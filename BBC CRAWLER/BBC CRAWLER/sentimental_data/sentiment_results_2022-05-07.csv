"Sinn FÃ©in, led by Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald, want Northern Ireland to leave the UK and reunite with the Republic of Ireland Sinn FÃ©in will be the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time, pushing the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) into second place. Sinn FÃ©in has 27 seats, compared to the DUP's 25. The result means Michelle O'Neill will be entitled to become first minister - unprecedented for a nationalist. Earlier, Ms O'Neill said it had been an election of ""real change"" and a ""defining moment for our politics and for our people"". ""Today ushers in a new era which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality and on the basis of social justice,"" she continued. This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has described her party's performance as a ""defining moment"" ""My commitment is to work through partnership, not division,"" Ms O'Neill said after she was elected in Mid Ulster. ""We will work with those who serve all other political perspectives, we will show respect and we expect to be shown respect."" A unionist party has had the most seats at Stormont since Northern Ireland was formed in 1921. The cross-community Alliance Party has returned 17 MLAs, more than doubling its previous number in 2017. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost one MLA to return with nine, while the SDLP's seats fell from 12 to eight. Counting in the Foyle constituency continued into a third day, with the DUP's Gary Middleton the last assembly member elected in the early hours of Sunday. Thirty-two of the MLAs elected are women, compared with 27 who were returned in the last election. The Alliance Party gained a seat in Belfast South, with Kate Nicholl (left) and Paula Bradshaw (right) elected Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he would meet with the party leaders over the coming days with the aim of restoring the Stormont institutions ""at the earliest possible moment"". ""I encourage the parties to form an executive as soon as possible. The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government that delivers on the issues that matter most to them,"" he said. In February, the executive collapsed when DUP assembly member Paul Givanresigned as first minister. As the first and deputy first minister roles are part of a joint office, the move also removed Michelle O'Neill from her position. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said a new power-sharing executive was ""vital for progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland"". ""It is now incumbent on all political parties and elected representatives to deliver on their mandate, through the nomination of a first and deputy first minister and the formation of a new executive to serve the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland."" The US State Department called for the parties ""to take the necessary steps to re-establish a power-sharing executive"". ""Critical and immediate challenges concerning the economy, health, and education are best addressed through the collective efforts of a devolved government chosen by, and accountable to, its people,"" said Ned Price. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he has not decided whether the party will nominate a deputy first minister Although Sinn FÃ©in can now nominate a first minister, they cannot take up the office unless the DUP, the biggest party from the unionist bloc, agrees to nominate a deputy first minister. Its leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has not yet made a decision on whether the party will do that. On Saturday, the DUP leader said his party would respect the result of the election, however, there needed to be changes made to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is an element of the UK's Brexit agreement with the European Union which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. Some unionists have said the protocol created a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The ultimate goal of Sinn FÃ©in is for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and become one country with the Republic of Ireland. But a victory for Sinn FÃ©in in this election does not mean a vote on Irish reunification - also known as a border poll - would be imminent. TheNorthern Ireland Act 1998,external- which followed the signing of the Good Friday Agreement - stated that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and ""shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll"". It also stated that the Northern Ireland Secretary would agree to hold a poll if it appeared likely that a majority of people wanted a united Ireland. Successive opinion polls suggest that is not yet the case, with the most recent, published in April, putting support at about a third. On Saturday, when asked about the prospect of a border poll, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary-Lou McDonald said unionists should not be ""scared"". ""The future is bright for all of us,"" she added. While Sinn FÃ©in was reluctant to promote its border poll ambitions during the election campaign, expect it to be back on the agenda now. But the party said it will be a decade-long plan at least which will only come after an island-wide conversation. The decision to hold a border poll is for the Northern Ireland secretary of state, when he or she feels there is more of an appetite for Irish unity. But you may now find talk of a border poll will slowly fade if a power-sharing executive returns and no votes are on the line.

""I'm also hugely blessed to be leading a party of the calibre of Alliance with people who are so dedicated, so committed and so selfless in their service,"" she said. UUP leader Doug Beattie, speaking after he was elected in Upper Bann, said he had no plans to change course after his party failed to grow its support. ""I will continue to promote positive, confident, optimistic unionism,"" he explained. After Sinn FÃ©in's result was confirmed, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated the party on a ""historic vote"". Allow Twitter content?

From IRA politics to NI's biggest party The election in maps and charts Despite seeing a surge in vote share, the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) returned one MLA, its leader Jim Allister. Gerry Carroll, of People Before Profit, was elected in Belfast West, while independents were elected in East Londonderry and North Down. SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon, the party's representative on the executive as infrastructure minister, lost her seat in North Belfast. Ms Mallon's party leader, Colum Eastwood, said there was nothing ""fair"" about her result and she would be a ""huge loss for us, but a bigger loss for the people of north Belfast"". There were other high profile casualties, including Roy Beggs of the UUP and former Education Minister Peter Weir, of the DUP, who were members of the first assembly in 1998. The DUP's Mervyn Storey, another former minister, failed to be elected along with the SDLP policing board member Dolores Kelly. The Green Party lost its two MLAs, including leader Clare Bailey.

"Michelle O'Neill says the election results represent a significant moment of change Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill is on the cusp of becoming the first nationalist to hold the role of first minister in the history of Northern Ireland. It will be a historic moment for Northern Ireland and too for Sinn FÃ©in, which has won the greatest number of seats in the assembly. It's the first time that a nationalist party will be the largest since the creation of Northern Ireland a century ago. Ms O'Neill, the party's vice-president, said the result presents ""an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality and on the basis of social justice"". Party leader Mary Lou McDonald hailed news of Sinn FÃ©in's achievement as significant - and not just because of the symbolic change. ""It's significant because it's a moment of equality,"" she said. ""It says there's no job that's beyond anybody's reach."" The young Michelle might have found that hard to believe in May 1993. As the IRA edged towards the end of its so-called ""armed struggle"", she found herself pregnant at 16 years old. In an interviewwith the Irish Times,externallast year, she said she had ""very, very negative"" experiences as a teenage single mother. ""I went to a Catholic grammar. You were nearly made to feel girls like you can't be at school,"" she said. But in the end, she said the experience made her ""a stronger woman"". She went back to school, took her A-levels, stormed ahead. Michelle O'Neill arrives to cast her vote at the Clonoe polling station on Thursday 5 May Strong women are what the new Northern Ireland is about. In this year's election, a record number of women - 87 - stood. At the first election in 1998, just 14 women were elected. Among them was Monica McWilliams from the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition. ""I felt like I had to put on body armour because there were so few women there,"" she remembered. Sometimes, when she stood up to speak, there were repeated cries of ""Moo, moo, moo"" to drown out her words. The moos have been consigned to history. Ms O'Neill grew up steeped in the history of Northern Ireland's Troubles. Born Michelle Doris on 10 January 1977, she was raised in the village of Clonoe in rural County Tyrone and hails from a family of prominent Irish republicans. Her father,Brendan Doris, was a former IRA prisoner who became a Sinn FÃ©in councillor in Dungannon. Her uncle, Paul Doris, was president of Noraid, a republican fundraising group. When the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998, she began working for the party. It brought her into direct contact with Martin McGuinness, who at that time was running for election in the Mid Ulster constituency. When her father stepped down from Dungannon Borough Council ahead of the 2005 election, Ms O'Neill won the seat he vacated. She became the first woman to hold the post of mayor in Dungannon. Her assembly career began in 2007, when she joined Martin McGuinness and Francie Molloy as a Mid Ulster MLA. She became her party's spokeswoman for health and sat on the education committee. Michelle O'Neill rose to the role of agriculture minister before becoming health minister in 2016 After four years on the back benches at Stormont, Sinn FÃ©in appointed her as minister for agriculture in 2011. In 2015, she was promoted to minister for health, one of Stormont's most high-profile and challenging portfolios. She faced mounting hospital waiting lists, a crisis in general practice and the findings of the Bengoa report into how Northern Ireland's health care is organised. Her response was a10-year plan to transform health service, saying it would improve a system that was at ""breaking point"". When Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in 2017 over the DUP's handling of theRenewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal, it led to a political stalemate at Stormont for three years. When he died soon afterwards, she was chosen to lead the party in Northern Ireland - a younger face and, significantly, a woman like her counterpart in the Republic, Mary Lou McDonald. Michelle O'Neill carries the coffin of the late Martin McGuinness in 2017 Now, the pinnacle of Northern Ireland politics, the role of first minister, is within her grasp. Michelle O'Neill (left, with her party leader Mary-Lou McDonald) says the vote has ""ushered in a new era"" The office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one, but the allocation of titles is symbolically important. Few are expecting a power-sharing devolved government to be formed in the short term. The DUP is reiterating that it plans to block the formation of a new Stormont Executive unless the Brexit trade border with the rest of the UK is scrapped. Significantly, during the election campaign, Michelle O'Neill's focus has not been on Irish unity and talk of a border poll. She argued that people were not waking up thinking about Irish unity, but instead were worried about the cost of living crisis. What she wants to do, she added, was to ""work for everybody"". O'Neill's journey to Sinn FÃ©in leader O'Neill sees off challenge for her Sinn FÃ©in role Who will succeed Martin McGuinness?

"Sinn FÃ©in, pictured at the party's manifesto launch, described its election performance as ""historic"" In the late 1980s, when I first arrived in Belfast as a young reporter, Sinn FÃ©in were routinely described on the BBC airwaves as ""the political wing of the IRA"". Sinn FÃ©in wasn't coy about its relationship with the IRA. If you asked Gerry Adams or Martin McGuinness to denounce an IRA bombing or shooting, they were likely to tell you they didn't engage in ""the politics of condemnation"". The Sinn FÃ©in newspaper An Phoblacht (Republican News) featured a column entitled War News which proudly detailed the latest IRA ambushes on what it described as British ""crown forces"". The party office on the Falls Road in west Belfast was emblazoned with an iconic mural of Bobby Sands. Bobby Sands was the IRA prisoner who secured election as an MP in 1981, before dying on hunger strike inside the Maze Long Kesh prison. If you had told me back then that, 41 years to the day that Bobby Sands died, the voters would be elevating Sinn FÃ©in to the top spot as Northern Ireland's biggest party, I would have been sceptical, to say the least. Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness pictured at an IRA funeral in 1987 A former Northern Ireland Secretary, Douglas Hurd, once derided Gerry Adams as ""Mr 10%"" - a sobriquet designed to emphasise that Adams only spoke for a minority of nationalists. Now Michelle O'Neill is ""Ms 29%"" - in possession of a quarter of a million first preference votes. A clear lead over the DUP in Stormont seats, and, potentially, the keys to the Stormont first minister's office. In the 1980s, Bobby Sands pioneered the foray into electoral politics, but in the Irish Republican ""ballot box and Armalite rifle"" dual strategy, the Armalite remained on top. But in the 1990s, Gerry Adams persuaded the reluctant militarists in Republican ranks that turning the IRA's violence off could achieve more in their quest for Irish unity. The eventual success of Adams' strategy was undoubtedly hastened by the willingness of the more moderate nationalist SDLP leader John Hume to ""sacrifice his party for his country"". Hume shared his immense influence and access in the USA and Dublin with Adams, in the interest of securing peace. The paramilitary ceasefires andthe Good Friday Agreementfollowed. The Good Friday Agreement was signed on 10 April 1998 and helped bring an end a period of conflict in Northern Ireland called the Troubles Buoyed up by huge domestic and international attention, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness transformed their movement into a political force which, in the 2000s, overtook the SDLP as the biggest nationalist party, before 20 years later supplanting the DUP as the biggest party overall. It is no mean achievement and to pull it off Sinn FÃ©in has drawn on the kind of discipline and organisation which it developed duringthe Troubles, a keen grasp of the issues on the mind of the growing nationalist community (many too young to have first-hand memories of the bad old days) and a war chest full of cash. The party is generally left of centre and populist in its approach and has proved able to discern changing attitudes, shifting its ground on issues as diverse as women's rights, the EU or diplomatic relations with Russia. Sinn FÃ©in set to win most seats in historic poll Although the party doesn't hide its commitment to a united Ireland, it won its latest mandate on the back of a deliberately low-key campaign with a soft focus, featuring Michelle O'Neill working out in the gym and promising she would be ""a first minister for all"". Putting one over on the DUP and unionism might have been a large part of the appeal for nationalist voters, but Sinn FÃ©in didn't have to say it out loud. The continuing presence of veteran IRA figures within the party's Stormont ranks emphasises that, while much has changed, the party's primary motivation remains the same. What would have surprised my 1980s self even more than Sinn FÃ©in's current dominance at Stormont is the situation in Dublin, where the party, led by Mary Lou McDonald, is now consistently topping the polls. A mural of Bobby Sands on the Falls Road in Belfast It's not inconceivable to imagine a Sinn FÃ©in Stormont first minister meeting a Sinn FÃ©in taoiseach (Irish prime minister) sometime in 2025, when the next Irish election is due. Sinn Fein's goal of uniting Ireland north and south remains some way off. The current balance at Stormont is roughly 40% nationalist 40% unionist with 20% preferring to steer clear of traditional green orange politics. Moreover, the latest opinion polls still point to majority support for staying in the UK. But Sinn FÃ©in's ascendancy is an important, symbolic, moment and a remarkable example of a movement exchanging the gun for the ballot box and then exceeding all expectations. Bobby Sands famously said that Irish republicans' revenge on their enemies would eventually be the ""laughter of our children"" and 41 years on republicans definitely have something to smile about.

"Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (centre) is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister The results of the Northern Ireland Assembly election are in and, for the first time ever, Sinn FÃ©in has won the most seats. It's the first time ever that a nationalist party has been the largest at Stormont in terms of seats, 101 years after Northern Ireland came into existence. It edged out the DUP, which is now the second-largest party. Alliance also had a historic result, winning 17 seats to become the third-largest party in the assembly. So what happens next and what does it mean for the future of devolved government in Northern Ireland and for Northern Ireland itself? Not necessarily. Underthe power-sharing system of government in Northern Ireland, the largest unionist and nationalist parties must share the first minister and deputy first minister's post, while the other ministerial positions are allocated among the biggest parties based on how many seats they have in the assembly. As the largest party, the rules say that Sinn FÃ©in is the party entitled to hold the position. But the roles of first minister and deputy first minister are equal - despite their names - and one cannot hold office without the other. So in order for Sinn FÃ©in to hold the first minister position, the biggest party from the unionist bloc - the DUP - must agree to take up the deputy first minister's position. On Monday,DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would not do sountil his party's concerns about the post-Brexit trading arrangements contained in the Northern Ireland Protocol were resolved. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (centre) withdrew Paul Givan (left) as NI's first minister in February in protest against the NI Protocol Sir Jeffrey is opposed to the protocol and withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in February in protest against it. The protocol isthe part of the Brexit deal which applies to Northern Irelandand is designed to avoid a hard border between it and the Republic of Ireland. It means checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, something unionists say undermines Northern Ireland's place in the union. Even though the difference between the first minister and deputy first minister positions is in name only, Sinn FÃ©in will draw a big symbolic boost from being entitled to hold the post. For its first 50 years, Northern Ireland was ruled exclusively by unionists, and since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 a unionist politician has always been first minister. The new assembly will meet on Friday and will elect a Speaker, who will then ask the parties for their nominations for first minister and deputy first minister. If the DUP nominates a deputy first minister, then an executive can be formed and other ministers can be chosen. If it does not, then the process is more uncertain. The DUP cannot nominate Sir Jeffrey, as he has stepped away from Stormont to remain as an MP at Westminster. He said he would not return to Stormont until his concerns with the protocol had been resolved. HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:Who is Michelle O'Neill? RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland Because of new rules which were brought in earlier in the year, the assembly will continue to exist in a caretaker capacity and the other ministers who were in place before the election - such as the health and education ministers - can stay in place. This could continue for up to six months, while there would be negotiations to try to find a solution to the DUP's refusal to nominate a deputy first minister. After six months, a fresh election could be called or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis, would have to come up with an alternative solution. Sinn FÃ©in's Mary-Lou McDonald (right) says planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"" During the election campaign Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said that people were not ""waking up thinking about Irish unity"" and stressed that issues such as the cost-of-living crisis were bigger priorities. But Sinn FÃ©in remains committed to holding a referendum on Irish unification, and its manifesto called on the British and Irish governments to set a date for a border poll. On Friday party leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". The rules around holding a referendum are set out in the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace agreement which ended the worst of the Troubles and set up the Northern Ireland Assembly. It says the UK government's secretary of state for Northern Ireland can hold a referendum at any time. In addition it says he or she should call one if it appears a majority of voters would vote in favour of Irish unification. Sinn FÃ©in is likely to argue that things are moving in that direction, but unionists will argue that the nationalist vote share has gone down since 2017 and that shows there is no desire for a border poll. Opinion polls have also not shown a majority in favour of a united Ireland. The growth in support for the Alliance Party, which does not take a position on the topic of Irish unity, also complicates the issue. Northern Ireland's devolved administration at Stormont - known as the executive - is made up of the first minister and deputy first minister and eight other ministers. It's known as a mandatory coalition, which means the largest parties are all entitled to at least one ministry. A mathematical formula decides how many ministries they are entitled based on the number of seats they won. However for an executive to be formed it would require the DUP to fill the deputy first minister's post. You can read more about the power-sharing systemhere. The Alliance Party has won its biggest ever share of the first preference vote in a Northern Ireland Assembly election with 13.5% and also a record number of seats - 17. The party, which was founded in 1970, won just eight seats at the last election in 2017, but it had good results in the European, council and Westminster elections of 2019 and has continued the trend this year. The Alliance Party, led by Naomi Long seen in the centre here with victorious candidates, made big gains in the election The party defines itself as being neither unionist or nationalist and aims to win votes from across Northern Ireland's traditional political divides. The result is also a sign that more voters are moving away from the traditional unionist and nationalist blocs. Alliance is likely to increase its calls for changes to how the system at Stormont works. For example it wants the executive to become a voluntary coalition. This would be a major change to the Good Friday Agreement and would require lengthy negotiations with the British and Irish governments and the other Northern Ireland parties.

On Friday party leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". The rules around holding a referendum are set out in the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace agreement which ended the worst of the Troubles and set up the Northern Ireland Assembly. It says the UK government's secretary of state for Northern Ireland can hold a referendum at any time. In addition it says he or she should call one if it appears a majority of voters would vote in favour of Irish unification. Sinn FÃ©in is likely to argue that things are moving in that direction, but unionists will argue that the nationalist vote share has gone down since 2017 and that shows there is no desire for a border poll. Opinion polls have also not shown a majority in favour of a united Ireland. The growth in support for the Alliance Party, which does not take a position on the topic of Irish unity, also complicates the issue. Northern Ireland's devolved administration at Stormont - known as the executive - is made up of the first minister and deputy first minister and eight other ministers. It's known as a mandatory coalition, which means the largest parties are all entitled to at least one ministry. A mathematical formula decides how many ministries they are entitled based on the number of seats they won. However for an executive to be formed it would require the DUP to fill the deputy first minister's post. You can read more about the power-sharing systemhere. The Alliance Party has won its biggest ever share of the first preference vote in a Northern Ireland Assembly election with 13.5% and also a record number of seats - 17. The party, which was founded in 1970, won just eight seats at the last election in 2017, but it had good results in the European, council and Westminster elections of 2019 and has continued the trend this year. The Alliance Party, led by Naomi Long seen in the centre here with victorious candidates, made big gains in the election The party defines itself as being neither unionist or nationalist and aims to win votes from across Northern Ireland's traditional political divides. The result is also a sign that more voters are moving away from the traditional unionist and nationalist blocs. Alliance is likely to increase its calls for changes to how the system at Stormont works. For example it wants the executive to become a voluntary coalition. This would be a major change to the Good Friday Agreement and would require lengthy negotiations with the British and Irish governments and the other Northern Ireland parties.

"Counting has finished with all 90 seats filled Sinn FÃ©in has won 27 seats to become the largest party and will be entitled to nominate a first minister - a first for a nationalist party A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the parliament, since NI's formation in 1921 The Democratic Unionist Party has held the post since 2007, but its vote share has dropped and it lost three seats, down to 25 Sinn FÃ©in wants Northern Ireland to leave the UK and unite with the Republic of Ireland But a Sinn FÃ©in win does not automatically mean a referendum - also known as a border poll - is imminent The cross-community Alliance party has made big gains, winning 17 seats up from eight last time Emma Canavan, Michael Sheils McNamee, Flora Drury, Jennifer Scott, Paul Lawlor and Luke Sproule It's the end of the road for counting On what is now a third day of counting we have finally had all 90 candidates elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It's been a momentous election, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the largest number of seats for the first time, returning 27 candidates, the same number as the last assembly election. The DUP slipped into second place with 25, but the big gains were for Alliance, which won 17 seats - more than double the eight it won in 2017. The UUP dropped by one seat to nine, the SDLP lost four to drop to eight. TUV and People Before Profit each had one candidate elected. Two independent unionists were also elected, while the Green Party lost both its seats. What happens next is not clear. Sinn FÃ©in can nominate a first minister to lead the Northern Ireland Executive, but as it's a joint office a first minister can not exist without a deputy first minister. The DUP can nominate a deputy first minister, but party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has already said he will not nominate any ministers without changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. There will be more reaction on BBC One Northern Ireland and iPlayer from 10am with Sunday Politics, and from the same time on BBC Radio Ulster there will be an election special. You can catch up with that later on BBC Sounds as well. That's all from us, goodnight.  On the 13th count Gary Middleton of the DUP has been re-elected in Foyle. It brings to an end more than two days of counting. Mr Middleton has served as a junior minister in the executive and was first elected for Foyle in 2016, having been co-opted the year before.

"Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (second left) with party leader Mary Lou McDonald and returning assembly members Emma Sheerin (left) and Linda Dillon (far right) There was a time in Northern Ireland when Sinn FÃ©in voices were silenced. Banned from the airwaves by the government to combat IRA propaganda. The BBC even employed an actor to voice the words of the then Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams. But this weekend Sinn FÃ©in voices were in high demand as broadcasters scrambled to get them on air. They all wanted to hear from the one-time political pariahs who are now the political powerbrokers at Stormont. And pose the question: Does its victory push Northern Ireland closer to a border poll and possibly Irish unity? Sinn FÃ©in wins most seats in historic NI election NI election in maps and charts Northern Ireland constituency results Communication is no longer a problem for Sinn FÃ©in as its message struck a chord with a quarter of a million voters. But the timing was key. Sinn FÃ©in firstly played down the prospects of being the largest party, mindful of overplaying its hand too early. But the party ramped it up the week before the poll, even pushing Michelle O'Neill as a ""first minister for all"" in a presidential-style pitch. Though much of the ground work paving the way for Sinn FÃ©in's success was already laid by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). The slogan - vote Jeffrey to avoid getting Michelle - worked for both parties. Jeffrey Donaldson won't say if he will rubberstamp Michelle O'Neill's appointment to the first minister role It energised some DUP voters to stick with Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, despite what the polls predicted. But crucially it also stoked nationalist voters to row in behind Sinn FÃ©in like never before to push unionists off the Stormont summit for the first time. Though the swing behind Sinn FÃ©in came at a high cost to the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) as it lost four seats leaving it on an all-time low of just eight. The party's deputy leader Nicola Mallon is among the casualties. SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon lost her seat A divided unionist vote also cleared the way for Sinn FÃ©in, which returned with the same number of seats it held going into the poll. The party is now entitled to the keys of the first minister's office. Though it comes with no extra power, the post has huge symbolic significance for unionists who've held it for 24 years. But Michelle O'Neill will only get the keys to her new office if the DUP agree to her nomination. Sir Jeffrey says he will respect the outcome of the poll - but he has so far refused to confirm if he will rubberstamp Michelle O'Neill's appointment by accepting the post of deputy first minister. Michelle O'Neill at the party's manifesto launch with leader Mary Lou McDonald Until he does, the Stormont stalemate will continue, with no power-sharing executive. That means the outgoing caretaker ministers will continue to run departments. But with no overarching executive, their powers will be limited. They won't be able to use a Â£300m pot to help families deal with the cost of living crisis, although the DUP insists the money can be handed out. The parties have six months to agree a new power-sharing executive and history tells us they are likely to take every minute. But if the executive returns then it will have a new look courtesy of the Alliance surge. Newly-elected Alliance assembly member EÃ³in Tennyson celebrates with party leader Naomi Long The party with 17 seats will be entitled to two ministerial posts which is likely to include the justice portfolio. It is also likely the SDLP and Ulster Unionists will end up on the opposition benches, leaving just three parties in the executive. That will change the dynamic but will it mean better delivery and fewer stand-offs? It has been a bruising election for the DUP and Ulster Unionists with a drop in their vote and seats. UUP leader Doug Beattie retained his seat - but it's been a disappointing election for his party Though the Traditional Unionist Voice party (TUV) broke new ground, increasing its vote by more than 5%, it failed to secure transfers to add to the sole seat held by party leader Jim Allister. His party's increase appears to have come from disillusioned DUP voters whose votes then transferred back to Sir Jeffrey's party. Irish unity It's a move which the DUP says played into the hands of Sinn FÃ©in and no doubt it will be used to warn unionist voters again. The DUP warning about Sinn FÃ©in using its new Stormont status to push for a border poll will also be tested before the next poll. While Sinn FÃ©in was reluctant to promote its border poll ambitions during the election campaign, expect it to be back on the agenda now. But the party says it will be a decade-long plan at least which will only come after an island-wide conversation. The decision to hold a border poll is for the Northern Ireland secretary of state, when he or she feels there is more of an appetite for Irish unity. But you may now find talk of a border poll will slowly fade if a power-sharing executive returns and no votes are on the line. Though the 2022 assembly election will be remembered for the Sinn FÃ©in breakthrough and Alliance advance, it may also mark a turning point in how Stormont functions - if and when it fully returns.

"Many people in Izyum retreated to basements, to avoid bombardment and soldiers ""We thought those were our last minutes. It was extremely scary but we were lucky."" Elena is recalling the moment Russian troops started shelling, after she and a group of escapees passed through one of their checkpoints. After two months living in the basement of a kindergarten in the Russian-occupied town of Izyum in Ukraine, Elena spent two nerve-shredding days on the road to safety. She and her daughter were among 20 people in a convoy of vehicles heading away from Russian-controlled territory. They fled last Friday using a route organised by volunteers. ""All that time we were praying,"" said Elena, 52, recounting how they passed through numerous Russian checkpoints. When troops asked them where they were going, the group convinced the soldiers they were headed for Russia. At one checkpoint, Elena said, Russians looked through her daughter's phone, and became angry when they saw messages to her friends about the situation in Izyum. Finally the pair reached safety in Poltava, a city in central Ukraine. But she said she felt as though she'd lost everything and couldn't forget the horror of what she went through in her home city after the start of the war. ""Bodies were lying for weeks in the streets. We tried not to watch them in order to save our minds. We couldn't bury dead people because it equalled being killed as well. The shelling was non-stop,"" she said. Elena and others in the basement had cooked food on a fire and lived off vegetables collected from their gardens. ""Everyone brought everything they had. We all shared food,"" she said. ""It helped us not to lose hope."" She adds that Russian troops were looting everything, including people's underwear. Soldiers drove around the city in stolen cars with ""Z"" signs painted on them, she recalled. ""They were armed and often very drunk. It was very scary when an armoured personnel carrier was driving on your street and soldiers with machine guns were sitting in it. We tried to hide."" Situated south-east of Kharkiv, the city of Izyum is known as the gateway to the Donbas - Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing region, more than a third of which was seized by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014. It is surrounded by forests and rivers, which make it a natural fortress. And within the city boundaries is the Kremenets mountain, which is 218m (715ft) above sea level. ""Whoever has control of this mountain has a significant military advantage,"" said Maxym Strelnik, an official of Izyum city council. All this made the city an important prize and soon after the Kremlin's invasion, it came under heavy bombardment. On 1 April,  Russia seized control and has occupied the city since. Now, Mr Strelnik, who was told by the Ukrainian military to leave the area, estimates that 80% of the city has been destroyed. Between 10,000 and 15,000 civilians remain in Izyum, he believes. ""There is no water, electricity, gas, heating and the sewage system doesn't work,"" he said. In March, during the initial stages of the invasion, people were forced to stay in their freezing basements without heating. Those who fell ill were unable to get medical treatment. ""We cannot even estimate how many victims there are in the city. There are no medical facilities or funeral services. The dead are buried near houses and in the city parks. It's a horrible reality,"" he said. Among those still trapped in Izyum is the mother of Katerina, who escaped with her husband and two children at the beginning of March. ""She calls me from time to time - sometimes once a week,"" Katerina said. ""Even now when I'm safe, I can't feel 100% fine because my mum is left in a town that doesn't exist."" By the time Katerina got out, it was too late for her mother, who lived in a part of Izyum then already occupied by the Russians. She was forbidden to leave her house by soldiers. Katerina's own escape was a harrowing experience. The family had been sheltering together in their basement for seven days when a Russian bomb fell just 500 metres from their house. ""The ground started to fall from the ceiling,"" she told the BBC. ""I started to understand then that our basement would not withstand the bombs."" She and her family had just 15 minutes to prepare to leave. They took very little - only children's clothes. Even the family pets had to be left behind. As they left, she said, she could hear shells above her head. ""The feeling of hearing them will be impossible to get rid of."" Up to 80% of the city has been destroyed, says one official Mr Strelnik has stayed close to Izyum, albeit in a zone still under Ukrainian control, to ensure he can try to help the people still inside. But communication with them is incredibly hard. For the past seven days, there has been no mobile phone connection between the town and the outside world. The families of those still inside are desperate to hear from them, he says. The lack of mobile coverage has also made life difficult for Volodymyr Zelensky - not Ukraine's president, but an ordinary citizen of the same name who has been volunteering to help those inside the city get out. During brief spells when a signal was available, relatives informed those still inside about evacuation buses which collected residents from small villages on the outskirts of the city. ""We evacuated about 200 people,"" said Mr Zelenskyy. ""People were very emotional when they got to the evacuation points. They didn't have a hope for weeks and finally when they saw us, they thought that we were their saviours."" But he said the rescue effort was dangerous work. ""The last time our volunteers extracted people from [the nearby village of] Spyvakiva, they were shot by Russian snipers. Three people were killed and three people were wounded,"" he said. The BBC has been unable to independently verify this claim. Both Katerina and Elena count themselves lucky they were able to escape Izyum when they did. But their memories of home in peacetime are haunting. Katerina remembers the place which she says had everything she needed, including parks for children. ""It was so cute, so cosy, like a small fluffy pillow, that feels like your mother hugging you,"" she said. Elena misses the days when she would plant flowers in the garden with her granddaughter. ""We did not realise how lucky we were,"" she said. ""Now I realise I was living in a paradise."" SANCTIONS:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?

"Protests against Russia's invasion of Ukraine have drawn crowds of tens of thousands across Switzerland How does a European country stay neutral when war rages in Europe? Switzerland managed it during the first and second world wars, but now, watching Russia's attack on Ukraine, many Swiss are rethinking their long-established position. Switzerland was granted ""eternal neutrality"" at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. It was a pragmatic, geopolitical move that was supported because the country was seen as a harmless buffer between Europe's big powers - France on one side, Austria and Prussia on the other - and it preserved Switzerland's safety while its neighbours slaughtered each other. During World War Two, Swiss neutrality was more pragmatic than heroic. Switzerland mobilised all its able-bodied men to defend its borders, but it also banked gold looted by the Nazis and, in a shameful move designed to keep Germany at bay, turned away thousands of Jewish refugees - a policy it finally apologised for in the 1990s. Nevertheless, gratitude for being spared two world wars is, says Markus Haefliger, politics correspondent with the Tagesanzeiger newspaper, ""almost in our genesâ¦ that makes neutrality so important for Swiss people"". For decades, neutrality has enjoyed almost universal support among the Swiss - opinion polls have shown approval ratings of well over 90%. But now, says Mr Haefliger, the Swiss are soul-searching. ""They ask themselves how can you stay neutral in a war like Ukraine? It's so clear who is the good guy and who is the bad guy."" A sign points Ukrainian refugees in the direction of a food distribution centre in Zurich When Russia invaded its neighbour in February, thousands of Swiss citizens took to the streets, condemning the aggression and demanding support for Ukraine. Thousands also offered their homes to Ukrainian refugees, for whom the Swiss government has offered visa-free collective protection. For young Swiss in particular, the idea that their country could stay aloof in such a conflict seemed unthinkable. Why has Russia invaded Ukraine and what does Putin want? Are arms shipments from the West making a difference? Operation Libero is a young, non-aligned political movement which campaigns for closer ties with Europe - Switzerland is not a member of the EU - and a less isolationist strategy. Its president, Sanija Ameti, believes this new war has been a wake-up call. ""Swiss people are realising that they are part of this European family of liberal democracies. This is a fight between systems, the one that we are in, and the autocratic, kleptocratic system of [Russian President] Putin."" That's a view shared by most political parties and most members of the Swiss government, which moved after a brief hesitation to adopt all the EU's sanctions against Russia. It's a big change from just 40 years ago, when - to the enduring shame of many Swiss - Switzerland did not join sanctions against apartheid South Africa. The adoption of sanctions was greeted with headlines around the world, suggesting that Switzerland had abandoned neutrality. In fact, when it comes to sanctions, neutrality has been fraying round the edges for some time, says Stefanie Walter, politics professor at Zurich University. ""Switzerland has actually changed position quite a lot in the last couple of decades,"" she points out. It joined United Nations sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s, and those against former Yugoslavia. ""And right now, as well as Ukraine, there are about 23 other sanctions in place."" But while sanctions may be supported by most Swiss, any military support appears at first out of the question. Switzerland's neutrality is legally defined by the Hague Convention of 1907, and forbids sending weapons to countries at war, as does Swiss domestic law on weapons exports, which was recently tightened. And so when Germany asked Switzerland to permit the export of Swiss-made ammunition for tanks Berlin is sending to Kyiv, the Swiss said no. That move prompted criticism from a surprising source, whenthe leader of the centrist Die Mitte party tweeted,externalthat in his opinion it would be legitimate to send weapons in the defence of European democracy. The type of ammunition manufactured for some Swiss tanks can also be used by tanks being sent to Ukraine by Germany Other centrist politicians have suggested closer Swiss ties with the Nato military alliance, including a common air defence system and participation in the organisation's military exercises. What is Nato and how has it responded to Russia's invasion? Such opinions would have been unimaginable just a few months ago, and they will be fiercely resisted by the right, where the Swiss People's Party is threatening a referendum to make even sanctions illegal, and on the left, where the Social Democrats and the Greens are opposed to any military involvement. But bit by bit, many Swiss are beginning to contemplate a new identity, and a new security strategy for their country. A recent opinion poll showed that, while two-thirds of Swiss still opposed the idea of joining Nato, more than half (52%) were in favour of joining a European defence union. This plan, known in Brussels as Pesco (permanent structured military co-operation) would involve countries committing to a common security and defence policy. Armies would work together, and fighter planes, tanks and other weapons would be jointly procured. The end goal: a common European army. The idea of neutral, non-EU member Switzerland getting involved in something like this would have been unthinkable just a few months ago, but the war in Ukraine has clearly changed opinions. Sanija Ameti believes Switzerland has a responsibility to defend European liberal democracy. ""We really need a debate about whether we have to protect our system with weapons,"" she explains. ""The consequence would mean not being neutral anymore."" Prof Walter does not go quite that far but suggests that ""Switzerland has to define neutrality anew"". For Markus Haefliger, the war in Ukraine has clarified Switzerland's position in a new, polarised world. ""Switzerland is so clearly part of the Western world, its values, its economy, its traditions, everything,"" he says. ""The big question is, can we be neutral in the traditional sense in this new world order?""

"Putin and Alina Kabaeva pictured in 2004 Russia is already under unprecedented sanctions and now the UK has targeted Alina Kabaeva, a politician, media boss, former Olympic gymnast, and - if the rumours are true - Vladimir Putin's girlfriend and mother to some of his children. Sanctions imposed by the UK and others are designed to punish those closest to Mr Putin - the oligarchs, politicians and other officials said to have benefited from their proximity to the president. Last month, the US and UK imposed sanctions onhis daughters Maria Vorontsova, 36, and Katerina Tikhonova, 35. They are his children with ex-wife Lyudmila. Until now, Ms Kabaeva had escaped, despite her reported status. She might have felt something was coming: an online petition in March demanded her expulsion from her residence in Switzerland. On Friday,the UK added her name to its sanctions list, with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss saying Britain was ""tightening the vice"" on Mr Putin's ""inner circle"". The former gymnast now faces a UK travel ban and asset freeze. Ms Kabaeva is a former Russian MP and chair of the board of directors of the National Media Group, which is reportedly the largest private Russian media company, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said. She is a close associate of Mr Putin and obtains a financial or material benefit from this association, it added. It noted that the National Media Group controlled television stations including Channel One, which was already under sanctions. ""It is reported that he [Mr Putin] has tried to reduce her visibility since the invasion began,"" the FCDO said. ""For example, a couple of weeks after the invasion, the National Media Group website was updated to remove her name, along with any reference to the board of directors."" Earlier, sources confirmed to the BBC that she was on the latest list of individuals to be sanctioned by the EU. According to AFP news agency, she was being targeted for her part in disseminating Kremlin propaganda and for being ""closely associated"" with the 69-year-old President Putin. The draft document did not name her as his partner. Russia's leader has always been intensely private. When asked about his private life, he has tended to brush off the question. He has, though, explicitly denied a relationship with Ms Kabaeva. Alina Kabaeva at the Athens Olympics, where she won gold In 2008, the Moskovsky Korrespondent newspaper reported that he was planning to divorce his wife Lyudmila and marry Ms Kabaeva. Both rejected the story. Soon after, the authorities shut the newspaper down. Mr Putin and Lyudmila would announce their split five years later. Lyudmila, whose new surname since a remarriage is Ocheretnaya, has also been sanctioned by the UK. At the time the Russian president was denying he was involved with Ms Kabaeva, she was transitioning from a successful sporting career to one in politics. Her chosen discipline was rhythmic gymnastics, where competitors perform routines with the aid of equipment like ribbons and balls. Ms Kabaeva, at her peak, has claims to have been the best in the world. She had a move named after her and was a leading performer in the team that dominated the sport. Russia won every Olympic gold medal available from 2000-2016. Born in 1983, she started rhythmic gymnastics as a four-year-old.Her coach, Irina Viner, said,external: ""I could not believe my eyes, when I first saw her. The girl has the rare combination of two qualities crucial in rhythmic gymnastics - flexibility and agility."" Ms Kabaeva would become known as ""Russia's most flexible woman"". She made her international debut in 1996, and was a surprise winner at the 1998 European Championships. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, an uncharacteristic error with the hoop cost her dearly (she let it roll off the floor) and she could only manage bronze in the all-round event. Four years later, in Athens, she went better, taking home gold. Ms Kabaeva moved into politics and media after retiring from sport By the time of her retirement, she had won 18 World Championship medals and 25 European Championship medals on top of her Olympic prizes. Like other Russian athletes, she has not escaped the taint of doping, losing her medals at an event in 2001 after testing positive for a banned substance. She moved into politics, holding a seat in Russia's lower house of parliament from 2007-2014 with the ruling United Russia party. In 2014 she became chair of the National Media Group, which has large stakes in almost all major Russian state media outlets. Such outlets have been pumping out a relentlessly pro-Kremlin message on the war in Ukraine,accusing Ukrainians of shelling their own cities and presenting Russian troops as liberators. Her position has reportedly made her a wealthy woman, with leaked documents suggesting she earns about $12m (Â£9.7m) a year. It is not known when she and Mr Putin first met, but it is not unusual for a leading Olympian to meet a country's president. There's a photo of the pair as far back as in 2001, when Mr Putin awarded her an Order of Friendship - a top state honour. There are rumours that they have children together, although reports vary on how many. A Swiss newspaper reported,externalthat Ms Kabaeva had a boy in 2015 at an exclusive clinic near Lake Lugano, and another boy at the same place in 2019. But The Sunday Times and Wall Street Journal said she had twins in 2019 in Moscow although they disagree on how many children she has had. The Kremlin denies such reports. Back in 2015, Mr Putin's spokesman said ""information about the birth of a baby fathered by Vladimir Putin does not correspond to reality"". Such is Mr Putin's guarded nature - in public, he's never mentioned the names of the children he has with Lyudmila, other than to say he has two adult daughters - that the speculation is likely to continue. Ms Kabaeva has been in and out of the spotlight since reports of her relationship with Mr Putin emerged. There was a Vogue cover in 2011, where she wore a pricey gold dress from French fashion house Balmain. She was also a torch bearer at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. More recently, in April she appeared at a junior gymnastics festival in Moscow, quashing suggestions she was in hiding. There, she praised Russia's war effort.Some outlets noted she wore a wedding band.,external The Wall Street Journal has suggested that the US is reluctant to sanction Ms Kabaeva, for fear it may be deemed ""so personal a blow"" to Mr Putin that it may escalate tensions further. It might not be off the table altogether, though. When the White House was asked in April why she was not on their latest list, the press secretary replied ""no-one is safe"".

"The Taliban say many women around the country obey their dress code At the Lycee Mariam market in Kabul, known for its long row of stalls selling women's clothing, news of theTaliban's latest decree that women must wear a face veilhad not yet filtered down by the afternoon. Some of those browsing the shops wore the all-encompassing blue burka that the Taliban enforced during their first stint in power in the 1990s.  Others, however, had scarves covering their hair, but their faces uncovered. ""Even when you go on pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia you don't have to cover your face,"" one pointed out. ""Humans are born free, no-one has the right to talk about women's clothes,"" said Fatima, a fashionably dressed university student with sunglasses perched on her head. Afghanistan is a deeply conservative country, and many women do wear the burka, but in bigger cities it's also common to see women wearing the simple headscarf. After taking power last August, the Taliban had held off issuing new laws on what women should wear - until Saturday. At a press conference, the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue announced that all women would have to cover their face in public, and laid out an escalating set of punishments for anyone refusing to comply. Taliban to force Afghan women to wear face veil The punishment starts with a woman's male guardian (normally father, brother or husband) being visited at home by Taliban officials. Then, if a woman's appearance was still not deemed acceptable, her male relative would be summoned to see ministry officials, and after that he could even potentially be jailed for three days or sent to court. Akif Muhajir, spokesman for the ministry, told the BBC the order was based on the Quran and the life of the Prophet Muhammad. Other Muslims dispute the interpretation, but Akif Muhajir described the face covering as a ""compulsory"" part of the religion. Only 1% of Afghan women, he insisted, were not already complying with the group's understanding of how they should dress. ""This is not only the order of the Islamic Emirate,"" he added, ""but the order of Allah."" Most Muslims around the world do not consider covering the face to be a mandatory part of the religion, and, after seizing control of the country, the Taliban initially appeared to be adopting a more flexible attitude to governance. In recent weeks, however, they have been introducing more hardline measures, many of them governing women's everyday lives - for example, assigning separate days for them to visit public parks to men, and barring them from undertaking longer distance journeys without a male guardian. Teenage girls have still not been allowed back to school in most of the country, and whilst women are working in some sectors such as healthcare and education, many others have been told not to return to their offices. Girls' tears over chaotic Taliban schools U-turn 'I felt anxious going back to university' Western diplomats have indicated that resuming development funding for the country - currently struggling with a dire economic crisis - is contingent on the Taliban's treatment of women. When announcing this latest decree at the press conference, however, one cleric said the Taliban could never be pressured by the West into compromising on their beliefs. This video can not be played Women in Afghanistan face an uncertain future following the Taliban's takeover For Afghan women's rights activists, who have spent years struggling to make fragile progress in the country, it seems as if two decades of achievements are being rolled back. Mahbouba Seraj is one of Afghanistan's most prominent campaigners. ""We have a million other problems. Women are not a problem!"" she told the BBC indignantly at her home in Kabul. ""Schools need to be opened, work needs to be given to families. There is famine all over this country. There are suicide bombings."" But, she added, despondently, ""instead of looking after that, they are always after women"".

"A full embargo on Russian energy is needed now, Ukraine's finance minister has told the BBC. Sergeii Marchenko said although he did not think it would necessarily end the war, it would make it harder for Russia ""to finance their military needs"". He said the invasion of Ukraine had pushed up energy prices, tipping the scales in Moscow's favour. It comes as the European Union tries to reach agreement on a full ban on imports of Russian oil. The bloc has already pledged to reduce gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022. Mr Marchenko said: ""Huge oil and gas prices help Russia to receive additional amounts to make their budget run with a surplus. In comparison we are running [the country] with very huge deficit [in] our budget."" ""I believe that [a] full embargo can make Russia suffer more than it is right now,"" he added. EU proposes total ban on Russian oil imports Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? How Germany is getting rid of Russian oil About 40% of EU gas imports and 27% of oil imports come from Russia. The bloc's politicians are trying to balance their desire to support Ukraine with the needs of their energy hungry citizens and businesses. On Friday European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen admitted it was ""not easy to establish unity"" amongst the 27 members but added that she was ""confident"" an oil embargo could be agreed. Sergeii Marchenko says his country's budget is running at a huge deficit because of the war with Russia Even before the war, last year's increase in prices meant oil and gas revenues accounted for 36%, or $119bn, of the spending of Russian President Vladimir Putin's government. However this could increase significantly, to more than $180bn, despite big production cuts by Russia - the world's third biggest oil producer - according to the consultancy Rystad Energy. In comparisonUkraine's economy is forecast to shrink 45%this year because of the conflict, according to the World Bank. Mr Marchenko said the war meant his country was collecting less in taxes ""because more than 20% of our businesses are fully closed"". ""It means that we can't manage to fulfil our necessary duty as [a] government without international support, or without just printing money,"" he added. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins on...Russian gas and oil Another reason Ukraine's economy is struggling to support itself is because of thesharp fall in commodity exports. Before the war it was one of the world's top producers of crops such as sunflower, corn and wheat but it is now a lot more difficult to earn money by selling those to the rest of the world. Russia now controls the majority of Ukraine's port cities and with the country's harbours blocked off an increasing amount of what it can still export is leaving by trains, which have a smaller capacity. ""The key question for us is how to unblock the seaports of Ukraine,"" Mr Marchenko said. Doing so could help reduce soaring global food prices by increasing supplies. Ukraine war to cause 'worst price shock in 50 years' KitKat maker Nestle warns of further price rises World Bank warns of 'human catastrophe' food crisis The fall in Ukraine's agricultural exports is ""a big source of concern for a number of countries"", according to Odile Renaud-Basso, who is President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The economic development body is trying to support Ukraine's farmers as well as other countries that rely on their produce, she said. ""The more we keep economic infrastructure, equipment businesses afloat, the less the cost will be later on. So I think this is why we need to act now and not only wait for the reconstruction,"" she added. Odile Renaud-Basso says investment is needed to help rebuild Ukraine The bank was already investing around $1bn a year before the war to help develop Ukraine's economy.  With shareholder backing ""we would be ready to increase it"" to help with rebuilding things such as destroyed roads, bridges and buildings, Ms Renaud-Basso said. Ukraine's government estimates $600bn of damage has been done so far. The EBRD president said external support, grants and loans would be needed to rebuild the country, similar to what happened in Europe after World War Two. Work on how to do that has already started, she added. Ukraine is calling for Russia to foot the billand Ms Renaud-Basso said ""this debate will have to take place"". But she cautioned lessons from the end of World War One need to be heeded. ""It had a very strong impact on Germany, and was one of the origins of what came with Hitler. I think that, for Europeans, this is part of the memory and we need to keep that in mind,"" she said.

"An unseen image captures the then Princess Elizabeth beaming at her new engagement ring soon after Prince Philip's marriage proposal Unseen footage from the Queen's archive is set to be aired in a BBC documentary narrated by the monarch. The BBC has been granted special access to hundreds of private home movies shot by the Royal Family, including clips of a young Princess Elizabeth smiling at her engagement ring. Elizabeth: The Unseen Queen will follow the monarch's life as a princess in her own eyes and own words. The documentary will air on 29 May in honour of the Queen'sPlatinum Jubilee. Three images never previously seen of a then Princess Elizabeth have also been released as part of the programme's joint announcement by Buckingham Palace and the BBC. The Queen gave the BBC unprecedented access to footage shot by her, her parents, Prince Philip and others. Elizabeth: The Unseen Queen shows footage capturing the Queen's life from being pushed in a pram by her mother to her coronation at the age of 27 in 1953. The 75-minute documentary features a clip marking the first extended visit of Prince Philip to Balmoral in 1946, while the couple's engagement was still not public. A young Princess Elizabeth can be seen smiling and showing the camera her engagement ring. The couple later wed in November 1947 and were married for 73 years before the Duke of Edinburgh died in April last year, a few months before his 100th birthday. Another previously unseen image shows the then Princess Elizabeth with Princess Margaret and their father King George VI The documentary will show moments including then Princess Elizabeth with her uncle Prince George The Duke of Kent, who died in a plane crash in 1942 while on active service, and King George VI's last visit to Balmoral in 1951. It will also depict Princess Elizabeth as a young mother with Prince Charles and Princess Anne spending time with their grandparents the King and Queen. BBC Studios reviewed more than 400 reels of film, privately held by the Royal Collection in the vaults of the British Film Institute (BFI), and discovered lost newsreel given to The Queen and behind the scene recordings of state events. Filmmakers also listened to over three hundred of the Queen's speeches across 80 years. Simon Young, the BBC's commissioning editor for history, said he was honoured that the Queen ""entrusted the BBC with such unprecedented access"" to her personal film collection. He said: ""This documentary is an extraordinary glimpse into a deeply personal side of the Royal Family that is rarely seen, and it's wonderful to be able to share it with the nation as we mark her Platinum Jubilee."" Claire Popplewell, creative director for BBC Studio Events Productions, said: ""As programme-makers who have previously worked closely with the Royal Household on ceremonial and celebratory broadcast events and programmes, the production team were under no illusion quite how special having access to this very personal archive was. ""Being able to draw upon the self-recorded history of a young Princess Elizabeth and her wider family - and allowing the Queen to tell us her own story - is the very heart of this film.""

"Sir Keir Starmer is facing further questions over whether he broke Covid lockdown rules at an MP's office in Durham, amid reports a leaked Labour memo suggested time was set aside for him to eat dinner with colleagues. Durham police are investigating last April's event, when the Labour leader had beer and curry with others. TheMail on Sunday published what it said was a memo,externalshowing timings for ""dinner"", before the visit would end. Sir Keir insists no rules were broken. A Labour spokesperson said he had eaten ""between work demands"". A party source added that it would be ""wrong to assume"" activities during the visit occurred at the times originally planned. Starmer investigated over alleged lockdown breach Rayner was at lockdown event with Starmer Keir Starmer's Durham drink - what were the rules? Sir Keir was filmed drinking a bottle of beer in the constituency office of Durham MP Mary Foy last year, in the run-up to a by-election in nearby Hartlepool. The Labour leader has maintained the visit was a work event, and that the food and drink was consumed in between doing work, so was within the rules. But the internal planning document for the Durham trip apparently showed how an hour and twenty minutes were scheduled for ""dinner"" - after which, the visit would conclude. The memo said a takeaway order would be placed by a member of Sir Keir's office from a nearby Indian restaurant for a meal between 20:40 and 22:00. Covid rules in place at the time meant it was illegal for people in England to socialise indoors with people from outside their household or support bubble. There was an exemption for ""work purposes"", although working from home was recommended in the guidance, but the rules did not mention socialising at work. Describing the meal earlier this week, Sir Keir said that ""at various points people went through to the kitchen, got a plate, had something to eat, and got on with their work"". He has also previously insisted he returned to work afterwards. Last week, Labour said Angela Raynerwas also at the event, after previously denying she was there. It blamed a ""mistake"" in communication. The real reason all this matters is less about what happened a year ago. And rather more about what Sir Keir Starmer has said since. He has repeatedly expressed his outrage - shared by millions - at the behaviour of the prime minister and others in government in breaking the Covid rules. And he's repeatedly called for Boris Johnson to resign. Now his critics say if you get on a moral high horse, it might turn into a bucking bronco if you've broken the rules yourself. Ministers I've spoken to are cock-a-hoop at this latest twist in this long running row about political conduct during Covid. The Labour leader finds himself in a very perilous position. Asked whether he would resign if fined, Sir Keir told reporters on Saturday: ""I was working in the office. We stopped for something to eat. There was no party"". He said he would not resign and would lead Labour into the next general election. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Sir Keir should consider his position as Labour leader if he is fined by police for breaking Covid laws. Ms Abbott told LBC radio that she didn't think he would be fined, and criticised ""hype built up by the Tory press"". But she added that if he did receive a fixed penalty notice, he would have to ""consider his position"". She insisted she was a ""loyal supporter"" of Sir Keir's, and was simply making a ""common-sense point"". This video can not be played Watch: Footage shows Sir Keir Starmer drinking beer with colleagues in Durham on 30 April 2021 Durham police hadinitially decided no offence had occurredafter reviewing footage from the gathering earlier this year. But after Thursday's local elections concluded, the force announced it would launch an investigation after receiving ""significant new information"". The force had been coming under pressure to revisit the matter after Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined for attending a birthday party for the prime minister in Downing Street in June 2020. Conservative MPs have also been calling for the force to launch a formal probe in recent days. Sir Keir has urged Mr Johnson to resign since January, when the prime minister became embroiled in accusations Covid rules were broken during gatherings held in Whitehall during lockdown. The Metropolitan Police are continuing their investigation into 12 gatherings held in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office during 2020 and 2021. Asked what Sir Keir should do if he is fined, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told Times Radio: ""We've got to let the police carry out their investigation and that's only right and responsible. ""I do think, though, that the public will be uncomfortable with the hypocrisy. ""He has tweeted himself saying that if you're under investigation, a criminal investigation, then you should resign.""

The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has calculated thatone in seven shopfronts,externalacross Britain is empty. Boris Johnson said boarded-up premises were a ""blight"" on towns and cities and damaged local economies. But the British Property Federation (BPF), which represents the real estate industry, dismissed compulsory auctions as a ""political gimmick"". What is levelling up and how is it going? 'Levelling up' plan for UK unveiled by government One in seven shops lie empty after lockdown What might be in the Queen's Speech? A parliamentary bill allowing councils to force owners to rent out shops is part of the government's levelling-up agenda - a 2019 general election promise that left-behind communities will get a chance to catch up with the rest of the country. It is envisaged that the successful bidder, whether a business or a community group, will take over the premises. ""High streets up and down the country have long been blighted by derelict shopfronts, because they've been neglected, stripping opportunity from local areas,"" the prime minister said. ""We are putting that right by placing power back in the hands of local leaders and the community so our towns can be rejuvenated, levelling up opportunity and restoring neighbourhood pride."" According to the BRC's 2021 survey, north-eastern England had the highest rate of empty shops in Britain - around one in five - while London had the lowest rate, of around one in 11. The proportion of shops left empty varies widely across Britain BPF chief executive Melanie Leech said: ""We fully support government's ambitions to revitalise town centres but political gimmicks such as compulsory rent auctions are not the solution. ""No property owner wants their premises to be empty. In our experience, property owners are willing to do zero-rent deals to avoid boarded-up shopfronts. ""But the burden of business rates and other occupational costs mean it is still unviable for many small and independent businesses to trade from town-centre premises."" In February, the government unveiled its blueprint for levelling up, including reducing crime, improving wellbeing and spending more on skills training. Labour accused ministers of creating ""slogans and strategies, with few ideas"" for effecting change across the UK. And a report by the National Audit Office, which scrutinises public spending, has criticised the government for having a ""limited"" understanding of what has worked well when setting up its programme for regional economic growth. The Queen's Speech - in which the government lays out its legislative programme for the coming months - follows abruising local election result for the Conservatives. The party lost almost 500 council seats around Britain in Thursday's poll, amid concern that voter worries about the cost of living and Downing Street parties during lockdown had harmed Tory support.

"Domestic passengers who travel by air have been urged to find alternative means of transport from Monday Nigeria's airlines are to stop domestic operations from Monday in protest at the spiralling cost of jet fuel. It has risen almost fourfold this year, which was unsustainable, the Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) said. ""No airline in the world can absorb this kind of sudden shock from such an astronomical rise over a short period,"" its statement said. The hikes have been triggered principally by Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the end of February. Ukraine war to cause 'worst price shock in 50 years' AON, which represents Nigeria's nine domestic carriers, said the airlines had been having to subsidise services over the last four months. There have been many flight cancellations and delays since March, often blamed on a shortage of jet fuel. The price of tickets has also tripled on some routes in recent weeks. Passengers in Nigeria pay for fares in naira, the local currency that has been devaluing. However, fuel suppliers need to be paid in US dollars. Despite being Africa's largest oil producer, Nigeria imports almost all its jet fuel. AON said that it had told the government, MPs, the state-owned oil company and the association representing fuel sellers that something needed to be done to bring costs down. The hikes could not be fully passed on to passengers as they were ""already experiencing a lot of difficulties"", it said. The government has not yet commented on the planned strike. AON said operations would cease indefinitely from Monday, apologised to customers and urged them to make alternative arrangements. The manager of one of the airlines told the BBC the suspension would not affect international flights - though those with internal connections will be hit. It will be a massive disruption for travellers in Nigeria and another blow for one of Africa's largest economies, reports the BBC's Ishaq Khalid from the capital, Abuja. Flights are often the preferred option for travel these days for those who can afford it because of insecurity on roads across the country, he says. Kidnapping gangs operate on highways, targeting vehicles and then abducting passengers who they hold for ransom. There has been general outrage on social media after the announcement - with people bemoaning the state of the economy, and advising those that opt to travel by road to factor in ransom money. In March a train was targeted on the high-speed link between Abuja and the city of Kaduna andat least 62 people are known to have been taken hostage. According to security risk management firm Beacon Consulting, in the first three months of this year more than 3,500 people were killed and many more kidnapped by armed groups in Nigeria.

"Smartphones contain around 30 different elements, some of which the Earth is running out of The recycling of e-waste must urgently be ramped up because mining the Earth for precious metals to make new gadgets is unsustainable, scientists say. One study estimated that the world's mountain of discarded electronics, in 2021 alone, weighed 57 million tonnes. The Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC) says there now needs to be a global effort to mine that waste, rather than mining the Earth. Global conflicts also pose a threat to supply chains for precious metals. The RSC is running a campaign,externalto draw attention to the unsustainability of continuing to mine all the precious elements used in consumer technology. Waste electronics to outweigh Great Wall of China Millions of old gadgets 'stockpiled in drawers' It points out that geopolitical unrest, including the war in Ukraine, has caused huge spikes in the price of materials like nickel, a key element in electric vehicle batteries. This volatility in the market for elements is causing ""chaos in supply chains"" that enable the production of electronics. Combined with the surge in demand, this caused the price of lithium - another important component in battery technology - to increase by almost 500% between 2021 and 2022. Demand for lithium batteries is only expected to grow Current reserves of some key elements, researchers say, are simply running out. ""Our tech consumption habits remain highly unsustainable and have left us at risk of exhausting the raw elements we need,"" said Prof Tom Welton, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry, adding that those habits were ""continuing to exacerbate environmental damage"". Gallium: Used in medical thermometers, LEDs, solar panels, telescopes and has possible anti-cancer properties Arsenic: Used in fireworks, as a wood preserver Silver: Used in mirrors, reactive lenses that darken in sunlight, antibacterial clothing and gloves for use with touch screens Indium: Used in transistors, microchips, fire-sprinkler systems, as a coating for ball-bearings in Formula One cars and solar panels Yttrium: Used in white LED lights, camera lenses and can be used to treat some cancers Tantalum: Used in surgical implants, electrodes for neon lights, turbine blades, rocket nozzles and nose caps for supersonic aircraft, hearing aids and pacemakers This video can not be played Smartphones contain around 30 different elements, some of which the Earth is running out of All the while, the amount of e-waste generated is growing by about two million tonnes every year. Less than 20% is collected and recycled. ""We need governments to overhaul recycling infrastructure and tech businesses to invest in more sustainable manufacturing,"" said Prof Welton. New research by the RSC also revealed a growing demand from consumers for more sustainable technology. In an online survey of 10,000 people across 10 countries, 60% said they would be more likely to switch to a rival of their preferred tech brand if they knew the product was made in a sustainable way. The survey also suggested that people did not know how to deal with their own e-waste. Many respondents said they worried about the environmental effect of unused devices they have in their homes, but did not know what to do with them or were concerned about the security of recycling schemes. Elizabeth Ratcliffe from the Royal Society of Chemistry,told BBC Radio 4's inside Sciencethat many of us were ""unwittingly stockpiling precious metals in our homes"", in old phones and defunct computers. Previous RSC research showed that millions of us are unwittingly stockpiling precious elements by keeping old devices in our homes ""Manufacturers and retailers need to take more responsibility,"" said Ms Ratcliffe. ""Like 'take-back' schemes, meaning people can return their electronics to a retailer and be assured they will be recycled securely. ""All this volatility in supply chains really just reinforces the fact that we need a circular economy for these materials. At the moment, we're just mining them out of the ground constantly."" The society hopes to encourage people to take old and unwanted devices to recycling centres, rather than stuff them into drawers and forget about them. It points UK consumers toonline resources,externalwhere they can find the nearest centre that pledges to recycle computers, phones and other devices securely. ""The thing we always say is reduce, reuse and recycle. So perhaps keep a phone for longer and maybe sell an old phone or give it to a relative,"" says Ms Ratcliffe. ""It will need everyone working together to scale up these processes and put the infrastructure in place, so we can all recycle our devices.""

"The sky walkway in the Canadian Rockies is an example of what could be replicated at the Radical Road. A huge sky walkway is among the options being considered to deal with the problem of rock falls at a historic path in Edinburgh. The Radical Road at Holyrood Park has been closed for more than three years over safety concerns. Options in a new report also include reopening the path at users' own risk, installing avalanche-style shelters or wire mesh, or permanent closure. The site's managers said no final decision had yet been taken. The Radical Road runs along Salisbury Crags at Arthur's Seat, an extinct volcano that is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. It was closed in 2018 after 50 tonnes of rock fell from cliffs onto the path.

Also known as the Scottish Insurrection, this uprising was the result of social unrest among workers who were fed up with what they perceived to be unjust working and living conditions. Unemployed west of Scotland weavers paved the track round Salisbury Crags, in a plan which was suggested by author Sir Walter Scott. Ramblers Scotland director Brendan Paddy said ""much more detail"" was needed about the true risk to walkers using the 200-year-old right of way. ""As a society we normally let people assess, manage and accept the risks involved with outdoor activity, as these are usually hugely outweighed by the benefits,"" he said.

"Counting has finished with all 90 seats filled Sinn FÃ©in has won 27 seats to become the largest party and will be entitled to nominate a first minister - a first for a nationalist party A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the parliament, since NI's formation in 1921 The Democratic Unionist Party has held the post since 2007, but its vote share has dropped and it lost three seats, down to 25 Sinn FÃ©in wants Northern Ireland to leave the UK and unite with the Republic of Ireland But a Sinn FÃ©in win does not automatically mean a referendum - also known as a border poll - is imminent The cross-community Alliance party has made big gains, winning 17 seats up from eight last time Emma Canavan, Michael Sheils McNamee, Flora Drury, Jennifer Scott, Paul Lawlor and Luke Sproule It's the end of the road for counting On what is now a third day of counting we have finally had all 90 candidates elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It's been a momentous election, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the largest number of seats for the first time, returning 27 candidates, the same number as the last assembly election. The DUP slipped into second place with 25, but the big gains were for Alliance, which won 17 seats - more than double the eight it won in 2017. The UUP dropped by one seat to nine, the SDLP lost four to drop to eight. TUV and People Before Profit each had one candidate elected. Two independent unionists were also elected, while the Green Party lost both its seats. What happens next is not clear. Sinn FÃ©in can nominate a first minister to lead the Northern Ireland Executive, but as it's a joint office a first minister can not exist without a deputy first minister. The DUP can nominate a deputy first minister, but party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has already said he will not nominate any ministers without changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. There will be more reaction on BBC One Northern Ireland and iPlayer from 10am with Sunday Politics, and from the same time on BBC Radio Ulster there will be an election special. You can catch up with that later on BBC Sounds as well. That's all from us, goodnight.  On the 13th count Gary Middleton of the DUP has been re-elected in Foyle. It brings to an end more than two days of counting. Mr Middleton has served as a junior minister in the executive and was first elected for Foyle in 2016, having been co-opted the year before.

We are inching closer to the final results in Northern Ireland's election. And while we don't know the outcomes yet, we can already see how people voted when it came to their first preference: The map shows how Sinn FÃ©in has consolidated its vote, particularly in western areas of Northern Ireland, and also how the Alliance's vote has grown in areas around Belfast.

Chris Buckler will have a roundup of the election in a special hour-long programme going through all the events of the last two days. That'll be on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday at 10am. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor There was a time in Northern Ireland when Sinn FÃ©in voices were silenced. Banned from the airwaves by the government to combat IRA propaganda. The BBC even employed an actor to voice the words of the then Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams. But this weekend Sinn FÃ©in voices were in high demand as broadcasters scrambled to get them on air. They all wanted to hear from the one-time political pariahs who are now the political powerbrokers at Stormont. And pose the question: Does its victory push Northern Ireland closer to a border poll and possibly Irish unity? Read more here. Conservative MP Julian Smith says: The former secretary of state for Northern Ireland has tweeted his congratulations to the three main party leaders, saying they have exceeded expectations ""in different ways"".

Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin has urged political parties to form a new executive to ""serve the interests of all the people of Northern Ireland."" Mr Martin congratulated those elected. He also said it was ""incumbent"" on parties and elected representatives to deliver on their mandate and nominate a first and deputy first minister. ""Power-sharing and principles of partnership, equality and mutual
respect are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, through which peace has
been secured and progress achieved for almost 25 years,"" he says. ""A new
power-sharing executive is vital for progress and prosperity for
all in Northern Ireland."" ""As a co-guarantor of
the Good Friday Agreement, the government will continue to work in partnership
with the British government and engage with the leaders of the political
parties in Northern Ireland to seek and support the effective operation of all
of the political institutions of the agreement."" Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill thanks Scotland's first minister for her well wishes. ""A new era begins,"" she replies to Nicola Sturgeon.

"Counting is nearing the finish line in the Northern Ireland Assembly election,with Sinn FÃ©in set to win the largest number of seats for the first time. The DUP is set for second place while the Alliance Party is on course to become the third-largest party in the assembly. Turnout (63.6%) was only slightly down on the 64.8% recorded in the last assembly election in 2017. Sinn FÃ©in saw its first preference vote share rise by 1.1% as it repeated its impressive performance from 2017. Meanwhile the DUP's vote dropped by 6.7% and Alliance's rose by 4.5%. Full results for allNorthern Ireland,externalseats are expected later on Saturday. The results reflect a growing trend for Alliance in recent years, while the DUP's rapid rise at the start of the century tailed off before experiencing a significant drop. Support for the SDLP and UUP has fallen more steadily. 462 of 462 seats counted.Counting complete. Parties - and independents - in the Northern Ireland Assembly designate as unionist, nationalist or other. Unionists want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, while nationalists want Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to unite as one country. Parties which have designated as other have held various views. Alliance does not take a position on Irish unity, while People Before Profit supports a referendum on Irish unity and would campaign for unity if one was called. At this election the proportion of seats won by other parties rose significantly, up to 18 from the 11 won at the last election - 20% of the total seats. Of those seats, 17 were won by Alliance and one by People Before Profit. Both unionism and nationalism lost seats. Unionism, dropped by three seats to 37 - 41% - while nationalism fell from 39 to 35 seats  - 39% of the total. Women are still outnumbered almost two-to-one in the assembly, but a record number were elected this time around. In total 32 female candidates were returned to sit on the blue benches at Stormont. It is a big change from the first election where more than 75% of assembly members were male. This election also sawa record number of female candidates.

"Michelle O'Neill says the election results represent a significant moment of change Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill is on the cusp of becoming the first nationalist to hold the role of first minister in the history of Northern Ireland. It will be a historic moment for Northern Ireland and too for Sinn FÃ©in, which has won the greatest number of seats in the assembly. It's the first time that a nationalist party will be the largest since the creation of Northern Ireland a century ago. Ms O'Neill, the party's vice-president, said the result presents ""an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality and on the basis of social justice"". Party leader Mary Lou McDonald hailed news of Sinn FÃ©in's achievement as significant - and not just because of the symbolic change. ""It's significant because it's a moment of equality,"" she said. ""It says there's no job that's beyond anybody's reach."" The young Michelle might have found that hard to believe in May 1993. As the IRA edged towards the end of its so-called ""armed struggle"", she found herself pregnant at 16 years old. In an interviewwith the Irish Times,externallast year, she said she had ""very, very negative"" experiences as a teenage single mother. ""I went to a Catholic grammar. You were nearly made to feel girls like you can't be at school,"" she said. But in the end, she said the experience made her ""a stronger woman"". She went back to school, took her A-levels, stormed ahead. Michelle O'Neill arrives to cast her vote at the Clonoe polling station on Thursday 5 May Strong women are what the new Northern Ireland is about. In this year's election, a record number of women - 87 - stood. At the first election in 1998, just 14 women were elected. Among them was Monica McWilliams from the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition. ""I felt like I had to put on body armour because there were so few women there,"" she remembered. Sometimes, when she stood up to speak, there were repeated cries of ""Moo, moo, moo"" to drown out her words. The moos have been consigned to history. Ms O'Neill grew up steeped in the history of Northern Ireland's Troubles. Born Michelle Doris on 10 January 1977, she was raised in the village of Clonoe in rural County Tyrone and hails from a family of prominent Irish republicans. Her father,Brendan Doris, was a former IRA prisoner who became a Sinn FÃ©in councillor in Dungannon. Her uncle, Paul Doris, was president of Noraid, a republican fundraising group. When the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998, she began working for the party. It brought her into direct contact with Martin McGuinness, who at that time was running for election in the Mid Ulster constituency. When her father stepped down from Dungannon Borough Council ahead of the 2005 election, Ms O'Neill won the seat he vacated. She became the first woman to hold the post of mayor in Dungannon. Her assembly career began in 2007, when she joined Martin McGuinness and Francie Molloy as a Mid Ulster MLA. She became her party's spokeswoman for health and sat on the education committee. Michelle O'Neill rose to the role of agriculture minister before becoming health minister in 2016 After four years on the back benches at Stormont, Sinn FÃ©in appointed her as minister for agriculture in 2011. In 2015, she was promoted to minister for health, one of Stormont's most high-profile and challenging portfolios. She faced mounting hospital waiting lists, a crisis in general practice and the findings of the Bengoa report into how Northern Ireland's health care is organised. Her response was a10-year plan to transform health service, saying it would improve a system that was at ""breaking point"". When Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in 2017 over the DUP's handling of theRenewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scandal, it led to a political stalemate at Stormont for three years. When he died soon afterwards, she was chosen to lead the party in Northern Ireland - a younger face and, significantly, a woman like her counterpart in the Republic, Mary Lou McDonald. Michelle O'Neill carries the coffin of the late Martin McGuinness in 2017 Now, the pinnacle of Northern Ireland politics, the role of first minister, is within her grasp. Michelle O'Neill (left, with her party leader Mary-Lou McDonald) says the vote has ""ushered in a new era"" The office of the first and deputy first minister is an equal one, but the allocation of titles is symbolically important. Few are expecting a power-sharing devolved government to be formed in the short term. The DUP is reiterating that it plans to block the formation of a new Stormont Executive unless the Brexit trade border with the rest of the UK is scrapped. Significantly, during the election campaign, Michelle O'Neill's focus has not been on Irish unity and talk of a border poll. She argued that people were not waking up thinking about Irish unity, but instead were worried about the cost of living crisis. What she wants to do, she added, was to ""work for everybody"". O'Neill's journey to Sinn FÃ©in leader O'Neill sees off challenge for her Sinn FÃ©in role Who will succeed Martin McGuinness?

"Mariupol has become the most heavily bombed and damaged city in Ukraine's war with Russia - having suffered the brunt of sustained Russian attacks. It is key to Moscow's military campaign in Ukraine. But why? There are four main reasons why taking the port city would be such a strategic win for Russia - and a major blow for Ukraine. Geographically, the city of Mariupol occupies only a tiny area on the map but it now stands obstinately in the way of Russian forces who have burst out of the Crimean peninsula. They are pushing north-east to try to link up with their comrades and Ukrainian-separatist allies in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. General Sir Richard Barrons - former commander of UK Joint Forces Command - says capturing Mariupol is vital to Russia's war effort. ""When the Russians feel they have successfully concluded that battle, they will have completed a land bridge from Russia to Crimea and they will see this as a major strategic success."" If Mariupol was seized, Russia would also end up with full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline - cutting-off its maritime trade and further isolating it from the world. By holding out against advancing forces for the past three weeks, the defending Ukrainians have managed to preoccupy a large number of Russian troops. But that failure by Russia to secure a rapid capture of the city, has prompted Russian commanders to resort to a 21st Century version of mediaeval siege tactics. They have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying over 90% of the city. They have also cut off access to electricity, heating, fresh water, food and medical supplies - creating a man-made humanitarian catastrophe which Moscow now blames on Ukraine for refusing to surrender by an 05:00 deadline on Monday. A Ukrainian MP has accused Russia of ""trying to starve Mariupol into surrender"". Ukraine has vowed to defend the city down to the last soldier. It may well come to that. Russian troops are slowly pushing into the centre and, in the absence of any kind of workable peace deal, Russia is now likely to intensify its bombardment - drawing little if any distinction between its armed defenders and the beleaguered civilian population which still numbers over 200,000. If, and when, Russia takes full control of Mariupol this will free up close to 6,000 of its troops - organised into 1,000-strong battalion tactical groups - to then go and reinforce other Russian fronts around Ukraine. There are a number of possibilities as to where they could be redeployed: to the north-east to join the battle to encircle and destroy Ukraine's regular armed forces fighting pro-Kremlin separatists in the Donbas region to the west to push towards Odesa, which would be Ukraine's last remaining major outlet to the Black Sea to the north-west towards the city of Dnipro Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion Mariupol has long-been a strategically important port on the Sea of Azov, part of the Black Sea. With its deep berths, it is the biggest port in the Azov Sea region and home to a major iron and steel works. In normal times, Mariupol is a key export hub for Ukraine's steel, coal and corn going to customers in the Middle East and beyond. Ukrainian concrete defences on a beach by Mariupol port, 17 February For eight years now, since Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the city has been sandwiched uncomfortably between Russian forces on that peninsula and the pro-Kremlin separatists in the breakaway self-declared republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. Losing Mariupol would be a major blow to what is left of Ukraine's economy. Mariupol is home to a Ukrainian militia unit called the Azov Brigade, named after the Sea of Azov which links Mariupol to the rest of the Black Sea. The Azov Brigade contains far-right extremists, historically including neo-Nazis. Although they form only the tiniest fraction of Ukraine's fighting forces, this has been a useful propaganda tool for Moscow, giving it a pretext for telling Russia's population that the young men it has sent to fight in Ukraine are there to rid their neighbour of neo-Nazis. Azov Battalion training camp at a former holiday resort near Mariupol, February 2019 If Russia manages to capture alive significant numbers of Azov Brigade fighters it is likely they will be paraded on Russian state-controlled media as part of the ongoing information war to discredit Ukraine and its government. The capture of Mariupol by Russia, if it happens, will be psychologically significant for both sides in this war. A Russian victory in Mariupol would enable the Kremlin to show its population - through state-controlled media - that Russia was achieving its aims and making progress. For President Putin, for whom this war appears to be personal, there is a historical significance to all this. He sees Ukraine's Black Sea coastline as belonging to something called Novorossiya (New Russia) - Russian lands that date back to the 18th Century empire. Putin wants to revive that concept, ""rescuing Russians from the tyranny of a pro-western government in Kyiv"" as he sees it. Mariupol currently stands in the way of him achieving that aim. But to Ukrainians, the loss of Mariupol would be a major blow - not just militarily and economically - but also to the minds of the men and women fighting on the ground, defending their country. Mariupol would be the first major city to fall to the Russians after Kherson, a strategically much less important city that was barely defended. There is another morale aspect here and that is of deterrence. Digging graves by the roadside in Mariupol, 20 March Mariupol has put up fierce resistance - but look at the cost. The city is decimated, it lies largely in ruins. It will go down in history alongside Grozny and Aleppo, places that Russia eventually bombed and shelled into submission, reducing them to rubble. The message to other Ukrainian cities is stark - if you choose to resist like Mariupol did then you can expect the same fate. ""The Russians couldn't walk into Mariupol,"" says Gen Sir Richard Barrons, ""they couldn't drive in with their tanks, so they've pounded it to rubble. And that's what we should expect to see anywhere else that really matters to them.""

"Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (centre) is hoping to be the first nationalist politician to become NI's first minister The results of the Northern Ireland Assembly election are in and, for the first time ever, Sinn FÃ©in has won the most seats. It's the first time ever that a nationalist party has been the largest at Stormont in terms of seats, 101 years after Northern Ireland came into existence. It edged out the DUP, which is now the second-largest party. Alliance also had a historic result, winning 17 seats to become the third-largest party in the assembly. So what happens next and what does it mean for the future of devolved government in Northern Ireland and for Northern Ireland itself? Not necessarily. Underthe power-sharing system of government in Northern Ireland, the largest unionist and nationalist parties must share the first minister and deputy first minister's post, while the other ministerial positions are allocated among the biggest parties based on how many seats they have in the assembly. As the largest party, the rules say that Sinn FÃ©in is the party entitled to hold the position. But the roles of first minister and deputy first minister are equal - despite their names - and one cannot hold office without the other. So in order for Sinn FÃ©in to hold the first minister position, the biggest party from the unionist bloc - the DUP - must agree to take up the deputy first minister's position. On Monday,DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he would not do sountil his party's concerns about the post-Brexit trading arrangements contained in the Northern Ireland Protocol were resolved. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (centre) withdrew Paul Givan (left) as NI's first minister in February in protest against the NI Protocol Sir Jeffrey is opposed to the protocol and withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in February in protest against it. The protocol isthe part of the Brexit deal which applies to Northern Irelandand is designed to avoid a hard border between it and the Republic of Ireland. It means checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, something unionists say undermines Northern Ireland's place in the union. Even though the difference between the first minister and deputy first minister positions is in name only, Sinn FÃ©in will draw a big symbolic boost from being entitled to hold the post. For its first 50 years, Northern Ireland was ruled exclusively by unionists, and since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 a unionist politician has always been first minister. The new assembly will meet on Friday and will elect a Speaker, who will then ask the parties for their nominations for first minister and deputy first minister. If the DUP nominates a deputy first minister, then an executive can be formed and other ministers can be chosen. If it does not, then the process is more uncertain. The DUP cannot nominate Sir Jeffrey, as he has stepped away from Stormont to remain as an MP at Westminster. He said he would not return to Stormont until his concerns with the protocol had been resolved. HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:Who is Michelle O'Neill? RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland Because of new rules which were brought in earlier in the year, the assembly will continue to exist in a caretaker capacity and the other ministers who were in place before the election - such as the health and education ministers - can stay in place. This could continue for up to six months, while there would be negotiations to try to find a solution to the DUP's refusal to nominate a deputy first minister. After six months, a fresh election could be called or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis, would have to come up with an alternative solution. Sinn FÃ©in's Mary-Lou McDonald (right) says planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"" During the election campaign Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said that people were not ""waking up thinking about Irish unity"" and stressed that issues such as the cost-of-living crisis were bigger priorities. But Sinn FÃ©in remains committed to holding a referendum on Irish unification, and its manifesto called on the British and Irish governments to set a date for a border poll. On Friday party leader Mary Lou McDonald said planning for a unity referendum would come within a ""five-year framework"". The rules around holding a referendum are set out in the Good Friday Agreement - the 1998 peace agreement which ended the worst of the Troubles and set up the Northern Ireland Assembly. It says the UK government's secretary of state for Northern Ireland can hold a referendum at any time. In addition it says he or she should call one if it appears a majority of voters would vote in favour of Irish unification. Sinn FÃ©in is likely to argue that things are moving in that direction, but unionists will argue that the nationalist vote share has gone down since 2017 and that shows there is no desire for a border poll. Opinion polls have also not shown a majority in favour of a united Ireland. The growth in support for the Alliance Party, which does not take a position on the topic of Irish unity, also complicates the issue. Northern Ireland's devolved administration at Stormont - known as the executive - is made up of the first minister and deputy first minister and eight other ministers. It's known as a mandatory coalition, which means the largest parties are all entitled to at least one ministry. A mathematical formula decides how many ministries they are entitled based on the number of seats they won. However for an executive to be formed it would require the DUP to fill the deputy first minister's post. You can read more about the power-sharing systemhere. The Alliance Party has won its biggest ever share of the first preference vote in a Northern Ireland Assembly election with 13.5% and also a record number of seats - 17. The party, which was founded in 1970, won just eight seats at the last election in 2017, but it had good results in the European, council and Westminster elections of 2019 and has continued the trend this year. The Alliance Party, led by Naomi Long seen in the centre here with victorious candidates, made big gains in the election The party defines itself as being neither unionist or nationalist and aims to win votes from across Northern Ireland's traditional political divides. The result is also a sign that more voters are moving away from the traditional unionist and nationalist blocs. Alliance is likely to increase its calls for changes to how the system at Stormont works. For example it wants the executive to become a voluntary coalition. This would be a major change to the Good Friday Agreement and would require lengthy negotiations with the British and Irish governments and the other Northern Ireland parties.

"Sir Keir Starmer is facing further questions over whether he broke Covid lockdown rules at an MP's office in Durham, amid reports a leaked Labour memo suggested time was set aside for him to eat dinner with colleagues. Durham police are investigating last April's event, when the Labour leader had beer and curry with others. TheMail on Sunday published what it said was a memo,externalshowing timings for ""dinner"", before the visit would end. Sir Keir insists no rules were broken. A Labour spokesperson said he had eaten ""between work demands"". A party source added that it would be ""wrong to assume"" activities during the visit occurred at the times originally planned. Starmer investigated over alleged lockdown breach Rayner was at lockdown event with Starmer Keir Starmer's Durham drink - what were the rules? Sir Keir was filmed drinking a bottle of beer in the constituency office of Durham MP Mary Foy last year, in the run-up to a by-election in nearby Hartlepool. The Labour leader has maintained the visit was a work event, and that the food and drink was consumed in between doing work, so was within the rules. But the internal planning document for the Durham trip apparently showed how an hour and twenty minutes were scheduled for ""dinner"" - after which, the visit would conclude. The memo said a takeaway order would be placed by a member of Sir Keir's office from a nearby Indian restaurant for a meal between 20:40 and 22:00. Covid rules in place at the time meant it was illegal for people in England to socialise indoors with people from outside their household or support bubble. There was an exemption for ""work purposes"", although working from home was recommended in the guidance, but the rules did not mention socialising at work. Describing the meal earlier this week, Sir Keir said that ""at various points people went through to the kitchen, got a plate, had something to eat, and got on with their work"". He has also previously insisted he returned to work afterwards. Last week, Labour said Angela Raynerwas also at the event, after previously denying she was there. It blamed a ""mistake"" in communication. The real reason all this matters is less about what happened a year ago. And rather more about what Sir Keir Starmer has said since. He has repeatedly expressed his outrage - shared by millions - at the behaviour of the prime minister and others in government in breaking the Covid rules. And he's repeatedly called for Boris Johnson to resign. Now his critics say if you get on a moral high horse, it might turn into a bucking bronco if you've broken the rules yourself. Ministers I've spoken to are cock-a-hoop at this latest twist in this long running row about political conduct during Covid. The Labour leader finds himself in a very perilous position. Asked whether he would resign if fined, Sir Keir told reporters on Saturday: ""I was working in the office. We stopped for something to eat. There was no party"". He said he would not resign and would lead Labour into the next general election. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Sir Keir should consider his position as Labour leader if he is fined by police for breaking Covid laws. Ms Abbott told LBC radio that she didn't think he would be fined, and criticised ""hype built up by the Tory press"". But she added that if he did receive a fixed penalty notice, he would have to ""consider his position"". She insisted she was a ""loyal supporter"" of Sir Keir's, and was simply making a ""common-sense point"". This video can not be played Watch: Footage shows Sir Keir Starmer drinking beer with colleagues in Durham on 30 April 2021 Durham police hadinitially decided no offence had occurredafter reviewing footage from the gathering earlier this year. But after Thursday's local elections concluded, the force announced it would launch an investigation after receiving ""significant new information"". The force had been coming under pressure to revisit the matter after Mr Johnson, his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were fined for attending a birthday party for the prime minister in Downing Street in June 2020. Conservative MPs have also been calling for the force to launch a formal probe in recent days. Sir Keir has urged Mr Johnson to resign since January, when the prime minister became embroiled in accusations Covid rules were broken during gatherings held in Whitehall during lockdown. The Metropolitan Police are continuing their investigation into 12 gatherings held in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office during 2020 and 2021. Asked what Sir Keir should do if he is fined, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told Times Radio: ""We've got to let the police carry out their investigation and that's only right and responsible. ""I do think, though, that the public will be uncomfortable with the hypocrisy. ""He has tweeted himself saying that if you're under investigation, a criminal investigation, then you should resign.""

"A woman who was secretly filmed getting undressed and using the shower by a man who preyed on nearly 170 victims says she is still waiting for justice. John Wood concealed cameras to film women in a number of locations, including in the swimming pool changing rooms at a Butlins holiday resort. The 44-year-old went on to hack into home security software to capture couples having sex in their own homes. Over six years he saved more than 1,400 videos which he used for his own sexual gratification. Wood was handed a two-year suspended jail sentence for his crimes. Here one woman, who wished to remain anonymous, opens up about how the experience has affected her. When I found out what had happened to me, I felt sick to my stomach. I remember I couldn't stop shaking. I felt completely violated, embarrassed and angry. He had set up cameras to record me in my most vulnerable moments - the things you do by yourself. Undressing. Using the shower, the toilet. He had taken something from me that I had not consented to. He had invaded my space. His crimes were intentional, premeditated and committed over many years, with many more victims. I didn't sleep the night after he was sentenced. I wanted to hear it directly from the police. They called me the day after. He got a two year sentence, suspended for two years. I cried on the phone, so upset and disgusted. I felt like I had been physically hit. I was so angry, so confused. In my heart of hearts I fully expected him to receive a custodial sentence. But he didn't. He walked away. I asked if I could appeal. After waiting so long for this case to get to court, after all my frustration, irritation, embarrassment, not knowing if these images were shared. Surely there was a way to appeal? The police later said I wasn't able to appeal because the sentencing for these types of crimes are only two years maximum. Within a couple of weeks of the case's conclusion, I had a mental breakdown. I couldn't contain my anger any more. The next day I sought medical help. I was prescribed anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs and will probably remain on them for the foreseeable future. Woods's offending first came to light during a regional organised crime unit investigation Wood was sentenced in October 2020 after admitting six charges of voyeurism and two counts under the Computer Misuse Act. The extent of his offending came to the attention of a regional organised crime unit during a joint investigation with the FBI. They were looking into the software LuminosityLink which allowed users to activate cameras and microphones to secretly observe people in their own homes. Wood was one of 167 people in the UK who bought the software and one of 8,500 across the world. Although police found no evidence he ever used it, he was now on their radar, and when officers analysed his computers they found hundreds of secret videos taken between 2011 and 2018. Det Sgt Jonathan Atkin, lead officer on the case, said: ""Prior to that point we didn't know what other offending he had committed. ""The only reason we identified what other offending he committed was because we seized every digital device from his property."" The videos recovered showed Wood had ""a massive, avid interest in voyeurism"", Det Sgt Atkin said. He had filmed more than 300 videos, setting up cameras to film women from the windows of his home. Then in 2012, while on holiday at Butlins in Bognor Regis, he took a camera in a concealed bag into the swimming pool changing rooms, where he filmed women undressing in adjacent cubicles. Wood filmed 77 videos over five days at Butlins. They showed more than 160 victims, none could be identified. Wood used software to monitor several different illicitly-accessed cameras at once But this was just the start of his offending. He went on to hack into people's private webcams and other camera-enabled devices to secretly watch them in their own homes. Wood used software to monitor several different illicitly-accessed cameras at once. A total of 1,400 of these videos were saved on his devices. The majority of the videos showed people having sex, but most [of the victims] have never been identified. ""There's no doubt, from the evidence from his devices, that he hasn't just fallen across this, it is a calculated, premeditated position, where he has an interest in adult females and obtaining whatever sexual gratification he can get from it,"" Det Sgt Atkin said. ""It was an ever growing interest that has then become palpable to the fact where he has then decided, 'well I have done this, what is the next thing I can now gain from it'. ""He's gone from putting cameras in a bag on the beach, with people sunbathing... to then going extreme into filming in leisure facilities and finally hacking into people's computers."" In court, Wood was described by his lawyer as someone who had been diagnosed with autism, hoarding disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. It was argued he was of previous good character and had stayed out of trouble in the three years since he was arrested. Under the terms of his suspended sentence, Wood was ordered to complete a sex offender rehabilitation programme, 30 rehabilitation activity days and 100 hours or unpaid work. He must also abide by a 10 year sexual harm prevention order and sign onto the sex offenders' register. I was so very disappointed. I didn't know where to turn. I felt lost, that my options were over, and that I just had to live with the decision. I was livid. Furious that I couldn't turn to anyone at this point and that what is done is done. I had no say in court, apart from a statement I had given. No control over what the judge had determined to be justified sentencing. He changed his real name by deed poll before he was officially charged so he could protect his privacy. He was able to use his new name and so protect his identity throughout the court case, from being charged to sentencing, giving him the luxury to remain ""unknown"". His victims were never allowed their privacy. I had no choice in having my dignity protected, he took that from me without my consent, for his own sexual gratification. The punishment didn't fit the crime. I still feel very much like it was unduly lenient. How many more people would he have had to have hacked? How many more years would he have had to have offended to spend time in jail? If he did serve time inside prison I think I would've had closure. Instead I am left with something that will always haunt me. Voyeurism is not included within the scope of the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme The Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme, under which people can appeal a sentence, has been expanded six times and includes many serious sexual offences. Most recently, sexual offences involving an abuse of trust, indecent images offences and domestic abuse offences were added, however voyeurism is not currently included within its scope. A spokesperson for the Attorney General's office said: ""For over 30 years, the Unduly Lenient Sentences scheme has helped victims of crime and their loved ones by correcting unduly lenient sentencing. ""The scheme includes many more offences now than it did when it was first launched, allowing the Law Officers to look at more sentences which don't appear to fit the crime."" It is for the Secretary of State for Justice to add further offences to the scheme. The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on whether voyeurism was a crime it would consider adding. The police confirmed Wood had a massive interest in pornography and that the evidence they had was over and above what they needed. So how was this sex offender allowed any leniency? I very much feel the system did let myself and other victims down. Without a shadow of a doubt this type of crime should be able to be appealed. I just want this all to end with a feeling that justice was served. Yes, he had to participate in a program and community service, also he'll be on the Sex Offenders Register, good, but the gravity of his crimes I feel deserved more than just a suspended sentence. It is outrageous that victims of these crimes just have to live with the consequences of the criminals' actions without being heard or seen by the law. I am not just a name, or number, I am a person who has been deeply affected by his malicious, premeditated, sexually driven actions and they will always affect me.

"The Northern Ireland assembly sits at Stormont in east Belfast Sinn FÃ©in has emerged as the biggest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, after last week's elections. However, the party's vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, cannot become first minister unless the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - which had been the largest party since 2007 but has now been pushed into second place - nominates for the position of deputy first minister. This is because of Northern Ireland's power-sharing system of government, which was introduced in the 1990s as a way of ending decades of violence. The principle of power sharing is what sets Northern Ireland apart from the UK's other nations. It means that in any government there must be representatives from both the nationalist community - who favour unity with the Republic of Ireland - and unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. The idea is that, whatever their historic differences, both communities have a vested interest in the system. Essential guide to the Northern Ireland election A chamber of 90 members (MLAs) is elected to the assembly at least once every five years. Five MLAs are elected in each of the 18 constituencies using a system called single transferable vote (STV), which ranks candidates by preference. Northern Ireland has a first minister and a deputy first minister - one unionist, the other nationalist. Seamus Mallon from the SDLP was deputy first minister, alongside the UUP's David Trimble as first minister in 1998 Since 2006 the first minister has been chosen by the largest party in the assembly. If this is a unionist party, then the deputy minister is drawn from the largest nationalist party, and vice versa. Both ministers have equal powers, and one cannot be in office without the other. If either the first minister or the deputy first minister resigns, the other is also forced to resign, whether they want to or not. GOVERNMENT CRISIS:What happens next? HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:What does the party want? RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts The executive, or cabinet is multi-party, and ministers are drawn from both unionist, nationalist and non-aligned parties, based on how many seats they have won in an election. This also means that politicians from smaller parties can be appointed as ministers. The assembly exercises powers over matters including the economy, education, health, and more recently, Covid. Certain areas - including international relations and defence - remain reserved for the UK government in London. Northern Ireland was createdin 1921 and remained part of the UK, when the rest of Ireland became an independent state. This created a split in the population between the unionists - who were mainly Protestant - and nationalists, who were predominantly Catholic. From the late 1960s, armed groups from both sides, such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA), carried out out bombings and shootings. This period was known as the Troubles - it lasted almost 30 years, and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people. Peace talks started in the early 1990s, culminating in the signing of theGood Friday Agreementin 1998, which ended the worst of the violence. It was endorsed in a referendum with 71% voting in favour. Under its terms, Northern Ireland found itself run by a new power-sharing assembly. When Stormont was restored in 2007, following a five-year suspension, the DUP's Ian Paisley was first minister and Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness deputy first minister The assembly has endured but it has also been suspended a number of times. The longest suspension was between 2002 and 2007, during which time Northern Ireland was run once more from London. Relations between the two main parties broke down again in 2017, and the assembly and ruling executive were not restored until January 2020. In February this year the DUP's Paul Givanresigned as first minister, in protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem This is the section of the UK's Brexit deal with the EU which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the European single market, and protects the movement of goods across the border with the Irish Republic. However, it also involves creating border controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. While most of the politicians elected to the assembly are in favour of the protocol remaining in place, unionists are not happy at what they perceive as a weakening of Northern Ireland's bond with Great Britain. The issue has caused street protests and unrest in some areas. Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan are currently deputy first minister and first minister Now that Sinn FÃ©in has become the largest party in the Assembly, its deputy leader, Michelle O'Neill, stands to become first minister. While DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, said that his party would respect the election result, his party says it won't nominate any ministers to an executive until its concerns about the protocol are addressed by the UK government. And on Thursday, the party said Sir Jeffrey would not be taking up his Assembly seat in Lagan Valley, instead choosing to remain an MP until issues with the the protocol were resolved. Former MLA and MP Emma Little-Pengelly was co-opted to his seat at Stormont. Sinn FÃ©in has accused DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson of holding society to ransom by threatening to paralyse the Assembly. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said the UK will have ""no choice but to act"" if the EU does not show flexibility over the protocol, but it's unlikely any movement will happen before the Northern Ireland Assembly sits on Friday. If no agreement is reached on the protocol and the DUP do not nominate a deputy first minister, other executive ministers who held office before the election - such as the health minister and education minister - can stay in post for up to six months. If a solution cannot be found after that time, there would either need to be further negotiations or a fresh election. The DUP has also refused to say if it will support the election of a new Speaker to the assembly. If it does not the assembly cannot function, MLAs cannot hold debates in the chamber or scrutinise ministers. Sinn FÃ©in: What happens now in Northern Ireland? What plans are ahead for NI language and culture? Q&A: How does the NI Executive work?

"Sinn FÃ©in, pictured at the party's manifesto launch, described its election performance as ""historic"" In the late 1980s, when I first arrived in Belfast as a young reporter, Sinn FÃ©in were routinely described on the BBC airwaves as ""the political wing of the IRA"". Sinn FÃ©in wasn't coy about its relationship with the IRA. If you asked Gerry Adams or Martin McGuinness to denounce an IRA bombing or shooting, they were likely to tell you they didn't engage in ""the politics of condemnation"". The Sinn FÃ©in newspaper An Phoblacht (Republican News) featured a column entitled War News which proudly detailed the latest IRA ambushes on what it described as British ""crown forces"". The party office on the Falls Road in west Belfast was emblazoned with an iconic mural of Bobby Sands. Bobby Sands was the IRA prisoner who secured election as an MP in 1981, before dying on hunger strike inside the Maze Long Kesh prison. If you had told me back then that, 41 years to the day that Bobby Sands died, the voters would be elevating Sinn FÃ©in to the top spot as Northern Ireland's biggest party, I would have been sceptical, to say the least. Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness pictured at an IRA funeral in 1987 A former Northern Ireland Secretary, Douglas Hurd, once derided Gerry Adams as ""Mr 10%"" - a sobriquet designed to emphasise that Adams only spoke for a minority of nationalists. Now Michelle O'Neill is ""Ms 29%"" - in possession of a quarter of a million first preference votes. A clear lead over the DUP in Stormont seats, and, potentially, the keys to the Stormont first minister's office. In the 1980s, Bobby Sands pioneered the foray into electoral politics, but in the Irish Republican ""ballot box and Armalite rifle"" dual strategy, the Armalite remained on top. But in the 1990s, Gerry Adams persuaded the reluctant militarists in Republican ranks that turning the IRA's violence off could achieve more in their quest for Irish unity. The eventual success of Adams' strategy was undoubtedly hastened by the willingness of the more moderate nationalist SDLP leader John Hume to ""sacrifice his party for his country"". Hume shared his immense influence and access in the USA and Dublin with Adams, in the interest of securing peace. The paramilitary ceasefires andthe Good Friday Agreementfollowed. The Good Friday Agreement was signed on 10 April 1998 and helped bring an end a period of conflict in Northern Ireland called the Troubles Buoyed up by huge domestic and international attention, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness transformed their movement into a political force which, in the 2000s, overtook the SDLP as the biggest nationalist party, before 20 years later supplanting the DUP as the biggest party overall. It is no mean achievement and to pull it off Sinn FÃ©in has drawn on the kind of discipline and organisation which it developed duringthe Troubles, a keen grasp of the issues on the mind of the growing nationalist community (many too young to have first-hand memories of the bad old days) and a war chest full of cash. The party is generally left of centre and populist in its approach and has proved able to discern changing attitudes, shifting its ground on issues as diverse as women's rights, the EU or diplomatic relations with Russia. Sinn FÃ©in set to win most seats in historic poll Although the party doesn't hide its commitment to a united Ireland, it won its latest mandate on the back of a deliberately low-key campaign with a soft focus, featuring Michelle O'Neill working out in the gym and promising she would be ""a first minister for all"". Putting one over on the DUP and unionism might have been a large part of the appeal for nationalist voters, but Sinn FÃ©in didn't have to say it out loud. The continuing presence of veteran IRA figures within the party's Stormont ranks emphasises that, while much has changed, the party's primary motivation remains the same. What would have surprised my 1980s self even more than Sinn FÃ©in's current dominance at Stormont is the situation in Dublin, where the party, led by Mary Lou McDonald, is now consistently topping the polls. A mural of Bobby Sands on the Falls Road in Belfast It's not inconceivable to imagine a Sinn FÃ©in Stormont first minister meeting a Sinn FÃ©in taoiseach (Irish prime minister) sometime in 2025, when the next Irish election is due. Sinn Fein's goal of uniting Ireland north and south remains some way off. The current balance at Stormont is roughly 40% nationalist 40% unionist with 20% preferring to steer clear of traditional green orange politics. Moreover, the latest opinion polls still point to majority support for staying in the UK. But Sinn FÃ©in's ascendancy is an important, symbolic, moment and a remarkable example of a movement exchanging the gun for the ballot box and then exceeding all expectations. Bobby Sands famously said that Irish republicans' revenge on their enemies would eventually be the ""laughter of our children"" and 41 years on republicans definitely have something to smile about.

"Counting has finished with all 90 seats filled Sinn FÃ©in has won 27 seats to become the largest party and will be entitled to nominate a first minister - a first for a nationalist party A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the parliament, since NI's formation in 1921 The Democratic Unionist Party has held the post since 2007, but its vote share has dropped and it lost three seats, down to 25 Sinn FÃ©in wants Northern Ireland to leave the UK and unite with the Republic of Ireland But a Sinn FÃ©in win does not automatically mean a referendum - also known as a border poll - is imminent The cross-community Alliance party has made big gains, winning 17 seats up from eight last time Emma Canavan, Michael Sheils McNamee, Flora Drury, Jennifer Scott, Paul Lawlor and Luke Sproule It's the end of the road for counting On what is now a third day of counting we have finally had all 90 candidates elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It's been a momentous election, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the largest number of seats for the first time, returning 27 candidates, the same number as the last assembly election. The DUP slipped into second place with 25, but the big gains were for Alliance, which won 17 seats - more than double the eight it won in 2017. The UUP dropped by one seat to nine, the SDLP lost four to drop to eight. TUV and People Before Profit each had one candidate elected. Two independent unionists were also elected, while the Green Party lost both its seats. What happens next is not clear. Sinn FÃ©in can nominate a first minister to lead the Northern Ireland Executive, but as it's a joint office a first minister can not exist without a deputy first minister. The DUP can nominate a deputy first minister, but party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has already said he will not nominate any ministers without changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. There will be more reaction on BBC One Northern Ireland and iPlayer from 10am with Sunday Politics, and from the same time on BBC Radio Ulster there will be an election special. You can catch up with that later on BBC Sounds as well. That's all from us, goodnight.  On the 13th count Gary Middleton of the DUP has been re-elected in Foyle. It brings to an end more than two days of counting. Mr Middleton has served as a junior minister in the executive and was first elected for Foyle in 2016, having been co-opted the year before.

Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor There was a time in Northern Ireland when Sinn FÃ©in voices were silenced. Banned from the airwaves by the government to combat IRA propaganda. The BBC even employed an actor to voice the words of the then Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams. But this weekend Sinn FÃ©in voices were in high demand as broadcasters scrambled to get them on air. They all wanted to hear from the one-time political pariahs who are now the political powerbrokers at Stormont. And pose the question: Does its victory push Northern Ireland closer to a border poll and possibly Irish unity? Read more here. Conservative MP Julian Smith says: The former secretary of state for Northern Ireland has tweeted his congratulations to the three main party leaders, saying they have exceeded expectations ""in different ways"". He addressed Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Alliance's Naomi Long, saying that the people of Northern Ireland ""have spoken"".

"Smoke rises above the steelworks on Thursday A third operation to pull civilians from Mariupol is due on Friday, the UN says, as more fighting was reported for control of a steelworks where the last Ukrainian defenders are holding out. About 200 civilians are also believed to be hiding in bunkers in the plant. UN chief Antonio Guterres said everything should be done to ""get people out of these hellscapes"". Russia's Vladimir Putin said his forces are ready to give civilians safe passage, but fighters must surrender. The Russian president has already declared victory in Mariupol, ordering his forces to seal off the sprawling industrial site - which was designed during the Cold War to serve as a nuclear bunker and has a network of tunnels deep below ground - rather than try to take control of it. However the remaining Ukrainian forces inside the steelworks - fighters from the Azov regiment, some marines, border guards and police - say Russian attacks are continuing. In his overnight address Ukraine's President Zelensky also said that Russian shelling and attempts to wrest control of the steelworks were ongoing. ""Just imagine this hell. And there are children! More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death nearby,"" he said. The Azov regiment released drone footage showing explosions at the steelworks, but the date of the footage could not be verified. Earlier on Thursday Sviatoslav Palamar, an Azov regiment commander, said Ukrainian defenders were fighting ""difficult, bloody battles"" with Russian troops who had managed to enter part of the complex. But the Kremlin denied its forces had tried to storm the plant and insisted that a humanitarian corridor was open as part of a three-day ceasefire that started on Thursday. Mr Guterres said a third operation to evacuate civilians from the city was under way and would arrive in the city on Friday. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on social media that this would happen at about midday. Mariupol steelworks evacuees reach safety At least 20 children are thought to be among the remaining civilians in the steelworks, and food and water supplies are dwindling fast. On Sunday an initial group of civilians was evacuated from the plant. Footage showed mainly women and children being helped to walk over piles of rubble, and boarding a bus with missing windows. This video can not be played Watch: One woman who left the Azovstal steelworks earlier this week said she did not see any sunlight for two months Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine 10 weeks ago but has not yet gained full control over any of Ukraine's major cities. In other developments: The US provided intelligence that helped Ukraine sink the Russian warship Moskva, multiple US media outlets report. Officials said Ukraine had asked the US about a ship in the Black Sea. The US identified it as the Moskva and helped confirm its location. Ukraine then targeted the ship Israel says Mr Putin has apologisedafter his foreign minister said that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler had ""Jewish blood"". Russia's account of the conversation did not mention an apology. Sergei Lavrov made the initial comments to try to justify Russia's portrayal of Ukraine as ""Nazi"" despite the fact that its president is Jewish A key ally of Russia, authoritarian Belarusian leaderAlexander Lukashenko, has indicated that the war in Ukraine has not gone to plan.

"Troops at a Mariupol steelworks insist they will never surrender to the Russian forces surrounding them In an extraordinary news conference, members of the Azov regiment heavily criticise Ukraine's government over their plight Russia has besieged the area for weeks, demanding the surrender of its defenders from the Azov battalion More than 60 people are now feared dead after a Russian bomb hit a school in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, the local governor says Nations across Europe are marking VE Day - the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two Against the backdrop of war, Russia is also preparing for huge celebrations on Monday of Nazism's defeat Ukraine's president is holding talks with G7 leaders - including US President Joe Biden and the UK's Boris Johnson - via video conference EU ambassadors are also meeting in Brussels on Sunday to discuss the sixth round of economic sanctions against Moscow Edited by Siobhan Toman First lady Jill Biden met with her Ukrainian counterpart at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod We're about to pause this coverage for the day. Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor There was a time in Northern Ireland when Sinn FÃ©in voices were silenced. Banned from the airwaves by the government to combat IRA propaganda. The BBC even employed an actor to voice the words of the then Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams. But this weekend Sinn FÃ©in voices were in high demand as broadcasters scrambled to get them on air. They all wanted to hear from the one-time political pariahs who are now the political powerbrokers at Stormont. And pose the question: Does its victory push Northern Ireland closer to a border poll and possibly Irish unity? Read more here. Conservative MP Julian Smith says: The former secretary of state for Northern Ireland has tweeted his congratulations to the three main party leaders, saying they have exceeded expectations ""in different ways"". He addressed Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Alliance's Naomi Long, saying that the people of Northern Ireland ""have spoken"".

"Sinn FÃ©in, led by Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald, want Northern Ireland to leave the UK and reunite with the Republic of Ireland Sinn FÃ©in will be the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time, pushing the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) into second place. Sinn FÃ©in has 27 seats, compared to the DUP's 25. The result means Michelle O'Neill will be entitled to become first minister - unprecedented for a nationalist. Earlier, Ms O'Neill said it had been an election of ""real change"" and a ""defining moment for our politics and for our people"". ""Today ushers in a new era which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality and on the basis of social justice,"" she continued. This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has described her party's performance as a ""defining moment"" ""My commitment is to work through partnership, not division,"" Ms O'Neill said after she was elected in Mid Ulster. ""We will work with those who serve all other political perspectives, we will show respect and we expect to be shown respect."" A unionist party has had the most seats at Stormont since Northern Ireland was formed in 1921. The cross-community Alliance Party has returned 17 MLAs, more than doubling its previous number in 2017. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost one MLA to return with nine, while the SDLP's seats fell from 12 to eight. Counting in the Foyle constituency continued into a third day, with the DUP's Gary Middleton the last assembly member elected in the early hours of Sunday. Thirty-two of the MLAs elected are women, compared with 27 who were returned in the last election. The Alliance Party gained a seat in Belfast South, with Kate Nicholl (left) and Paula Bradshaw (right) elected Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he would meet with the party leaders over the coming days with the aim of restoring the Stormont institutions ""at the earliest possible moment"". ""I encourage the parties to form an executive as soon as possible. The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government that delivers on the issues that matter most to them,"" he said. In February, the executive collapsed when DUP assembly member Paul Givanresigned as first minister. As the first and deputy first minister roles are part of a joint office, the move also removed Michelle O'Neill from her position. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said a new power-sharing executive was ""vital for progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland"". ""It is now incumbent on all political parties and elected representatives to deliver on their mandate, through the nomination of a first and deputy first minister and the formation of a new executive to serve the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland."" The US State Department called for the parties ""to take the necessary steps to re-establish a power-sharing executive"". ""Critical and immediate challenges concerning the economy, health, and education are best addressed through the collective efforts of a devolved government chosen by, and accountable to, its people,"" said Ned Price. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he has not decided whether the party will nominate a deputy first minister Although Sinn FÃ©in can now nominate a first minister, they cannot take up the office unless the DUP, the biggest party from the unionist bloc, agrees to nominate a deputy first minister. Its leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has not yet made a decision on whether the party will do that. On Saturday, the DUP leader said his party would respect the result of the election, however, there needed to be changes made to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is an element of the UK's Brexit agreement with the European Union which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. Some unionists have said the protocol created a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The ultimate goal of Sinn FÃ©in is for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and become one country with the Republic of Ireland. But a victory for Sinn FÃ©in in this election does not mean a vote on Irish reunification - also known as a border poll - would be imminent. TheNorthern Ireland Act 1998,external- which followed the signing of the Good Friday Agreement - stated that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and ""shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll"". It also stated that the Northern Ireland Secretary would agree to hold a poll if it appeared likely that a majority of people wanted a united Ireland. Successive opinion polls suggest that is not yet the case, with the most recent, published in April, putting support at about a third. On Saturday, when asked about the prospect of a border poll, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary-Lou McDonald said unionists should not be ""scared"". ""The future is bright for all of us,"" she added. While Sinn FÃ©in was reluctant to promote its border poll ambitions during the election campaign, expect it to be back on the agenda now. But the party said it will be a decade-long plan at least which will only come after an island-wide conversation. The decision to hold a border poll is for the Northern Ireland secretary of state, when he or she feels there is more of an appetite for Irish unity. But you may now find talk of a border poll will slowly fade if a power-sharing executive returns and no votes are on the line. Read more from Enda on Sinn FÃ©in's journey from political pariahs to Stormont power brokershere. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said she was ""hugely proud"" of what the party had achieved. ""I'm also hugely blessed to be leading a party of the calibre of Alliance with people who are so dedicated, so committed and so selfless in their service,"" she said. UUP leader Doug Beattie, speaking after he was elected in Upper Bann, said he had no plans to change course after his party failed to grow its support. ""I will continue to promote positive, confident, optimistic unionism,"" he explained. After Sinn FÃ©in's result was confirmed, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated the party on a ""historic vote"". Allow Twitter content?

She tweeted that she hoped to see Northern Ireland's government ""functioning again soon"". From IRA politics to NI's biggest party The election in maps and charts Despite seeing a surge in vote share, the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) returned one MLA, its leader Jim Allister. Gerry Carroll, of People Before Profit, was elected in Belfast West, while independents were elected in East Londonderry and North Down. SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon, the party's representative on the executive as infrastructure minister, lost her seat in North Belfast. Ms Mallon's party leader, Colum Eastwood, said there was nothing ""fair"" about her result and she would be a ""huge loss for us, but a bigger loss for the people of north Belfast"". There were other high profile casualties, including Roy Beggs of the UUP and former Education Minister Peter Weir, of the DUP, who were members of the first assembly in 1998. The DUP's Mervyn Storey, another former minister, failed to be elected along with the SDLP policing board member Dolores Kelly. The Green Party lost its two MLAs, including leader Clare Bailey.

"This video can not be played Douglas Ross blames Partygate for Tory losses Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has blamed Partygate for losing councillors across Scotland. But he refused to call for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's resignation, saying the situation in Ukraine called for stability in the UK government. Mr Ross, who was at his local count in Moray, said the result in the council election was ""very disappointing"". ""From people I've spoken to it's very clear, Partygate was the dominating issue here,"" he said. ""Where we could get the focus on local issues like here in Moray, people have responded to that. ""But where there have been national issues that dominated, Partygate has struck through and we have suffered as a result of that."" As it happened: Coverage of the Scottish council elections SNP finishes as biggest party in council elections He also dismissed suggestions that his leadership was to blame, pointing to similarresults in London, and said he would stay in his position. Mr Ross said: ""I'm deeply disappointed, I'm sorry for every one of our excellent candidates that didn't get over the line, our outstanding councillors that weren't re-elected. But we've got to look at the national picture and see this is not just a reflection here in Scotland but across the United Kingdom."" Previously Douglas Ross had called for the prime minister's resignation amid the row over Downing Street parties during lockdown, buthe withdrew the call over the war in Ukraine. As the council election results came in on Friday, Mr Ross declined to call for Mr Johnson's resignation again but said the public had sent a very clear message ""that they are not happy with the prime minister, they are not happy with Partygate"". ""We as a party across the UK have to look at that. I'm sure the prime minister will look at the results but I'm sure we have to do everything possible to support the people in Ukraine."" The party did see success in Moray, gaining three seats to overtake the SNP - who had been running the council as a minority administration since 2019 - as the largest party. There, the Tories now have 11 seats, with the SNP down one to eight. And the island of Arran returned a Conservative councillor - the Tory support having surged and SNP support tumbling. BBC Scotland's political editor, Glenn Campbell, said this perhaps reflected local concern over ferry services. Douglas Ross refused to call for Boris Johnson's resignation again The Tories appeared to have suffered bigger losses in Scotland than the party did in England's local elections. The Scottish party lost 63 seats, with their share of the vote falling by more than 10% in several wards. So far in England,the Tories have lost hundreds of council seats. PM admits Tories faced tough night in local elections Tories lose hundreds of seats in England as Lib Dems make big gains They had been braced for big losses in England, as they faced attacks over the rising cost of living and the ongoing Partygate scandal - including the prime minister'sfine for breaking lockdown rules. Boris Johnson conceded the Tories had had a ""tough"" time in some areas - but argued results had been mixed overall. He added that he took personal responsibility for the results, which showed the need for his party to renew its focus on helping people with rising living costs. In the Scottish elections, the SNP and Labour made gains. The SNP was the biggest party overall, gaining 22 seats on 2017. They also secured anoverall majority in Dundee, whileLabour won control of West Dunbartonshire. Labour - which finished third behind the SNP and Conservatives in 2017 - picked up 20 seats and overtook the Tories in the battle for second place. The Scottish Greens picked up 16 seats, and also won their first ever seat in the Scottish Borders. And Green candidate Holly Bruce finished first in the ward of the SNP's Susan Aitken, who was the Glasgow City Council leader (who was still elected after finishing with the second-highest number of first preference votes). The Liberal Democrats also did better than expected, winning an additional 20 seats across the country, but Alex Salmond's Alba Party failed to have any of its candidates elected.

You can catch up with that later on BBC Sounds as well. That's all from us, goodnight.  On the 13th count Gary Middleton of the DUP has been re-elected in Foyle. It brings to an end more than two days of counting. Mr Middleton has served as a junior minister in the executive and was first elected for Foyle in 2016, having been co-opted the year before.

2022 poll are women. Thirty-two of the 90 MLAs are female, compared with 27 who
were elected in 2017. The previous year, when 108 MLAs were returned to the
assembly, 30 women were elected. The system in Northern Ireland means that there are no by-elections for councils, instead if someone resigns their party can co-opt a replacement. Anyone elected as an MLA must resign from council, so there are plenty of changes coming. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor There was a time in Northern Ireland when Sinn FÃ©in voices were silenced. Banned from the airwaves by the government to combat IRA propaganda. The BBC even employed an actor to voice the words of the then Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams. But this weekend Sinn FÃ©in voices were in high demand as broadcasters scrambled to get them on air. They all wanted to hear from the one-time political pariahs who are now the political powerbrokers at Stormont. And pose the question: Does its victory push Northern Ireland closer to a border poll and possibly Irish unity? Read more here.

"Troops at a Mariupol steelworks insist they will never surrender to the Russian forces surrounding them In an extraordinary news conference, members of the Azov regiment heavily criticise Ukraine's government over their plight Russia has besieged the area for weeks, demanding the surrender of its defenders from the Azov battalion More than 60 people are now feared dead after a Russian bomb hit a school in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, the local governor says Nations across Europe are marking VE Day - the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two Against the backdrop of war, Russia is also preparing for huge celebrations on Monday of Nazism's defeat Ukraine's president is holding talks with G7 leaders - including US President Joe Biden and the UK's Boris Johnson - via video conference EU ambassadors are also meeting in Brussels on Sunday to discuss the sixth round of economic sanctions against Moscow Edited by Siobhan Toman First lady Jill Biden met with her Ukrainian counterpart at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod We're about to pause this coverage for the day. Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

"The Taliban say many women around the country obey their dress code At the Lycee Mariam market in Kabul, known for its long row of stalls selling women's clothing, news of theTaliban's latest decree that women must wear a face veilhad not yet filtered down by the afternoon. Some of those browsing the shops wore the all-encompassing blue burka that the Taliban enforced during their first stint in power in the 1990s.  Others, however, had scarves covering their hair, but their faces uncovered. ""Even when you go on pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia you don't have to cover your face,"" one pointed out. ""Humans are born free, no-one has the right to talk about women's clothes,"" said Fatima, a fashionably dressed university student with sunglasses perched on her head. Afghanistan is a deeply conservative country, and many women do wear the burka, but in bigger cities it's also common to see women wearing the simple headscarf. After taking power last August, the Taliban had held off issuing new laws on what women should wear - until Saturday. At a press conference, the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue announced that all women would have to cover their face in public, and laid out an escalating set of punishments for anyone refusing to comply. Taliban to force Afghan women to wear face veil The punishment starts with a woman's male guardian (normally father, brother or husband) being visited at home by Taliban officials. Then, if a woman's appearance was still not deemed acceptable, her male relative would be summoned to see ministry officials, and after that he could even potentially be jailed for three days or sent to court. Akif Muhajir, spokesman for the ministry, told the BBC the order was based on the Quran and the life of the Prophet Muhammad. Other Muslims dispute the interpretation, but Akif Muhajir described the face covering as a ""compulsory"" part of the religion. Only 1% of Afghan women, he insisted, were not already complying with the group's understanding of how they should dress. ""This is not only the order of the Islamic Emirate,"" he added, ""but the order of Allah."" Most Muslims around the world do not consider covering the face to be a mandatory part of the religion, and, after seizing control of the country, the Taliban initially appeared to be adopting a more flexible attitude to governance. In recent weeks, however, they have been introducing more hardline measures, many of them governing women's everyday lives - for example, assigning separate days for them to visit public parks to men, and barring them from undertaking longer distance journeys without a male guardian. Teenage girls have still not been allowed back to school in most of the country, and whilst women are working in some sectors such as healthcare and education, many others have been told not to return to their offices. Girls' tears over chaotic Taliban schools U-turn 'I felt anxious going back to university' Western diplomats have indicated that resuming development funding for the country - currently struggling with a dire economic crisis - is contingent on the Taliban's treatment of women. When announcing this latest decree at the press conference, however, one cleric said the Taliban could never be pressured by the West into compromising on their beliefs. This video can not be played Women in Afghanistan face an uncertain future following the Taliban's takeover For Afghan women's rights activists, who have spent years struggling to make fragile progress in the country, it seems as if two decades of achievements are being rolled back. Mahbouba Seraj is one of Afghanistan's most prominent campaigners. ""We have a million other problems. Women are not a problem!"" she told the BBC indignantly at her home in Kabul. ""Schools need to be opened, work needs to be given to families. There is famine all over this country. There are suicide bombings."" But, she added, despondently, ""instead of looking after that, they are always after women"".

"Counting has finished with all 90 seats filled Sinn FÃ©in has won 27 seats to become the largest party and will be entitled to nominate a first minister - a first for a nationalist party A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the parliament, since NI's formation in 1921 The Democratic Unionist Party has held the post since 2007, but its vote share has dropped and it lost three seats, down to 25 Sinn FÃ©in wants Northern Ireland to leave the UK and unite with the Republic of Ireland But a Sinn FÃ©in win does not automatically mean a referendum - also known as a border poll - is imminent The cross-community Alliance party has made big gains, winning 17 seats up from eight last time Emma Canavan, Michael Sheils McNamee, Flora Drury, Jennifer Scott, Paul Lawlor and Luke Sproule It's the end of the road for counting On what is now a third day of counting we have finally had all 90 candidates elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It's been a momentous election, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the largest number of seats for the first time, returning 27 candidates, the same number as the last assembly election. The DUP slipped into second place with 25, but the big gains were for Alliance, which won 17 seats - more than double the eight it won in 2017. The UUP dropped by one seat to nine, the SDLP lost four to drop to eight. TUV and People Before Profit each had one candidate elected. Two independent unionists were also elected, while the Green Party lost both its seats. What happens next is not clear. Sinn FÃ©in can nominate a first minister to lead the Northern Ireland Executive, but as it's a joint office a first minister can not exist without a deputy first minister. The DUP can nominate a deputy first minister, but party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has already said he will not nominate any ministers without changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. There will be more reaction on BBC One Northern Ireland and iPlayer from 10am with Sunday Politics, and from the same time on BBC Radio Ulster there will be an election special. You can catch up with that later on BBC Sounds as well. That's all from us, goodnight.  On the 13th count Gary Middleton of the DUP has been re-elected in Foyle. It brings to an end more than two days of counting. Mr Middleton has served as a junior minister in the executive and was first elected for Foyle in 2016, having been co-opted the year before.

2022 poll are women. Thirty-two of the 90 MLAs are female, compared with 27 who
were elected in 2017. The previous year, when 108 MLAs were returned to the
assembly, 30 women were elected. The system in Northern Ireland means that there are no by-elections for councils, instead if someone resigns their party can co-opt a replacement. Anyone elected as an MLA must resign from council, so there are plenty of changes coming. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

We are inching closer to the final results in Northern Ireland's election. And while we don't know the outcomes yet, we can already see how people voted when it came to their first preference: The map shows how Sinn FÃ©in has consolidated its vote, particularly in western areas of Northern Ireland, and also how the Alliance's vote has grown in areas around Belfast. Because of Northern Ireland's single transferable vote system, these maps only show a tiny proportion of the picture.

Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor There was a time in Northern Ireland when Sinn FÃ©in voices were silenced. Banned from the airwaves by the government to combat IRA propaganda. The BBC even employed an actor to voice the words of the then Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams. But this weekend Sinn FÃ©in voices were in high demand as broadcasters scrambled to get them on air. They all wanted to hear from the one-time political pariahs who are now the political powerbrokers at Stormont.

"Todd Boehly owns a stake in three sports teams in Los Angeles Chelsea have agreed terms on the Â£4.25bn ($5.2bn) sale of the club to a consortium led by Todd Boehly, co-owner of the LA Dodgers baseball team. The club wasput up for salebefore owner Roman Abramovich wassanctionedfor his alleged links to Russian president Vladimir Putin following the invasion of Ukraine. A Chelsea statement said the new owners will pay Â£2.5bn for the club's shares. The proceeds will go into a frozen bank account to be donated to charity. The key names behind the consortium buying Chelsea The consortium is led by Boehly but Clearlake Capital, a Californian private equity firm, would own a majority of the shares in Chelsea. Other investors include US billionaire Mark Walter, also a co-owner of the LA Dodgers, and Swiss billionaire Hansjoerg Wyss. BBC Sport has learned the new owners have agreed to not sell a majority stake in the club until 2032 and have given assurances over dividends and debt. The consortium said it will provide Â£1.75bn to invest in the Premier League club, including ""investments in Stamford Bridge, the academy, the women's team and Kingsmeadow and continued funding for the Chelsea Foundation"". In the statement,,externalChelsea said the sale was expected to complete in late May. The takeover will require approval from the English football authorities and the UK government. Chelsea are operating under a special licence from the UK government which ends on 31 May, but last month, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the club were on ""borrowed time"" to complete the sale. Any sale can only be signed off by the bidder passing the Premier League's owners' and directors' test. Todd Boehly was pictured with Chelsea fans outside Stamford Bridge on Friday. Also in the photo is former Chancellor George Osborne, whose firm has signed onto the Boehly bid in an advisory capacity. Boehly, an American investor and businessman, has a reported net worth of $4.5bn (Â£3.6bn), according to Forbes. He is a part owner of the Dodgers - a US baseball franchise - and US women's basketball outfit the Los Angeles Sparks, and owns a stake in the renowned LA Lakers NBA franchise. His consortium also includes American PR executive Barbara Charone, British businessman Jonathan Goldstein and British journalist Daniel Finkelstein. Other consortiums who had been in the running to buy Chelsea have been headed by Sir Martin Broughton and the co-owner of the Boston Celtics, Stephen Pagliuca, but they were told in late April that their bids were unsuccessful. British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe - majority shareholder of chemical group Ineos - made a late offer, but it arrived on 29 April, several weeks beyond the initial deadline for bids of 18 March. Ratcliffe's bid was dismissed but he said on 4 May that he was""not giving up"". On Thursday, Abramovich said he hasnot asked for his Â£1.5bn loan to Chelsea to be repaidwhen the club is sold. A spokesperson said Abramovich ""remains committed"" to making sure the proceeds from the sale ""go to good causes"". BBC sports editor Dan Roan This is the most significant moment yet since Chelsea was put up for sale, with the Boehly consortium now confident of completing what would be one of the most expensive deals in sports history. Premier League approval is not expected to be an issue, and the government is keen to get the sale completed. With concerns raised by rival bidder British billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe over the leading role played by private equity firm Clearlake Capital in the Boehly consortium, I understand the club have received an assurance that the group will commit to owning the club for at least 10 years. In another move designed to reassure fans and distinguish them from the Glazers - the US family that owns Manchester United - I am told the new owners will not pay themselves dividends or management fees during that period.

"Counting has finished with all 90 seats filled Sinn FÃ©in has won 27 seats to become the largest party and will be entitled to nominate a first minister - a first for a nationalist party A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the parliament, since NI's formation in 1921 The Democratic Unionist Party has held the post since 2007, but its vote share has dropped and it lost three seats, down to 25 Sinn FÃ©in wants Northern Ireland to leave the UK and unite with the Republic of Ireland But a Sinn FÃ©in win does not automatically mean a referendum - also known as a border poll - is imminent The cross-community Alliance party has made big gains, winning 17 seats up from eight last time Emma Canavan, Michael Sheils McNamee, Flora Drury, Jennifer Scott, Paul Lawlor and Luke Sproule It's the end of the road for counting On what is now a third day of counting we have finally had all 90 candidates elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It's been a momentous election, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the largest number of seats for the first time, returning 27 candidates, the same number as the last assembly election. The DUP slipped into second place with 25, but the big gains were for Alliance, which won 17 seats - more than double the eight it won in 2017. The UUP dropped by one seat to nine, the SDLP lost four to drop to eight. TUV and People Before Profit each had one candidate elected. Two independent unionists were also elected, while the Green Party lost both its seats. What happens next is not clear. Sinn FÃ©in can nominate a first minister to lead the Northern Ireland Executive, but as it's a joint office a first minister can not exist without a deputy first minister. The DUP can nominate a deputy first minister, but party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has already said he will not nominate any ministers without changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. There will be more reaction on BBC One Northern Ireland and iPlayer from 10am with Sunday Politics, and from the same time on BBC Radio Ulster there will be an election special.

"Sinn FÃ©in, led by Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald, want Northern Ireland to leave the UK and reunite with the Republic of Ireland Sinn FÃ©in will be the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time, pushing the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) into second place. Sinn FÃ©in has 27 seats, compared to the DUP's 25. The result means Michelle O'Neill will be entitled to become first minister - unprecedented for a nationalist. Earlier, Ms O'Neill said it had been an election of ""real change"" and a ""defining moment for our politics and for our people"". ""Today ushers in a new era which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality and on the basis of social justice,"" she continued. This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has described her party's performance as a ""defining moment"" ""My commitment is to work through partnership, not division,"" Ms O'Neill said after she was elected in Mid Ulster. ""We will work with those who serve all other political perspectives, we will show respect and we expect to be shown respect."" A unionist party has had the most seats at Stormont since Northern Ireland was formed in 1921. The cross-community Alliance Party has returned 17 MLAs, more than doubling its previous number in 2017. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost one MLA to return with nine, while the SDLP's seats fell from 12 to eight. Counting in the Foyle constituency continued into a third day, with the DUP's Gary Middleton the last assembly member elected in the early hours of Sunday. Thirty-two of the MLAs elected are women, compared with 27 who were returned in the last election. The Alliance Party gained a seat in Belfast South, with Kate Nicholl (left) and Paula Bradshaw (right) elected Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he would meet with the party leaders over the coming days with the aim of restoring the Stormont institutions ""at the earliest possible moment"". ""I encourage the parties to form an executive as soon as possible. The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government that delivers on the issues that matter most to them,"" he said. In February, the executive collapsed when DUP assembly member Paul Givanresigned as first minister. As the first and deputy first minister roles are part of a joint office, the move also removed Michelle O'Neill from her position. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said a new power-sharing executive was ""vital for progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland"". ""It is now incumbent on all political parties and elected representatives to deliver on their mandate, through the nomination of a first and deputy first minister and the formation of a new executive to serve the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland."" The US State Department called for the parties ""to take the necessary steps to re-establish a power-sharing executive"". ""Critical and immediate challenges concerning the economy, health, and education are best addressed through the collective efforts of a devolved government chosen by, and accountable to, its people,"" said Ned Price. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he has not decided whether the party will nominate a deputy first minister Although Sinn FÃ©in can now nominate a first minister, they cannot take up the office unless the DUP, the biggest party from the unionist bloc, agrees to nominate a deputy first minister. Its leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has not yet made a decision on whether the party will do that. On Saturday, the DUP leader said his party would respect the result of the election, however, there needed to be changes made to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is an element of the UK's Brexit agreement with the European Union which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. Some unionists have said the protocol created a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The ultimate goal of Sinn FÃ©in is for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and become one country with the Republic of Ireland. But a victory for Sinn FÃ©in in this election does not mean a vote on Irish reunification - also known as a border poll - would be imminent. TheNorthern Ireland Act 1998,external- which followed the signing of the Good Friday Agreement - stated that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and ""shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll"". It also stated that the Northern Ireland Secretary would agree to hold a poll if it appeared likely that a majority of people wanted a united Ireland. Successive opinion polls suggest that is not yet the case, with the most recent, published in April, putting support at about a third. On Saturday, when asked about the prospect of a border poll, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary-Lou McDonald said unionists should not be ""scared"". ""The future is bright for all of us,"" she added. While Sinn FÃ©in was reluctant to promote its border poll ambitions during the election campaign, expect it to be back on the agenda now. But the party said it will be a decade-long plan at least which will only come after an island-wide conversation. The decision to hold a border poll is for the Northern Ireland secretary of state, when he or she feels there is more of an appetite for Irish unity. But you may now find talk of a border poll will slowly fade if a power-sharing executive returns and no votes are on the line.

"Sinn FÃ©in, led by Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald, want Northern Ireland to leave the UK and reunite with the Republic of Ireland Sinn FÃ©in will be the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time, pushing the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) into second place. Sinn FÃ©in has 27 seats, compared to the DUP's 25. The result means Michelle O'Neill will be entitled to become first minister - unprecedented for a nationalist. Earlier, Ms O'Neill said it had been an election of ""real change"" and a ""defining moment for our politics and for our people"". ""Today ushers in a new era which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality and on the basis of social justice,"" she continued. This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has described her party's performance as a ""defining moment"" ""My commitment is to work through partnership, not division,"" Ms O'Neill said after she was elected in Mid Ulster. ""We will work with those who serve all other political perspectives, we will show respect and we expect to be shown respect."" A unionist party has had the most seats at Stormont since Northern Ireland was formed in 1921. The cross-community Alliance Party has returned 17 MLAs, more than doubling its previous number in 2017. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost one MLA to return with nine, while the SDLP's seats fell from 12 to eight. Counting in the Foyle constituency continued into a third day, with the DUP's Gary Middleton the last assembly member elected in the early hours of Sunday. Thirty-two of the MLAs elected are women, compared with 27 who were returned in the last election. The Alliance Party gained a seat in Belfast South, with Kate Nicholl (left) and Paula Bradshaw (right) elected Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he would meet with the party leaders over the coming days with the aim of restoring the Stormont institutions ""at the earliest possible moment"". ""I encourage the parties to form an executive as soon as possible. The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government that delivers on the issues that matter most to them,"" he said. In February, the executive collapsed when DUP assembly member Paul Givanresigned as first minister. As the first and deputy first minister roles are part of a joint office, the move also removed Michelle O'Neill from her position. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said a new power-sharing executive was ""vital for progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland"". ""It is now incumbent on all political parties and elected representatives to deliver on their mandate, through the nomination of a first and deputy first minister and the formation of a new executive to serve the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland."" The US State Department called for the parties ""to take the necessary steps to re-establish a power-sharing executive"". ""Critical and immediate challenges concerning the economy, health, and education are best addressed through the collective efforts of a devolved government chosen by, and accountable to, its people,"" said Ned Price. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he has not decided whether the party will nominate a deputy first minister Although Sinn FÃ©in can now nominate a first minister, they cannot take up the office unless the DUP, the biggest party from the unionist bloc, agrees to nominate a deputy first minister.

"A resurgence in cases of people unable to cover their debt repayments is expected, a charity has warned, as the cost of living hits family budgets. Debt advisers are urging people who are struggling with existing debts to come to fresh arrangements on how much to repay each month. Doing so made the basics affordable again, one dad told the BBC. Prices are rising at the fastest rate for 30 years, creating fresh strain on people's finances. Many thousands of people are on debt management plans (DMPs), often when they owe money to a host of companies which they cannot afford to repay under the original agreement. Creditors are offered a lower, but regular, payment which is made each month. This is designed to fend off the likelihood of a default and, in return, lenders tend to freeze interest or any further charges. Prices, as measured by inflation, are currently rising at a rapid rate - the fastest since 1992. This means some people who were previously keeping to their DMP repayments are now finding it a lot more difficult. Rising domestic gas and electricity bills, and accelerating price rises, are likely to add to the strain. Sue Anderson, from debt charity StepChange, which negotiates DMPs, said: ""Through the Covid pandemic we saw an increase in the number of clients who were temporarily unable to continue to meet their planned payments on managed debt solutions, and now it looks as if we are going to see a resurgence of this as a result of dramatic increases in the cost of living."" Among the charity's clients, nearly twice as many said in March that the rising cost of living was a key reason for getting into debt compared with six months earlier. It was the third most likely reason given, behind a lack of control over finances and unemployment or redundancy. Andy is on a repayment plan and is urging others to seek help When Andy Barwell spoke to BBC News in December, the father-of-two saidurged others to learn from his examplethat you cannot ""live a champagne life on a lemonade budget"". Debts had taken him to the brink, but he had got his life back on track. Now, six months later, he said even he needed to act as energy bills and rent had become more expensive. ""Everything just seems to be a bit tighter now. For now, all treats have had to stop, not that there was many before. ""I have contacted [Stepchange] and amended my repayments to something more affordable. Granted, this means my debt will take longer to pay off but at least I can still afford the basics and also know that my debts are being paid too, and that no interest or added costs are piling back up on top."" Sara Williams, who writes the Debt Camel blog -which has covered this issue,external, said that signs of difficulty needed to be addressed early. She said the prospect of further price rises meant that anyone finding it hard now should ask how they would get through the next three months or more. Among the tell-tale signs, she said, was when people reached for a credit card as the only way to pay for fuel in the car. ""If you are struggling now, then ask for a reduction, but be realistic,"" she said. She added that creditors would not want requests to be commonplace, and borrowers could always increase repayments when the situation improved.

"Jason Perry thanked his family and his late mother in his acceptance speech Croydon's Conservatives have bucked the trend in London by winning the borough's first mayoralty. The directly elected mayor replaces the former cabinet system, where councillors selected their own leader from within their ranks. Fewer than 600 votes separated Conservative Jason Perry and Labour candidate Val Shawcross. The win could lead to London's first council power-split, as Mr Perry may have to work with a Labour majority. The results of the full council election are expected on Sunday. In his acceptance speech Mr Perry paid a tearful tribute to his mother who died during the campaign. The count was supposed to finish by 21:00 BST Friday but went on until nearly 05:00 on Saturday It had been an unexpectedly long and gruelling count and dawn had broken by the time the final result was declared, following a run-off between Conservative and Labour candidates and then a final recount. In a close contest, Labour's Val Shawcross picked up 6,617 second preferences, giving her a total of 38,023. Mr Perry won 5,199 second preference votes in the run-off, but started with more first preference votes and ended with a combined tally of 38,612  votes. He had to turn his back to the crowd on the stage to compose himself as he waited for the final declaration and became tearful during his acceptance speech, where he thanked his late mother for her support during the campaign. As he left the stage, he shared an emotional embrace with his wife, Melanie, and son William, who also shed a tear as he congratulated his father and told him ""she would be so proud"". A family embrace between new Mayor of Croydon Jason Perry, his son William and wife Melanie Speaking to BBC London afterwards, William said: ""It's a bit hard to put into words because my nan didn't make it but she was with my dad at his first count in 1994 and she's here today, looking down."" Croydon's new mayor said he was ""very emotional, very excited and very much looking forward to getting to work"" once the borough's new councillors were elected in a postponed count later on Saturday. ""It means a great deal,"" he said. ""Croydon has been in a bad place and now it's time for us to come together and move forwards. ""The finances I'm sure played a part. I really want to try and make it positive now, move on and get better. ""Obviously in London we have had a couple of difficult results but this will be a shining light, I hope, and we can show people how it's done becausewe bucked the trend.We're here to deliver."" Mr Perry also lent his support to Boris Johnson, despite his party losing councils including Westminster, Wandsworth and Barnet. ""I believe he is still the leader to lead us,"" he said.

"A woman who was secretly filmed getting undressed and using the shower by a man who preyed on nearly 170 victims says she is still waiting for justice. John Wood concealed cameras to film women in a number of locations, including in the swimming pool changing rooms at a Butlins holiday resort. The 44-year-old went on to hack into home security software to capture couples having sex in their own homes. Over six years he saved more than 1,400 videos which he used for his own sexual gratification. Wood was handed a two-year suspended jail sentence for his crimes. Here one woman, who wished to remain anonymous, opens up about how the experience has affected her. When I found out what had happened to me, I felt sick to my stomach. I remember I couldn't stop shaking. I felt completely violated, embarrassed and angry. He had set up cameras to record me in my most vulnerable moments - the things you do by yourself. Undressing. Using the shower, the toilet. He had taken something from me that I had not consented to. He had invaded my space. His crimes were intentional, premeditated and committed over many years, with many more victims. I didn't sleep the night after he was sentenced. I wanted to hear it directly from the police. They called me the day after. He got a two year sentence, suspended for two years. I cried on the phone, so upset and disgusted. I felt like I had been physically hit. I was so angry, so confused. In my heart of hearts I fully expected him to receive a custodial sentence. But he didn't. He walked away. I asked if I could appeal. After waiting so long for this case to get to court, after all my frustration, irritation, embarrassment, not knowing if these images were shared. Surely there was a way to appeal? The police later said I wasn't able to appeal because the sentencing for these types of crimes are only two years maximum. Within a couple of weeks of the case's conclusion, I had a mental breakdown. I couldn't contain my anger any more. The next day I sought medical help. I was prescribed anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs and will probably remain on them for the foreseeable future. Woods's offending first came to light during a regional organised crime unit investigation Wood was sentenced in October 2020 after admitting six charges of voyeurism and two counts under the Computer Misuse Act. The extent of his offending came to the attention of a regional organised crime unit during a joint investigation with the FBI. They were looking into the software LuminosityLink which allowed users to activate cameras and microphones to secretly observe people in their own homes. Wood was one of 167 people in the UK who bought the software and one of 8,500 across the world. Although police found no evidence he ever used it, he was now on their radar, and when officers analysed his computers they found hundreds of secret videos taken between 2011 and 2018. Det Sgt Jonathan Atkin, lead officer on the case, said: ""Prior to that point we didn't know what other offending he had committed. ""The only reason we identified what other offending he committed was because we seized every digital device from his property."" The videos recovered showed Wood had ""a massive, avid interest in voyeurism"", Det Sgt Atkin said. He had filmed more than 300 videos, setting up cameras to film women from the windows of his home. Then in 2012, while on holiday at Butlins in Bognor Regis, he took a camera in a concealed bag into the swimming pool changing rooms, where he filmed women undressing in adjacent cubicles. Wood filmed 77 videos over five days at Butlins. They showed more than 160 victims, none could be identified. Wood used software to monitor several different illicitly-accessed cameras at once But this was just the start of his offending. He went on to hack into people's private webcams and other camera-enabled devices to secretly watch them in their own homes. Wood used software to monitor several different illicitly-accessed cameras at once. A total of 1,400 of these videos were saved on his devices. The majority of the videos showed people having sex, but most [of the victims] have never been identified. ""There's no doubt, from the evidence from his devices, that he hasn't just fallen across this, it is a calculated, premeditated position, where he has an interest in adult females and obtaining whatever sexual gratification he can get from it,"" Det Sgt Atkin said. ""It was an ever growing interest that has then become palpable to the fact where he has then decided, 'well I have done this, what is the next thing I can now gain from it'. ""He's gone from putting cameras in a bag on the beach, with people sunbathing... to then going extreme into filming in leisure facilities and finally hacking into people's computers."" In court, Wood was described by his lawyer as someone who had been diagnosed with autism, hoarding disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. It was argued he was of previous good character and had stayed out of trouble in the three years since he was arrested. Under the terms of his suspended sentence, Wood was ordered to complete a sex offender rehabilitation programme, 30 rehabilitation activity days and 100 hours or unpaid work. He must also abide by a 10 year sexual harm prevention order and sign onto the sex offenders' register. I was so very disappointed. I didn't know where to turn. I felt lost, that my options were over, and that I just had to live with the decision. I was livid. Furious that I couldn't turn to anyone at this point and that what is done is done. I had no say in court, apart from a statement I had given. No control over what the judge had determined to be justified sentencing. He changed his real name by deed poll before he was officially charged so he could protect his privacy. He was able to use his new name and so protect his identity throughout the court case, from being charged to sentencing, giving him the luxury to remain ""unknown"". His victims were never allowed their privacy. I had no choice in having my dignity protected, he took that from me without my consent, for his own sexual gratification. The punishment didn't fit the crime. I still feel very much like it was unduly lenient. How many more people would he have had to have hacked? How many more years would he have had to have offended to spend time in jail? If he did serve time inside prison I think I would've had closure. Instead I am left with something that will always haunt me. Voyeurism is not included within the scope of the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme The Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme, under which people can appeal a sentence, has been expanded six times and includes many serious sexual offences. Most recently, sexual offences involving an abuse of trust, indecent images offences and domestic abuse offences were added, however voyeurism is not currently included within its scope. A spokesperson for the Attorney General's office said: ""For over 30 years, the Unduly Lenient Sentences scheme has helped victims of crime and their loved ones by correcting unduly lenient sentencing. ""The scheme includes many more offences now than it did when it was first launched, allowing the Law Officers to look at more sentences which don't appear to fit the crime."" It is for the Secretary of State for Justice to add further offences to the scheme. The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on whether voyeurism was a crime it would consider adding. The police confirmed Wood had a massive interest in pornography and that the evidence they had was over and above what they needed. So how was this sex offender allowed any leniency? I very much feel the system did let myself and other victims down. Without a shadow of a doubt this type of crime should be able to be appealed. I just want this all to end with a feeling that justice was served. Yes, he had to participate in a program and community service, also he'll be on the Sex Offenders Register, good, but the gravity of his crimes I feel deserved more than just a suspended sentence. It is outrageous that victims of these crimes just have to live with the consequences of the criminals' actions without being heard or seen by the law. I am not just a name, or number, I am a person who has been deeply affected by his malicious, premeditated, sexually driven actions and they will always affect me.

"Counting has finished with all 90 seats filled Sinn FÃ©in has won 27 seats to become the largest party and will be entitled to nominate a first minister - a first for a nationalist party A unionist party has always been the largest in the assembly, and previously the parliament, since NI's formation in 1921 The Democratic Unionist Party has held the post since 2007, but its vote share has dropped and it lost three seats, down to 25 Sinn FÃ©in wants Northern Ireland to leave the UK and unite with the Republic of Ireland But a Sinn FÃ©in win does not automatically mean a referendum - also known as a border poll - is imminent The cross-community Alliance party has made big gains, winning 17 seats up from eight last time Emma Canavan, Michael Sheils McNamee, Flora Drury, Jennifer Scott, Paul Lawlor and Luke Sproule It's the end of the road for counting On what is now a third day of counting we have finally had all 90 candidates elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly. It's been a momentous election, with Sinn FÃ©in winning the largest number of seats for the first time, returning 27 candidates, the same number as the last assembly election. The DUP slipped into second place with 25, but the big gains were for Alliance, which won 17 seats - more than double the eight it won in 2017. The UUP dropped by one seat to nine, the SDLP lost four to drop to eight. TUV and People Before Profit each had one candidate elected. Two independent unionists were also elected, while the Green Party lost both its seats. What happens next is not clear. Sinn FÃ©in can nominate a first minister to lead the Northern Ireland Executive, but as it's a joint office a first minister can not exist without a deputy first minister. The DUP can nominate a deputy first minister, but party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has already said he will not nominate any ministers without changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. There will be more reaction on BBC One Northern Ireland and iPlayer from 10am with Sunday Politics, and from the same time on BBC Radio Ulster there will be an election special. You can catch up with that later on BBC Sounds as well. That's all from us, goodnight.  On the 13th count Gary Middleton of the DUP has been re-elected in Foyle. It brings to an end more than two days of counting. Mr Middleton has served as a junior minister in the executive and was first elected for Foyle in 2016, having been co-opted the year before.

We are inching closer to the final results in Northern Ireland's election. And while we don't know the outcomes yet, we can already see how people voted when it came to their first preference: The map shows how Sinn FÃ©in has consolidated its vote, particularly in western areas of Northern Ireland, and also how the Alliance's vote has grown in areas around Belfast.

Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor There was a time in Northern Ireland when Sinn FÃ©in voices were silenced. Banned from the airwaves by the government to combat IRA propaganda. The BBC even employed an actor to voice the words of the then Sinn FÃ©in President Gerry Adams. But this weekend Sinn FÃ©in voices were in high demand as broadcasters scrambled to get them on air. They all wanted to hear from the one-time political pariahs who are now the political powerbrokers at Stormont. And pose the question: Does its victory push Northern Ireland closer to a border poll and possibly Irish unity? Read more here. Conservative MP Julian Smith says: The former secretary of state for Northern Ireland has tweeted his congratulations to the three main party leaders, saying they have exceeded expectations ""in different ways"". He addressed Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill, the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Alliance's Naomi Long, saying that the people of Northern Ireland ""have spoken"".

"Troops at a Mariupol steelworks insist they will never surrender to the Russian forces surrounding them In an extraordinary news conference, members of the Azov regiment heavily criticise Ukraine's government over their plight Russia has besieged the area for weeks, demanding the surrender of its defenders from the Azov battalion More than 60 people are now feared dead after a Russian bomb hit a school in eastern Ukraine on Saturday, the local governor says Nations across Europe are marking VE Day - the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two Against the backdrop of war, Russia is also preparing for huge celebrations on Monday of Nazism's defeat Ukraine's president is holding talks with G7 leaders - including US President Joe Biden and the UK's Boris Johnson - via video conference EU ambassadors are also meeting in Brussels on Sunday to discuss the sixth round of economic sanctions against Moscow Edited by Siobhan Toman First lady Jill Biden met with her Ukrainian counterpart at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod We're about to pause this coverage for the day. Here's a reminder of the top stories this evening:  Leaders of the world's seven most industrialised economies - the G7 -have just issued a statement,externalfollowing an online meeting attended by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We assured him of our full solidarity and support,"" the leaders said. They added that they would continue efforts to wean themselves off Russian oil supplies and to reinforce sanctions aimed at crippling the ability of the Russian government to continue its aggression against Ukraine. Leaders also pledged to ""continue and elevate our campaign against the financial elites and family members, who support President Putin in his war effort and squander the resources of the Russian people"". Financial sanctions are intended to punish Russia for its unprovoked attack on Ukraine New sanctions against Russia were announced in Washington on Sunday, as President Biden hosted a video call with other G7 leaders and President Zelensky. As a further punishment for its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the US unveiled sanctions against three Russian television
stations, banned Americans from providing accounting and
consulting services to Russians, and sanctioned executives from
Gazprombank. The measures leveled against Gazprombank executives were the
first involving the trading arm of the Russian gas giant. The US and its allies have so far avoided imposing measures against the gas exporter's bank amid fears that it might lead to gas shortages for EU customers. A senior White House official said the move was ""not a full block"" but was intended to signal that Gazprombank ""is not a safe haven"". New export control restrictions were aimed at directly
degrading Putin's war effort, including controls on industrial
engines, motors and fans. In tandem, the EU will also impose additional controls on
chemicals which contribute to the Russian military effort,
the official said. The White House also said the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would suspend licences for exports of special nuclear
material to Russia. President Biden will speak from his home in Delaware,
where he is spending the weekend US President Joe Biden is currently meeting his G7 counterparts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - by video conference - as they consider new measures to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. The White House said the leaders would discuss adding to the
sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Russia since
its 24 February invasion. Washington said the leaders would discuss the latest developments in Russia's war
against Ukraine and its global impact - and how nations could build on sanctions ""to impose severe costs
for Putin's war"". Take a look at the sanctions which have been imposed on Russia so far. This video can not be played WATCH: Russia rehearses World War Two victory parade Many countries across Europe are celebrating Victory Day on Sunday, 8 May. But Russia celebrates the victory over Nazi Germany, 77 years ago, a day later because it was already 9 May in Moscow when Nazi Germany's troops surrendered. Victory Day is an annual event in Russia. Under Vladimir Putin, it has become a show of strength of troops and military hardware, as well as a chance to remember the sacrifices of World War Two. Twenty-seven million Soviet citizens died, by far the greatest loss of any country, in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War. This year, the event has taken on a significance of its own. Far from liberating Europe, Russia has waged months of war against its neighbour Ukraine and is devoid of any real form of military victory that it can celebrate. Read more about the significance of the 9 May, amid the war in Ukraine,here. There was no advance notice of Mr Trudeau's visit to Irpin, just outside Kyiv Canadian Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau has made an unannounced visit to the Ukrainian
town of Irpin, which came under heavy bombardment at the start of the invasion and was temporarily occupied by Russian forces. Writing on Telegram, local mayor Oleksandr Markushyn, said Mr Trudeau came ""to see with his own
eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our
town"". Canada was one of the 12 founding members of Nato in 1949.It has  committed over $118 million in military equipment to support Ukraine,externalsince the beginning of this year, according to the government there. Ukrainian soldiers head for the front on Sunday in Bakhmut, Donetsk region It's been 74 days since Russia invaded Ukraine and the bloodiest conflict to be seen in Europe in decades shows no sign of abating:  US first lady Jill Biden (L) gave Olena Zelenska a bunch of flowers US first lady Jill Biden made a surprise visit to Ukraine during a trip to Romania and Slovakia where she was reaffirming US support for Nato allies. Mrs Biden met Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska at a school in the border town of Uzhhorod which is currently being used as temporary shelter for displaced people. The US first lady said she wanted ""to show that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine"" adding that the war, now it its third month, had been ""brutal"" and had to stop. Mrs Zelenska said it had been a ""courageous act"" to visit Ukraine. ""We
understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war, when
the military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are
happening every day, even today,â she said. She added that the visit, on Motherâs Day, was very symbolic, adding: ""We feel your love and support during such an important day.â Mrs Zelenska has not appeared in public since the Russian invasion began on 24 February. The two women later sat down and played with some of the dozens of children who are currently housed at the school, making tissue
paper bears - the symbol of the local province. Hugo BachegaReporting from Dnipro Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar described intense Russian shelling This was a remarkable news conference, broadcast live online
from a bunker in the partially destroyed Azovstal steelworks, the last pocket
of Ukrainian resistance in the city of Mariupol. First, Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander
of the Azov regiment, said they had been under intense Russian shelling, and that
the invading forces were trying to storm the plant. While hundreds of civilians
had been evacuated in recent days, he said there was a ""multitude of casualties"" across the sprawling complex, both civilian and military. Another fighter, Lt Illia Samoilenko, then spoke for almost
two hours, most of it in English. He started by heavily criticising the
government, without giving details, saying it had let 25,000 people be ""murdered
by the Russian army"" in the city, a figure that cannot be independently verified. ""Nobody expected we would last so long and weâre still lasting,
weâre still holding,"" he said, adding that they had been ""left on their own for
the last eight years"". ""Our government actually failed in the defence of Mariupol.
Failed in the preparation."" Lt Samoilenko said he could not give details about how many
fighters were still holed up in the site but said a ""couple hundred"" had been
wounded. Russia, whose forces are surrounding the plant, says it could agree
with the evacuation of the fighters if they lay down their arms, something
rejected by Lt Samoilenko. ""Surrender for us is unacceptable because we canât grant
such a big gift to the enemy,"" he said. ""We are basically dead men. Most of us know
this. Itâs why we fight so fearlessly."" Police in the German capital Berlin rolled up a giant Ukrainian flag, reading ""They are us"" at the Soviet memorial - a day after the regional senate banned the display of Russian and Ukrainian flags for the events to mark Nazi Germany's surrender on 8 May 1945. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, expressed outrage at the ban, which he said amounted to giving the same treatment to the victim and the aggressor in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The event marks 77 years since the end of World War Two. This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky hits out at Russia's 'evil' invasion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of implementing ""a bloody reconstruction of Nazism"". In a speech commemorating World War Two, he saidthe Russian army was replicating Nazi ""atrocities""during its invasion of his country. ""Darkness has returned to Ukraine and it has become black and white again,"" he said in his video address. ""Evil has returned, in a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose,"" he added. The video also featured archive footage of World War Two and black-and-white footage of Russia's invasion. Mr Zelensky's references to Nazism appear to be an attempt to turn Vladimir Putin's language against him. Russia has justified its offensive in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to ""demilitarise"" and ""de-nazify"" its neighbour. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false âNaziâ claims The Ukrainian leader compares Russia's invasion of his country to wartime Nazi bombings. Bono with Taras Topolia U2 frontman Bono has added his voice to support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion, performing an acoustic set in a hall of the Kyiv metro together with bandmate The Edge. ""The people in Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you are fighting for all of us who love freedom,"" the Irish rock star said during a break, as quoted by AFP news agency. A small audience at Kreshchatik Station heard U2 classics Sunday Bloody Sunday, Desire and With Or Without You. Bono was joined by a Ukrainian singer in military uniform, Taras Topolia of the band Antytila, to sing the old soul standard Stand By Me, but changing the words to Stand By Ukraine. Lt Gen Yakov Rezantsev was reportedly killed in the Kherson region At leastseven Russian generals are believed to have been killed in Ukraine- an extraordinary casualty rate for any army. In its latestintelligence update,external, the UK Ministry of Defence attributes the presence of so many commanders in the field to difficulties in command and control, as well as faltering Russian performance. ""Russian commanders rarely delegate operational authority to their subordinates, who in turn do not gain vital leadership experience,"" the MoD says. ""This has resulted in a force that is slow to respond to setbacks and unable to alter its approach on the battlefield.""    More now from that press conference at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. We're now hearing from Lt Illia Samoilenko, who says ""surrendering is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives"". ""Surrender for us is unacceptable. We can't grant such a big gift to the enemy,"" he says. ""To be captured for me means to be dead."" ""We're fighting against an aggressor, the enemy who brings
terror to Ukraine, against their barbarism,"" he adds. CONTEXT:Civilians now out of Azovstal plant Germany's foreign minister has urged people to stand up for peace, freedom and democracy, on the day much of Europe celebrates VE Day, marking the anniversary of the defeat of Nazi German in World War Two. Ahead of a planned visit to Ukraine, Annalena Baerbock said VE Day reminded Germans never again to be on the wrong side of the struggle for freedom and humanity. Earlier on Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave an
emotional Victory Day speech, saying that ""evil has returned"" to Ukraine, but Russia would not escape responsibility. Russia will celebrate victory in WW2 on Monday, with the annual Victory Day parade in Moscow a centrepiece. President Vladimir Putin sent messages to a number of pro-Russian leaders and their citizens on Sunday, as well the peoples of Georgia and Ukraine. In his message,externalto ""the veterans of theGreat Patriotic War,externaland citizens of Ukraine"", Putin stressed ""the unacceptability of revenge on the part of the ideological followers of those who were defeated"". He said it was the ""common duty"" of Russia, and her allies, ""to prevent the revival of Nazism, which brought so much suffering to the people of different countries"". One of President Putinâs justifications for his invasion of Ukraine is that he wants to - in his words - ""denazify"" the country. WATCH: Putin's false Nazi claims Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar (L) and Lt Illia Samoilenko are speaking from the besieged steelworks That online news conference with fighters in the Azovstal steelworks which we trailed a little earlier has just started. Capt Svyatoslav Kalina Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov regiment at the site in Mariupol, says Russian forces have continued to shell the area, and that they're trying to storm the plant. He said he couldn't confirm whether all civilians had been evacuated from the site as was reported yesterday. Laura BickerBBC News The mayor of Mariupol says Russian President Vladimir Putin is determing who lives, who leaves and who dies in the city. Vadym Boichenko told the BBC that the 100,000 people still living in the besieged port city need a permit to move around - and a separate permit to leave. Mr Boichenko also claims that around 2,000 men are being held in so-called âfiltration centresâ in Bezymenne and Kozatske, and not being allowed to return to their homes unless they are sick or injured. âThey are being used as labour to clear the rubble, collect the dead bodies of those the Russians have killed, and cover up evidence of war crimes,â he says. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Capturing Mariupol - now dominated by Russian forces, aside from the Azovstal steelworks - will allow the Russians to complete a land bridge between Crimea and the Donbas region, as well as giving them full control of more than 80% of Ukraine's Black Sea coastline. But in their quest to do so, they have pummelled Mariupol with artillery, rockets and missiles - damaging or destroying more than 90% of the city. Once a thriving port with a promising future, Mr Boichenko shares a thick booklet of plans compiled last year for Mariupol. It's full of glossy images of parks, pavement cafes, universities and schools. âI worked there for seven years, putting my heart and soul into it, "" he tells the BBC. ""My home is there, my parentsâ home is there. They took everything away from us, â he says.
âMy heart and soul are gone.â President Zelensky says diplomatic efforts are continuing over the evacuation of military personnel from Mariupol's Azovstal steelworks The fighters holed up inside the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol are expected to hold a rare online news conference shortly, in what will likely include a plea for a plan to guarantee their rescue. Ukrainian officials say all women, children and elderly who were sheltering in the site's underground bunkers and shelters have now been evacuated. But with the civilians out, there are fears Russia may step up its attacks on the site. Russia says the fighters, believed to number in the hundreds, must lay down their arms. They reject this, saying they won't surrender. We'll bring you updates from the news conference as it happens. Those expected to speak to journalists include the Commander of the Azov Regiment, Lt Col Denis Radis Prokopenko and his deputy, Cpt Svyatoslav ""Kalina"" Palamar. A Ukrainian MiG jet could be seen flying over Donetsk region on Sunday The bombing of a school where villagers had taken shelter is tragically just one attack among many this weekend as the war in Ukraine shows no sign of relenting. There has been fierce fighting around Popasna in Luhansk in recent days amid a sustained Russian assault.  Local governor Serhiy Haidai said Ukrainian forces had been pulling back and that everything in the town had been destroyed. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said his troops had taken control of most of the town. Meanwhile, Russian-backed separatists in the neighbouring Donetsk region said the city of the same name and another town, Holmivskyi, had come under Ukrainian shelling on Sunday. Both sides earlier talked of inflicting heavy losses on the other. The Ukrainian government reported killing 400 enemy soldiers, knocking out eight tanks and 28 other armoured vehicles, destroying a ship and a helicopter, and downing 27 drones. Russia's military says its air force alone killed around 420 Ukrainian soldiers, putting 55 pieces of military hardware out of action. It also reports destroying a warship with a missile near the port of Odesa, and shooting down two attack planes and a helicopter. The BBC has not independently confirmed these claims. The Ukrainian government has accused Moscow of targeting educational establishments, including schools and colleges, completely destroying more than 20 sites since the Russian invasion began. Presidential advisor Daria Herasymchuk described the invasion as ""a war against children"". Officialstweeted on Sunday,externalthat the Russian invasion has so far killed 225 children and injured 413 - although these figures are likely to be higher, as they do not include casualties in occupied areas or where hostilities are currently ongoing. Ms Herasymchuk said children were suffering the most in the eastern Donbas region, where the government has called for international help to repatriate children from orphanages in Russian-occupied territory.

"On 5 May, voters in Wales will go to the polls to elect 1,234 councillors With just days left until the council elections on Thursday, the main parties in Wales have been making their case to the voters. Labour has been focussing on the cost of living crisis, while Plaid Cymru aims to extend free school meal provision. The Conservatives have promised to keep council tax low. On 5 May, voters in Waleswill elect 1,234 councillors to represent the 22 local authorities. Welsh Labour is still the biggest party at council level with 472 seats won at the 2017 election, despite losing more than 100 councillors and majority control of three councils - Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil. It retained majority control of seven Welsh councils. Launching the party's election campaign at the start of April, Welsh Labour leader and first ministerMark Drakeford blamed the Conservatives for the cost-of-living crisis. Mark Drakeford said Labour was prepared to think about a wide range of ideas to help those struggling financially But asked on theBBC Politics Wales programmehow electing Labour councillors would actually help people who are struggling financially, Mr Drakeford said: ""How councils charge for the services they provide has a real impact on people who live in those areas.Â ""Labour-run councils will be taking all of that into account and doing everything that they can, alongside a Labour government,Â to help people with the cost of living. ""The Labour government here in Wales is always looking for ways in which we can take action ourselves that leaves money in the pockets of people who don't have enough money, and particularly don't have enough money in current circumstances.Â ""There's a wide range of practical ideas that we are prepared to think about,"" Mr Drakeford added.

Plaid Cymru was the second biggest party after the last council elections, winning 202 seats - up 33 since the 2012 elections. Plaid currently leads four councils in Wales - Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Anglesey and Gwynedd. The party's aim is that Plaid-led councilswill extend free school meals to all their secondary school pupils. Adam Price said child hunger was a priority Mr Price told Politics Wales the policy aim was a ""priority... because getting to grips with the situation, incredible as it may seem, that we are dealing with child hunger in an advanced economy like ours, has to be a priority."" He added: ""Let's look at the experience in England, where the context is very similar.Â ""There we have seen local authorities that have moved beyond the centrally-funded provision for universal free school meals into primary and even into secondary.Â ""What we want to do is to apply the lessons from that here in Wales."" The Welsh Conservatives were the biggest gainers in the previous Welsh local elections in 2017, winning an extra 80 seats. The party runs Monmouthshire Council with a majority, and has cabinet members in ruling coalitions in Powys, Wrexham, Conwy and Denbighshire. Andrew RT Davies said the Conservatives would aim to deliver ""low council tax settlements across Wales"" The Welsh Conservativespromised to tackle ""bread and butter issues""when they launched their local election campaign. Tory Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies told Politics Wales the Conservatives would aim to deliver ""low council tax settlements across Wales"". He added: ""That money is best left in people's pockets, rather than paying in taxes. ""We will deliver those services in as efficient a way as possible, whether it is a rural authority or an urban authority."" In 2017, independents were the second biggest group with 322 councillors, whilst the Liberal Democrats won 62 seats, Llais Gwynedd returned six councillors, and there was a single Green councillor.

"Sinn FÃ©in, led by Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald, want Northern Ireland to leave the UK and reunite with the Republic of Ireland Sinn FÃ©in will be the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time, pushing the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) into second place. Sinn FÃ©in has 27 seats, compared to the DUP's 25. The result means Michelle O'Neill will be entitled to become first minister - unprecedented for a nationalist. Earlier, Ms O'Neill said it had been an election of ""real change"" and a ""defining moment for our politics and for our people"". ""Today ushers in a new era which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality and on the basis of social justice,"" she continued. This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has described her party's performance as a ""defining moment"" ""My commitment is to work through partnership, not division,"" Ms O'Neill said after she was elected in Mid Ulster. ""We will work with those who serve all other political perspectives, we will show respect and we expect to be shown respect."" A unionist party has had the most seats at Stormont since Northern Ireland was formed in 1921. The cross-community Alliance Party has returned 17 MLAs, more than doubling its previous number in 2017. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost one MLA to return with nine, while the SDLP's seats fell from 12 to eight. Counting in the Foyle constituency continued into a third day, with the DUP's Gary Middleton the last assembly member elected in the early hours of Sunday. Thirty-two of the MLAs elected are women, compared with 27 who were returned in the last election. The Alliance Party gained a seat in Belfast South, with Kate Nicholl (left) and Paula Bradshaw (right) elected Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he would meet with the party leaders over the coming days with the aim of restoring the Stormont institutions ""at the earliest possible moment"". ""I encourage the parties to form an executive as soon as possible. The people of Northern Ireland deserve a stable and accountable local government that delivers on the issues that matter most to them,"" he said. In February, the executive collapsed when DUP assembly member Paul Givanresigned as first minister. As the first and deputy first minister roles are part of a joint office, the move also removed Michelle O'Neill from her position. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said a new power-sharing executive was ""vital for progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland"". ""It is now incumbent on all political parties and elected representatives to deliver on their mandate, through the nomination of a first and deputy first minister and the formation of a new executive to serve the interests of all of the people of Northern Ireland."" The US State Department called for the parties ""to take the necessary steps to re-establish a power-sharing executive"". ""Critical and immediate challenges concerning the economy, health, and education are best addressed through the collective efforts of a devolved government chosen by, and accountable to, its people,"" said Ned Price. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he has not decided whether the party will nominate a deputy first minister Although Sinn FÃ©in can now nominate a first minister, they cannot take up the office unless the DUP, the biggest party from the unionist bloc, agrees to nominate a deputy first minister. Its leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has not yet made a decision on whether the party will do that. On Saturday, the DUP leader said his party would respect the result of the election, however, there needed to be changes made to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is an element of the UK's Brexit agreement with the European Union which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. Some unionists have said the protocol created a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The ultimate goal of Sinn FÃ©in is for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and become one country with the Republic of Ireland. But a victory for Sinn FÃ©in in this election does not mean a vote on Irish reunification - also known as a border poll - would be imminent. TheNorthern Ireland Act 1998,external- which followed the signing of the Good Friday Agreement - stated that Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom and ""shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll"". It also stated that the Northern Ireland Secretary would agree to hold a poll if it appeared likely that a majority of people wanted a united Ireland. Successive opinion polls suggest that is not yet the case, with the most recent, published in April, putting support at about a third. On Saturday, when asked about the prospect of a border poll, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary-Lou McDonald said unionists should not be ""scared"". ""The future is bright for all of us,"" she added. While Sinn FÃ©in was reluctant to promote its border poll ambitions during the election campaign, expect it to be back on the agenda now. But the party said it will be a decade-long plan at least which will only come after an island-wide conversation. The decision to hold a border poll is for the Northern Ireland secretary of state, when he or she feels there is more of an appetite for Irish unity. But you may now find talk of a border poll will slowly fade if a power-sharing executive returns and no votes are on the line.

""I'm also hugely blessed to be leading a party of the calibre of Alliance with people who are so dedicated, so committed and so selfless in their service,"" she said. UUP leader Doug Beattie, speaking after he was elected in Upper Bann, said he had no plans to change course after his party failed to grow its support. ""I will continue to promote positive, confident, optimistic unionism,"" he explained. After Sinn FÃ©in's result was confirmed, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated the party on a ""historic vote"". Allow Twitter content?

She tweeted that she hoped to see Northern Ireland's government ""functioning again soon"". From IRA politics to NI's biggest party The election in maps and charts Despite seeing a surge in vote share, the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) returned one MLA, its leader Jim Allister. Gerry Carroll, of People Before Profit, was elected in Belfast West, while independents were elected in East Londonderry and North Down. SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon, the party's representative on the executive as infrastructure minister, lost her seat in North Belfast. Ms Mallon's party leader, Colum Eastwood, said there was nothing ""fair"" about her result and she would be a ""huge loss for us, but a bigger loss for the people of north Belfast"". There were other high profile casualties, including Roy Beggs of the UUP and former Education Minister Peter Weir, of the DUP, who were members of the first assembly in 1998. The DUP's Mervyn Storey, another former minister, failed to be elected along with the SDLP policing board member Dolores Kelly. The Green Party lost its two MLAs, including leader Clare Bailey.

"Newport's vacancy rates post-June 2021 were the highest in the UK, according to think tank Centre for Cities The city which has more empty shops than anywhere in the UK is trying to make a comeback. The oncevibrant music scene, which hosted the likes of David Bowie and Elton John, is no more and the cinema which closed just five years after opening hangs over the shopping centre vacant. So how can Newport regain its glory days of the past at a time when theprice of everything - well nearly everything - is soaring, and - let's face it - when it can just be easier to shop online? Well, they're pinning their hopes on young people's consideration for buying local, shopping with the environment in mind and love for posting locations that'll add something to their Instagram feed. And giving Newport market, which first opened in 1854, a glow-up could well be part of the answer. Cineworld in Friars Walk hasn't reopened since the pandemic The market is being pitched to a younger crowd to capitalise on the trend to live, work and play closer to home. 'My nan has helped me get millions of views' Is this the era of shopping focused social media? ""If you can offer cool independent clothing brands, a place that reflects sustainability, with some great food and the ability to work there in a cool and innovative office with affordable rates, all that stuff is going to bring younger people in and a different audience,"" said market developer Simon Baston. And he believes he's done just that. From a traditional Victorian market... The Grade II listed building, which saw ""Europe's biggest indoor market regeneration"" this year, boasts some of ""Wales' best street food"", has about 25 stalls, with work spaces and offices around the centre. ""The reason why a 20 to 45-year-old millennial population like it is because it offers everything under one roof,"" he said. He hopes the market could be the start of the regeneration process for Newport which, like many other towns and cities, has been hit hard by the pandemic. ...to a market worthy of a place on your social feed For Isabel Godsell, coming into Newport town is a rarity unless she needs to get the essentials. The 22-year-old from Caerleon said she will either shop online or head into Cardiff because of the ""old, dying"" city which needs ""refurbishment"". Isabel says the market's food ""is very in with the vegetarian and vegan option"" ""They're cutting down on youth clubs, young people don't have anywhere to go and, with gangs and crimes on the rise, we need activities which are not just sitting down and eating."" And although she believes the market is ""very Instagram-able in the way they've laid it out"", she wants to see a better shopping experience for people to feel safer. ""It [Newport] needs an injection of cash flow... past seven o'clock people don't really come out - they just don't feel safe here,"" she said. Wedding? Comedy gig? Simon Baston says the market is a multi-use space ""More stuff is starting to come here like Taco Bell and the new market - I think it's getting better and different dynamics are coming back to town,"" said 19-year-old Lucas Barnes. However, he'd like to see more shops in town now the pandemic is drawing to an end, with more catered to men. ""Newport is very quiet,"" says Lucas Research released byCentre for Cities,externalrevealed Newport is thought to have the most closed shops in the UK - with about one-third of its centre closed permanently. It found that a lack of high-skilled jobs limited the demand for local businesses and the pandemic and cost of living crisis have left people with less disposable income to spend in shops and restaurants. Pandemic accelerated UK's shift online, says Ofcom Decline in Welsh shoppers prompts support plea Newport city council says just before Christmas it offered a ""generous"" package of grants for small and medium-sized businesses ""Young consumers over the pandemic were one of the groups particularly affected by job losses,"" said retail expert, Dr Sarah Montano. ""So we have to recognise not every young consumer is going to have the income."" The lecturer at Birmingham University said, aside from the practical ways of attracting consumers to city centres, like free transport for under-25s, ""it's about thinking of these spaces in a much more multi-dimensional way"" which are then ""very experiential"". Dr Montano says the second biggest trend for young consumers is around second-hand shopping She also said retailers have a responsibility to ""think how they can be in city centres"". ""Often they'll say, 'Well I'm not opening a four story departmental store because it's not going to be viable'. Well, I accept that because lots of people are shopping online, but can you have one story then?"" Dr Montano said having a different shop on each floor would give ""a reason for consumers to keep coming back"". What next for Newport after Debenhams loss? Is this what shops will have to look like to keep people coming back? ""There are brands that young consumers are going into store - Glossier is a good one, it's a really playful space, very pink and gold. ""But where's the next Glossier because the next Glossier is somewhere, and it could be in Newport. ""So how can the council say, 'Come in, try this space, see what happens', and think about what subsidies, rent discounts they need to doâ¦ and it could be fun."" Newport hasn't always been full of empty shops. ""It was thriving when it was a town,"" long-time collector of Newport's history, Peter Brown said. ""Newport was the third richest place in Wales at the start of the century. ""The glory days were the industrial revolution - a lot of the Irish came here, the churches began to fill up and it just exploded in Newport because of the old town dock."" Commercial Street on 28 August 1962 The town became known for its accessible, modern docks as trade flourished in the early 1900s. That continued when the Alexander Dock was opened in 1875, becoming the largest dock in the world at the time. ""The town was buzzing in the 50s, 60s and 70s - you couldn't go anywhere unless there were crowds,"" Peter said. ""But now we've developed a record of seeing the most shut up shops."" For Peter, reopening shops and and ""taking a chance"" on Newport will get it back to its glory days of the past. Do you know where Newport Civic Clock has moved to now? Newport Market has plans to keep expanding ""We have long recognised that a different mix of uses in the city centre, rather than a reliance on retail alone, was vital,"" said chief executive of Newport city council, Beverly Owen. ""In this financial year, our unique city centre rates scheme will give eligible businesses a 25% reduction on their rates bill on top of the Welsh government's rate relief."" She said Newport Market, and the opening of future venues will ""usher in a new era"" for the city. Newport city centre has undergone much change in the past decade and is set for more She said the council's survey in May 2021 showed the vacancy rate in the city is at less than 24%, compared to the 33% found by Centre for Cities, citing a ""discrepancy"" in how the think tank carried out its research. ""The company's assessment did not appear to differentiate between vacant units and units that were being refurbished or redeveloped at the time of the survey,"" she added. More than Â£15m funding will be used to restore the Market Arcade, build a newleisure centre, repurpose the former railway station as an innovative hub and redevelop the four-star hotel and offices, Ms Owen said. ""As the city looks to its recovery, an attractive and successful city centre remains at the heart of our plans.""
