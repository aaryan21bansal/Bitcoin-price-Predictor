"Mark Asay - who has white supremacist tattoos - admits one murder, but denies the other A white supremacist convicted of racially motivated murders three decades ago in Florida has been executed by lethal injection. Mark Asay is the first white man in state history to be executed for killing a black victim, according to theDeath Penalty Information Center,external. The 53-year-old had been found guilty of two 1987 murders in Jacksonville. The execution took place at 22:22 GMT. It was the first time a new drug cocktail was used. A jury found that Asay shot his victims - Robert Lee Booker, a black man, and Robert McDowell, 26, a white-Hispanic man - on the same night after making racist comments. How does a lethal injection work? The Americans volunteering to watch executions Prosecutors said that Asay had hired McDowell, who was dressed as a woman, for sex, and shot him after discovering his gender. Since the state reinstated death sentences in 1976, 20 black men have been executed for killing white victims, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. His execution began with him being given etomidate, an anaesthetic never before used for a US execution, which will replace midazolam, a drug abandoned over fears that it was causing unnecessary suffering. Concerns were raised after a number of prisoners appeared to suffer agonising deaths, eventually leading Florida to abandon the drug in January. He was given two other drugs to paralyse him and stop his heart - rocuronium bromide and potassium acetate. However, one dissenting judge warned the allowance of an unproven cocktail ""jeopardised Asay's fundamental constitutional rights and treated him as the proverbial guinea pig"". In an interview with a local television station, Asay had said he did not want to spend the rest of his life behind bars. The inmate - who had white supremacist tattoos - admitted killing Mr McDowell, but denied the other murder. ""Because I pray, and I say, 'I've had all of the prison I want.' So I want out of prison, through the front door or the back,"" hetold News4Jax,external. The US has seen several sloppily handled executions in recent years, with lawyers arguing the drugs failed to properly prevent pain during the process. Not only was this the first execution in Florida in more than 18 months, but it was also the first since the US Supreme Court found the state's method of sentencing to be unconstitutional. The high court ruled that judges held too much sway over the decision to hand down the death penalty. Since then, the state legislature has changed the rules so that a jury must reach a unanimous verdict in order for a death sentence to be recommended to the court. But the new law does not affect older cases, such as Asay's.

"Christa O'Connor and her sons live in Roseville, near Detroit Hollywood star Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, has dubbed a 10-year-old boy a ""real-life hero"" after the youngster copied a scene from one of his films and saved his little brother's life. When Jacob O'Connor found two-year-old Dylan floating face-down in the swimming pool he didn't rush off and find a grown up to help, instead he remembered a move from one of his favourite films, San Andreas. Jacob, from Roseville, Michigan, managed to pull his brother out of the pool and started giving him chest compressions - just as he'd seen The Rock doing in the film. Dylan was then rushed to hospital and went on to make a full recovery. When he heard of Jacob's amazing intervention, Dwayne Johnson tweeted: ""Wow amazing story....You're a real life hero. We're all proud of you! DJ"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Teen caught smuggling tiger cub into US Winner of $758m lottery jackpot: 'I quit' Rare bush rat rediscovered after 30 years She said her son was taking all the praise in his stride and added: ""He just thinks it was the natural thing to do. ""Someone asked him if he thought he was a hero and he just said 'I don't know'. ""I'm surprised Jacob remembered what he'd seen in the film but it's one of his favourites and he'd seen it the week before."" Jacob (left) saved his brother by copying what he'd seen The Rock do in a film The specific scene Jacob was copying was one in San Andreas where Johnson's character tries to save his on screen daughter. Jacob told local news media: ""I was scared when I saw Dylan in the pool."" ""My favourite movie, San Andreas, had compressions (CPR) in the movie and I remembered it from the part in the movie where there was an earthquake, then there was a tsunami, and the girl was drowning. ""In most movies, that's what they do. They try to save the person first, and if it's not working, they go get someone."" The boys along with their other brother Gavin, 8, were being looked after by their grandmother while their mother was at work, but Dylan managed to somehow get out unnoticed. Jacob O'Connor with his brothers Gavin (left) and Dylan (centre) When Jacob spotted his brother was gone he went to investigate and found he'd managed to unlock two back doors to get into the garden and then walk around the corner to the swimming pool. After Jacob's life-saving resuscitation Dylan coughed up some water but because he didn't respond fully Jacob ran to tell his grandmother. She called an ambulance and Dylan was rushed to hospital. In the meantime his mother drove frantically from work to meet them there. ""He was unconscious and on oxygen when I got there,"" she said, ""and was kept in for two days. ""But he's well now and has no neurological damage or any lasting effects."" After all the trauma the mother-of-three can reflect positively on the accident, which happened at the end of last month. ""Thankfully we've been so lucky and it's like it never happened,"" she said.

"This video can not be played The technology has already been trialled in the Netherlands using two lorries, with the lead truck having control Small convoys of partially self-driving lorries will be tried out on major British roads by the end of next year, the government has announced. A contract has been awarded to the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) to carry out the tests of vehicle ""platoons"". Up to three lorries will travel in formation, with acceleration and braking controlled by the lead vehicle. But the head of the AA said platoons raised safety concerns. In the platoons, the lead vehicle will be controlled by a human driver and will communicate with the rest of the convoy wirelessly. The following vehicles will be instructed to accelerate and brake by the lead vehicle, allowing the lorries to drive closer together than they could with human drivers. Lorries driving close together could reduce air resistance for the following vehicles, as the front lorry pushes air out of the way. This could lead to fuel efficiency savings for haulage companies, which Transport Minister Paul Maynard hopes will be passed on to consumers. The following vehicles could also react more quickly to the lead lorry braking than human drivers can. However, human drivers will still steer all the lorries in the convoy. The TRL will begin trials of the technology on test tracks, but these trials are expected to move to major roads by the end of 2018. This video can not be played Driverless lorries could lead to savings being passed to consumers, the Transport Minister Paul Maynard says The government has been promising such a projectsince at least 2014. Last year, for example, itannounced its intention to carry outplatooning trials but was later frustrated after some European lorrymakers declined to participate. A Department for Transport spokesman told the BBC that the experiments are now expected to go ahead as the contract had been awarded. Will the platoon block motorists trying to leave or enter the motorway? The TRL says it will carefully choose sections of motorway for its trials, taking the number of junctions and traffic into account. All the lorries will have drivers behind the wheel who will be able to take control and break up the convoy to let other drivers join or leave the motorway if there is an obstruction. What happens if a car tries to squeeze between the lorries? The platoon lorries will be able to drive more closely together than those driven exclusively by humans, so the gap between them might be uncomfortably close for a driver to try to squeeze into.  However, the TRL says its current strategy is to break up the convoy and let the human drivers take control, if a car squeezes in between the lorries.  The organisation is considering ways of informing other road users that the lorries are in a ""self-driving"" convoy. How much fuel will a convoy actually save? According to TRL, other trials have seen improvements in fuel economy of between 4% and 10%. A local trial will help determine the benefit platooning can deliver in the UK. The TRL has announced its partners for the project: DAF Trucks, a Dutch lorry manufacturer Ricardo, a British smart tech transport firm DHL, a German logistics company Platooning has been testedin a number of countriesaround the world, including the US, Germany and Japan. However, British roads present a unique challenge, said Edmund King, president of the AA. ""We all want to promote fuel efficiency and reduce congestion but we are not yet convinced that lorry platooning on UK motorways is the way to go about it,"" he said, pointing out, for example, that small convoys of lorries can block road signs from the view of other road users. ""We have some of the busiest motorways in Europe with many more exits and entries. ""Platooning may work on the miles of deserted freeways in Arizona or Nevada but this is not America,"" he added. His comments were echoed by the RAC Foundation. Its director, Steve Gooding, said: ""Streams of close-running HGVs could provide financial savings on long-distance journeys, but on our heavily congested motorways - with stop-start traffic and vehicles jostling for position - the benefits are less certain."" Campaign group the Road Haulage Association said ""safety has to come first"". Transport Minister Paul Maynard said platooning could lead to cheaper fuel bills, lower emissions and less congestion. ""But first we must make sure the technology is safe and works well on our roads, and that's why we are investing in these trials,"" he said.

"Supporters of Ram Rahim Singh have been protesting ahead of the court verdict Tens of thousands of supporters of an Indian guru accused of rape have flocked to the north of the country ahead of his arrival at court. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, 50, is due to appear at a court in Panchkula, Haryana state, on Friday to hear the verdict in a case involving the rape of two women. Parts of Punjab and Haryana have been placed in lockdown and mobile internet services suspended in some areas. Thousands of police and paramilitary forces have been deployed. The high court in the state has asked the government to use force, if necessary, to control the crowds. Ram Rahim Singh denies the allegations, which date back to 2002. Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh has millions of followers in India The chief of the Dera Sacha Sauda sect dresses up in colourful clothes, with a rock star image. He has published half a dozen music videos and regularly performs at rock concerts, which are attended by tens of thousands of followers. The Dera Sacha Sauda website says it is a ""social welfare and spiritual organisation that preaches and practices humanitarianism and selfless services to others"". The sect claims to have more than 50 million followers around the world and says it campaigns against female foeticide, for reforms for sex workers, runs schools and several hospitals. In recent months, the Dera chief has been mired in controversy, amid allegations that he forced 400 followers to undergo castrations so that they could get ""closer to god"". He also faces trial for murder, charges a spokesman for the sect has denied. He has been opposed by mainstream Sikh leaders, who accuse him of insulting and belittling their faith. Why is India's 'godwoman' in the news? Gun-loving India 'god-woman' who shot wedding guests MSG Messenger of God: Indian critics pan guru film The crowds in Panchkula, where the court will deliver its verdict, have sparked a massive security deployment across the city. Schools and offices in the area were closed, trains were halted, roads were blocked and three stadiums were set aside as makeshift prisons in case of trouble, officials said. As many as 200,000 devotees of the highly influential guru have gathered, many desperate to get a glimpse of Singh as he heads into the court. Authorities are concerned and are preparing for a possible public backlash from his supporters. Security has been beefed up ahead of the verdict Ram Rahim Singh, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the long-running case, is one of India's most powerful gurus, with a god-like status. He wields considerable political influence and claims to have tens of millions of followers worldwide.

"This video can not be played Winner of record lottery jackpot quits job The winner of the biggest jackpot in North American history - $758.7m (Â£590m) - has come forward to collect her prize. Mother-of-two Mavis Wanczyk, 53, bought the ticket at a Chicopee, Massachusetts, petrol station. The winner - whose lucky numbers were 6, 7, 16, 23 and 26, and 4 - told reporters she had already quit her job. The biggest ever US Powerball jackpot was $1.6bn, although that was shared by three ticket holders in January 2016. Massachusetts State Lottery told reporters the ticket in Wednesday night's draw had been validated. ""The first thing I want to do is just sit back and relax,"" said Ms Wanczyk, chewing gum. The winning ticket was bought at a petrol station in Chicopee, Massachusetts ""I had a pipe dream.. and it came true."" She told journalists she had picked her lucky numbers based on relatives' birthdays. Ms Wanczyk said of her 32-year job at a medical centre: ""I've called them and told them I will not be going back."" She added that she was ""going to go hide in my bed"". Reporters asked if she had plans to treat herself to something nice, such as a fancy new car. But Ms Wanczyk replied she just bought a new car less than a year ago, and now plans to pay it off in full. One lottery official described the woman as ""your prototypical Massachusetts resident"". People wait outside a liquor store to buy lottery tickets in Hawthorne, California He added that she seems like ""a hard-working individual"" and ""clearly she's excited"". The $50,000 prize awarded to the business that sells the winning numbers will be donated to charity, said Pride petrol station owner Bob Bolbuc. The jackpot payout, which can be made in 29 yearly payments or a lump sum, is estimated to be about $443m after taxes. Powerball Product Group chairman Charlie McIntyre said in a statement that six other tickets - sold in Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and the Virgin Islands - won $2m each. Thirty-four other tickets across the US scooped $1m. Massachusetts lottery officials initially said the jackpot ticket was sold at a convenience store in the Boston suburb of Watertown, but corrected the location on Thursday morning. It is not clear how the error was made. Odds of winning the jackpot are one in 292.2 million.

"Darlington Borough Council's planning committee heard complaints from residents overlooking the ground A planning dispute has erupted between a cricket club and its neighbours after residents said players were too noisy. While the sound of leather on willow may be music to the ears for some, it is an irritation for people living near Darlington Cricket Club. A retrospective planning application for a new practice area and two sets of nets has been submitted by the club. But some residents of a new estate bordering the Feethams ground have objected due to noise during practice. Darlington Borough Council's planning committee heard complaints from residents living close to the ground. They included ""the noise of the bat striking the ball"" and ""the effort of batting and bowling"" and the lack of privacy caused by the nets. One letter complained about men ""dropping their trousers to remove thigh pads and boxes in their underwear"". The club has been at the same ground in County Durham since 1866 and plays in the North Yorkshire and South Durham Premier League. It said nets previously on the southern boundary of the cricket ground had deteriorated and needed replacing. The practice pitches are due to be available to club players as well as local schools between April and September. Residents who object to the plans say there are more suitable places on the field for the training facility. The application has been recommended for approval by council officers with some conditions attached.

"Investors dumped food and grocery stocks on Thursday after Amazon said it would complete its takeover of Whole Foods on Monday and immediately embark on price cuts. The news drove losses at retailers including Walmart, Target and Costco and helped push US markets lower. TheDow JonesIndustrial Average fell 0.1% to 21,783 points. The widerS&P 500dipped 0.2% to 2,438.9 points and theNasdaqslipped 0.1% to 6,271.3 points. Wall Street has been relatively quiet this week, as the results season wraps up and investors await any news from central bankers at an annual conference in Wyoming. Amazon's news reignited fears for the supermarket industry. In addition to lower prices, the e-commerce giant said it plans to sell Whole Foods brand products on its website, integrate its systems to offer Prime members discounts and provide Amazon pick-up spots at Whole Foods stores, among other changes. Roger Davidson, a former Whole Foods executive now with consultancy firm Oakton Advisory Group, said Amazon ""will lower prices on consequential items to drive traffic and sales, but not do a whole store price reduction, which could really damage gross margin and potentially wipe out operating margin. ""It does not look like they will go kamikaze on pricing."" Prices at Whole Foods can be an average of 15% to 20% higher than those charged by some rivals. Amazon's move sent Walmart down 2%, with Target slipping almost 4% and Costo down 5%. Food companies also took a hit: Campbell Soup fell 3% and Kellogg dropped 2.9%. Amazon fell 0.6% to $952.45 and the stock has dipped just over 8% in the past month, but has risen 27% since the start of the year. Meanwhile, shares of Signet Jewelers, which owns diamond brands such as Kay's, were a rare gem, rising more than 16%, after the firm announced a plan to buy an online retailer for $328m. The company also reported that sales in the three months to July reached almost $1.4bn, up 1.9% year-on-year.

"Fixed-wheel bikes are similar to the track bikes seen in velodromes, being raced at great speeds As a widower urges ""reckless"" cyclists to learn from the death of his wife, who was knocked down and killed by a teenager on bike with no front brake in east London, a courier explains to the BBC's Laura Lea what made him ride a ""fixie"" - and why this may now change. Michael - not his real name - has worked as a bike courier for the last year and a half and believes the case -which led to an Old Bailey trial and national media attention- has ""whipped up hatred against cyclists"". ""I've heard other couriers saying to me they feel on edge and that pedestrians have looked at them differently,"" he says. ""In the last couple of weeks, with every courier I've met, this has been the first thing we've talked about,"" the 27-year-old adds. He spends 9-10 hours a day delivering packages on the roads of central London and is paid on a job-by-job basis, so weaving in and out of traffic to complete the work quickly is vital. Michael rides a fixie - a fixed-wheel bicycle - with no front brake. This is illegal. By law, a bike on a public road in the UK must have two brakes. A fixed-wheel bicycle has a single gear and no freewheel mechanism. The rear fixed wheel of a fixie - which a rider can slow using the pedals - counts as a brake. ""I didn't actually know it was against the law until this case,"" he says. Cyclist Charlie Alliston guilty over pedestrian's death Husband says 'reckless' cyclists must learn from wife's death ""It takes a long time to get used to riding a bike without brakes,"" Michael says. ""People do it because it's this personal sensation of control with the bike. You never get that quick in London, it's more about how you cycle. I think most couriers who spend hours riding every day have the credentials."" He does admit you ""can probably slow down quicker with a front brake"". ""I wouldn't advise it for an 18-year-old kid who's been watching cycling videos,"" he adds. The trial of Charlie Allison over the death of Kim Briggs heard how the then teenager had compared the experience of riding without a front brake to videos by a stunt cyclist. Mrs Briggs's husband, Matthew, asked why those who rode bikes without a front brake would take that ""risk with somebody else's life"". But Michael does not believe he is taking a risk: ""I wouldn't ride it if I felt there was a risk to others."" He does concede that it makes riding ""exciting"" and ""fun"" but says his fellow couriers are among the most trained urban cyclists in London. Following the case, Michael is planning to get a brake fitted. But this isn't for the reason you might think. ""I'm worried going out on my bike, that the police are going to take my bike off me and then I won't be able to work,"" he says. Mr Briggs said he hoped courier companies would communicate clearly and forcefully that bikes without two brakes are not legal. Michael said this could have little effect as ""so many [cycle] couriers are self-employed"". Cycling organisations and charities have widely supported Mr Briggs. Duncan Dollimore, from Cycling UK, called riding without a front brake on a busy road ""stupid"". Josh Lane - a mechanic at Look Mum, No Hands, a cafe and workshop for cyclists in central London - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme many fixie riders ""just think about their own safety"" rather than anyone else. He said: ""The problem is you have younger guys that see these riders and think 'Damn , that is so cool. That's how I want to look'. Take their brakes off and maybe they can't stop or move in the way that these really professional riders can."" He said: ""In this particular circumstanceâ¦ someone has crashed into someone - that could have been avoided if they had brakes. You've got to take that into account. You've got to think of other people, not just yourself."" Mr Lane, who rides a fixie himself with a front brake, suggested that bikes should have to be regularly serviced and checked, much like the MOT system for cars. He said: ""People need to be intelligent enough to look at these videos, take away certain aspects of them but then maybe take a look at how they ride a bike, where they ride a bike and what the consequences can be."" But Michael believes there has been too much ""fixation"" on the issue of the brakes. ""It would be an entirely different story here if [Alliston] fell away from Mrs Briggs into an oncoming bus. This was a freak accident. ""People just step out in front and expect us to stop. There needs more education for pedestrians dealing with cyclists. The law needs to look at better cycling infrastructure."" He did agree, however, that ""pedestrians have the right of way, even if they are wrong"". Crash investigators who studied CCTV of the incident concluded Alliston would have been able to stop and avoid the collision if the bike had been fitted with a front brake. Alliston is due to be sentenced on 18 September. âReckless cyclists must learn from deathâ Bike courier wins 'gig' economy case At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"Driverless lorries will be trialled on British motorways for the first time next year,according to the Daily Telegraph,external.  The paper says up to three lorries will travel in convoy, controlled by a driver in the lead vehicle. But theDaily Express,externalsays the AA is warning that this is ""not America"", with wide open freeways. It says the plans could pose a risk to motorists as the ""platoons"" of lorries will be the equivalent of half a football pitch long and difficult to control. Prime Minister Theresa May's determination to continue counting foreign students in the government's immigration target has left her increasingly isolated,says the Guardian,external. It reports that Conservative MPs have called on Mrs May to end the focus on overseas students, as it appears the government has drastically overestimated the risk that they will remain in Britain illegally. The paper says official figures show that less than 5,000 stay on after their visas expire. Estimates for previous years had been close to 100,000. The Times reports that the head of the country's biggest trade union,external, Unite, is backing Emily Thornberry to be the next leader of the Labour Party. The paper - following up reports fromthe Huffington Post,external- says Len McCluskey believes she is a ""unifying figure"" and suited to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Ms Thornberry resigned from Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet three years ago after being accused of being a snob when she tweeted a photograph of a house in Rochester, Kent, decked out in a St George's flag. More than two million people in the UK are either problem gamblers or at risk of addiction,reports the Guardian,external.

Veteran broadcaster David Attenborough thinks life on Earth is better than ever,reports the Times,external.

"A combined ice breaker and LNG tanker has crossed the northern sea route A commercial LNG tanker has sailed across the colder, northern route from Europe to Asia without the protection of an ice-breaker for the first time. The specially-built ship completed the crossing in just six-and-a-half days setting a new record, according to the tanker's Russian owners. The 300-metre-long Sovcomflot ship, the Christophe de Margerie, was carrying gas from Norway to South Korea. Rising Arctic temperatures are boosting commercial shipping across this route. The Christophe de Margerie is the world's first and, at present, only ice-breaking LNG carrier. The ship, which features a lightweight steel reinforced hull, is the largest commercial ship to receive Arc7 certification, which means it is capable of travelling through ice up to 2.1m thick. On this trip it was able to keep up an average speed of 14 knots despite sailing through ice that was over one metre thick in places. The ship is the first of a new fleet specially constructed to sail through ice all year round On its maiden voyage earlier this year, the Christophe de Margerie docked in the Russian port of Sabetta. Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated the crew and energy company officials gathered on the ship's bridge, saying: ""This is a big event in the opening up of the Arctic."" The Russian owners, Sovcomflot, will use this ice-breaking tanker to export gas from the Yamal peninsula to Asian markets later this year. It will be the first of a planned fleet of 15 that will transport gas from these ice bound fields all year round. ""Previously there was only a window of navigation from our summer to autumn, but this ship will be able to sail westwards from Sabetta which is the Yamal energy port, all year round and eastwards from July to December,"" said Sovcomflot spokesman Bill Spears. ""Before the northern sea route was only open for four months and you had to have ice-breakers - so it's a significant development."" In 2016, the northern sea route saw 19 full transits from the Atlantic to the Pacific. High insurance and large fees for Russian ice-breakers are still discouraging some ship owners from the riskier northern route. But the economic benefits are attractive - the Christophe de Margerie took just 19 days for the entire voyage, around 30% faster than going by Suez. There has been an overall decline in Arctic sea ice over the past 30 years,linked by scientists,externalto rising global temperatures. This year, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC), the annual maximum extent of Arctic sea ice hit a record low for the third year in a row. The Russian President speaking during the naming ceremony for the new tanker earlier this year This diminution of northern ice is something that the Russian ship owners believe will continue well into the future. ""If there was a material change in the ice thickness it would change the period of the year that the ship could move through the Northern Sea Route,"" said Bill Spears from Sovcomflot. ""There is an assumption that the ice is not going to thicken dramatically for the economic life of these vessels, which could be over 30 years."" Environmental campaigners, though, are worried that increased traffic in this inhospitable region could have potentially significant effects. ""We're concerned that this is a commercial opportunity that has only opened up because of global warming, and we're especially concerned that having taken advantage of the thinning of the ice, shipping operations are now expanding in that part of the world,"" said John Maggs fromSeas at Risk,external. ""It is not like sailing in open water, even if you have an ice classed ship, the risks are dramatically increased."" As well as the risk of accident or spillage, there are worries that some of the ships that will sail along this route will be powering their engines with heavier, dirtier marine fuels. The black carbon that they produce could be very damaging to snow and ice in the region, increasing the melting. ""The environmental risks are enormous,"" said John Maggs. ""You are taking industrial-sized installations and moving them through a pristine Arctic environment, so it's going to have an impact - and what are we getting in return, slightly shorter journey times? A 30% gain is not much of a gain to me."" Follow Matt onTwitter,externaland onFacebook,external.

"Kim Jong-un's shadow falls across a diagram of the Hwasong-13 missile, while officials obscure a chart showing a new Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile North Korea appears to have revealed details of two as-yet untested missile systems in its press coverage of a factory inspection by the country's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Photographs released by KCNA state news agency to go with a report on Mr Kim's visit to a facility at the Academy of Defence Sciences facility show wall charts describing the missiles, called Hwasong-13 and Pukguksong-3. Hwasong-13 appears to be a three-stage ICBM (Inter Continental Ballistic Missile), while the chart showing Pukguksong-3, although largely obscured by officials, is an Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile (SLBM). It's not the first time that North Korea has ""accidentally"" left details of important developments in the background of photo-shoots, and this is seen by analysts as a means of showing off its military power or sending messages to its foes. North Korea's report of the visit appears to be deliberately timed, coming on the third day of the Ulchi Freedom Guardian military exercises involving South Korea and the United States, to which Pyongyang is vehemently opposed. The timing and the content is critical. Speaking to South Korea'sJoongAng Ilbo newspaper,external, Shin Jong-woo of the Korea Defence and Security Forum said that North Korea ""has a history of displaying actual weapons, or graphic designs of them, via state media in order to flaunt its military prowess to the world."" According to KCNA, Kim Jong-un is said to have ordered scientists at the facility to produce more solid rocket fuel and warhead tips, and these fit with the details displayed on the wall charts. Unlike the liquid-fuelled Hwasong-14 missile which North Korea tested in July, Hwasong-13 appears to be a three-stage solid fuel rocket; while the solid-fuelled Pukguksong-3 is a longer-range version of the Pukguksong-1 and -2 missiles which were tested in 2016. The aerial view of Andersen Air Force Base is intended to send a message to Washington Whether by mistake or as a ruse, it has happened before. Two weeks ago, photos of Kim Jong-un planning a ballistic missile test in the direction of US Andersen Air Force Base on Guam also contained strategically placed wall charts and an ominous aerial view of the base itself. The message here is clear. Pyongyang is telling Washington that American military power in the region is in their sights. But it could all have been an ""elaborate bluff,"" Seoul'sChosun Ilbo,externalnewspaper says. The paper says that the aerial photo of the Guam base is six years old and publicly available on the Google Earth mapping service. North Korea has no facilities of its own to obtain satellite imagery. Pyongyang has used this intimidating tactic at a time of heightened tensions before - such is the cyclical nature of North Korean crises. Kim Jong-un was photographed in March 2013 in a meeting withnotepad-wielding generalsafter the region appeared on the brink of war following a North Korean nuclear test the previous month. One of the charts, placed at a convenient angle for the camera, is titled ""Plan to strike the US mainland"", with one of the missile plots terminating in Austin, Texas. In 2013, Kim Jong-un and senior officers were photographed in front of a chart saying ""plan to strike US mainland"" As an intimidation tactic though, the plan fell through - news of this threat was mostly met with mockery by Texan Twitter users,Washington Post,externalreported at the time. And as North Korea almost certainly did not have the technical capabilities to carry out such a strike, it would have been hard for it to carry the scheme through to completion even if it wanted to. While accidentally- or purposely-placed maps and charts give North Korea-watchers clues to the messages that North Korea is trying to send to the outside world, it's what Pyongyang doesn't show in its news reporting that can be just as revealing. The slow disappearance of MiG-29 fighter jets from North Korean TV screens - which usually glory in the ""invincible"" strength of the armed forces - could be a sign that UN sanctions are biting hard in those parts of the country's military which once relied on foreign sources for spare parts. Only one identifiable example of the supersonic fighter was seen airborne during coverage of this June's Air Force flight competition, a regular event given prominence due to Kim Jong-un's presence. Two others were spotted on the ground. In previous years, as many as five MiGs could be seen flying in formation during news reports and propaganda films, but lack of parts and fuel shortages have reportedly restricted flight hours. Communication in all its forms is tightly controlled by the government in Pyongyang, but sometimes the mask slips sufficiently to tell the world more than intended. Kim Jong-un looks at MiG-29 jets in February 2016, but they've been rarely seen since BBC Monitoring,externalreports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

"Net migration has fallen to the lowest level for three years after a surge in the number of EU nationals leaving the UK since last June's Brexit vote. Net migration - the difference between those entering and leaving the UK - fell 81,000 to 246,000 in the year to March 2017. More than half that change is due to a decrease in net migration of EU citizens, which is down 51,000. The government is committed to reducing net migration to below 100,000. Non-EU students 'not staying illegally' Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis welcomed the new figures, saying: ""It was good to see a third quarter running of net migration figures coming down"". But business groups raised concerns about the fall, with the CBI saying: ""The loss of these vital skills should concern us all."" The ONS figures show a particularly sharp rise, of 17,000, in departures of citizens from the so-called EU8 countries - Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. An ONS spokesman said: ""These results indicate that the EU referendum result may be influencing people's decision to migrate into and out of the UK, particularly EU and EU8 citizens. ""It is too early to tell if this is an indication of a long-term trend."" The ONS figures,externalshow that immigration from all countries has fallen - and emigration has also risen. International migration for work remains the most likely reason to move, said the ONS, but it added that people are now more likely to move if they have a definite job, rather than to just look for work. A spokesman for the Institute of Directors said ""no one should celebrate these numbers"". ""Given unemployment is currently at its lowest level ever (4.5%), without the three million EU citizens living here the UK would have an acute labour shortage. ""Signs that it is becoming a less attractive place to live and work are a concern,"" he added. Are there other factors beyond a suspected Brexit effect? Since the Brexit referendum, the falls in the pound on currency markets mean that money made in the UK buys less back home. This is really important for workers who are sending cash back to their families - and a decisive factor in decisions to move all around the world. Last June, the pound bought almost 6 Polish zlotys. Today, it buys only 4.6 zlotys. What's more, when people choose to move to another country, they're not just looking at the circumstances there, but, fairly obviously, at the conditions at home. And there is no doubt that for some EU workers, coming to the UK isn't the slam-dunk deal it once was. Read Dominic's full analysis Matthew Percival, head of employment at the CBI, said EU nationals made a ""crucial contribution"" to the economy. ""This latest data reflects a trend many businesses have seen - an increase in the number of EU citizens leaving the country,"" he said. ""The loss of these vital skills should concern us all, underlining the importance of urgently providing certainty for millions of workers and their families."" The government has also published the first ever ""exit checks"" data - a proper count of all people who are actually known to have left the UK. For the year to March 2017, the data shows that 97% of students from outside the EU with a visa to enter the UK are known to have complied with the terms of their visa by either departing the UK or remaining in the country by extending their visas. It is not clear what had happened to the remaining 3% whose visas had expired. This previously unknown figure runs contrary to repeated claims that international students are abusing the immigration system to stay illegally in the UK. Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said it showed Theresa May's ""long-running campaign to malign international students"" was ""based on fantasy"". And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the NHS was facing recruitment problems due to the lack of EU workers - and the UK needed a migration policy based on the ""economic needs"" of the country. The Lib Dems called the overall drop in net migration a ""deeply worrying Brexodus of EU citizens"", blaming the government's failure to guarantee their rights to stay in the UK after Brexit.

"Evidence of Beale lying about the rapes came to light when police investigated a separate allegation A ""serial liar"" who made a series of bogus sexual assault allegations against 15 men has been jailed for 10 years. Jemma Beale, 25, claimed she was raped by nine men and sexually assaulted by six, all strangers, in four encounters spanning three years. One allegation led to the conviction of a man who was jailed for seven years. Beale from Hounslow was found guilty of perjury and perverting the course of justice at Southwark Crown Court. Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told Beale, who was in a relationship with a woman: ""This trial has revealed, what was then not obvious, that you are a very, very convincing liar and you enjoy being seen as a victim. ""The prosecution described your life as a 'construct of bogus victimhood'. ""These offences usually began as a drunken attempt to get your partner's sympathy or perhaps to arouse her jealousy. ""They each began impulsively, but what is particularly chilling is the manner in which you persisted in making allegations which you knew were untrue even to the extent of committing and repeating perjury."" Police spent 6,400 hours investigating Beale's lies at a cost of at least Â£250,000, and the trial at Southwark Crown Court cost at least Â£109,000 Prosecutor Madeleine Wolfe told the court police spent 6,400 hours investigating Beale's lies at a cost of at least Â£250,000, and the trial cost at least Â£109,000. ""Cases such as this bring a real risk that a woman who has been raped or sexually assaulted does not complain to the police for fear of not being believed"", the judge added. ""False allegations are likely to have the perverse impact of increasing the likelihood of guilty men going free."" In a victim impact statement, Mahad Cassim, who was wrongly convicted of raping Beale in 2010, told the court he had been hugely affected by the false claim. ""One of my goals is to be a successful businessman, to have a nice family and be happy,"" he said. ""I am working on the happiness - I have a long way to go."" Beale had also falsely claimed she was groped by a stranger, Noam Shahzad, in a pub in July 2012. She alleged she was then gang-raped by him and other men, and even self-inflicted injuries to back up her claims she was assaulted with barbed wire. The following year Beale fabricated similar allegations against six other men. She claimed two strangers sexually assaulted her and said she was gang raped again, by four others, two months later.

"Embassy staff noticed symptoms late last year At least 16 US government employees were treated for symptoms after a possible acoustic attack targeting embassy staff in Cuba, the state department says. US media reports say the symptoms range from hearing loss to ""mild traumatic brain injury"", which could include concussion or headaches. A spokeswoman said the attacks seemed to have stopped. Cuba denied involvement and said it was investigating the reports. The attacks werefirst reported earlier this monthwhen the US expelled two Cuban diplomats from Washington. But it was not clear until Thursday how many US employees had been affected. TheAssociated Press reports,externalthat the sonic devices used may have been emitting inaudible sound waves that can cause deafness. ""We can confirm that at least 16 US government employees, members of our embassy community, have experienced some kind of symptoms,"" State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. ""We take the situation extremely seriously,"" she added. Cuba country profile Four takeaways from Trump's Cuba policy US and Cuba announce embassies Intense sound can cause structural damage to the receptor hair cells in the inner ear which convert sound into brain activity. There is also evidence that noise exposure can lead to degeneration of the nerve fibres that make contact with the hair cells, which means that even if the hair cells remain intact, the transmission of information to the brain can be disrupted. However, frequencies that are inaudible to humans do not transmit much mechanical energy to the ear's sensitive parts, and so experts believe that it would be difficult to use them to damage hearing. There is limited evidence that exposure to ultrasonic sounds above the range of human hearing may be associated with symptoms such as excessive fatigue, headache and irritation. A German study has also found that the ear may be temporarily more prone to damage after being exposed to low-frequency sounds. US embassy staff and at least one Canadian began to notice symptoms late last year. The victims, some of whom have been withdrawn from Cuba, have been treated in the US and by US doctors in Cuba. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has described the incident as a ""health attack"". The incidents appeared to continue even after the US staff complained of them and as the Cuban authorities were investigating the cause, the BBC's Will Grant in Havana says. There are currently investigations under way by the Americans, the Canadians and the Cubans, and security has been stepped up around the diplomats' residences in Havana. Security analysts believe a third country with hostile relations with the US may be involved but no clear picture has yet been established. Washington and Havana only re-established ties in 2015, following 50 years of hostilities between the two countries.

"This video can not be played Martyn Hettâs sister gets 11 A* GCSEs The sister of Manchester bomb victim Martyn Hett has been described as a ""hero"" for getting 11 A*s in her GCSEs. Martyn, 29, from Stockport, wasone of 22 people who diedwhen a homemade bomb was detonated after an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena on 22 May. Nikita, 16, took an exam the day after finding out her brother had died, while the family were ""completely numb"". She said: ""I didn't want to let what's happened stop me. Martyn would want me to do it and do it well."" Martyn Hett was one of 22 people who were killed in the Manchester Arena attack Nikita, who took other exams in the days after the terror attack, said: ""Loads of people were at my house so I sort of wanted to get out anyway."" She thinks Martyn would've been very pleased with her results. ""He'd be so happy, he'd be tweeting about it. He'd be more excited than I am,"" she said. Her brother Dan Hettsaid on Twitter,externalshe was ""an actual hero"" and ""the toughest person I have ever met"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

I couldn't understand why, I didn't even know what day it was at that point, it had been such a horrific few days."" He said he was ""utterly amazed"" and ""floored"" the Stockport Grammar School pupil was putting her shoes on ""so she could go and sit a bunch of GCSEs"". In a series of tweet, he wrote: ""Under the most horrific conditions, after going through (and continuing to go through) it all, [Nikita] didn't skip a beat...Sleeves rolled up, get it done. Nothing wasted despite it all."" ""I have never been more proud or amazed by anyone. In conclusion: my kid sister is the toughest person I have ever met. don't mess with her. Be inspired."" Crowds gathered outside Stockport Town Hall for Martyn Hett's funeral Nikita told the Press Association she was halfway through her exams when the attack happened. ""When we didn't know where [Martyn] was, I was just thinking that I should probably revise just in case we found him. ""I thought if we did find out [he had died] I won't end up doing it but, just in case we find out he's fine and it's a misunderstanding, I should probably revise."" Allow Twitter content?

"New footage has been published of the ""traingate"" journey that triggered a row involving Jeremy Corbyn and Sir Richard Branson last year. A year ago, Mr Corbyn was filmed sitting on the floor of a train he said was ""ram-packed"". Virgin Trains then released CCTV images and footage it said showed the Labour leader walking past empty seats. In the newly-released CCTV, people can be seen sitting on the floor between the carriages. It was released by pro-Corbyn filmmaker Yannis Mendez, whose original film of the Labour leader sitting on the floor sparked the debate. Mr Mendez made a request to Virgin for the CCTV in which he featured, and it has now beenpublished,externalby his Double Down News company. How Twitter reacted to Branson v Corbyn Virgin challenges Corbyn train claim The clash between the rail operator and Mr Corbyn's team took place during last summer's Labour leadership contest. After Mr Corbyn used the overcrowding on the service to make his case for rail renationalisation, Virgin responded, saying he had walked past available seats and managed to find somewhere to sit later on. On social media, where it has been shared thousands of times, supporters of the Labour leader have said the latest film backs up his comments about overcrowding on the London to Newcastle service. ""These are the CCTV clips Richard Branson didn't show you,"" the voiceover says, to footage of people sitting and lying on the floor between carriages. The film also highlights that people could be seen sitting in some - although not all - of the apparently empty seats Mr Corbyn walked past. Mr Corbyn said he was experiencing a problem that was common to commuters When questioned by journalists at the height of the row last year, the Labour leader said he had been looking for two empty seats together so he could sit with his wife. Virgin Trains has not disputed the service was crowded but said at the time it took issue with the suggestion Mr Corbyn had been unable to find a seat. Neither Virgin Trains nor the Labour leadership have commented on the latest video.

"GCSE passes have dropped slightly across the range of subjects, with some dramatic changes in new, tougher exams sat for the first time in England. Overall in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, passes (grades C/4 and above) dropped 0.6 percentage points to 66.3%. In England, the English literature pass-rate fell 2.2 percentage points to 72.4%. In maths it dropped from 71.4 to 70.7%. Both are  new, tougher exams. Exam boards said this year's results were broadly consistent with last year. But the exams regulator Ofqual says a pass or grade 4 in maths would have been achieved in the upper tier paper with just 18% of the overall marks. For a grade 9, a 79% mark was required, while for a grade 7 - the equivalent of an A - candidates needed just over half marks. There has been a particular focus on this maths GCSE, with many students posting concerns online about the exam after they sat it. Ofqual explained the higher tier paper caters for more able students and starts with with grade 4 or pass mark level questions, adding that the 18% pass mark reflected this. Exam boards insist that standards have been held steady, despite complaints by some students and teachers about a lack of textbooks and practice papers. They explained the fall in the pass rate for the English literature GCSE in England by saying this year's cohort had had slightly lower prior attainment. The proportion of entries receiving the top grades (A/7 or above) has also fallen, to 20%, down 0.5 percentage points on last year. This is the lowest since 2007, when the figure was 19.5% How the new GCSE grading system works GCSE dilemma? We answer your questions Top grade 9 student says he's 'in shock' Nine things about nine things Half a million pupils are getting their results, amid a switch to a new numerical grading system and tougher exams in England. In each of the three new O-level-style GCSE subjects - English, English literature and maths - a new top grade 9 has been created. Some 3.2% of papers were awarded this grade in English literature, 2.2% in English language and 3.5% in maths. Exam boards revealed that 2,000 extremely able candidates got a 9 in all three new exams. There were 50,000 grade 9s overall - two-thirds of which were girls. The regulator said the percentage of passes would be kept the same as under the old system, in the interest of fairness, but some experts say the new exams are the toughest since the late 1980s. Others have complained the new 9 to 1 grading system would be confusing for parents, admissions tutors and employers. Under this system, an A is equivalent to a 7 while a C is anchored at the bottom of a grade 4. The reason for introducing three bands - 7 to 9  - instead of just A* and A at the top end  - was to give more detail about the highest-achieving candidates. This year's GCSE candidates in England, about 90% overall, are the first to sit the exams after the changes pushed by former Education Secretary Michael Gove. Schools Minister Nick Gibb said pupils and teachers were already rising to the challenge. He highlighted that more than 50,000 top 9 grades had been awarded across the new GCSEs and more than two-thirds of entries had secured at least a standard pass. This video can not be played What do new GCSE grades mean for employers? This year also marks a divergence in qualifications between the nations, with candidates in England, Wales and Northern Ireland now all studying different exams. In Wales, exams in English, Welsh and maths (six GCSEs in total) have also been toughened, but the qualification is still taken in units. New GCSEs in other subjects are being phased in. Here GCSE results for A* to C grades fell sharply by 3.8 percentage points to 62.8% compared to 66.6% in 2016. Exams watchdog Qualifications Wales says changing entry patterns have contributed to the fall. In Northern Ireland, where pupils are generally sitting old-style GCSEs in all subjects this year, results have improved here again, with one in 10 entries being awarded an A*. Pupils in Scotland already sit a completely different set of exams. Sally Collier, chief regulator at England's exams watchdog, said the results reflected ""years of careful planning"". She said the new qualifications had allowed students ""to better demonstrate their abilities"" and had ""better prepared them for further study, if that is their choice"". Under pressure: Candidates have been sitting some new, tougher exams in England and Wales She added that the regulator had required exam boards to use the same system on comparable outcomes to ensure fairness: ""If a student receives a grade 7 today, they could have expected to have received a grade A last year. ""And if they get a grade 4, they could have expected to get a grade C in 2016."" But Alan Smithers, an exams expert at Buckingham University, said in order to create equivalence between new grades and old, the number of marks required for a pass had been dropped at various levels. ""In some cases, it's dropped them very low, it's more or less giving away the grade."" Secondary school heads have expressed concern about increased stress and anxiety among pupils taking these exams and that is expected to intensify next year. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said he was concerned to see a decline in the pass rate overall and feared that this may be the result of driving children down this narrow academic route. The more challenging GCSEs were putting severe pressure on young people, he added. His organisation will be carrying out a ""post-mortem"" on the results and exams experience with Ofqual. It also pledged to talk to the Department for Education about how the impact of these much tougher exams on young people can be mitigated.

"Ines Alves also gained top marks in her maths and Spanish exams A teenager who sat her chemistry GCSE the day after she escaped from the Grenfell Tower fire has been awarded an A grade in the subject. Ines Alves, who lived on the 13th floor, fled the blazing block holding her chemistry notes and sat the exam in the clothes she left in. Speaking at her school in Hammersmith, the 16-year-old said she was ""quite happy"" with her grades. She also gained top marks in maths and Spanish. The teenager now plans to study chemistry, maths, economics and sociology when she starts her A-levels later this year. GCSE passes dip after tougher exams Grenfell Tower pupils enjoy 'good day' In the days after the fire, Ines missed exams in history, RE and physics which has affected her overall grades. ""I wish I did more, but then again, I don't know... For the exams I missed, I didn't do too well in them overall [the subjects],"" she said. This video can not be played ""The first thing I grabbed was my Chemistry notes"": Ines, 16, on sitting her GCSE the day after the fire Sacred Heart High School headteacher Marian Doyle called her results ""fantastic"".

Ines said she sat her chemistry paper that morning as ""there was no point me carrying on watching the building burning"". Her family are currently living in a hotel as they wait to be offered a permanent home.

"Samrita Hayer, of the National Careers Service, and Catherine Sezen, of the Association of Colleges, answer your questions If your GCSE results are proving a problem and you don't know what to do next, we have experts on hand to answer your questions. With more options than ever open to teenagers in terms of education, training. apprenticeships and jobs, it is crucial to get good advice. Samrita Hayer, an adviser with the National Careers Service, and Catherine Sezen, a senior curriculum expert at the Association of Colleges, are offering personalised advice on what to do if your grades are different to what you were expecting. Hi Edward, I am sorry to hear that your results were not what you were expecting. The good news is that there are many options post-16: A-levels, a vocational or technical qualification or an apprenticeship.â I would recommend going into your local FE college, staff there will be able to give you advice on your options with the grades that you have achieved. I am sure that you will find something that is of interest. Catherine Hi Wendy, First, congratulations to your son on gaining a 5 in his English literature. As the grading system has changed, the 3 in English language means that your son has achieved a D/E. Therefore, it could be beneficial for him to resit his English language. This could be useful when applying for courses and getting into employment. English resits can be done in November. I would suggest speaking to the school to gain further information in regards to this. Your son could also look into retaking this GCSE alongside his further education course; the course provider will be able to provide you further information on this option. Best of luck, Samrita Hi Haydar, Predicted grades are used to measure the progress of an individual student, and this is what the teachers believe you can achieve. Your actual grades are what you have achieved, and you can use these to plan your next steps in education. In relation to further education, you may find it helpful to ask to the school or college you would like to attend if it will accept you with the grades you achieved. They decide who is accepted on their courses, and it is common for them to receive questions about acceptance when students receive their results. I hope you will be able to speak to them soon. Good luck, Samrita Hi Lilly, Well done in achieving a grade 4.  I would suggest that you speak to your school or college about the level 5 required for economics. They will be able to explain why they have that entry requirement and be able to advise you on the best options for you. Perhaps there would be another A-level you could take. A-level economics will have a lot of maths content and the school or college experience may indicate that a level 5 is needed. Catherine Hi Valerie, Congratulations on your grade 7s in English language and literature. If you achieved a 3 or a D in maths you will have the opportunity to retake it at college. I would suggest that you contact your college and they will advise you about whether the D or 3 in maths will impact on the course you need to take. I am sure that they will ensure that you are on a course that is right for you.  Good luck! Catherine Hi Liam, Many students feel this way and it is important not to give up! You could ask for extra support from your teachers or even look into getting a private tutor. Extra support could help you work out exactly what it is that you are struggling with. This may also help you get the pass that most employers and training providers look for. Alternatively you can look at  GCSE equivalents such as a functional skills course. Our helpline on 0800 100 900 can tell you what your options are. Good luck, Samrita Hi Ruth, First of all well done to your son on achieving 6s in maths and English literature. Government guidance states that if a student has achieved a 4 or above in English literature and or English language he or she is exempted from retaking English post 16 as English literature acts as a proxy for English language. Catherine Hi Peter, Your son's results are very good and I hope that he got the results that he needs to go onto the post-16 course of his choice. However, if he feels that he would like a remark for any of the subjects it would be a good idea for him to talk it through with the school. They will be able to give a fair view of whether his results were as expected or whether he should consider any remarks. Catherine Hi Chris, Have you been to collect your results slips from your school? All the information that is available to your school should be on the results slips. If you have any further questions I am sure that your school will be able to advise. Catherine Hi Alex, In England, individuals under 18 who have not passed English and maths GCSE must continue to work towards the qualification alongside further education studies or as a separate resit. A 3 is equivalent to a D/E grade while grade 4 is seen as a low pass and a grade 5 as a strong pass. Most employers and training providers look for the A-C/9-4  in maths. You might findthe government's GCSE factsheet,externalfor parents useful. I would also suggest speaking to the school to gain some further information on next steps. I hope this helps, Samrita Hi Vaitheke, Requesting a GCSE remark will be done by your school or college, but it comes with a fee that you or your family may have to cover. You could speak to a teacher or the examinations officer at your school to look into getting a remark for your maths paper as they will be aware of the next steps. Best of luck, Samrita Hi Umayr, Firstly, congratulations on your results. The options available will all depend on what you want to do next. It will probably be useful for you to resit English as the 3 you have gained is the equivalent of a D/E grade and most employers and training providers look for at least a grade 4. If you are interested in further education courses, you could speak to the college or sixth form that you wish to attend and ask them if you can retake English alongside their course. For further guidance, contact our helpline on 0800 100 900. Samrita Hi Liam, Most further education course providers and future employers look for passes in English and maths GCSEs. As the college set the entry requirements you should ask them if you can re-sit these GCSEs alongside the course, or if you would need to gain them to get onto the course. Good luck, Samrita Hi Abdullah, It's likely that these GCSEs will need to be taken again either through a re-sit or alongside the diploma you would like to do. Contact the college for information about your options. All the best, Samrita. Hi Ismail, In order to resit your English language GCSE in November you will have had to have taken it in June. The exam boards all aim to be equally robust to ensure an equal playing field whichever board's exam you sit.  If you are resitting your GCSE at a school or college they will be able to tell you which exam board they use.  Good luck! Catherine Hi Marie, I am sorry to hear that you didn't get the grade you wanted for your English exam. I would suggest that you speak to your teachers at college. They will be able to advise you about next steps and how they can best support you. Catherine Hi Mahmoud, Universities have different entry requirements depending on the course. Most course providers and future employers accept a C grade as a pass but it is difficult to say for definite if you would get a university acceptance. You could also contact our helpline on 0800 100 900 for further guidance. I hope this helps, Samrita. Hi Don, It would be a good idea to speak to your son's school about what extra support teachers can give to help him pass his GCSE English next year. Another option could be to get a private tutor if your son feels he would find this helpful.

"Tian Tian was artificially inseminated earlier this year The UK's only female panda, Tian Tian, is believed to be pregnant, according to Edinburgh Zoo. A spokesman for the zoo said it was hard to predict a specific date for any cub being born, and that the breeding season can last until late September. Tian Tian, who arrived at the zoo as part of a breeding pair with Yang Guang in 2011, was artificially inseminated earlier this year. The zoo said she was being closely monitored. This is the fifth time Tian Tian has been artificially inseminated. She had previously given birth to twins in China but all attempts to produce a cub at Edinburgh Zoo have failed. A spokesman for RZSS Edinburgh Zoo said: ""Giant panda breeding is a very complicated process but we believe that Tian Tian is pregnant. ""Although a specific date was suggested, like all babies it's hard to predict precisely and the panda breeding season can last until late September. ""Tian Tian is being closely monitored by our expert team and we will be the first to share any news as soon as we can."" A spokesman for animal rights campaigners OneKind said: ""This poor panda cub will never be introduced to the wild and will only ever know a life in captivity. ""To make matters worse, to produce a cub, Tian Tian has been subjected to repeated invasive procedures since coming to Edinburgh. ""This has not been in the interest of pandas or conservation, and appears instead to be driven by the pursuit of PR and gate fees. ""If you want to help pandas, you don't need to go and see one at a zoo. Just make a donation to conservation charities conserving pandas in their natural habit instead."" News of the pregnancy came to light after documents were released to the Edinburgh Evening News under the Freedom of Information Act. If a cub was born, it would be returned to China at the age of two - mimicking natural dispersal age in the wild. At birth, a cub is just 1,000th of its mother's weight at about 5.3oz (150g). Giant panda foetuses do not start to develop until the final weeks of gestation Panda cubs are born pink and covered in short, sparse white hair, their eyes are tightly shut and they cry loudly and often Their black patches start to appear at about one week old, followed by black hair on the patches a few weeks later It is several weeks before they can crawl and cubs spend the first few weeks of life vocalising their needs to their mother, sleeping and suckling Panda mothers lick their cubs often and do not leave the cub to eat bamboo until offspring are three to four weeks old. At this point the cubs can regulate their body temperatures and do not need constant body contact from the mother to keep warm After a month, the cub looks much more like a miniature adult giant panda but with a longer tail Baby pandas' eyes open partly after 30 to 45 days and fully open a week or two later Panda cubs grow to up to 10 times their birth weight in the first five to six weeks Panda reproduction is a notoriously difficult process, with females only ovulating once a year. Tian Tian (Sweetie) and Yang Guang (Sunshine) are the only giant pandas living in the UK. They arrived on loan from China in December 2011 and are due to remain at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade. The zoo first announced it was in negotiations to bring a pair of giant pandas to Scotland in 2008. The pair were brought to the UK under a historic agreement between the UK and Chinese governments. Described as a gift from China, they were the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years.

"Angelo Quirino was on holiday in Italy with his family when he died The family of a four-year-old boy from Manchester who died when he was crushed to death by an electric gate are ""devastated"", a friend has said. Angelo Quirino, whose parents are Italian, died in the accident at a rented villa in Italy on Saturday. Family friend Imma Totaro said the grief for his parents Amadeo and Roberta was ""beyond words"". An online appeal has been set up by Ms Totaro to help raise funds for the family. Ms Totaro said Angelo was playing with his elder brother Diego in Anzio when the gate fell on him. ""Roberta and Amadeo are devastated. I received an email from Roberta who said she can't even speak. It is beyond words,"" she said. Ms Totaro said the couple, who have three children, came to Manchester three years ago. ""They had a little girl, Linda, eight months ago.  Roberta was so happy that she had had a girl and now this has happened,"" she said. Police in Anzio are investigating how the accident occurred Mrs Quirino was holidaying near relatives when the accident occurred. Her husband, who works as a croupier in Manchester, flew immediately to Italy to be with his family. ""The flights are expensive at this time of year especially at short notice,"" Ms Totaro said. ""Such a thing should never happen to anyone. The community of moms in Manchester decided to raise funds to help."" Mayor of Anzio,Luciano Bruschini,external, said the family's vacation ""unfortunately turned into a tragedy that shocked our community."" The cause of the accident is being investigated by police in the city, a council spokeswoman confirmed. Mr Bruschini said: ""A sweet angel was here just to enjoy his time and suddenly a perfect vacation day has turned into tragedy.

"Theodore Silvester's death was ""tragic accident"", a coroner concluded A five-year-old boy choked to death on a sausage roll during his school lunch break, an inquest has heard. Theodore Silvester died after being taken illat Anlaby Primary School in Hull on 3 February. Senior coroner Prof Paul Marks ruled his death was ""a tragic accident"" and praised those who tried to save him. Hull Coroner's Court heard ""established and proven techniques"" were used to try and dislodge the food from the boy's airway. More on this and other Hull stories Teachers were alerted to Theodore choking on his lunch in the school dinner hall at midday by another five-year-old pupil, the inquest heard. Staff immediately started slapping his back and the infant was said to be gasping for air as they administered first aid. Anlaby Primary School's head teacher said all connected to the site were ""deeply saddened"" In a statement, one teacher described how she saw colour return to his face while she held his hand, but the food had passed to his lower airways which prevented him from breathing. An ambulance was called and he was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary where he was pronounced dead shortly before 13:00 GMT. A statement by Theodore's mum, Katie Silvester, was read out in court describing him as ""a charmer"" who loved books, cars and superheroes. ""He is my baby and always will be. He was only with us a short time but he has left an empty void for all his family and friends. ""Everyone will think of his beautiful smile. He is our life and soul and he brightened every room."" Following Theodore's death, floral tributes poured in for the ""very happy little chap"" In a statement, head teacher Gareth May said the death was ""a terrible tragedy"" and thanked everyone ""who made desperate efforts to save him"". ""We will always remember Theo as a happy, laughing child, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family.""

"This video can not be played Kim Wall's death: What we know so far Prosecutors in Denmark say they will bring murder charges against the inventor suspected of killing a Swedish journalist on board his submarine. They are expected to ask for the new charges when Mr Madsen appears in court in early September. Ms Wall was last seen alive on 10 August as she departed with Mr Madsen on his self-built underwater vessel. On Wednesday a headless torso found in waters off Denmark was identified as belonging to Ms Wall. DNA from the torso - which had been weighted down with metal - matched that on Ms Wall's hairbrush and toothbrush. An âexceptionalâ journalist remembered What we know Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Mr Madsen initially said he had dropped her off safely near Copenhagen, but then said she died in an accident and that he had ""buried"" her at sea. He denies killing Ms Wall and was initially charged with negligent manslaughter. Danish police believe Mr Madsen deliberately sank the 40-tonne submarine hours after the search for Ms Wall began. Her partner had reported that she had not returned from the trip. Part of her remains were found on a beach south of Copenhagen on Monday.

"Lawrence Schofield is about to embark on A-levels in double maths, physics and chemistry Lawrence Schofield is one of only 2,000 students in England to get 9s in English, English literature and maths, the top possible in the new system. ""Very happy - but somewhat in shock,"" is the way the 16-year-old described himself after opening his results at his school in Horsham. He also achieved A*s in all his other subjects, which are still marked under the old system. ""Staying positive and trying not to panic,"" are his tips for doing well. Overall, just under 50,000 9s were awarded to candidates - but only 2,000 students scored a clean sweep of 9s in English, English literature and maths. At the top, in the new GCSEs there are now three grades - 7, 8 and 9 - compared with two under the old system. A* results are now split into 8s and 9s. So, a lower proportion of candidates have achieved a 9 than gained A*s under the traditional A*-G grading system. Early figures suggest: 3.5% of entries - 18,617 in total - scored a 9 In English, 2.6% of entries - 13, 754 in total - scored a 9 In English literature, 3.3% - 17,187 in total - scored a 9 Girls outperformed boys in grade 9s in both English GCSEs Boys did better in maths. The new grading system is being rolled out as new GCSEs in other subjects are brought in over the next two years. Lawrence says he was ""amazingly lucky"" to attendTanbridge House School,externalin Horsham, West Sussex, but  as it only goes up to age 16 he will move on to the local sixth-form college for A-levels in double maths, physics and chemistry. The aim of the new grading system, which currently only applies to these three  key subjects, is to allow more differentiation between the brightest candidates. It is also part of the government's strategy to make GCSEs more rigorous and challenging. But Andrew Halls, head master of the private King's College, Wimbledon, where half the Year 11s achieved 10 or more top grade results, warned against a pursuit of perfection at GCSE. He said: ""There is misplaced anxiety about the new grade 9s in GCSEs. ""I am hopeful these will be rare enough to help teach our pupils an essential lesson in life: perfection should never be our incentive in life. ""We need to understand that human beings and human achievements are flawed. ""Exam results are very important but they are not the sole purpose of education, nor the final means of assessing the value of a child."" Even high-flying Lawrence says that when he was doing the exams he tried not to think about the results. ""You have to try not to panic because it allows you to be more creative during the exam. ""You just do your best and stay positive,"" he says. ""It might flow or it might completely fall apart."" He says that when the exams were over he completely put them out of his head until results day. ""What's done is done,"" he says.

"A huge volume of honey oozed through the couple's bathroom ceiling A gigantic bee hive has been removed from a house after the owners noticed honey ""oozing"" through from their loft. Hundreds of bees were found at the grade II listed 18th Century house, in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, earlier in August. The homeowners, who did not want to be identified, found the ""sticky substance"" near a light fitting. Heritage insurers Ecclesiastical said its bee expert cut a hole in the ceiling and made the ""surprising"" find. Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands Hundreds of bees had built quite an ""impressive home"" in the loft A spokeswoman for the company said: ""The couple noticed a patch [and] on closer inspection they could see that the substance was sticky and coming through the light fixtures. ""They [also] noticed a lot of bees around the house and at this point sought an expert view. ""The bees expert made a hole in the ceiling and discovered the huge hive."" The company said due to the sheer volume of honey the claim had to be treated in a similar way to water damage, often caused by old pipe work. The insurers normally deal with water damage claims in older homes A spokeswoman from the British Beekeepers Association said it was a ""well established"" colony and had probably been there for a long period of time. She added that certain bee species ""love high up dark spaces"". The hive was removed and the ceiling repaired, the cost of which has not been disclosed.

"Sophie Lancaster was just 20 when she was kicked to death by teenage boys - all because she was a goth. Ten years on, have attitudes changed or are young people scared to be different? On the evening of 11 August 2007 Sophie and her boyfriend Robert Maltby were walking through Stubbylee Park in Bacup, Lancashire, when they were both attacked and left for dead. Robert woke from his coma a week later but Sophie never did. With dreadlocked hair, dark clothing and piercings, the pair were ""singled out, not for anything they said or did, but because of their dress"", the chief crown prosecutor for Lancashire said at the time. The outcome of the attack shocked the public, but for those like Sophie and Robert, there was a feeling of inevitability. ""I've been called freak, gay and transvestite, among other things, by random people in the street,"" says Nathan Slack. Now 36 and living in London, he remembers the experience of growing up a goth in March, Cambridgeshire, around the time Sophie was killed. ""I had objects hurled at me from cars, my own car was vandalised after I was threatened with physical violence and I was spat at in the street,"" he says. Throughout his experiences, Nathan Slack kept his alternative style For Robert Shread, the abuse he received for how he dressed was even more brutal. When he was 18, he was attacked as he left an alternative nightclub in Portsmouth, where people who judged others for their lifestyle were waiting nearby. ""I was jumped by a couple of trendy guys who apparently wanted to know what time it was,"" he says. ""The guys knocked me down and started kicking me in the head until I passed out."" Robert woke up two days later unable to recall the events of the night. Because of the beating, he lost a year and a half of his memory, including any recollection of his girlfriend. ""It completely changed me,"" he said. ""I used to be a lot more outgoing. It's the root of the generalised anxiety disorder that I'm having to deal with today. ""Going outside is terrifying and that in itself is frustrating. I still expect strangers to attack me for no reason."" Robert Shread lost his memory after being attacked, but has continued to dress alternatively Matthew Sly, 34, remembers similar experiences when growing up in Tadley, Hampshire. ""I know I was lucky I was only attacked once,"" he says. ""I've always been about 6ft 1in and when people want to attack those for how they look, they tend to want to know what the outcome will be. ""I would still get shouts in the street though and it happened to a lot of people I knew. You just had to be prepared for it and we got used to it."" When talking to young people growing up today who dress in goth and alternative clothing, it seems there is still a battle to fight. The parents of 16-year-old Hannah Foxton took her out of school because of how bad her experiences were. ""I was really into the Mighty Boosh TV show and had a bag from it, which was quite alternative,"" she says. ""A couple of girls started calling me names and shouting at me. ""It then got worse and they tried to push me out into the highway. I just broke down in tears."" Hannah Foxton left school in year nine because of her experiences Hannah said she tried to change her look to ""fit in"" but it led to a loss of confidence. ""I just wouldn't leave the flat for months... Any time I went outside, I had panic attacks. It was brutal."" It was only when she moved to Nottingham that she felt she could finally be who she wanted to be. ""I needed to be happy and get that confidence back,"" she says. ""Yes, I still get the odd stare and shout of 'Satan' but I also get compliments."" Despite coming from a large city with a strong musical past, Luke Daley, 19, has been subjected to violence in Liverpool. ""School was always full of people shouting stuff, telling me to 'stop cutting myself', but that I could deal with,"" he says. ""It's outside of school, when you just don't know if someone will look at you and start something."" Luke Daley was attacked in a shopping centre because of how he dresses Luke was attacked at a shopping centre, but after being punched in the stomach, he and his girlfriend got away. Another of his friends was not so lucky. ""I know a lad who dresses a bit goth and a bit glam who ended up in critical care,"" he says. ""He had his head split open with a crowbar after being attacked by five other lads because of what he was wearing. ""What happened to Sophie isn't alien to me. It is only 20 or 30 miles down the road. I am kind of used to it but only because if I let it affect me, I could never leave the house. I am not locking myself away though."" Sophie's mum Sylvia knows what the community has gone through. Her daughter had been attacked three times before and she had witnessed her being abused. Sylvia Lancaster now campaigns against prejudice ""When I was out on the streets with Sophie, I would hear people's comments,"" she says. ""I would hear them say 'look at the state of that' or 'what does she look like'. ""I remember going into one shop and the look they gave her. After they had spoken to her for five minutes, that went as they realised she was actually quite a lovely little thing, but it was funny to see that. ""I would always think, how dare you judge somebody on the way they look?"" In her daughter's memory, Sylvia has set up a charity - The Sophie Lancaster Foundation - to help prevent the prejudices and experiences many goths go through. Using her experience as a youth worker she goes into schools to talk to people about their judgements and to try to show them the consequences. ""Young people are not stupid and sometimes we demonise them. Actually what we need to do is talk to them properly."" Sophie's family released this photo of her before she died on 24th August 2007 Sylvia's campaign has seen her receive support from around the world and appointed an OBE. Her efforts have also had a real effect. Attacking someone for being part of an alternative subculture is now recognised as a hate crime. Greater Manchester Police was the first force in the UK to treat such offences in that way, raising awareness that attacks would not be tolerated and could lead to longer sentences. Since bringing in the policy in 2013, almost 100 incidents - ranging from verbal abuse to physical attacks - have been reported to them. Sgt Kathryn Crompton, who leads the neighbourhoods, confidence and equality team at GMP - and worked closely with Sylvia on the policy - said: ""The judge in Sophie's murder trial stated that he felt it was a hate crime. ""The legacy of that is that forces, not just Greater Manchester, are recognising that people are targeted for being different. ""And whatever reason we are different, the message is the same - we should celebrate people's differences not target them."" On the 10th anniversary of the attack on Sophie, 15,000 people - including her family - gathered in a field in Derbyshire for the annual Bloodstock Open Air festival. The heavy metal event has been a haven for alternative people since it began in 2005 and the organisers have worked closely with Sophie's family, naming one of its stages after her. ""The importance for us is that the awareness is permanent,"" says Vicky Hungerford, one of the festival's organisers. ""It still happens in our community. They face violence in the streets, and we hear about it from our fans. It is something we can never stop campaigning about and we will make sure Sophie is never forgotten.""

"There are so many important headlines in theAugust migration datathat it is difficult to know where to begin. Let's start with the biggie - is there a Brexit effect that is frightening workers off from the British economy? Anecdotally, many of us who report on this field have picked up these stories. I spoke to a lot of Eastern European workers around the time of the general election who were rather nervous but somewhat resigned to Brexit. But not many of them suggested to me they were going to get on the first budget flight back home. But today's data gives us a really good glimpse into the thousands of individual decisions that ordinary people make about their future. Net migration - that's the difference between the number of immigrants coming in for a year or more and the number of people who emigrate - has fallen substantially since the referendum. In March 2016, weeks out from the vote, it stood at almost 330,000. Today it is 81,000 down at 246,000 people - the lowest it has been for three years. Big net migration fall since Brexit vote Non-EU students 'not staying illegally' Food firms warn of EU worker shortage Theestimates from the Office for National Statistics,externalshow that two-thirds of this fall in net migration is accounted for by changes in EU migration, and particularly by citizens of Eastern and Central Europe. In the year to the end of March, fewer EU nationals arrived to live in the UK than in the previous 12 months - and there was an acceleration in the numbers leaving. When you look at the figures for the 10 nations of Eastern and Central Europe, we can see that 62,000 of their citizens said ""do widzenia"" (""goodbye"") to the UK while 26,000 fewer of them arrived. When you drill down further, net migration from the A8 nations (Poland and others which joined the EU in 2004) has dropped very sharply. In the year to March 2016, 39,000 more of these citizens arrived than left. In the year to March 2017, that had crashed to just 7,000. Interestingly, notes Prof Jonathan Portes of King's College London, these figures show, for the first time, a stabilising of arrivals from the eight Eastern European nations - and that suggests they no longer regard the UK as as attractive as it once was. ""Net migration from the A8 countries, which joined the EU in 2004, is now statistically insignificant for the first time since then,"" he says. ""Moreover, figures for National Insurance registrations, which measure new arrivals registering to work, also fell, with the number of EU nationals registering in April to June falling more than 12% on the same period a year earlier. ""These statistics confirm that Brexit is having a significant impact on migration flows, even before we have left the EU or any changes are made to law or policy."" For its part, the ONS is cautioning that it's too early to say this is a long-term trend. So are there other factors beyond a suspected Brexit effect? Since the Brexit referendum, the falls in the pound on currency markets mean that money made in the UK buys less back home. This is really important for workers who are sending cash back to their families - and a decisive factor in decisions to move all around the world. Last June, the pound bought almost 6 Polish zlotys. Today, it buys only 4.6 zlotys. What's more, when people choose to move to another country, they're not just looking at the circumstances there, but, fairly obviously, at the conditions at home. And there is no doubt that for some EU workers, coming to the UK isn't the slam-dunk deal it once was. The Polish economy, for example, has one of the strongest growth rates in the EU and its government is lobbying workers to stay at home, rather than take their skills elsewhere. Whatever the precise factors, the government will want to present all this as a victory for its strategy and progress towards its net migration target. And while campaigners for falls will be buoyed by the statistics - some are urging caution. ""This is a step forward but it is largely good fortune,"" says Lord Green, chairman of Migrationwatch UK, a pressure group. ""It is mainly due to a reduction in the huge net inflow of East Europeans from 100,000 to 50,000. This should not obscure the fact that migration remains at an unacceptable level of a quarter of a million a year with massive implications for the scale and nature of our society."" That's a pointer to the scale of the challenge ministers still face, if they are determined to stick to their target. Net migration from the rest of the world still stands at 180,000 people a year - and that is the one part of policy that the UK can currently completely control. The August figures have also revealed some fascinating truths about migration, and people's intentions, that until now have been subjected to myth, fears and an awful lot of speculation - do people leave the UK when they should? Well, we don't really know - or at least we didn't until now. The ONS uses a large rolling survey at ports to estimate immigration and emigration - but it's only as good as a survey can be - it has limitations. Now, we have ""exit checks"" data - figures derived from the scans of passports and so on as people leave the UK at our ports. And the figures from the Home Office show, for the first time, that the vast majority of visitors to the UK who require a visa leave the UK when they should. Exit check data indicates that 97.4% of international students comply with their visa requirements Some 1.34 million visas granted to non-EEA nationals expired in 2016-17. Of those people who had not already secured a legal reason to stay on, 96.3% departed in time. A further 0.4% left after their visa expired. It's not quite clear what happened to the remaining 3.3%. So, of all those visas, around 40,000 overstayed. And what's even more interesting are thefigures around students. International students have been a hot topic in the migration debate with some claiming that they habitually overstay their visas. Some of the predictions for student over-stayers have been enormous. The exit check data shows the rate of compliance - those who play by the rules - was 97.4%. And that suggests that assumptions about mass overstaying are either simply wrong or, alternatively, a thing of the past after a crackdown on bogus colleges.

"The more things change... the more things stay the same. A revolution has been announced for GCSEs in England, with tougher exams, a more stretching syllabus, no hiding behind coursework and standards that are higher than anything since the demise of the O-levels in the 1980s. But the results - give or take a fraction of a percentage point - are uncannily similar to last year. How does that happen? Of course, the most important thing about GCSE results is the individual pupils, their families and teachers. It's about hard work, long nights of revision and youngsters making the most of their opportunities, sometimes in tough circumstances. It's not about the statistical snowstorm that GCSE results coverage can too easily become. But how does the exam system deliver greater rigour and more difficult exams - and at the same time not see any significant change in grades? Pupils found out their GCSE results after the long wait The balancing act, if not a conjuring trick, is pulled off by changing the grade boundaries. The upper-tier maths paper might be pencil-chewingly difficult, but a grade-4 pass required a mark of only 18%. To get a grade 7, equivalent to an A grade, required a mark of 52%. The new ultra-high grade 9, for the very brightest students and meant to be much tougher than the old A*, required 79%. So, by adjusting the grade boundaries, the proportions getting the different grades can be kept constant with previous years. It's a bit like intellectual limbo, changing the height of the stick to decide how many get through. Professor Alan Smithers, from the University of Buckingham's Centre for Education and Employment Research, said this meant ""more or less giving away the grade"". Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton says there is something ""Alice in Wonderland"" about this pursuit of exams being much harder, but results being pegged as more or less the same. Mr Barton, head of the ASCL head teachers' union, questions whether this will remain sustainable - and asks how schools are able to show authentic progress, if year after year the grading system keeps holding everyone to the same level. He says he is no ""apologist"" for some of the weaknesses in the former content of GCSEs. But he says there needs to be a change in the ""mindset"" of what is expected from the exam system - and more transparency about how the final outcomes are constructed. ""We need to open up the rather surreal nature of what we're doing to make sure that results are consistent."" Lawrence Schofield got a top grade 9 in three subjects But in defence of the exam boards, the other side of the argument is that in a qualifications system that seems to face constant change, it would be very unfair if individual year groups suddenly faced a cliff-edge collapse in results. They need to be protected from the sudden changes in direction and shifting expectations. The exam regulator Ofqual says the ""boundaries were set using a combination of statistics and examiner judgment. We are confident that they reflect an appropriate standard of performance"". Exam boards and schools are also caught between a rock and a hard place with results. If results were to suddenly improve, there would be accusations of grade inflation and dumbing down. If results went sharply down, there would be claims of a collapse in standards and that schools were letting down their pupils. So, instead, the ""comparable outcome"" system keeps things in more or less the same place - constructing the results accordingly, so that they bob up each year in the same place, like a self-righting mechanism on a lifeboat. What does this mean for overall objective standards? What does it mean for international competition? How much is the exam system bent out of shape by political pressure? Even when it's about a maths exam, this is a day that's about more than such calculations. Families will have been sharing their own news headlines. There are congratulations and commiserations. And next year, it will start all over again, and we'll watch exam results nudge slightly upwards or downwards, as if of their own accord.

"The fibre made from the oranges can be blended with other yarns to make clothing From fashion to energy - the rind and seeds of Sicily's most famous citrus fruit, the humble orange, are being used in a range of greener, healthier business initiatives. In 2011, Adriana Santonocito was a design student in Milan when she first had the idea of making sustainable textiles from what was naturally abundant, and widely wasted, in her native Sicilian city of Catania. Her challenge was to find a way for the rinds of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of oranges to be put to good use. Now, thanks to her creative thinking, it is possible to make whole items of clothing using fibre that originated from the fruit. Ms Santonocito's concept was inspired by a question posed in her university dissertation. Could a luxurious silk foulard be made from citrus by-products, that would otherwise be thrown away or fed to cattle? Orange Fiber uses chemical reagents to separate the cellulose from the orange remains The question was particularly relevant in Sicily, where many thousands of tonnes of citrus fruit are juiced every year, leaving massive amounts of waste. The 39-year-old found her answer in the university's labs, and it earned her a patent. It was already known that cellulose could be extracted from orange rinds. But Ms Santonocito discovered that, using chemical reagents, it could then be turned into yarn, which could be dyed and blended with other textiles, such as cotton or polyester. Together with her university colleague Enrica Arena, she founded Orange Fiber in 2014, and set about selling the silk-like material to clothes-makers. Adriana and Enrica now head up a 12-strong team This year, the famous Italian fashion label Salvatore Ferragamo used it in its spring-summer collection. The aim was to make its high-end shirts, dresses and foulards more sustainable. Orange Fiber, which now has a team of 12 people, operates from a local juice-processing plant, where it gets its waste material for free. The business is partially seasonal, operating during the months of the year when the juice-maker works. But once the orange rind has been transformed into cellulose, it can be put in storage for use later. Antonio Perdichizzi, an early investor in Orange Fiber, says the firm stood out to him because, unlike most innovative start-ups in Italy, it isn't digital. Orange Fiber uses the rinds of juiced oranges ""Italy doesn't invest much in innovation, but brilliant ideas and skills win despite a lack of resources,"" he adds. Rosario Faraci, a professor of business, economics and management at the University of Catania, says the firm is an example of how ""creativity and entrepreneurial spirit"" is creating new jobs and businesses in the region. Oranges could also make baked goods healthier, and stay fresher, thanks to a new procedure which transforms them into an innovative fat-free flour. The new technique is currently being tested at the University of Catania and results are encouraging. At the moment, almost all bakers use fat, such as butter or margarine in their cooking. But according to the research, half of this fat could be replaced by using flour obtained from orange rinds, seeds, and part of the pulp not used in juice-making. Local bakers and pastry chefs in Acireale, near Catania, liked the new flour Like Orange Fiber, the researchers obtain the raw materials they need from local juice makers. They wash the rinds to remove the bitter flavour, then dry, process and whiten what remains. Salvatore Barbagallo, a professor of agriculture at the University of Catania, says the flour is ""perfectly sustainable"" and costs almost nothing to produce. It also has ""no impact"" on the taste and fragrance of food that contains it. More stories from the BBC'sBusiness Brainseries looking at quirky or unusual business topics from around the world: Elvis still earning a fortune 40 years after his death Can ice cream vans stage a comeback? The businesses capitalising on 24-hour sunlight Do you have to avoid huggers at work? The homeowners hiring out their houses as film sets His researchers made 300kg of the flour and got local bakers in Acireale, near Catania, to try it out. The cooks, known for being conservative about new ingredients, were all happy with the results and could taste no difference in their pastries. The new flour is soluble The researchers say they have found other uses for the flour, too. It is soluble and can be added to drinks to provide health benefits. It could also be used by nutritionists and in medicine. Sicilian farmers have always used orange rinds as animal feed or fertiliser. But oranges can be a precious source of energy as well. In Mussomeli, an ancient town near Caltanissetta in the middle of Sicily, orange waste products are used to make biogas which is turned into electricity. The farm Nuova Scala used about 16,430 tonnes of rinds last year to produce 24,000 kWh of electricity. Output varies depending on the amount of oranges produced, and the firm expects to get through 22,000 tonnes of orange waste in 2017. Disposing of oranges after they have been juiced can be expensive Of course, all of these projects depend on local fruit companies, which produce many thousands of tonnes of citrus by-products annually. Salvatore Imbesi, who owns the producer AgrumiGel, says the rinds, seeds and other non-edible parts of the fruit are called ""pastazzo"", and he produces about 40,000 tonnes of it a year. He says Sicily as a whole produces about 200,000 tonnes, although unofficial estimates suggest the real figure could be higher. Producers have an incentive to re-use pastazzo, because disposal can be expensive. Mr Imbesi says that in Sicily the total cost of disposal can reach 16m euros every year, ""six for the cost of the transport, and 10 for the disposal itself"". Some of Sicily's fruit is sold fresh, including its famous blood oranges, with the rest turned into juices. In 2016, the amount juiced included some 140,000 tonnes of lemons, 100,000 tonnes of blonde oranges, 100,000 tonnes of blood oranges, 20,000 tonnes of green mandarins and 20,000 tonnes of matured mandarins. Finally, thanks to the new crop of innovative solutions, the squeezed fruit are being turned from expensive waste into exciting products.

"Pop stars have always been clothes horses for fashion designers - but more and more of them are turning to designing themselves. So far this year, Skepta has released his debut fashion range and Zayn Malik's Versace Versus collection was unveiled. They join a list of musicians-turned-designers that already includes names like Victoria Beckham, Kanye West and Rihanna. But how easy is it for a pop star to become a successful designer in a world where, traditionally, you had to cut your teeth in the trade before your designs would hit the catwalk? Victoria Beckham has left her Spice Girls past behind Say goodbye to the artist formerly known as Posh Spice, and instead say hello to top British fashion designer Victoria Beckham. The former Spice Girl launched her first fashion range back in 2008, and it's fair to say there was a bit of sniggering and some raised eyebrows. But her first collection - a modest one containing just 10 dresses - went down a storm with critics. Nicole Phelpswrote in Vogue,external: ""The woman formerly known as Posh Spice has launched a dress collection, and, believe it or not, it's one of the hottest things going in New York this week."" And since then, Mrs Beckham has gone from strength to strength. Victoria Beckham is in with the fash pack - here she's pictured with Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of US Vogue ""With Victoria Beckham, everyone wanted to hate her and put her down and she learnt from the beginning how to do everything from scratch - now, she might not be able to pattern-cut but does that really matter?"" says Glamour's fashion director Natalie Hartley. ""Beckham is getting respect because right at the beginning, she really put her neck on the line. I remember the early days when she would do her shows in New York, she would talk you through the collections herself and she became very friendly with the editors. It was a very clever move. ""People felt like they got to know her and she would remember you every seasonâ¦ she was actually very personable and I think that won them over."" VB has won several prestigious awards including two best brand accolades at the British Fashion Awards in 2011 and 2014. As well as her own collections, she's collaborated with US high street brand Target, which includes clothes in larger sizes and is affordable for the majority of us who can't afford designer prices. Sheonce said,external: ""I want a woman to look and feel like the best version of herself."" West brings on the bling for the Met Ball Kanye is just one of a number of US music stars to have made the foray into fashion - honourable mentions also go to Jay Z and Pharrell. Kim Kardashian's husband first dipped his toe into the fashion world back in 2009 with a Nike collaboration - step forward the Air Yeezys - before further shoe lines followed with designer labels including Luis Vuitton. To prove he was taking fashion seriously, West completed an internship with Fendi the same year. An original pair of 2009 Air Yeezys is currently on offer on eBay for an eye-watering $1,349.99 (Â£1,055). In 2011, the rapper debuted DW Kanye West, his women's fashion label, at Paris Fashion Week. But it's fair to say it didn't go down too well with the fashion pack. West gets fully involved in his fashion shows The Daily Telegraph,external's Lisa Armstrong summed it up as a ""stupendously vacuous enterprise"". And theNew York Times',externalSuzy Menkes wrote: ""His collection of sexpot low-bodice dresses and skintight pants, decked out with heaps of ginger fur, did not inspire the fashion crowd to tell him to give up his day job."" Ouch. On the plus side, Style.com did blog that it was ""a work in progress"". Ever the optimist, Kanye got back in the saddle quickly and his second line, launched in 2012, was largely well received. He has since gone on to produce five seasons of his Yeezy clothing line plus a trainer collaboration with Adidas. ""I am actually a fan of Kanye's Yeezy collections,"" Natalie Hartley says. ""I love sportswear and think he has done a great job making simple, modern sportswear. He has also grafted to learn the ropes, he is passionate about fashion, and who can knock that?"" Gwen took some time out for her children The No Doubt singer first stepped into the fashion foray with the launch of her label L.A.M.B in 2004. The name is an acronym of her debut solo album Love.Angel.Music.Baby. She has frequently shown her collections during New York Fashion Week and has attracted largely positive reviews. On the label'sFacebook page,external, L.A.M.B is described as ""a playful juxtaposition between classic Hollywood movie star glamour and more modern and casual street influences. L.A.M.B. is always a mixture of vintage inspiration mashed up with modern and futuristic elements"". It's certainly been a commercial success for the singer,raking in millions of dollars a year,external, which has allowed her to expand her fashion empire to include labels Harajuku Lovers (inspired by Japanese street style) and Design With Purpose (her eco-friendly line designed with Seven for all Mankind founder Michael Glasser). While Natalie Hartley says she's ""personally not hugely in to [Gwen's] style"", she credits her for sticking to her own instincts and ""her fan base are up for dressing just like her"". Stefani took a break from New York Fashion Week a while ago,explaining that,external""the only reason I haven't [been] lately is because it falls when my kids go back to school and I was like, 'Oh, I guess I will go to NYFW and miss my kid's first day of kindergarten.' No."" But never fear fashion fans, Gwen has been back showing off her wares on the runway again. Hoorah for childcare! Rihanna hits the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival RiRi has proved to be a designer's dream over the last few years, gracing red carpets in the likes of Stella McCartney, Chanel, Prada and Giambattista Valli. But she's not just a clothes horse - she has been designing clothing for several years now across various different brands. Her fashion credits include underwear, denim and T-shirts for Armani Jeans and Emporio Armani Underwear plus a high street collection for River Island. Natalie explains that there's an authenticity about Rihanna's fashion credentials: ""Rihanna does stuff that's true to her. She wouldn't put anything together she would never wear herself."" Being named creative directorof Pumain 2014, which entails overseeing the direction of the womenswear collection, was a big moment for the star. She's gone on to have huge success with her Puma trainer line, including her creeper-style trainers and furry sliders. Other recent collaborations include an all-denim collection with shoe god Manolo Blahnik (including thigh-high boots) and a range of sunglasses for Dior. Not content with clothes and shoes, RiRi also has several perfumes to her name - including Kiss and Crush - and a jewellery line with Chopard. Tinie Tempah is a regular at the top fashion shows The south London rapper first cut his fashion teeth not long after he scored his first number one with his debut single Pass Out back in 2010. His label Disturbing London is very much based on his own style - street mixed with high fashion. Consistently listed as one of Britain's best-dressed men, Tinie launched his What We Wear line earlier this year. Natalie says: ""Tinie Tempah's whole stance is sustainability and recycling materials. He obviously has a passion about that and that's what he wants to put out."" Speaking about his decision to go into fashion, the man himselftold Reuters,external: ""To be honest I got a little bit bored of people just saying I was really stylish just for wearing other people's clothes,"" ""After a while I feel like people start to put more of the emphasis on the clothes than the actual person...I started to feel like I was a bit of a walking mannequin."" He's also said he'd be up for designing a women's collection at some point. ""Regardless of what you're wearing, confidence is key. You can pretty much wear anything as long as you're confident enough to wear it. Fashion and style are two different things - you can wear the same things,""he once told GQ,external.

"A few days ago a school friend sent me a very disturbing video on WhatsApp of a three-year-old being taught maths at home. The tutor, whose face cannot be seen, appears to be a family member - she's either the child's mother or aunt or another relative. She's teaching the child to recognise numbers from one to five. Tears streaming down her face, the little girl is seen begging with her tutor to spare her, show a bit of leniency, ""teach with a bit of love"". At one point, frustration takes over, she says her head is aching. Put under more pressure, she's angry, and continues to sob as she repeats the numbers through clenched teeth. The video ends with her getting slapped across the face. In many countries, if a video surfaced of parents treating their children with such cruelty, it would be treated as a serious case of child abuse and she would possibly be removed from the parents' custody. Abusing and hitting children is a crime in many parts of the world and corporal punishment in schools is banned in India too. But it's still an accepted way of disciplining children within homes. Many middle class Indian parents believe education is the key that opens the door to a better life and put tremendous importance on education of their children. Middle class Indian parents put a lot of emphasis on their children's education In India, where WhatsApp has 200 million monthly active users, the video of the three-year-old spread within hours and soon went viral on social media sites. Watching a three-year-old being treated so badly made many people angry. Virat Kohli, the captain of India's cricket team, and several of his team-mates were among those who took to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to express their outrage. ""The fact that the pain and anger of the child is ignored and one's own ego to make the child learn is so massive that compassion has totally gone out of the window. This is shocking and saddening to another dimension. A child can never learn if intimidated. This is hurtful,"" Kohli posted on Instagram. Cricketer Shikhar Dhawan wrote that it was ""one of the most disturbing videos"" he had seen. Many others too said they were distressed by the video. ""When I saw this video on Whatsapp it was heart wrenching... And no matter how many excuses the parents or family give in support of their behaviour it cannot be justified,"" commented Nidhi (nid048). ""This is pretty sad, I mean that kid at that age shouldn't be taught that way,"" commented egadwiprasetya. ""Can anyone in India help to save this little girl's life from her lunatic Mum please ? Media, police please? I am broke,"" Sudhi Pooniyil wrote on Twitter. For several days, the identity of the little girl remained a mystery, but on Wednesday, it was reported that she was Bollywood singer-composer Toshi Sabri's niece. In an interview with the Hindustan Times newspaper, Sabri said the video was made for their family's WhatsApp group and defended the family's treatment of the child. Many believe teaching should be a joyous affair ""Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan don't know about us. We know about our child better,"" he said. ""Her nature is such that after being scolded, the next minute she runs off to play. But, because of her nature if we don't push her, she won't study."" He said the video was made by the child's mother, who wanted to show her brother and husband that the child had become very stubborn. ""But she is very dear to us,"" he added. Experts, however, insist this is ""abusive behaviour"" and in many countries, it would be ""treated as a crime against a child"". Psychiatrist Achal Bhagat says he cannot comment on this particular case because he hasn't examined the child, but warns that treated in such a way, a child can be ""harmed permanently"". ""It can result in the child developing a mistrust of people because those who are supposed to be loving her are mistreating her. It can either make her too cautious or too impulsive in forming relationships later in life. She can also start developing self-harm behaviour."" Also, he says, focusing on a child's limitations are not going to help her learn anything. ""This is likely to be very damaging. The child is crying for help. She needs immediate help. And so do her parents,"" he adds.

"Dixons Carphone says profits are down in part because consumers are refusing to upgrade to the iPhone 7 ""My iPhone 6S is falling apart,"" says 18-year-old student Asher Silver. ""But I think the iPhone 7 is useless - you can't plug in a speaker when you play music and you can't charge it [at the same time]."" He's not alone. Earlier on ThursdayDixons Carphone said the appetite for new phones was pretty weak currently- one reason worried investors marked the shares down by about a fifth. Dixons Carphone said customers are choosing to hang on to their existing smartphones for four to five months longer, and it is partly because Apple's most recent iPhone is not seen as appealing enough. ""For half the market, the Apple base more or lessrejected the iPhone 7,"" said Dixons Carphone chief executive Seb James. ""We have a much bigger iPhone 6 base - we have many customers holding on to the iPhone 6S even if the battery is on its last leg."" I'm an Apple fan myself, and I'm in the same boat as Mr Silver.

"Dixons Carphone says profits are down in part because consumers are refusing to upgrade to the iPhone 7 ""My iPhone 6S is falling apart,"" says 18-year-old student Asher Silver. ""But I think the iPhone 7 is useless - you can't plug in a speaker when you play music and you can't charge it [at the same time]."" He's not alone. Earlier on ThursdayDixons Carphone said the appetite for new phones was pretty weak currently- one reason worried investors marked the shares down by about a fifth. Dixons Carphone said customers are choosing to hang on to their existing smartphones for four to five months longer, and it is partly because Apple's most recent iPhone is not seen as appealing enough. ""For half the market, the Apple base more or lessrejected the iPhone 7,"" said Dixons Carphone chief executive Seb James. ""We have a much bigger iPhone 6 base - we have many customers holding on to the iPhone 6S even if the battery is on its last leg."" I'm an Apple fan myself, and I'm in the same boat as Mr Silver.

"The more things change... the more things stay the same. A revolution has been announced for GCSEs in England, with tougher exams, a more stretching syllabus, no hiding behind coursework and standards that are higher than anything since the demise of the O-levels in the 1980s. But the results - give or take a fraction of a percentage point - are uncannily similar to last year. How does that happen? Of course, the most important thing about GCSE results is the individual pupils, their families and teachers. It's about hard work, long nights of revision and youngsters making the most of their opportunities, sometimes in tough circumstances. It's not about the statistical snowstorm that GCSE results coverage can too easily become. But how does the exam system deliver greater rigour and more difficult exams - and at the same time not see any significant change in grades? Pupils found out their GCSE results after the long wait The balancing act, if not a conjuring trick, is pulled off by changing the grade boundaries. The upper-tier maths paper might be pencil-chewingly difficult, but a grade-4 pass required a mark of only 18%. To get a grade 7, equivalent to an A grade, required a mark of 52%. The new ultra-high grade 9, for the very brightest students and meant to be much tougher than the old A*, required 79%. So, by adjusting the grade boundaries, the proportions getting the different grades can be kept constant with previous years. It's a bit like intellectual limbo, changing the height of the stick to decide how many get through. Professor Alan Smithers, from the University of Buckingham's Centre for Education and Employment Research, said this meant ""more or less giving away the grade"". Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton says there is something ""Alice in Wonderland"" about this pursuit of exams being much harder, but results being pegged as more or less the same. Mr Barton, head of the ASCL head teachers' union, questions whether this will remain sustainable - and asks how schools are able to show authentic progress, if year after year the grading system keeps holding everyone to the same level. He says he is no ""apologist"" for some of the weaknesses in the former content of GCSEs. But he says there needs to be a change in the ""mindset"" of what is expected from the exam system - and more transparency about how the final outcomes are constructed. ""We need to open up the rather surreal nature of what we're doing to make sure that results are consistent."" Lawrence Schofield got a top grade 9 in three subjects But in defence of the exam boards, the other side of the argument is that in a qualifications system that seems to face constant change, it would be very unfair if individual year groups suddenly faced a cliff-edge collapse in results. They need to be protected from the sudden changes in direction and shifting expectations. The exam regulator Ofqual says the ""boundaries were set using a combination of statistics and examiner judgment. We are confident that they reflect an appropriate standard of performance"". Exam boards and schools are also caught between a rock and a hard place with results. If results were to suddenly improve, there would be accusations of grade inflation and dumbing down. If results went sharply down, there would be claims of a collapse in standards and that schools were letting down their pupils. So, instead, the ""comparable outcome"" system keeps things in more or less the same place - constructing the results accordingly, so that they bob up each year in the same place, like a self-righting mechanism on a lifeboat. What does this mean for overall objective standards? What does it mean for international competition? How much is the exam system bent out of shape by political pressure? Even when it's about a maths exam, this is a day that's about more than such calculations. Families will have been sharing their own news headlines. There are congratulations and commiserations. And next year, it will start all over again, and we'll watch exam results nudge slightly upwards or downwards, as if of their own accord.

"The new GCSE system in England is going to be graded from 9 to 1. But is 9 a counter-intuitive top score? Nine is the nearly-man and woman of numbers - almost, but not quite 10. But this change in exam grades could be the big breakthrough for this undervalued number. Forget top 10s. Forget 10 out of 10. Nine is fine. It's... er... number one. 1. Amps up to 11.If number 1 was the top grade, it would be difficult to go upwards, in the way that the old A grade had an upgrade to A*. There's nowhere to go beyond above a 1. But when in a few years the inevitable clamour comes that the 9 is too easy, it will be simple enough to stick up the top grade to 10. Nigel Tufnel in the classic mock rockumentary Spinal Tap explained the principle when he boasted about why the band's amplifiers went up to 11. Tufnel: ""If we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?"" Interviewer: ""Put it up to 11."" Tufnel: ""Eleven. Exactly. One louder."" Interviewer: ""Why don't you just make 10 louder and make 10 the top number and make that a little louder?"" Tufnel: ""These go to 11."" 2. Up to the nines.It's been ingrained that rankings run downwards in status - whether it's the pop charts going down from number one or university degree grades with first class above second and third. But it needn't be this way. Nine has its own idiomatic claims to be top. Dressed to the nines. The whole nine yards. A stitch in time saves nine. Lucky cats have nine lives. A whip with many ends is a ""cat-o'-nine tails"". Since ancient times, nine seems to have been associated with the horizon, the last point on a numbering system before beginning again. They all imply nine is a high point or lots of something. 3. The inevitable headline.It's only a matter of time before news stories about GCSE results have pictures of brainy, jumping triplets celebrating a string of top grades with the headline ""On cloud nine."" 4. Nine is a mystical number.Hinduism, the religions of ancient Greece and Egypt and Norse mythology all use nine as a significant and symbolic number. There are associations with completeness and fulfilment. On Christmas Eve, the iconic service from King's College Cambridge is Nine Lessons and Carols. The prayer cycles of ""novenas"" are over nine days. The pop singer John Lennon has been described as having been obsessed with the number nine. He was born on the ninth, he lived in a house with a number nine and various events in his life were associated with the number. 5. Bingo lingo.In the banter of bingo callers, number nine is ""doctor's orders"". There are competing theories about the origins, including that Number 9 was the name of a laxative pill given by army and navy doctors during World War Two. 6. A group of nineis called an ennead. And in geometry, an enneagon or nonagon is a nine-sided shape. Or how about that ""noon"" is originally from the Latin for the ninth hour? Think such uplifting thoughts, and when you hear ""Nine to one"", don't think about Fifteen to One or even worse, 3-2-1 and Dusty Bin. 7.Nine circles of hell.Teenagers getting their results, facing the long, tortuous struggle towards a grade 9, might feel empathy with those sinners in Dante's Inferno who face nine circles of pain and torment. 8. ""How is 9 on top?""Every phrase has to begin somewhere. It will be heard muttered in homes across England, as parents try to make out whether they should be offering congratulations or commiserations. ""It says 9. But 9 out of what?"" 9. Nine-day wonder?Not really. The switch to using numerical grades for GCSEs is going to spread to other subjects over the next few years. And if you're looking for irony, the phrase ""nine-day wonder"" has been around for at least 400 years and probably much longer.

"Karima Nabi shared a series of images of her being chased by a monkey How close is too close to get to a monkey? As one Twitter user found out, it's really better to keep your distance. A series of photographs,externalof a woman's encounter with a Barbary macaque has been retweeted over 41,000 times and gained 70,000 likes. All she wanted was ""to get a picture with a monkey"". However, Trentham Monkey Forest, near Stoke-on-Trent, where the incident happened, does warn all its visitors to experience the ""natural behaviour"" of the animals while not getting too close to them. Barbary macaques are free to roam the park at Trentham Monkey Forest Karima Nabi, from Birmingham, was visiting the park with her sister over the weekend. She approached the macaque for a photo, but it turned and ran after her. Speaking to the BBC, Karima said as the monkey lurched towards her she ""ran for about 10 seconds and it finally stopped chasing me."" ""Next thing I know, a worker came up to us and asked if we were alright and told us to be careful and to stay one metre away next time."" Barbary macaques make an 'o' shape with their mouths as a warning Matt Lovall, Park Director at Trentham Monkey Forest, explained some of the body language displayed in the images. Leaning back, as seen in the second image, is a behaviour often displayed when macaques feel threatened. While curling their lips into an 'o' shape, as above, is a clear warning to rivals. Mr Lovatt added visitors to the park are asked to keep at least one metre away from the monkeys at all times, and ""this particular visitor may not have followed that rule."" Trentham Monkey Forest were keen to stress interactions like the one Karima had with this monkey are very rare at the park.

"This video can not be played Matthew Briggs told Today there is a ""fetishism"" with certain types of bikes The husband of a woman who was knocked down and killed by a cyclist has urged ""reckless"" riders to learn from his wife's death. Kim Briggs, 44, was hit while crossing the road in east London last year. Matthew Briggs has criticised the ""fetishism"" of cyclists riding fixed gear bikes with no front brake and is calling for a change in the law. It comes a day after Charlie Alliston, 20, was found guilty of causing bodily harm by ""wanton or furious driving"". Alliston, whowas cleared of manslaughter, was riding a fixed gear bike with no front brakes when he hit the mum-of-two. She suffered ""catastrophic"" head injuries and died a week later in hospital. Mr Briggstold BBC Radio 4's Today programmehe was campaigning for a change in the law because ""sometimes in life you have to step up and do the right thing"". He called for cycling to be incorporated into the Road Traffic Act with the creation of new offences, such as causing death by dangerous cycling, death by careless cycling and causing serious injury. Mr Briggs is campaigning for a change in the law Mr Briggs described his wife as the ""most wonderful woman, the most fun loving woman"". He said he was launching a campaign for a change in the law to honour his wife, and to ""try and stop another family having to go through what we have had to go through"". ""I've lived in London for 28 years. I cycle in London, this is not a witch-hunt against cyclists."" ""This is dealing with a specific issue of reckless cyclists and also those people who choose to ride fixed wheel bikes without the front brake."" Alliston is due to be sentenced on 18 September and could be jailed for up to two years Mr Briggs said riding fixed gear bikes with no front brakes was a fashion statement bordering on fetishism. To those who rode bikes without a front brake, he said: ""I would just urge them to read my story. To understand what happened to my wife, mother of two, the most wonderful woman, the most fun loving woman who went out to work and didn't come back. ""Why would you take that risk with somebody else's life? And even at the most selfish why would you endanger yourself?"" Asked on BBC Radio 5 livehow his children were coping with the loss of their mother, Mr Briggs said: ""My children are amazing. My children are the reason I get up every single morning. They are resilient, they are funny, they are full of life. ""They are an absolutely credit to their mother who brought them up with joy, with laughter, with compassion and I'll do the same. They are the reason I'm doing this. I just love them from the bottom of my heart."" The law explained in the Commentaries on the Laws of England, published in 1867 Alliston was charged with an admittedly archaic offence - but it is the closest to dangerous driving a cyclist can be charged with. Unlike a dangerous cycling charge, causing GBH by wanton and furious driving takes into account injury. It may sound slightly eccentric, but perhaps it is down to its wording which was coined in 1861. Introduced under the Offences Against the Person Act, the charge was created to deter people from driving horse carriages recklessly. It is now used when it is not possible to prosecute under the Road Traffic Act 1988 - ie, when the vehicle in the crime was not mechanically propelled -  and in cases of serious injury or death caused by a cyclist's actions. It carries a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Previous successful prosecutions under the offence include those against cyclistsDarryl GittoesandDarren Hall,external, who both knocked down pedestrians who later died.

"A chunk came out of the coffin after visitors put a child inside it A ""historically unique"" 800-year-old stone coffin was damaged when visitors to a museum put a child inside it. Part of the sarcophagus tumbled over and a chunk fell off at Prittlewell Priory Museum in Southend, Essex, as theSouthend Echo reported,external. Staff were ""shocked and upset"" at the ""unbelievable incident"", said conservator Claire Reed, who now has the job of repairing it. Those responsible were caught on CCTV but ran off without reporting it. The coffin was found in the grounds of the priory in 1921 complete with a skeleton which could have been a senior monk, Mrs Reed said. More news from Essex Although already in three pieces, the sandstone casket has been on display since the 1920s ""and nothing like this has ever happened before"", she told the BBC. The section to the right of the crack was intact before the incident The museum was very busy on 4 August when visitors lifted the child over the clear plastic barrier and into the coffin, seemingly so they could take a photograph. ""Staff heard a thump and that was the first indication something had happened,"" Mrs Reed said. ""It was one of those isolated, terrible incidents. ""It's a very important artefact and historically unique to us as we don't have much archaeology from the priory."" The remains of the Cluniac Priory of St Mary's date from the 13th Century and now house the museum The conservator for Southend Museums Service now has to work out how to repair the damage so the coffin can go back on display ""as soon as possible"". ""It is repairable, and that's the good thing,"" Mrs Reed said.

"This video can not be played âItâs just a soul in a different body.â This is how 26-year-old Adam describes being transgender Somewhere in Egypt in 1991 a girl was born. This girl no longer exists. But far away in Glasgow, there is a Scottish man who does not have a birth certificate. This man is called Adam. ""It is a soul in a different body"" Adam says. ""Whenever you move your hand it's moving in the mirror,"" he says. ""Whenever you do anything with your face, you can see that in the mirror. ""So it's obviously you. But it's not you because it doesn't look like you."" Adam, who is playing the lead role in a play about his reassignment story, describes the gender dysphoria he suffered as a child. Adam plays himself in the lead role of a play at the Edinburgh Fringe Adam was bullied and harassed in Egypt for wanting to be like the boys. He says he was lucky because ""they can torture, they can kill for that, because you are not 'normal'."" Although Egypt is a particularly conservative society, it has been able to legally accept some people with new genders after surgery, but many have not. According to Scott Long, a human rights activist working on international LGBT issues, ""doctors who perform the surgeries [in Egypt] are themselves sometimes subjected to criminal penalties, or professionally punished by the Doctors' Syndicate"". Trans people who try to live in their experienced gender can be arrested - sometimes for ""fraud"" or creating ""public scandal"", Mr Long says. Adam gave himself his current name at the age of 14, but in secret. ""I never bought a doll and I always wanted guns and wanted to play with the boys,"" says Adam as he thinks back to his childhood in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. Adam left home at 19 and travelled to the UK on a tourist visa. The day he landed, he shaved his head. When the visa ran out he went 'underground', working illegally to make money. Adam was young and desperate to be the man he knew he was but didn't know where to go. It was not until someone suggested that he claim asylum as a gender refugee, that he found a way to live legally in the UK and be officially male. He put in a claim. Sent to Glasgow, Adam sat in his room in a tall tower block on the outskirts of the city and waited. He waited months. Adam became severely depressed. He was lonely and missed home. His asylum application was refused three times. But he appealed each time. In the UK, the law states that to be legally recognised as their acquired sex, transgender people must obtain a gender recognition certificate. To obtain this, transgender people must provide medical evidence including a diagnosis of gender dysphoria by a doctor or psychologist who specialises in this area. This can be very difficult, if not impossible, for asylum seekers to access. Transgender people should also prove that they have been living as their new gender for two years. This can be through change of name deed, style of dress or how the applicant is viewed by others. Adam had no official name change and wasn't recognised by his Egyptian family as his new gender. His application for asylum depended on showing that he had a genuine fear of persecution because of his transgender. And he needed to prove to the law that he was not ""Miss Kashmiry"" but Mr Adam Kashmiry. Although gender reassignment is not a requirement, it does aid your claim. Determined to prove his manliness, he looked online for help. He found testosterone for sale. Adam stopped eating to save money to pay for the hormone. Using Youtube videos, he began his own transition treatment. He became extremely sick. Each area of his body that he injected ballooned and doubled in size. He became feverish and sometimes couldn't walk. He did this every week for three months, dreading each moment he would have to inject himself but knew it was the only way. Seeing how sick Adam was, his GP finally gave in and began to prescribe Adam legal testosterone. It took two years to win his asylum claim. Doctors took skin from Adam's arm to construct a penis Now, as a refugee, he has all the same rights as any British citizen and can have gender reassignment. He has had two operations to construct a penis. Adam is laughing as he points at the scars and explains how they took skin from his arm and replaced it with skin from his bottom. He says: ""The hair on my butt is not really that long, I don't why the hair is growing wild."" Adam was bullied and harassed in Egypt for wanting to be like the boys Playwright Frances Poet and director Cora Bissett are putting on an award-winning play about Adam's life. The National Theatre of Scotland is showing his story on stage this summer and Adam plays his own part. A beautiful Scottish woman is at the bar having a drink in the Traverse theatre in Edinburgh. This is Toni, Adam's wife. ""I didn't know when I first met him and when I found out I didn't really care,"" Toni says. ""When it first started I was against the play because I thought that being so publicly open about his story would have a negative impact on him. ""I was scared he might get hurt. But watching how passionate he is and watching how people are so inspired by him, I'm so proud of him."" The actor Neshla Caplan plays Egyptian [female] Adam and Scottish Adam plays himself. The play features a choir of 120 people from around the world, all of whom are transgender like Adam. ""It's not just Adam's story. It's many people's story"" says Toni. When asked what he misses about home, Adam replies ""The sea, the food and my family."" Although his mother struggled with the concept of his gender transition in the beginning, she has accepted him now as her son and still loves him as she always has. But, Adam hasn't seen his mum for seven years, because he can't travel to Egypt, as it was the country from which he sought asylum. Adam and Toni are saving up to travel to meet his mum in another country. Adam would finally hug his mother as a son and not as the daughter he once was. Adam is being performed as part of the Made in Scotland Showcase 2017 at the Edinburgh Fringe until 27 August and then touring to Stirling and Glasgow until 16 September 2017.

"This video can not be played Get off the bus early ... and other ways to get walking Middle-aged people are being urged to walk faster to help stay healthy, amid concern high levels of inactivity may be harming their health. Officials at Public Health England said the amount of activity people did started to tail off from the age of 40. They are urging those between the ages of 40 and 60 to start doing regular brisk walks. Just 10 minutes a day could have a major impact, reducing the risk of early death by 15%, they say. But PHE estimates four out of every 10 40- to 60-year-olds do not even manage a brisk 10-minute walk each month. To help, the government agency is promoting a free app -Active 10,external- which can monitor the amount of brisk walking an individual does and provide tips on how to incorporate more into the daily routine. PHE deputy medical director Dr Jenny Harries said: ""I know first hand that juggling priorities of everyday life often means exercise takes a back seat. ""But walking to the shops instead of driving, or going for a brisk 10-minute walk on your lunch break each day, can add many healthy years to your life."" Maureen has now started leading organised walks Maureen Ejimofor, 44, started taking regular walks three years ago in a bid to improve her health. At the time, she weighed 18 stone and wanted to make a change. Within seven months, she had lost nearly five stone. She joined a local organised walking group in Kent and loved it so much she ended up becoming a walk leader in charge of taking groups of people out at the weekend. She has been using the Active 10 app and encourages others to do the same, describing it as ""really useful"" in persuading users to get a ""burst"" of brisk walking into their day. Another walking fan is Liam Quigley, who has just turned 60. ""My parents used to take us out walking all the time,"" he says. ""But unfortunately as I got older, I got a taste for the finer things in life, so I used to drink quite a bit, eat some of the wrong stuff. I actually put a lot of weight on. ""I like walking, and I decided to do something about it."" Mr Quigley joined Stockport Walkers and now takes 10-mile hikes. ""Since I joined, I've lost two stone. It's had a good effect on me,"" he says. GPs are also being encouraged to get their patients walking faster - defined as a walk of at least 3mph that leaves you breathing faster and increases your heart rate. Dr Zoe Williams, of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""Every GP should talk to their patients about the benefits of brisk walking and recommend the Active 10 app."" PHE is focusing on those in middle age, because of the drop in activity levels. It is recommended that people do 150 minutes of activity a week, but nearly half of those aged 40 to 60 fail to achieve that and one in five does less than 30 minutes. While a daily 10-minute brisk walk will not get them to the recommended level, it will be enough to start making a difference to high blood pressure, diabetes, weight issues, depression and anxiety and musculoskeletal problems such as lower back pain. PHE also hopes by getting this age group active it will have a knock-on effect among those who have children.
