"Family members said Afrasia Mohammed, 27, was seeking a better life in the UK French authorities have formally identified 26 of the 27 bodies recovered after last month's mass drowning in the English Channel. Sixteen Kurdish people from Iraq and four Afghans were among the victims, whose families are being informed. They included two friends from the same town who died in the worst-recorded migrant tragedy in the Channel. Their inflatable boat sank while attempting to cross to the UK from France on 24 November. The BBC spoke to the families of Rezhwan Hassan, 18, and 27-year-old Afrasia Mohammed, who were both from the town of Rania, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Their families had not heard from the two men since the disaster, leaving them anxiously awaiting news. The two friends each paid people smugglers thousands of dollars to help them reach the UK. At the end of October they flew into Belarus - an increasingly popular smuggling route - and crossed the border into the European Union before reaching France. Rezhwan Hassan was a carpenter who dreamed of a better life in the UK. His nephew, Dahin Hama, says he tried to talk him out of going. ""We were like brothers; our friendship was strong,"" Dahin Hama said. ""He said he would emigrate from Kurdistan. He said that he cannot bear to live here, and there is no life left to live."" The last time he heard from Rezhwan was on the night of the boat crossing. Rezhwan told his family that he'd contact them from the UK. They pleaded with him to come back, but he said he would make it to the UK ""even if it cost him death"", Dahin Hama said. Hours later, he would lose his life, along with at least 26 others. Rezhwan Hassan's family last heard from him on the night of the crossing Also in the boat was his friend, Afrasia Mohamed. His sister, Nergiz Ahmed Mohammed, says Afrasia believed that the UK promised him a brighter future. ""He went for a better life, and he said there are human rights there,"" she said. ""These don't exist in Kurdistan. All his hopes were to get to the UK, that's why he left."" But he too would never make it. On Tuesday, Kurdish authorities told his family that his body was one of the 27 found. But even before this, his family had been grieving for weeks. ""What is more important? The life of a human being or borders? Where are the human rights? How can they let those people drown and then say it's not our issue?"" Nergiz Ahmed Mohammed said. This video can not be played Channel disaster: A father's anguish, a missing family Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin, a 24-year-old Kurdish woman from northern Iraq,was the first person to be confirmed as a victim in late November. Other names have been reported by Kurdish media but they are yet to be independently verified. On Tuesday, France's justice ministry said the bodies of 26 of at least 27 victims had been identified and repatriation requests were under way. The ministry said it could confirm the identity of 16 Kurdish people from Iraq, including four women aged 22 to 46, a 16-year-old teenager, a seven-year-old child and ten men aged 19 to 37, as well as that of a 23-year-old Kurdish man from Iran. Three Ethiopians were also identified, including two women aged 22 and 25 and a man aged 46. A Somali woman aged 33, four Afghan men aged between 24 and 40 and an Egyptian man aged 20 were also identified. None of the women victims were pregnant, French authorities said. Calais's mayor said at the time of the tragedy that a pregnant woman was among those who died,in comments reported by the BBC. Record numbers of migrants have been making the dangerous journey from France to the UK across the Channel in small boats this year. The crossings have strained an already fraught relationship between France and the UK, which traded recriminations after the tragedy on 24 November. But despite the risks, people are still heading to Western countries in large numbers, including many from northern Iraq. An estimated 40,000 people have left the region for Europe in the past year alone, using illegal smuggling routes. More families are bracing themselves for bad news in the coming days as French authorities contact the loved ones of the drowned victims.

"This video can not be played Sturgeon: 'Limit household mixing to a maximum of three' People in Scotland have been asked to limit socialising to three households at a time in the run-up to Christmas amid concerns over the Omicron variant. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the advice would not apply on Christmas Day and that plans should not be cancelled. But she said people should reduce their social contacts with other households ""as far as possible"". Shops and hospitality venues will also be told to bring back physical distancing and screens. Ms Sturgeon said that Scotland is facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid rules Jabs need a major scaling up - but can it be done? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? She said: ""Before and immediately after Christmas, please minimise your social mixing with other households as much as you can. ""However, if you do plan on socialising - either at home or in indoor public places - we are asking that you limit the number of households represented in your group to a maximum of three. And make sure you test before you go."" The first minister stressed that she was not asking anyone to cancel their Christmas plans, and that places of worship would remain open. But she said that people should try to keep their festive celebrations ""as small as your family circumstances allow"" despite the new guidance not applying on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day or Boxing Day. The guidelines on social mixing will not be legally enforceable, but Ms Sturgeon warned: ""Although it is guidance, please do not think of it as optional."" The first minister outlined a series of measures aimed at reducing virus transmission. They include: no more than two people to visit a patient in hospital at any one time visits to care home residents should not involve any more than two households at a time businesses legally required to take steps to reduce the spread of Covid the return of measures to cut down crowding in shops and at bars physical distancing and the use of protective screens inside hospitality venues a legal requirement for employers to enable staff to work from home where possible. However, schools are to remain open, with Ms Sturgeon saying it was a ""key aim to ensure that schools stay open if at all possible to minimise further disruption to education"". The new guidelines will not apply on Christmas Day - but people have been urged to limit their gstherings as much as possible The Scottish government will provide Â£100m of funding to help businesses in hospitality and food supply chains which have been hit by advice to cancel work Christmas parties. And ministers are working to identify new mass vaccination centres as part of a push to offer a booster jab to all adults by the end of the month. Shortly before Ms Sturgeon started speaking, the UK Treasury said it would make extra funding available to devolved governments to accelerate the vaccine rollout and tackle the virus. An additional 100 military personnel have also been made available to accelerate the vaccine rollout in Scotland, bringing the total number to 221. The Omicron variant is believed to be spreading very rapidly in Scotland, with the number of cases doubling every two to three days. The heavily-mutated variant is expected to overtake Delta as the dominant form of the virus this week, with the latest data suggesting it accounts for 27.5% of new cases. The number of people in hospital has dropped by 20 to 541, but the figure now includes two confirmed Omicron cases. Ms Sturgeon said that even if the new strain proves milder than Delta, the fact it spreads much faster could still put ""significant"" pressure on health services. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said there would be ""disappointment"" among firms about the announcement, saying the Â£100m of funding announced ""will not go anywhere near far enough to cover the financial losses being incurred"". And CBI Scotland said the government ""must show the same urgency in addressing the economic consequences of Omicron"", saying ""urgent clarity"" was needed on what physical distancing and crowd control requirements would mean in practice. This package of new rules for businesses and strong guidance to all of us to cut back on social contact is the toughest anywhere in the UK. Nicola Sturgeon argues that however unwelcome, it is necessary to help slow down the spread of Omicron while booster vaccines are speeded up. Unlike thepolitical row over Plan B for England, these new measures for Scotland do not face fierce resistance from the Conservatives or other opposition parties at Holyrood. Instead, they question the detailed arrangements for getting financial support to businesses and accelerating the delivery of Covid jags. Ms Sturgeon said she would have tightened hospitality rules further with financial support from the Treasury. It has now promised extra cash which the first minister disputes is new. While rules on social distancing and other measures for retail and hospitality will be backed up by regulations, the request for reduced social mixing is not. The first minister said that did not make it optional. But it is not without contradiction. How, for instance, do you avoid contact with people from many households if you go to nightclubs which remain open for business? This video can not be played In full: Nicola Sturgeon sets Hogmanay booster target Ms Sturgeon said the new curbs were needed to slow the spread of the virus while the booster vaccine programme is accelerated. A target of offering appointments to all adults has been set for the end of the month, with the first minister saying the goal was to complete 80% of jabs by then and complete the others early in January. Booster appointments will be given priority over the remainder of the flu vaccination programme, and the requirement for people to wait in a vaccine centre for 15 minutes before going home will be dropped. Additional capacity for ""drop in"" jabs is to be added, while ""additional venues"" including new mass vaccination clinics are identified. As well as extra funding to support businesses, the government has added Â£100m to the self isolation support grant fund, with an expected increase in the number of people asked to quarantine. The UK government has confirmed that extra funding will be made available to the devolved administrations to deal with the Omicron variant. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""We are working with the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to drive the vaccine rollout to all corners of the United Kingdom and ensure people and businesses all across the country are supported."" Ms Sturgeon's announcement came shortly before MPs voted on new Covid rules for England which saw nearly 100 Conservatives rebel against Prime Minister Boris Johnson. His proposal to make Covid passes a requirement of entering large venues such as nightclubs - which is already the case in Scotland - has angered many of his own MPs. Despite the rebellion, the measures were passed into law as Labour supported them. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"DJ Patrick Topping was to be the headline act at Saturday's rave A rave that would have forced Edinburgh's largest vaccination centre to close for more than a week is to be cancelled, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister was asked by Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton about Saturday's planned event at the Royal Highland Centre. He said operators were contractually obliged to begin dismantling the vaccine operation on Tuesday. But Ms Sturgeon said action was under way to cancel the rave. In response to the Scottish Lib Dem leader, the first minister said that with the new faster-spreading variant of Covid now in Scotland it was ""no longer appropriate"" for the event to take place and there would be full compensation for the cancellation. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs at Holyrood she wanted to increase the facilities for vaccination, not see them go in the opposite direction. About 3,500 people were thought to have been scheduled to attend the house and techno music rave at the Ingliston venue's Lowland Hall on Saturday, which was to feature DJ Patrick Topping. Mr Cole-Hamilton, who is the MSP for the area, said he had raised the issue with the health secretary on Monday, who had been unaware of the plan to temporarily move the vaccine hub. He said: ""The RHS wanted to do the right thing but to cancel would cost them more than Â£60,000 and there was no guarantee of financial support from the government."" Scots urged to limit socialising to three households Earlier, the first minister had outlined how she wanted everyone over 18 to have booked a Covid booster vaccination by the end of the month. The vaccination push is being ramped up in response to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. Ms Sturgeon said that Scotland is facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. She advised that people in Scotland should limit socialising to three households at a time in the run-up to Christmas and shops and hospitality venues will also be told to bring back physical distancing and screens.

"The Lion King returned to the Lyceum Theatre in the West End in July after more than a year of closure due to the pandemic West End hits The Lion King and The Life of Pi are among a number of shows that have been forced to cancel performances due to Covid-19 outbreaks. The Lion King called off shows on Tuesday and Wednesday due ""to Covid-enforced absences"" among cast and crew. Life of Pi at Wyndham's Theatre pulled five shows from 9 to 13 December. The Royal Shakespeare Company's Comedy of Errors at the Barbican in London has also cancelled all performances until 22 December due to Covid cases. The company said scrapping performances ""was a last resort"". The National Theatre had to scratch Monday's preview of its Christmas show Hex after one of its lead actors caught Covid. Rosalie Craig plays the fairy in Hex at the National Theatre The play, based on Sleeping Beauty, has now postponed its press night from Wednesday to 21 December. In a letter to critics, artistic director Rufus Norris wrote: ""You will no doubt be aware of the impact that Covid has been having on productions across the industry (none of ours over the last year have escaped entirely) but the impact on Hex has been considerable, with several members of the company including one of our leads being taken ill during the technical and preview period, and fresh bad news on that front again today."" London's Southwark Playhouse has closed its new musical The Rhythmics - described as Calendar Girls meets the Full Monty - three weeks early, after ""disruption caused by ongoing illness and Covid-19 related absences in the company"". That was compounded by ""the ongoing uncertainty in the wake of recent government announcements, leaving theatres once again facing a devastating loss of business"", a statement from its producers said. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time at the Troubadour theatre in Wembley Park was forced to cancel its performances until Friday, while the capital's Donmar Warehouse has also been affected. The Bush's Fair Play was cancelled on Monday but is set to resume on Tuesday Performances of Force Majeure from Monday to Thursday were cancelled due to cases of Covid-19 in the company. The theatre said in a statement: ""We are very disappointed to have to cancel, but the safety of our performers, staff and audiences is our priority."" Rory Kinnear stars in the adaptation of Ruben Ãstlund's dark film comedy. Like many others, the play had already been rescheduled from 2020 due to the pandemic. London's Bush Theatre also had to cancel a performance of critically-acclaimed Fair Play on Monday, but it is set to resume on Tuesday. Moulin Rouge! at the Piccadilly Theatre in London restarted on Monday after a 10-day Covid-enforced break. Some pantomimes have also been affected. The Brighton Centre's Aladdin, which was set to star Anita Dobson, has now been postponed until 2022 due to ""the uncertainty and risk surrounding the Omicron variant of Covid-19"". A production of Peter Pan at the Chrysalis Theatre has been cancelled due to Covid risks The Chrysalis Theatre in Milton Keynes saidit had taken the ""very difficult decision"" not to go ahead with its production of Peter Pan, after junior cast members caught the virus. Steven Gordon-Wilson of 1702 Productions said the theatre space was shared with vulnerable groups, and the company felt cancellation was best. Nerve-wracking to be back on stage, says Banjo Meanwhile, performances of Beauty and the Beast at Coventry's Belgrade Theatre have been suspended since 8 December and are not due to resume until 18 December at the earliest. ""Knowing this would always be a risk during the ongoing pandemic, we have taken the precaution of creating a professionally filmed version of our Beauty and the Beast production,"" the theatre said in a statement last week. Jack and the Beanstalk from the Big Pembrokeshire Panto, which was due to star The Only Way is Essex's James Argent, has been cancelled too. Rapunzel at the ADC Theatre in Cambridge has also been cut short, and the Byre Theatre in St Andrews, Scotland, has decided to lower the curtain on its version of Jack and the Beanstalk ""in light of the current, rapidly evolving situation regarding the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19"".

"The Omicron variant was first identified by South Africa The new coronavirus variant Omicron is spreading across the globe at an unprecedented rate, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Cases of the heavily mutated variant have been confirmed in 77 countries. But at a press conference, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was probably in many others that had yet to detect it. Dr Tedros said he was concerned that not enough was being done to tackle the variant. ""Surely, we have learned by now that we underestimate this virus at our peril. Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems,"" he said. Is Omicron milder despite dodging immunity? Why do boosters work if two doses struggle? Is low vaccination a factor in the rise of Omicron? The WHO's latest data suggests the variant - first detected in South Africa in November - can better evade existing vaccines and carries a higher risk of re-infection, leading the organisation to say the level of risk remains very high. A number of countries have introduced travel bans affecting South Africa and its neighbours following the emergence of Omicron, but this has failed to stop it from spreading around the world. More than 800,000 Americans have now died from the coronavirus- the highest recorded national death toll from the global pandemic UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson won backing for Covid passes in England, despite the biggest revolt by members of his own party since he became PM The UK government also announced on Tuesday thatall 11 countries on its travel red list would be taken off,with Health Secretary Sajid Javid saying the Omicron variant had spread so widely the rules no longer had much purpose Italy has extended a state of emergency until 31 March 2022, citing concerns over Omicron. The measures, which were due to expire at the end of December, give the government more power to limit travel and public gatherings The Netherlands says it will close primary schools a week before the Christmas holidays are due to start, in a pre-emptive bid to tackle infections Norway has announced a ban on serving alcohol in bars and restaurants, among other measures In Tuesday's news conference, Dr Tedros reiterated concerns about vaccine inequity, as some countries accelerate rollouts of a booster shot in response to Omicron. Recent studies of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine showed it produced far fewer neutralising antibodies against Omicron than against the original strain, but that this deficit could be reversed by a third, booster, jab. This video can not be played What we know about Omicron and its impact on Africa Dr Tedros said boosters could play an important role in curbing the spread of Covid-19, but that it was ""a question of prioritisation"". ""The order matters. Giving boosters to groups at low risk of severe disease or death simply endangers the lives of those at high risk who are still waiting for their primary doses because of supply constraints,"" he said. Supplies to the global vaccine-sharing programme Covax have increased in recent months. However, world health officials fear a shortfall of tens of millions of doses - like the one which occurred in the middle of this year when India suspended its vaccine exports - could happen again. In poorer countries, some vulnerable people are yet to receive a single dose.

Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place.

"The men bought five scratch cards, one of which had a Â£10 prize while another had the Â£4m jackpot (stock image) Two men who bought a National Lottery scratch card using stolen debit card details and then tried to claim the Â£4m jackpot they revealed have been jailed. Jon Watson, of Bolton, and Mark Goodram went to London to beg in 2019 and bought the winning card in Clapham. They were found out when claiming the prize, as they revealed they did not have a bank account, despite using a debit card to buy the item. Admitting fraud at Bolton Crown Court, they were both jailed for 18 months. The court heard the men, aged 34 and 38, travelled from Bolton to London on 22 April 2019. Denise Fitzpatrick, prosecuting, said the pair, who were both on licence following previous prison sentences, had the details of a debit card belonging to a man they did not know. She said Goodram had the card number and expiry date written on his hand and used them to buy Â£90 of shopping at a Londis store on Clapham High Street and Â£71 of goods, including five scratch cards, at a Waitrose store on Clapham Common. The court was told one card had a Â£10 prize, which was claimed in the Londis store, while another had the jackpot prize. The men bought the jackpot-holding scratch card at the Waitrose store on Clapham Common Watson telephoned the National Lottery line to tell them his friend had won, Ms Fitzpatrick said, before Goodram then told the operator he would be sharing the prize with his friend. He was informed the payment would be made by bank transfer. ""Mark Goodram explained he did not have a bank account, [but] the purchase of the winning scratch card had been made by debit card from a bank account... which immediately raised suspicions,"" she said. The court was also told Goodram, of no fixed address, and Watson, of Nuttall Avenue, Little Lever, spoke to the media when the prize was not paid out. Sentencing them, Recorder Sarah Johnston said the pair, who had numerous previous convictions, had deprived the next customer to win a ""life-changing sum of money"" before having the ""audacity to plead your sense of injustice in the national newspapers"". ""You must have thought all of your Christmases had come at once,"" she said. ""Despite knowing you had fraudulently acquired that prize money, you tried to claim it. ""I have no doubt that both of you will continue to offend in dishonest ways in the future."" Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"This video can not be played Watch: The moment MPs approved the introduction of a Covid pass in England Boris Johnson has won backing for Covid passes in England, despite the biggest revolt by Tory MPs since he became PM. A total of 99 Conservatives voted against the government, but the measure was passed by a majority of 243 thanks to Labour support. So NHS Covid passes, showing a recent negative test or full vaccination, must be shown to get into many large venues, including nightclubs, from Wednesday. MPs also voted to back compulsory face masks in most indoor settings. Where will I need to use a Covid passport? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Tory rebellion over Covid passes was a ""very significant blow to the already damaged authority of the prime minister"". ""It confirms that he's too weak to discharge the basic functions of government,"" he added. Health minister Gillian Keegan admitted Conservative MPs had faced ""difficult"" decisions, still having received only ""partial information"" from scientists on the Omicron variant. ""We have decided that we need to buy time... We really do need to slow down this unbelievably transmittable virus,"" she added. The Covid measures MPs voted for: Making vaccinations compulsory for NHS workers in England Over-18s in England must prove they are fully vaccinated or have a recent negative lateral flow test to enter a number of large venues, such as nightclubs, from Wednesday Daily lateral flow tests for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with Covid cases, instead of isolation Continue making face masks compulsory in a wider range of venues Before the votes, the prime minister made a last-minute plea to his MPs to support the government's measures, outlined in its Plan B, designed to deal with an expected winter surge in coronavirus infections. But Conservative backbenchers lined up during the Commons debate to criticise them. After the Covid passes vote, one Tory rebel, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said the scale of the revolt meant a leadership challenge to Mr Johnson had ""got to be on the cards"" next year. Another, Sir Charles Walker, told the BBC that Tory MPs still backed the PM, but the rebellion was a ""cry of pain"" over the specific measure, which they viewed as an attack on personal freedoms that would not halt the spread of Covid. There was also concern from the Night Time Industries Association, representing nightclubs, who said passes would ""jeopardise the survival of businesses in 2022"" and called for ""urgent additional"" financial support from the government. The arrival of another Covid variant has, of course, prompted the government to act to try to protect the public's health. If the Omicron outbreak is as enormous as the worst-case scenarios predict, much of the current political debate may be swamped, or indeed feel quickly irrelevant or self-indulgent. But right now, Tory fears about the action ministers are taking are not just about the specifics of this debate but about what many perceive as a lack of thinking about whether we can live like this for ever. Read Laura's blog Some 38 Tory MPs - and three DUP members - rebelled against the government over the face mask plan, which has already come into effect. There was also a big Conservative rebellion - involving 63 MPs - over compulsory vaccinations for frontline NHS workers. But, after the measure was passed by the Commons, GMB union national secretary Rehana Azam said: ""We are opposed to legally enforced medical procedures as a condition of employment - it's heavy-handed and will deepen the health service's devastating staff black hole."" Scrapping self-isolation, in favour of daily lateral flow tests, for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with Covid cases, including Omicron, was passed unanimously without a vote. Labour shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said his party backed the Plan B measures because they would ""help us have a safer Christmas as well as to protect our NHS from being totally overwhelmed"". But eight of the party's MPs, including former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, plus former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who now sits as an independent, voted against Covid passes. Labour's Rachael Maskell resigned as a shadow culture minister after opposing the measure. Where will I need to use a Covid passport? How many Covid cases are there in the UK?

"Wales' first minister urged people last week to use lateral flow tests before mixing with others People are being encouraged by the Welsh government to use up lateral flow tests already at home before ordering more, due to high demand. It comes as some users ordering rapid home tests were told online that no more kits were available. The Welsh government said demand for the tests was ""very high at present"". First Minister Mark Drakeford urged people last week totest themselves before mixing with others. Curbs on people meeting in Wales on the cards Alert level raised to four due to Omicron spread Attempts to order testing packs since just after 10:00 GMT on Monday resulted in some users receiving the message: ""sorry, there are no more home test kits available right now"". The Welsh government said it expected any issues with meeting demand would be ""resolved shortly"". ""Lateral flow tests are readily available through pharmacies and community collection sites,"" it said. Sudhir Sehrawat, a community pharmacist in Cardiff and Royal Pharmaceutical Society Wales board member, said his pharmacies have seen ""increased demand"" for test kits since Friday. ""We're finding the amount we can order each day isn't meeting the demand we're expecting,"" he said. Sudhir Sehrawat says the daily cap on pharmacy lateral flow test kits isn't meeting demand He said at Lakeside pharmacy in Cardiff, one box of 54 test kits was empty after an hour. Mr Sehrawat he believed pharmacies were being put in a ""restrictive process"", only being able to order one box of 54 test kits per day. ""When you're in a busy area or you're the only pharmacy in the whole village, that is quite frustrating. ""Community pharmacy in general is doing its best to meet the challenge, we just need supply to meet demand. ""We're upsetting people by not meeting the demand for lateral flow tests, which the Welsh government have told people to do."" A Boots spokeswoman said there ""may be a small number of stores"" that are experiencing temporary shortages due to ""higher demand in certain areas"". She said in these cases patients would be advised about other pharmacies nearby that have test kits in stock. ""Overall, we have plenty of stock of these tests across the UK and do not have any supply chain issues at present,"" she said. The high street chemist said it provides lateral flow test kits at over 2,100 pharmacies in the UK. The Welsh government says demand for lateral flow tests is ""very high at present"" Meanwhile, Amy Swarbrick a pharmacy technician at Knights Rhostyllen pharmacy in Wrexham, said they are experiencing no problems with ordering in lateral flow test kits. ""We are getting a lot of people asking for them, especially today,"" she said. ""The demand might outrun, but as it stands it is fine.""

"The government has said that all 11 countries will be removed from the UK's travel red list from 4am on Wednesday. Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe are on the list. The red list was reintroduced in late November as a precaution after the emergence of the Omicron variant. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it had spread so widely the rules no longer had much purpose. ""Now that there is community transmission of Omicron in the UK and Omicron has spread so widely across the world, the travel red list is now less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad,"" he told Parliament. ""Whilst we will maintain our temporary testing measures for international travel we will be removing all 11 countries from the travel red list effective from 4am tomorrow morning."" What tests do I need if I travel abroad? All UK arrivals from red list countries are required to pay for and self-isolate in a pre-booked, government-approved hotel for 10 days. But with all 11 countries being removed from that list, it was confirmed that those currently in managed quarantine would be allowed to leave early and ""follow the rules as if they had arrived from a non-red list country"". Some travellers had paid thousands of pounds to stay in government-approved quarantine hotels, with complaints of chaotic organisation and inedible food during their stays. Anyone who has tested positive will to remain in isolation, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Stephen Barclay told the House of Commons. Mr Javid also said earlier he was ""very persuaded"" by calls to reimburse people and hoped to make an announcement on that soon. The point of putting countries on the red list was to act quickly to slow the spread of Omicron. Now it has spread in the community, the government doesn't think putting people from a limited list of countries in hotels is useful. It will be welcome news to people with plans to come to the UK from countries like South Africa and Nigeria, or who had delayed their return from those countries. But it will be frustrating for those who did get caught up in the revival of the red list, which only started about a fortnight ago. Some people who have already paid for hotel stays want to see the government pay their costs. The travel industry wantsallrestrictions removed. Businesses see testing measures as putting a dampener on their recovery. It seems the government is not prepared to go that far, just yet. This will make travel companies, who normally benefit from a holiday booking rush in late December and early January, feel nervous. The move follows anger from African countries, with the UN describing the ban on non-UK residents entering England as ""travel apartheid"". South African Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said the UK announcement had ""come just in time to allow families and friends to unite over the festive season"". The travel industry had also warned the restrictions were hurting business. Tim Alderslade, head of trade group Airlines UK, said emptying the red list made ""complete sense"" but that the government should also scrap the remaining travel restrictions. Currently all arrivals, regardless of where they fly from, must take Covid tests within 48 hours of setting off for the UK and PCR tests within two days of their arrival. ""If the red list isn't necessary, given that Omicron is established here at home, then neither are the costly emergency testing and isolation measures imposed on even fully vaccinated travellers, which again put us completely at odds with the rest of Europe,"" he said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said these testing measures would be reviewed in the first week of January. ""As always, we keep all our travel measures under review and we may impose new restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health,"" he said on Twitter. Alison Stitt in her quarantine hotel room Alison Stitt says her experience in a quarantine hotel pushed her to the point of meltdown. She was in South Africa visiting her father for his 90th birthday when the country went on the UK's red list. It took days to rearrange a flight home on the same date that a quarantine hotel room was available. They had to stay longer in their AirBnB and re-book their car hire while they waited - on top of extending their car parking and kennels bookings in the UK. Now she and her husband David are at a hotel near Gatwick. Alison says the total cost of their extended stay in South Africa and paying for their quarantine facility has been at least Â£5,500. ""It was one expense after another. It's all going on credit cards. It was meant to be a budget trip."" She describes the experience of going into quarantine as a farce. ""We were herded into coaches after we landed. We got lucky coming to Gatwick, some were going to Manchester."" Alison says her room is clean and modern, but she doesn't feel safe in the hotel, saying she's seen guards sneezing with their masks down. The hotel had to be evacuated last week because of a fire alarm. ""We know someone has tested positive in the hotel. They came to re-test us, saying that we had been exposed to someone with Covid during the fire alarm."" Read more here How are travel rules being relaxed?

"Jack Simm said winning the case ""instilled in me that young people need to back themselves"" Ever booked accommodation and turned up to find it's not exactly what you were sold in the pictures? Well, that's just what happened with Jack Simm's university accommodation, which he described as being like a ""building site"". So, he decided to do what any self-respecting law student would do and took his landlord to court - winning his first ever case with the help of his textbooks. The 19-year-old was in his first year at the University of East Anglia in September 2020 when he moved into the Velocity Student accommodation in Norwich. But because he got his university place through clearing he didn't get a chance to view it beforehand. ""I thought I was going to get what I'd seen on these photos,"" he says. ""These nice, upmarket student accommodation rooms."" A large hole in the ceiling in one of the rooms at the property But when he turned up, it was a different story. ""It was a building site,"" he says of the property which was developed by The Freedman Project LLP and managed by Estateducation. ""There were skips everywhere, tradesmen everywhere, hammering the ceiling, hammering the walls. The place was covered in dust from sanding. ""It was almost ironic and funny that people were moving into this place because it looked awful. It was just a bit of a dire state really."" Self-isolating students in end-of-tenancy 'nightmare' University deferral deals: Current students brand them unfair Bristol alumni student tackles 'toxic' student rental market After a week Jack moved out and stopped paying his rent. Despite being threatened with recovery action by a debt collector, he turned to his textbooks and started building his case. He collected witness statements, put together the case law and statute law surrounding contract representation, and sued for breach of contract and misrepresentation. ""It was quite easy to be honest,"" says Jack, who is originally from Newcastle. ""I studied contract law at the time. To me it was quite an easy case of opening my contract law textbook and looking through some of the relevant law and applied it to the situation."" He adds: ""We sued for our money back our deposit our first month's rent. They sued for the entire tenancy agreement - around Â£7,000."" At an online hearing at Newcastle County Court on 2 November, his dad spoke for him in court, and Jack won what he had paid them plus court fees, totalling Â£999. The counterclaim was dismissed. He said it was ""great winning"" and ""really just instilled in me that young people need to back themselves"". ""You just can't let these landlords win,"" he added.

"Shaun Bailey was a youth worker before entering politics A former Conservative mayoral candidate who attended a Covid regulation-breaching Christmas party has quit as chair of a police and crime committee. Shaun Bailey's team organised the gathering at the Conservative Campaign Headquarters on 14 December 2020 when London was under Tier 2 restrictions banning household mixing. He has now stepped down from the role but remains a member of the committee and the London Assembly. Mr Bailey has yet to comment. On Tuesday night, a photograph emerged in the Daily Mirror of the party. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has condemned the event, saying: ""That scene is absolutely unacceptable. ""It is unacceptable for people to be breaking the rules. That was not authorised by the Conservative Party,"" Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Those Conservatives who were on secondment from the party have already been disciplined and whatever further action needs to be taken will be taken."" Mr Bailey founded a youth charity after finishing his degree A spokesperson for the Greater London Authority Conservatives said Mr Bailey chose to step down to prevent the ""unauthorised social gathering"" distracting from the committee's work of holding the mayor of London to account. Last week it emerged that four members of Mr Bailey's campaign team had been disciplined over the party in the basement of the Conservatives' Westminster base. Which parties are being investigated? He was said to have briefly attended to give a speech thanking the group, some of whom stayed on for the banned gathering, at its end-of-year-briefing. Born in North Kensington to a British-Jamaican family, Mr Bailey has been a member of the London Assembly since 2016. Mr Bailey, who has a degree in computer-aided engineering from London South Bank University, co-founded a charity called MyGeneration in 2006; it ceased operations in 2012 due to financial problems. Mr Bailey, who came second to Labour's Sadiq Khan in May's London mayoral election, had faced mounting calls to quit against a backdrop ofthe launch of an official probeinto three government parties. Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat Assembly Members have come together in a joint call to Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, to investigate reports of the party. The statement reads: ""Londoners, once again, feel let down and angry at these reports. So many people have made huge sacrifices over the last 21 months, particularly those who have been working on the front line, including your officers, and those lives have been directly and often tragically, impacted by Covid-19. ""It is essential that all those who breach the rules are held to account."" Boris Johnson announced last week that top civil servant Simon Case would lead an inquiry into a video of a mock press conference in which government spokeswoman Allegra Stratton joked with fellow staffers about a party held at 10 Downing Street in breach of regulations. The clip, first shown by ITV News, was recorded last year on 18 December - a day on which more than 400 Covid deaths were reported. Ms Stratton apologised and resigned over the video.

"Wildfires have been made more severe by high temperatures and strong winds in the Arctic The highest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic, 38C (100F), has been officially confirmed, sounding ""alarm bells"" over Earth's changing climate. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) on Tuesday verified the record, reported in the Siberian town of Verkhoyansk on 20 June last year. The temperature was 18C higher than the area's average daily maximum for June. The WMO, a UN agency, said the extreme heat was ""more befitting the Mediterranean than the Arctic"". It is the first time the agency has included the Arctic Circle in its archive of extreme weather reports. The WMO said the 38C temperature was measured at a meteorological station during ""an exceptional and prolonged Siberian heatwave,external"". Last year's extreme heat in the region contributed to the spread of wildfires, which swept across the forests and peatlands of northern Russia releasing record amounts of carbon. While relatively common in summer months, high temperatures and strong winds made the fires unusually severe. The high temperatures across Siberia led to ""massive sea ice loss"" and played a major role in 2020 being one of the three warmest years on record, the WMO said. What is climate change? A really simple guide How do we know humans affect climate change? How extreme weather is linked to climate change The agency said its verification of the Verkhoyansk record highlighted how temperatures were increasing in a climatically important region of the world. ""This new Arctic record is one of a series of observations reported to the WMO archive of Weather and Climate Extremes that sound the alarm bells about our changing climate,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. Mr Taalas told the BBC that melting snow and ice in the Russian Arctic were boosting warming. ""This is very much caused by changes in the radiation properties of the soil and the ocean... once we had snow cover, the radiation properties of the surface is very different from the dark soil or open sea,"" he said. The WMO said it had added the Arctic Circle to its World Weather and Climate Extremes archive under a new category for high temperatures in the region. The Arctic is one of the fastest warming regions in the world, heating at more than twice the global average, the WMO said. Warming in the Arctic is leading to the thawing of once permanently frozen permafrost below ground. This is alarming scientists because as permafrost thaws, carbon dioxide and methane previously locked up below ground is released. These greenhouse gases can cause further warming, and further thawing of the permafrost, in a vicious cycle known as positive feedback. The higher temperatures also cause land ice in the Arctic to melt at a faster rate, leading to greater run-off into the ocean where it contributes to sea-level rise. Human activity is contributing to a rise in world temperatures, and climate change now threatens every aspect of human life. Left unchecked, humans and nature will experience catastrophic warming, with worsening droughts, greater sea level rise and mass extinction of species.

"Health officials hope to administer as many booster doses as possible before the end of December Medical students and army doctors may be drafted in to deliver booster jabs across Northern Ireland as quickly as possible, the health minister has said. Robin Swann said he mightreturn to the Ministry of Defence for help. He was speaking amid fears of a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases from the new Omicron variant. One expert has warned that Omicron cases could reach over 1,000 a day in Northern Ireland by Christmas Eve due to the speed at which it spreads. Ten cases of the Covid-19 varianthave been detected in Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned in a televised address on Sunday that there was a""tidal wave of Omicron coming"". Meanwhile, long queues of people have been waiting at vaccination centres across Northern Ireland to get their booster jabs. Boosters are now being made available at walk-in centres for those aged 30 and above, whose last dose was administered at least three months ago. The Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland have identified eight additional cases of the Omicron variant in the country on Monday. Long queues have been reported at some vaccination centres on Monday, including this one in Londonderry That brings the total number of cases identified by the department there to 18. The country will soon be moving to a three-month gap between Covid-19 vaccine and booster doses, following a recommendation from the country's National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). Currently boosters are being given out to people aged 50 and over, people with underlying health conditions and healthcare workers. Mr Swann said he intended to announce plans in the ""next few days"" around booster availability for younger age groups. ""I need to emphasise the scale of the booster programme challenge and the Herculean efforts being made to get jabs to as many people as possible in the coming weeks,"" he said. Mr Swann told the Northern Ireland Assembly that 513 additional vaccinators had been sourced and urged people to check updates from health trusts on social media to determine the best time to attend the various walk-in facilities. ""We're already seeing sites where unfortunately we're seeing more people turn up than we actually have capacity,"" he said. But the focus is to get as many vaccines into arms as soon as is practically possible, he added. Dr Andrew Kunzmann, an epidemiologist at Queen's University Belfast, said Omicron cases in Northern Ireland could reach over 1,000 a day ""by Christmas Eve"". He said it was an ""inexact science"" but he estimated there would be ""quite a lot of cases by Christmas Day"". Dr Andrew Kunzmann warned there could be 1,000 cases a day in Northern Ireland by Christmas ""We want to slow that down as much as possible so that at Christmas Day fewer families have someone sitting at the table that's infected so that then hopefully we don't have that big post-Christmas peak that we did last year,"" he said. Trust hubs will be extending their opening hours and days of operation with immediate effect and hundreds of additional vaccinators are in the process of being recruited. The deferral of some planned routine health service activity is also under consideration. UK alert level raised to four - what does that mean? NI Covid booster uptake rises but infection rate high Police to lead Covid-19 passport enforcement - Long ""GPs, community pharmacies and trust hubs will all have a central and vital role in making this happen,"" Mr Swann said ""It is also really important that people who are not yet vaccinated come forward for their first dose without delay."" Earlier on Monday, First Minister Paul Givan said Northern Ireland was facing a Covid-19 ""storm"". ""This new variant is two-and-a-half times more transmissible, there is not the same protection from the first and second doses, but the booster does provide additional protection and that's why we need to get it out there,"" he said. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said ministers had been warned Northern Ireland could be ""overwhelmed with this new variant by early January"". There are now 10 confirmed cases of Omicron in Northern Ireland. None of those cases are in hospital, and of course, the true number is likely to be much higher. I understand those cases are either travel related or household contacts - so there is either little or no community transmission that public health officials can identify. That is good but it is a situation that will change. It's all about trying to contain cases at this stage in order to protect the public and the health service, but with just weeks to go before Christmas - where travel and socialising really is at its peak - that's going to be very difficult to do. We are in a different position than this time last year - while the vaccine had just come on the market, a lot of us hadn't got it. The language used by the prime minister and the UK's chief medical officers on Sunday night was shocking - it was designed to jolt us and trigger a rapid acceleration of the booster programme. Chief scientific adviser Prof Ian Young said Northern Ireland now had an opportunity to get in the ""strongest possible position"" ahead of the inevitable rise in cases.

He said a ""huge amount of work"" had taken place over the weekend to do with the booster jabs for the over-30s. Northern Ireland hashad a slower uptake for booster doses in comparison with Great Britain. The health officials in charge of vaccines have said that is because of the initial emphasis put on getting boosters into care homes. More than 500,000 booster/third doses have been delivered to date. Northern Ireland's Covid certificationbecame legally enforceable on Monday.

"This video can not be played Watch: The moment MPs approved the introduction of a Covid pass in England Boris Johnson has won backing for Covid passes in England, despite the biggest revolt by Tory MPs since he became PM. A total of 99 Conservatives voted against the government, but the measure was passed by a majority of 243 thanks to Labour support. So NHS Covid passes, showing a recent negative test or full vaccination, must be shown to get into many large venues, including nightclubs, from Wednesday. MPs also voted to back compulsory face masks in most indoor settings. Where will I need to use a Covid passport? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Tory rebellion over Covid passes was a ""very significant blow to the already damaged authority of the prime minister"". ""It confirms that he's too weak to discharge the basic functions of government,"" he added. Health minister Gillian Keegan admitted Conservative MPs had faced ""difficult"" decisions, still having received only ""partial information"" from scientists on the Omicron variant. ""We have decided that we need to buy time... We really do need to slow down this unbelievably transmittable virus,"" she added. The Covid measures MPs voted for: Making vaccinations compulsory for NHS workers in England Over-18s in England must prove they are fully vaccinated or have a recent negative lateral flow test to enter a number of large venues, such as nightclubs, from Wednesday Daily lateral flow tests for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with Covid cases, instead of isolation Continue making face masks compulsory in a wider range of venues Before the votes, the prime minister made a last-minute plea to his MPs to support the government's measures, outlined in its Plan B, designed to deal with an expected winter surge in coronavirus infections. But Conservative backbenchers lined up during the Commons debate to criticise them. After the Covid passes vote, one Tory rebel, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said the scale of the revolt meant a leadership challenge to Mr Johnson had ""got to be on the cards"" next year. Another, Sir Charles Walker, told the BBC that Tory MPs still backed the PM, but the rebellion was a ""cry of pain"" over the specific measure, which they viewed as an attack on personal freedoms that would not halt the spread of Covid. There was also concern from the Night Time Industries Association, representing nightclubs, who said passes would ""jeopardise the survival of businesses in 2022"" and called for ""urgent additional"" financial support from the government. The arrival of another Covid variant has, of course, prompted the government to act to try to protect the public's health. If the Omicron outbreak is as enormous as the worst-case scenarios predict, much of the current political debate may be swamped, or indeed feel quickly irrelevant or self-indulgent. But right now, Tory fears about the action ministers are taking are not just about the specifics of this debate but about what many perceive as a lack of thinking about whether we can live like this for ever. Read Laura's blog Some 38 Tory MPs - and three DUP members - rebelled against the government over the face mask plan, which has already come into effect. There was also a big Conservative rebellion - involving 63 MPs - over compulsory vaccinations for frontline NHS workers. But, after the measure was passed by the Commons, GMB union national secretary Rehana Azam said: ""We are opposed to legally enforced medical procedures as a condition of employment - it's heavy-handed and will deepen the health service's devastating staff black hole."" Scrapping self-isolation, in favour of daily lateral flow tests, for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with Covid cases, including Omicron, was passed unanimously without a vote. Labour shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said his party backed the Plan B measures because they would ""help us have a safer Christmas as well as to protect our NHS from being totally overwhelmed"". But eight of the party's MPs, including former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, plus former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who now sits as an independent, voted against Covid passes. Labour's Rachael Maskell resigned as a shadow culture minister after opposing the measure. Where will I need to use a Covid passport? How many Covid cases are there in the UK?

"In a series of Commons votes, MPs have backed the government's Plan B measures aimed at tackling the Omicron variant of coronavirus MPs voted to approve changing the rules on mask wearing and self-isolation - the system is replaced by daily lateral flow tests The introduction of Covid passes for large venues passes by 369 votes to 126 Nearly 100 Conservative MPs voted against the regulations The measure requires people to show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter some venues Backbencher Sir Charles Walker said the rebellion was a ""cry of pain"" by the party Boris Johnson described the plan as ""balanced and proportionate"" in light of the new Omicron variant Edited by Rob Corp That's it from us today - thanks for following our live coverage of today's Commons debate on new Covid regulations for England. The live page was written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Scott and Justin Parkinson, with correspondent analysis by Iain Watson. The editor was Rob Corp. You can keep up to date with any developments by readingour main story. It's been a dramatic evening here in Westminster, with Boris Johnsonfacing his biggest rebellion since becoming prime minister. Here's what happened: The House of Commons official photographer has been in the chamber capturing some of the key moments of the debate today. Here are some of the best shots, as MPs consider the government's proposals to introduce its Plan B Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Sajid Javid faced many interventions from his fellow Tory MPs over the votes, with many expressing their intention to vote against the government Javid set out the reasons the government intended to move to Plan B as debate opened The health secretary's tough reception was not just from his own side of the House, the opposition benches also had some words for him Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting outlined the Labour Party's support for the government, which is expected to allow the votes to proceed despite a significant Tory rebellion Louie French was elected less than two weeks ago The Conservative Party's newest MP was among those to vote against the introduction of mandatory Covid passes. Louie French, who won the Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election less than two weeks ago, said he did so to fulfil an election pledge. He wrote on Twitter: ""I fully support the booster rollout and I will get mine ASAP thanks to the efforts of the government, NHS, pharmacies, Army and volunteers. ""But, I made a clear pre-election pledge that I would not support Covid passes for our domestic economy and voted accordingly."" Some more news on the last Covid-related vote of the evening, on compulsory vaccinations for frontline NHS staff in England. Sixty-three Tory MPs rebelled against the government. This is the second biggest Conservative rebellion - after the one on Covid venue passes earlier tonight - since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Reacting to the Conservative rebellion, Scotland's first minister says it makes ""all UK nations less safe"". Nicola Sturgeon writes on Twitter,external: ""Under current funding arrangements, without responsible public health protections in England, there's no financial provision for such protections in Scotland, Wales or NI. ""It's a big problem in [the] face of this Covid challenge."" Nations have the power to set their own Covid regulations but overall funding for public services is allocated from central government under the Barnett formula. The formula means funding is adjusted based on comparable spending per person in England. Earlier today,people in Scotland were asked to limit socialising to three households at a timein the run-up to Christmas. It seems the numbers who voted in the Commons division on Covid passes might not be complete yet. The official division list - recording who voted for and against - shows only 123 of the MPs who opposed the government. The result in the Commons said 126 went this way. Anyway, as it stands, 96 Tory MPs defied the government, while two acted as tellers - vote counters - meaning they felt the same way but weren't counted themselves. Eight Labour MPs, 10 Liberal Democrats, six DUP, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Independent MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Rob Roberts also opposed the regulations. We'll try to find out about the other three, Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent They tried to persuade. They tried to cajole. Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed a packed meeting of backbench
MPs, setting out the risks posed by the new Covid variant. Professor Chris Whitty, Englandâs chief medical
officer, briefed MPs too  - telling them to expect a significant
increase in hospitalisations. But plenty of Conservative rebels - nearly 100 - simply
werenât for turning. That far outstrips the 55 MPs who voted against the Covid
tier system â remember that? â last year. It says a lot about the scepticism towards Covid passports But it also highlights a significant and growing gap between
the government and its backbenchers. And it suggests that, after weeks of negative headlines, the prime ministerâs authority has been seriously eroded - just as the country faces the next Covid crisis. Many Conservatives seem to have heeded the call
from former chief whip Mark Harper to use the vote to force the government
to show more respect for MPs. He is pressing for a recall of Parliament over Christmas, should the prime minister feel itâs necessary to introduce further
restrictions. Whether todayâs show of force from the back benches makes a
recall likely â or something Boris Johnson would want to avoid at all costs â
remains to be seen. The hope of many rebels is that the prime minister will
instead feel he can now go no further than Plan B. Itâs clear the mood on the Conservative benches is restless,
to say the least. All eyes at Westminster will be on Thursdayâs North Shropshire
by-election, as Conservative MPs openly mull over whether their big
electoral asset in 2019 - Johnson â has turned in to a liability. A body representing nightclubs says it is ""disappointed"" MPs have approved plans to make Covid passes mandatory for large venues. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, says his organisation has consistently opposed Covid passes because of the ""logistical challenges they pose"". ""It is very disappointing that, after flip-flopping on the
issue twice, the government have decided to press ahead with the plans despite
no evidence of their impact on transmission of the virus,"" he says. âThis is a slippery path we are
going down. I would urge the government to listen to its backbenchers now â
this far and no further.â If more restrictions are introduced, Kill says there must be a ""proportionate support package including a return of the furlough scheme"". Charles Walker, one of the 98 Tory MPs to rebel against the government on Covid passes, says the prime minister still has ""huge support"" but ""this was just a bridge too far"". âIt was a cry of pain from the Conservative Party,"" he tells the BBC. However, Walker says he does not believe the rebellion calls into question the PM's ability to persuade his own MPs over the things he wants to do. The Tory MP says many colleagues were ""holding their nose"" when voting for mandatory Covid passes and the prime minister and his team ""need to listen"". ""The mood has changed"" and backbench views on further restrictions ""are hardening"", he adds. Some figures are in. Ninety-eight Conservative MPs rebelled against the government over Covid passes in England. That's by far the biggest such act of defiance by his own troops since Boris Johnson became PM. Also, eight Labour MPs rebelled against their own front bench to oppose the plan - Sir Keir Starmer had ordered them to support it.  After several hours of debate, the government's proposals for tackling the Omicron variant in England have been approved by MPs - albeit with a significant rebellion by some Tories. Here's what they voted for: The result of the final vote is in, with the government's plans to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for front-line NHS workers in England passing by 385 votes to 100. So all the measures got through, one without a vote and the others by varying margins. Forty Conservative MPs rebelled  against government plans to make face coverings compulsory in most indoor settings. Thirty-eight Tories voted against the plans, while a further two who were opposed acted as tellers. A further three DUP MPs also voted against. Labour's whips office is suggesting that 101 Conservative MPs rebelled against the government on Covid passes for large venues in England. We'll have the full figures as soon as possible. The previous biggest rebellion against Boris Johnson's government involved 59 Tory MPs. And now for the final Commons vote this evening, on whether front-line NHS staff in England should be compelled to be vaccinated for Covid. Like the other measures, this is expected to pass easily, but the size of any Tory rebellion will be closely watched. It looks like there was a big one in the previous vote, on Covid passes for entry to large venues. The House of Commons backs the government's plan to introduce Covid passes - or passports - for entry to large venues in England, such as nightclubs, by 369 votes to 126. The Labour leadership supported the move, but the Liberal Democrats and many on Boris Johnson's own Conservative benches opposed it. MPs have unanimously voted to approve changing the rules so that vaccinated people who come into contact with suspected Omicron cases will no longer have to self-isolate. Anyone coming into contact with Covid cases of any kind will be""strongly advised"" to take lateral flow tests,externalfor seven days. Right, MPs are filing out for the second of tonight's votes. This time it's the one where the biggest Tory rebellion is expected - on whether to introduce a Covid pass - called a ""passport"" by many - to allow access to nightclubs and other sizeable venues. Another motion, on isolation, got through ""on the nod"" - that is, without opposition in the Commons chamber. Regulations making wearing face masks compulsory in most indoor settings, except for pubs and restaurants, have been approved by MPs. The government wins by 441 votes to 41. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Family members said Afrasia Mohammed, 27, was seeking a better life in the UK French authorities have formally identified 26 of the 27 bodies recovered after last month's mass drowning in the English Channel. Sixteen Kurdish people from Iraq and four Afghans were among the victims, whose families are being informed. They included two friends from the same town who died in the worst-recorded migrant tragedy in the Channel. Their inflatable boat sank while attempting to cross to the UK from France on 24 November. The BBC spoke to the families of Rezhwan Hassan, 18, and 27-year-old Afrasia Mohammed, who were both from the town of Rania, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Their families had not heard from the two men since the disaster, leaving them anxiously awaiting news. The two friends each paid people smugglers thousands of dollars to help them reach the UK. At the end of October they flew into Belarus - an increasingly popular smuggling route - and crossed the border into the European Union before reaching France. Rezhwan Hassan was a carpenter who dreamed of a better life in the UK. His nephew, Dahin Hama, says he tried to talk him out of going. ""We were like brothers; our friendship was strong,"" Dahin Hama said. ""He said he would emigrate from Kurdistan. He said that he cannot bear to live here, and there is no life left to live."" The last time he heard from Rezhwan was on the night of the boat crossing. Rezhwan told his family that he'd contact them from the UK. They pleaded with him to come back, but he said he would make it to the UK ""even if it cost him death"", Dahin Hama said. Hours later, he would lose his life, along with at least 26 others. Rezhwan Hassan's family last heard from him on the night of the crossing Also in the boat was his friend, Afrasia Mohamed. His sister, Nergiz Ahmed Mohammed, says Afrasia believed that the UK promised him a brighter future. ""He went for a better life, and he said there are human rights there,"" she said. ""These don't exist in Kurdistan. All his hopes were to get to the UK, that's why he left."" But he too would never make it. On Tuesday, Kurdish authorities told his family that his body was one of the 27 found. But even before this, his family had been grieving for weeks. ""What is more important? The life of a human being or borders? Where are the human rights? How can they let those people drown and then say it's not our issue?"" Nergiz Ahmed Mohammed said. This video can not be played Channel disaster: A father's anguish, a missing family Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin, a 24-year-old Kurdish woman from northern Iraq,was the first person to be confirmed as a victim in late November. Other names have been reported by Kurdish media but they are yet to be independently verified. On Tuesday, France's justice ministry said the bodies of 26 of at least 27 victims had been identified and repatriation requests were under way. The ministry said it could confirm the identity of 16 Kurdish people from Iraq, including four women aged 22 to 46, a 16-year-old teenager, a seven-year-old child and ten men aged 19 to 37, as well as that of a 23-year-old Kurdish man from Iran. Three Ethiopians were also identified, including two women aged 22 and 25 and a man aged 46. A Somali woman aged 33, four Afghan men aged between 24 and 40 and an Egyptian man aged 20 were also identified. None of the women victims were pregnant, French authorities said. Calais's mayor said at the time of the tragedy that a pregnant woman was among those who died,in comments reported by the BBC. Record numbers of migrants have been making the dangerous journey from France to the UK across the Channel in small boats this year. The crossings have strained an already fraught relationship between France and the UK, which traded recriminations after the tragedy on 24 November. But despite the risks, people are still heading to Western countries in large numbers, including many from northern Iraq. An estimated 40,000 people have left the region for Europe in the past year alone, using illegal smuggling routes. More families are bracing themselves for bad news in the coming days as French authorities contact the loved ones of the drowned victims.

"3200 covers have already been cancelled for December across Ms Isaac's four restaurants As the hospitality industry reels from the impact of new Covid curbs, pubs and restaurants have reported a wave of Christmas cancellations. The Bar 44 chain, which has four outlets, told the BBC 3,200 people had scrapped bookings for December. Natalie Isaac, its operations director, said only a ""handful"" of people would have cancelled before the pandemic. Others say that although they face no new rules, public caution is causing lower footfall and a loss of trade. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called for the government to provide financial support for businesses affected, but the Treasury has not unveiled any new measures. Bar 44, which has restaurants in Bristol and Cardiff, says 1,000 of the 3,200 lost bookings were down to the knock-on effects of cancelled concerts by Tom Jones and the Stereophonics. ""Having to stay open but not getting the business is our big worry,"" Ms Isaac explained. ""This should be our bumper two weeks before Christmas, but the diary is worryingly empty. We're significantly impacted and without furlough, we won't be able to protect our staff."" Ms Isaac was unable to give a figure for the loss of trade across the month, as the venues are not operating at full pre-pandemic capacity. They have also been opening just five days a week, because of staff shortages that started before the new Plan B restrictions. ""We're slightly refilling with small groups, but people are worried to go out again as they don't want to catch Covid during Christmas."" 'People don't realise the impact of cancellations' 'Non-stop cancellations' after Christmas party plea UK alert level raised to four - what does that mean? The CBI said hospitality businesses and shops were facing a ""double whammy"" of collapsing demand and no financial help because of the government's Plan B, aimed at fighting the spread of the Omicron variant. CBI director general Tony Danker said the restrictions were ""balanced"", but ministers needed to clarify that they were temporary. ""Whilst we have measures to keep the economy open, we have messages that have ended up closing much of it down,"" he told the BBC. ""We saved these businesses in the last 18 months. We kept them flourishing,"" he said. ""We can't lose that now, to essentially if unintentionally close down the restaurant sector at this time of year. That's a huge cashflow hit,"" he added. ""We need to revisit cashflow measures to support those businesses. We can't pretend that the economy is still open when demand has been so suppressed for understandable reasons."" A Treasury spokesperson said that the government had ""acted early"" to help control the virus's spread while ""avoiding damaging economic and social restrictions by allowing businesses to remain open"". ""To continue to protect the NHS, as well as jobs and livelihoods across the country, our priority is to ensure everyone who is eligible gets their booster jabs as quickly as possible. ""Our Â£400bn Covid-19 support package will continue to help businesses into spring next year and we will continue to respond proportionately to the changing path of theâ¯virus, as we have done since the start of the pandemic,"" the spokesperson added. Clive Watson, boss of pub chain, City Pub Group, said every kind of booking was now in decline since the Plan B announcement. ""In an nutshell, the big corporate parties have really started to be cancelled, which were really lucrative,"" he explained. ""To a certain extent, these were being compensated by smaller groups still booking, but now they're starting to cancel as well. ""What we're facing is a partial lockdown, but with no government assistance this time round."" Mr Watson said it was still worth staying open, but added that the impact would be sizeable if no further financial assistance came from the government. Data for Monday to Sunday of last week from the trade body UKHospitality, for example, showed a 13% drop in business and a 15% increase in cancellations, compared with pre-pandemic levels. The Caviar and Chips hospitality group has had to pivot to weddings next year after corporate cancellations As people revise their Christmas plans, Marc Hornby, co-founder of the Caviar and Chips catering and hospitality group, says corporate event inquiries are now ""next to none"". The country-wide external catering firm based in Birmingham has had to pivot to focusing on wedding events for 2022 and 2023 because of the impact of the current restrictions. ""It's been a significant drop - we're seeing 25% of the business we'd usually see,"" Mr Hornby told the BBC. ""The biggest challenge has been the mixed messaging and the government not realising how much it costs to cancel events."" Recruitment has also been difficult for 18 months, but Mr Hornby said they had anticipated fresh restrictions, so had planned more small events. The group owns a pub in Kenilworth, opened in March 2020, a week before lockdown. After moving to takeaways during lockdown, it has reopened, but has also seen very few corporate bookings. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said that Plan B restrictions had ""destroyed"" the crucial Christmas trading time for pubs. ""Further restrictions such as limits on group sizes, or even closing pubs, would be disastrous,"" she explained. ""Pubs need all the trade they can get this Christmas to make it through the quiet winter months ahead. ""Without it, they will need a full financial package from the government, including support on VAT, business rates and a return of the local authority grants. ""The chancellor needs to come to our rescue once more."" A spokesperson from restaurants operator Mitchells & Butlers, which runs brands such as All Bar One, O'Neill's, Harvester and Toby Carvery, said: ""We are deeply disappointed by the announcement of Plan B and the knock-on effect this will have on our industry as we continue to try to rebuild our businesses during the pandemic. ""We will, of course, comply with the Plan B regulations.  Very few of our businesses will be affected by the Covid pass provisions, and face masks are not required in our pubs and restaurants under the new guidance. ""We have no plans to introduce any additional restrictions unless required to do so."" Have you cancelled your Christmas booking? How have your plans changed due to the Omicron coronavirus variant?

A total of 99 Conservatives voted against the government, but the measure was passed by a majority of 243 thanks to Labour support.

Health minister Gillian Keegan admitted Conservative MPs had faced ""difficult"" decisions, still having received only ""partial information"" from scientists on the Omicron variant. ""We have decided that we need to buy time... We really do need to slow down this unbelievably transmittable virus,"" she added. The Covid measures MPs voted for: Making vaccinations compulsory for NHS workers in England Over-18s in England must prove they are fully vaccinated or have a recent negative lateral flow test to enter a number of large venues, such as nightclubs, from Wednesday Daily lateral flow tests for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with Covid cases, instead of isolation Continue making face masks compulsory in a wider range of venues Before the votes, the prime minister made a last-minute plea to his MPs to support the government's measures, outlined in its Plan B, designed to deal with an expected winter surge in coronavirus infections. But Conservative backbenchers lined up during the Commons debate to criticise them. After the Covid passes vote, one Tory rebel, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said the scale of the revolt meant a leadership challenge to Mr Johnson had ""got to be on the cards"" next year. Another, Sir Charles Walker, told the BBC that Tory MPs still backed the PM, but the rebellion was a ""cry of pain"" over the specific measure, which they viewed as an attack on personal freedoms that would not halt the spread of Covid. There was also concern from the Night Time Industries Association, representing nightclubs, who said passes would ""jeopardise the survival of businesses in 2022"" and called for ""urgent additional"" financial support from the government. The arrival of another Covid variant has, of course, prompted the government to act to try to protect the public's health. If the Omicron outbreak is as enormous as the worst-case scenarios predict, much of the current political debate may be swamped, or indeed feel quickly irrelevant or self-indulgent. But right now, Tory fears about the action ministers are taking are not just about the specifics of this debate but about what many perceive as a lack of thinking about whether we can live like this for ever. Read Laura's blog Some 38 Tory MPs - and three DUP members - rebelled against the government over the face mask plan, which has already come into effect. There was also a big Conservative rebellion - involving 63 MPs - over compulsory vaccinations for frontline NHS workers. But, after the measure was passed by the Commons, GMB union national secretary Rehana Azam said: ""We are opposed to legally enforced medical procedures as a condition of employment - it's heavy-handed and will deepen the health service's devastating staff black hole."" Scrapping self-isolation, in favour of daily lateral flow tests, for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with Covid cases, including Omicron, was passed unanimously without a vote. Labour shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said his party backed the Plan B measures because they would ""help us have a safer Christmas as well as to protect our NHS from being totally overwhelmed"". But eight of the party's MPs, including former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, plus former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who now sits as an independent, voted against Covid passes. Labour's Rachael Maskell resigned as a shadow culture minister after opposing the measure. Where will I need to use a Covid passport? How many Covid cases are there in the UK?

"The temporary lack of in-person PCR tests in England on Tuesday was due to exceptionally high demand, UK Health Security Agency sources say. While home testing kits remained available, the UK's official booking website briefly showed no appointments available anywhere in England. However, more time slots have since been released to cope with demand. PCR tests are required for people who have Covid symptoms or who have tested positive on a lateral flow test. As the testing slots ran out, a statement on the booking website read: ""If you cannot get a test now, try again later. You will not be able to get a test through the helplines."" PCR tests are now once again available at testing sites in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But there are still none listed as available in London, Hertfordshire, Suffolk, the Isle of Wight, Bristol, and Mendip - while there are ""very few"" in Stockton-on-Tees. How do I book my vaccine booster? How do I get a lateral flow or PCR Covid test? On Monday, the ordering of lateral flow test kits from the government website was also temporarily suspended - again due to high demand - while members of the public complained of waiting for hours in online queues for the chance to book a Covid vaccine appointment. Downing Street said ministers were working with Royal Mail and Amazon to ensure more lateral flow tests can be delivered. The surge in demand for both tests and vaccines comes as the UK battles to slow the spread of the Omicron variant in the run-up to Christmas. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all over-18s across the UK will be offered the chance to get a booster jab before the end of the month, while MPs are set to vote later on a raft of new restrictions for England, some of which are already in effect. Under the new rules: Face coverings are compulsory in most indoor public venues, including theatres and cinemas - as well as on public transport and in places like shops and hairdressers People should work from home ""if they can"" Daily lateral flow testing for seven days is required for fully-vaccinated people who are contacts of positive Covid cases From Wednesday, some venues and events would be legally required to check the Covid status of visitors During the Commons debate on the new rules, Health Secretary Sajid Javid described Omicron as a ""grave threat"", adding scientists ""have never seen a variant capable of spreading so rapidly"" and the government needed to slow its advance. However, due to the widespread prevalence of Omicron internationally, England's travel red list, which restricts travel to certain countries, will cease to exist from Wednesday at 04:00 GMT, Mr Javid said. Monday saw online booster jab bookings open for people aged 30 and over - a day after the prime minister announced an expansion to the rollout amid the ""Omicron emergency"". People aged 18 to 29 will be able to book their booster jabs online from Wednesday. More than 500,000 people booked a vaccine appointment online on Monday, while others queued up at walk-in centres across the country. Modelling by the UKHSA estimates the current number of daily Omicron infections is around 200,000, and Dr Susan Hopkins, its chief medical adviser, has said the growth rate of Omicron seems to be ""shortening rather than lengthening"". ""We have been studying this virus for three weeks today and in that time period we have shown that in the UK this is growing very fast, with a growth rate initially two to three days and that growth rate seems to be shortening, rather than lengthening at the moment,"" she told the Science and Technology Committee of MPs. UK expected to remove 11 countries from red list Why do boosters work if two doses struggle? The latest official figures show there are 4,713 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant, with 10 people, aged between 18 and 85, hospitalised with the variant in England. However, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab caused confusion on Tuesday when he told Sky News there were 250 Omicron cases in hospital, then immediately afterwards told the BBC there were nine cases. When contacted by the BBC, the UKHSA said neither answer was right, and the actual number was still 10. The PM's official spokesman said ministers had been told by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, that a ""significant increase in hospitalisations"" from Omicron is expected. But the spokesman added it was still ""too early to say"" how severe the illness caused by the Omicron variant is. Who can get an NHS Covid jab this autumn?

"This video can not be played Watch: The moment MPs approved the introduction of a Covid pass in England Boris Johnson has won backing for Covid passes in England, despite the biggest revolt by Tory MPs since he became PM. A total of 99 Conservatives voted against the government, but the measure was passed by a majority of 243 thanks to Labour support. So NHS Covid passes, showing a recent negative test or full vaccination, must be shown to get into many large venues, including nightclubs, from Wednesday. MPs also voted to back compulsory face masks in most indoor settings. Where will I need to use a Covid passport? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Tory rebellion over Covid passes was a ""very significant blow to the already damaged authority of the prime minister"". ""It confirms that he's too weak to discharge the basic functions of government,"" he added. Health minister Gillian Keegan admitted Conservative MPs had faced ""difficult"" decisions, still having received only ""partial information"" from scientists on the Omicron variant. ""We have decided that we need to buy time... We really do need to slow down this unbelievably transmittable virus,"" she added. The Covid measures MPs voted for: Making vaccinations compulsory for NHS workers in England Over-18s in England must prove they are fully vaccinated or have a recent negative lateral flow test to enter a number of large venues, such as nightclubs, from Wednesday Daily lateral flow tests for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with Covid cases, instead of isolation Continue making face masks compulsory in a wider range of venues Before the votes, the prime minister made a last-minute plea to his MPs to support the government's measures, outlined in its Plan B, designed to deal with an expected winter surge in coronavirus infections. But Conservative backbenchers lined up during the Commons debate to criticise them. After the Covid passes vote, one Tory rebel, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said the scale of the revolt meant a leadership challenge to Mr Johnson had ""got to be on the cards"" next year.

"Scotland's first minister wants to slow down the spread of the Omicron variant - which now accounts for 27.5% of Scotland's cases - while the booster vaccine programme is being ramped up Nicola Sturgeon's statement outlines new guidelines on social contact which includes asking for no more than three households to meet in social settings She adds that she will not limit numbers on Christmas day - but guidance will be issued to ""make Christmas safer"" Over 18s in Scotland will be able to book their booster jabs from tomorrow but Scotland's FM concedes that ""not everyone will have been vaccinated by the end of December"" Ms Sturgeon ends her statement: ""Please follow the new advice I have outlined today. Although it is guidance, please do not think of it as optional."" The UK government has announced more funding to each of the devolved nations ""to progress their vaccine rollout"" Opposition parties question the Scottish government's ability to deliver the booster programme BBC Scotland News It has been a hectic afternoon and early evening as Nicola Sturgeon outlined her plans to tackle the latest wave of coronavirus in Scotland. But what did we we learn from her statement to parliament and what new guidelines are in place?  That's it for our live page coverage of events today. Thanks for joining us. Mr Swinney is asked if people would still be allowed to stand up and drink at bars when the new rules come into force on Saturday. The deputy first minister says he expects people will ""exercise the type of caution they are familiar with already"". Mr Swinney says it is all about ""sensible
steps in the short term"" to allow hospitality businesses to stay open and keep people safe. Deputy first minister John Swinney says there are no
current plans to make changes to big sporting events. In the coming weeks, Scotland has a number of large
football matches coming up including the League Cup final this weekend and the
Celtic v Rangers derby on 2 January. But Mr Swinney toldDrivetimethere are no plans to make changes to
these âat this stageâ and added âI would hope for them not be under scrutinyâ. The deputy first minister says spectators will need to âexercise
extra careâ and adds there will be dialogue with clubs to ensure appropriate
social distancing measures are in place for people entering and leaving stadia. The UK government says an extra 100 Armed Forces personnel are being made available to
accelerate the vaccine rollout in Scotland. That is on top of the 121
personnel who have been supporting the vaccine programme since
early October. Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace said: âOur Armed Forces continue to tirelessly support the Covid-19
vaccination programme in Scotland to give people and communities vital
protection against this virus. âThis uplift in support will help to get more vaccines into arms
faster, working shoulder to shoulder with the dedicated health services.â Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor This
package of new rules for business and strong guidance to all of us to cut back
on social contact is the toughest anywhere in the UK. Nicola
Sturgeon argues that however unwelcome, it is necessary to help slow down the
spread of Omicron while booster vaccines are speeded up. Unlike
the political row over Plan B for England, these new measures for Scotland do
not face fierce resistance from the Conservatives or other opposition parties
at Holyrood. Instead,
they question the detailed arrangements for getting financial support to
businesses and accelerating the delivery of Covid jabs. Ms
Sturgeon said she would have tightened hospitality rules further with financial
support from the Treasury - support that has now been announced. While
rules on social distancing and other measures for retail and hospitality will
be backed up by regulations, the request for reduced social mixing is not. The
first minister said that did not make it optional. But it is not without
contradiction. How,
for instance, do you avoid contact with people from many households if you go
to nightclubs which remain open for business? Lady Poole Deputy first minister John Swinney announces the Scottish
Covid-19 inquiry will be chaired by Lady Poole. The public inquiry will investigate a number of areas
including:  Mr Swinney is due to appear onBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeshortly. Question from Kirsty in Montrose We have had a lot of questions about the potential impact of Omicron on major life events. During the pandemic, both weddings and funerals were hit hard by restrictions on guest and mourner numbers. But the legal requirement for physical distancing and limits on gatherings were removed on 9 August. Despite the concerns over the new variant, there has been no change to the current guidance. It states: ""There are no limits on the number of people who can attend weddings, civil partnerships and funerals. This is also the case for other life events such as christenings, anniversary celebrations, bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland has a number of large football matches coming up including the League Cup final this weekend and the Celtic v Rangers derby on 2 January. Dr Sandesh Gulhane, from the Scottish Conservatives, tellsDrivetimethat we need to have ""sensible precautions"" in place around such football matches. He says: ""My feeling would be we need to look very carefully at that
and possibly, possibly, may need to cancel that."" However, he adds that he hopes the Scottish government has done modelling around such events and decided on whether it is the ""correct thing to do"" - although he points out this data was not supplied in a recent evidence paper. The debate around restrictions and whether they go far enough is, understandably, a hot topic. Tory MSP and part-time GP Sandesh Gulhane says the measures announced today will suffice for this phase of the battle against Omicron. Speaking onBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime, Dr Gulhane says, ""at the moment I
donât think we need further restrictions"" but adds the key is speeding up the booster jab rollout. Dr Gulhane welcomes the move to open more large-scale vaccination centres but adds this should have been done earlier. Just to recap on the latest statistics around Covid in Scotland... There were 3,117 new cases of Covid-19 reported in the past 24 hours - and six new reported deaths of people who had tested positive. The number of Omicron cases confirmed in Scotland was 110, taking the total to 296, according to data released by the Scottish government. The S gene dropout - a good indication of Omicron levels - is currently present in 27.5% of cases 541 people are in hospital - 20 fewer than yesterday - but the figure now includes two confirmed Omicron cases. 38 people are in intensive care - down one Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton tellsDrivetimethat he believes the Scottish government wants to go further in tightening hospitality restrictions. He says he doesn't necessarily believe things like theatre productions should be cancelled unless there is ""pound for pound"" compensation. I rather suspect that we might be called back to Parliament in the coming days when the quantum of money from the UK government becomes apparent. I felt that there was a will in the Scottish government to go further in tightening regulations on hospitality. If the Omicron surge is so severe that we should restrict our domestic socialising to just three households, itâs a hard message to sell that itâs ok to go on to see the ballet or the panto. Alex Cole-Hamilton, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader A body representing part of Scotland's hospitality sector welcomes the Â£100m extra support for businesses affected by recent Covid announcements. Stephen Montgomery, of The Scottish Hospitality Group, says December
is a ""critically important trading month"" for hospitality and warns without support that ""many venues will struggle to survive"". He adds, ""We therefore welcome the Scottish government's
commitment to Â£100m of financial support for hospitality. ""Today's funding will provide a little breathing space in the short
term - but it is clear the hospitality sector will require much more support if
we are to save venues from going to the wall."" More reaction to the latest Covid changeson BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeprogramme now. As we have been reporting, the Scottish business community has been giving an - at best -  lukewarm reception to the first minister's announcements. Leon Thompson, the Scotland director for UK Hospitality, tells BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime with John Beattiethat the Â£100m fund for businesses is a ""drop in the ocean"" for those that are already struggling. Last week the BBC told how the Chester Hotel in Aberdeen had900 cancellations within 48 hours. Mr Thompson says there needs to be further
conversations about the guidance and there will be a ""lot of questions"" as to how things work. It is still not clear when the latest social distancing rules for hospitality businesses will begin, however Mr Thompson says further talks are taking place tomorrow. Shortly before Ms Sturgeon started speaking to the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternnon, the UK Treasury said it would make extra funding available to devolved governments to accelerate the vaccine rollout and tackle the virus. However, the first minister later tweeted she believes the money is ""not additional"" to funding already allocated through Barnett consequentials. Allow Twitter content?

Magnus BennettBBC Scotland News The Scottish Chambers of Commerce says there will be some
disappointment among Scotlandâs business community at new measures announced by
the first minister to tackle the Omicron variant. It has welcomed the Â£100m of targeted support being made
available for the hospitality, wholesale and supply chain sectors but says âit
will not go anywhere near far enough to cover the financial losses being
incurredâ. Chief executive Liz Cameron adds: âWhat Scotlandâs
businesses need now is an extension of at least the 50% Covid-19 rates relief,
beyond the three months set out in the Scottish budget and guaranteed for the
next financial year, in full. âWith these additional restrictions now in place, extended
rates relief will be critical to giving thousands of Scottish businesses a shot
at survival.â The push to get people to test more regularly has meant increased demand for lateral flow kits in some areas. The UK government website where people can order the kits to be posted out to them has struggled to keep up with demand at times. And some pharmacies in Scotland do not have any kits in stock. A spokesman for trade body Community Pharmacy Scotland confirmed its members are seeing increased demand. This pharmacy in Edinburgh is among many to have run out of lateral flow test kits The range of new restrictions will make trading much more difficult, according to Scotland's Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). Policy chair Andrew McRae welcomes the news of the Â£100m support fund from the Scottish government, but says independent retailers have already reported fewer customers. The money must reach firms as quickly as possible, especially since the new household mixing rules are bound to cause another surge in cancellations. Governments in Edinburgh and London must co-operate to ensure the amount of cash support available to firms matches the scale of the restrictions. The financial firepower to help firms during this stage of the crisis must be found."" Andrew McRae, Federation of Small Businesses Following the Treasury's confirmation of further funding support, Scottish Secretary
Alister Jack says we need to do ""everything possible"" to get boosters rolled out quickly. He adds that the UK government has provided ""unprecedented support"" in all parts of the UK since the start of the pandemic and that support will continue. Allow Twitter content?

Some more news on the last Covid-related vote of the evening, on compulsory vaccinations for frontline NHS staff in England. Sixty-three Tory MPs rebelled against the government. This is the second biggest Conservative rebellion - after the one on Covid venue passes earlier tonight - since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Reacting to the Conservative rebellion, Scotland's first minister says it makes ""all UK nations less safe"".

Eight Labour MPs, 10 Liberal Democrats, six DUP, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Independent MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Rob Roberts also opposed the regulations. We'll try to find out about the other three, Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent They tried to persuade. They tried to cajole. Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed a packed meeting of backbench
MPs, setting out the risks posed by the new Covid variant. Professor Chris Whitty, Englandâs chief medical
officer, briefed MPs too  - telling them to expect a significant
increase in hospitalisations. But plenty of Conservative rebels - nearly 100 - simply
werenât for turning. That far outstrips the 55 MPs who voted against the Covid
tier system â remember that? â last year. It says a lot about the scepticism towards Covid passports But it also highlights a significant and growing gap between
the government and its backbenchers. And it suggests that, after weeks of negative headlines, the prime ministerâs authority has been seriously eroded - just as the country faces the next Covid crisis. Many Conservatives seem to have heeded the call
from former chief whip Mark Harper to use the vote to force the government
to show more respect for MPs. He is pressing for a recall of Parliament over Christmas, should the prime minister feel itâs necessary to introduce further
restrictions. Whether todayâs show of force from the back benches makes a
recall likely â or something Boris Johnson would want to avoid at all costs â
remains to be seen. The hope of many rebels is that the prime minister will
instead feel he can now go no further than Plan B. Itâs clear the mood on the Conservative benches is restless,
to say the least. All eyes at Westminster will be on Thursdayâs North Shropshire
by-election, as Conservative MPs openly mull over whether their big
electoral asset in 2019 - Johnson â has turned in to a liability. A body representing nightclubs says it is ""disappointed"" MPs have approved plans to make Covid passes mandatory for large venues. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, says his organisation has consistently opposed Covid passes because of the ""logistical challenges they pose"". ""It is very disappointing that, after flip-flopping on the
issue twice, the government have decided to press ahead with the plans despite
no evidence of their impact on transmission of the virus,"" he says. âThis is a slippery path we are
going down. I would urge the government to listen to its backbenchers now â
this far and no further.â If more restrictions are introduced, Kill says there must be a ""proportionate support package including a return of the furlough scheme"". Charles Walker, one of the 98 Tory MPs to rebel against the government on Covid passes, says the prime minister still has ""huge support"" but ""this was just a bridge too far"". âIt was a cry of pain from the Conservative Party,"" he tells the BBC. However, Walker says he does not believe the rebellion calls into question the PM's ability to persuade his own MPs over the things he wants to do. The Tory MP says many colleagues were ""holding their nose"" when voting for mandatory Covid passes and the prime minister and his team ""need to listen"". ""The mood has changed"" and backbench views on further restrictions ""are hardening"", he adds. Some figures are in. Ninety-eight Conservative MPs rebelled against the government over Covid passes in England. That's by far the biggest such act of defiance by his own troops since Boris Johnson became PM. Also, eight Labour MPs rebelled against their own front bench to oppose the plan - Sir Keir Starmer had ordered them to support it.  After several hours of debate, the government's proposals for tackling the Omicron variant in England have been approved by MPs - albeit with a significant rebellion by some Tories. Here's what they voted for: The result of the final vote is in, with the government's plans to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for front-line NHS workers in England passing by 385 votes to 100. So all the measures got through, one without a vote and the others by varying margins. Forty Conservative MPs rebelled  against government plans to make face coverings compulsory in most indoor settings. Thirty-eight Tories voted against the plans, while a further two who were opposed acted as tellers. A further three DUP MPs also voted against. Labour's whips office is suggesting that 101 Conservative MPs rebelled against the government on Covid passes for large venues in England. We'll have the full figures as soon as possible. The previous biggest rebellion against Boris Johnson's government involved 59 Tory MPs. And now for the final Commons vote this evening, on whether front-line NHS staff in England should be compelled to be vaccinated for Covid. Like the other measures, this is expected to pass easily, but the size of any Tory rebellion will be closely watched. It looks like there was a big one in the previous vote, on Covid passes for entry to large venues. The House of Commons backs the government's plan to introduce Covid passes - or passports - for entry to large venues in England, such as nightclubs, by 369 votes to 126. The Labour leadership supported the move, but the Liberal Democrats and many on Boris Johnson's own Conservative benches opposed it. MPs have unanimously voted to approve changing the rules so that vaccinated people who come into contact with suspected Omicron cases will no longer have to self-isolate. Anyone coming into contact with Covid cases of any kind will be""strongly advised"" to take lateral flow tests,externalfor seven days. Right, MPs are filing out for the second of tonight's votes. This time it's the one where the biggest Tory rebellion is expected - on whether to introduce a Covid pass - called a ""passport"" by many - to allow access to nightclubs and other sizeable venues. Another motion, on isolation, got through ""on the nod"" - that is, without opposition in the Commons chamber. Regulations making wearing face masks compulsory in most indoor settings, except for pubs and restaurants, have been approved by MPs. The government wins by 441 votes to 41. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Rival bus groups Stagecoach and National Express have agreed to merge. The deal, which involves an all-share takeover by National Express, comes after talks between the transport giantswere revealed in September. It will create a combined firm worth about Â£1.9bn, with a fleet of about 40,000 vehicles and a workforce of about 70,000. Under the deal, National Express shareholders would own about 75% of the combined group and Stagecoach 25%. The proposal, which will be voted on by shareholders, values Perth-based Stagecoach at about Â£437m. National Express in talks to buy transport rival Stagecoach Stagecoach innovates as bus passenger numbers fall About 50 jobs are expected to be cut from the head offices, IT and corporate departments of the two firms, under plans to slash annual costs by at least Â£45m following the merger. But the companies stressed there would be no job losses among drivers, or depot closures, as a result of the deal. It's 41 years since a nurse, Ann Gloag, and her brother Brian Souter, a former bus driver, began Stagecoach, and tapped into the newly privatised, deregulated bus market. Stagecoach grew to be one of the dominant transport companies in Britain, partnering with Virgin on railways, and with overseas operations from the USA to Malawi. But it's scaled back to city buses, and the founders - now titled, Dame Ann and Sir Brian - have been reducing their stakes to just over a quarter between them. That's worth more than Â£100m. Merger with the long-haul, Birmingham-based coach operator National Express means the loss of one of Scotland's big corporate headquarters, and overlap of management roles means at least some jobs are likely to go at its Perth head office. In the race to become chief executive of the combined group, Martin Griffiths has lost out to his opposite number, Ignacio Garat. The country's other one-time transport giant, FirstBus, is now also on a much smaller scale at its Aberdeen headquarters, having also sold its US school bus and transit operations. The business case for a merger has to do with deeper pockets for investment in new fleet, as buses shift to battery and possibly hydrogen, and as the market for rail is being reformed. This is being presented as a good time to invest in public transport, when governments are devising policy to reduce carbon emissions from private transport. National Express wants to tie its commuter and shuttle bus operations into Stagecoach's city and town services, and to use the Scottish firms network of depots. It also sees a Â£1.5bn pipeline of potential future investment, including overseas. While Stagecoach has retreated, National Express is still in the USA and has a stake in German rail. The deal also signals the wind-down of an empire built by one of Scotland's most successful entrepreneurs. Sir Brian Souter, now aged 67, was also one of the investors in Alexander Dennis bus-builders in Falkirk, and instead of seeking to expand internationally, that was sold to a Canadian transport group. Under the deal, Stagecoach will sell off its Megabus UK and Falcon South-West coach service operations, as well as its 35% stake in Scottish Citylink bus services. Stagecoach chairman Ray O'Toole will become chairman of the merged group, while National Express chief executive Ignacio Garat will keep the same role at the merged firm. The merger comes as both firms have been hit hard by the pandemic, with passenger numbers slumping due to lockdowns, remote working and a switch away from public transport. Government support to help transport firms through the crisis is also due to end soon. It followsa previous attempt at a merger in 2009,external, when National Express rejected a Â£1.7bn merger deal put forward by Stagecoach. Stagecoach chief executive Martin Griffiths said: ""This is an exciting opportunity to bring together two of the UK's iconic transport brands to create a strong, diverse business that is well-placed to grow the market for greener and smarter public transport for the benefit of all stakeholders."" National Express has bus and coach networks across the UK and Spain, while it also runs school bus services in America and a rail franchise in Germany. Stagecoach is UK-focused and is Britain's biggest bus and coach operator. The companies said they expected the deal to be completed around the end of next year.

"Family members said Afrasia Mohammed, 27, was seeking a better life in the UK French authorities have formally identified 26 of the 27 bodies recovered after last month's mass drowning in the English Channel. Sixteen Kurdish people from Iraq and four Afghans were among the victims, whose families are being informed. They included two friends from the same town who died in the worst-recorded migrant tragedy in the Channel. Their inflatable boat sank while attempting to cross to the UK from France on 24 November. The BBC spoke to the families of Rezhwan Hassan, 18, and 27-year-old Afrasia Mohammed, who were both from the town of Rania, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Their families had not heard from the two men since the disaster, leaving them anxiously awaiting news. The two friends each paid people smugglers thousands of dollars to help them reach the UK. At the end of October they flew into Belarus - an increasingly popular smuggling route - and crossed the border into the European Union before reaching France. Rezhwan Hassan was a carpenter who dreamed of a better life in the UK. His nephew, Dahin Hama, says he tried to talk him out of going. ""We were like brothers; our friendship was strong,"" Dahin Hama said. ""He said he would emigrate from Kurdistan. He said that he cannot bear to live here, and there is no life left to live."" The last time he heard from Rezhwan was on the night of the boat crossing. Rezhwan told his family that he'd contact them from the UK. They pleaded with him to come back, but he said he would make it to the UK ""even if it cost him death"", Dahin Hama said. Hours later, he would lose his life, along with at least 26 others. Rezhwan Hassan's family last heard from him on the night of the crossing Also in the boat was his friend, Afrasia Mohamed. His sister, Nergiz Ahmed Mohammed, says Afrasia believed that the UK promised him a brighter future. ""He went for a better life, and he said there are human rights there,"" she said. ""These don't exist in Kurdistan. All his hopes were to get to the UK, that's why he left."" But he too would never make it. On Tuesday, Kurdish authorities told his family that his body was one of the 27 found. But even before this, his family had been grieving for weeks. ""What is more important? The life of a human being or borders? Where are the human rights? How can they let those people drown and then say it's not our issue?"" Nergiz Ahmed Mohammed said. This video can not be played Channel disaster: A father's anguish, a missing family Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin, a 24-year-old Kurdish woman from northern Iraq,was the first person to be confirmed as a victim in late November. Other names have been reported by Kurdish media but they are yet to be independently verified. On Tuesday, France's justice ministry said the bodies of 26 of at least 27 victims had been identified and repatriation requests were under way. The ministry said it could confirm the identity of 16 Kurdish people from Iraq, including four women aged 22 to 46, a 16-year-old teenager, a seven-year-old child and ten men aged 19 to 37, as well as that of a 23-year-old Kurdish man from Iran. Three Ethiopians were also identified, including two women aged 22 and 25 and a man aged 46. A Somali woman aged 33, four Afghan men aged between 24 and 40 and an Egyptian man aged 20 were also identified. None of the women victims were pregnant, French authorities said. Calais's mayor said at the time of the tragedy that a pregnant woman was among those who died,in comments reported by the BBC. Record numbers of migrants have been making the dangerous journey from France to the UK across the Channel in small boats this year. The crossings have strained an already fraught relationship between France and the UK, which traded recriminations after the tragedy on 24 November. But despite the risks, people are still heading to Western countries in large numbers, including many from northern Iraq. An estimated 40,000 people have left the region for Europe in the past year alone, using illegal smuggling routes. More families are bracing themselves for bad news in the coming days as French authorities contact the loved ones of the drowned victims.

Here's what happened: The House of Commons official photographer has been in the chamber capturing some of the key moments of the debate today. Here are some of the best shots, as MPs consider the government's proposals to introduce its Plan B Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Sajid Javid faced many interventions from his fellow Tory MPs over the votes, with many expressing their intention to vote against the government Javid set out the reasons the government intended to move to Plan B as debate opened The health secretary's tough reception was not just from his own side of the House, the opposition benches also had some words for him Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting outlined the Labour Party's support for the government, which is expected to allow the votes to proceed despite a significant Tory rebellion Louie French was elected less than two weeks ago The Conservative Party's newest MP was among those to vote against the introduction of mandatory Covid passes. Louie French, who won the Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election less than two weeks ago, said he did so to fulfil an election pledge. He wrote on Twitter: ""I fully support the booster rollout and I will get mine ASAP thanks to the efforts of the government, NHS, pharmacies, Army and volunteers. ""But, I made a clear pre-election pledge that I would not support Covid passes for our domestic economy and voted accordingly."" Some more news on the last Covid-related vote of the evening, on compulsory vaccinations for frontline NHS staff in England. Sixty-three Tory MPs rebelled against the government. This is the second biggest Conservative rebellion - after the one on Covid venue passes earlier tonight - since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Reacting to the Conservative rebellion, Scotland's first minister says it makes ""all UK nations less safe"". Nicola Sturgeon writes on Twitter,external: ""Under current funding arrangements, without responsible public health protections in England, there's no financial provision for such protections in Scotland, Wales or NI. ""It's a big problem in [the] face of this Covid challenge."" Nations have the power to set their own Covid regulations but overall funding for public services is allocated from central government under the Barnett formula. The formula means funding is adjusted based on comparable spending per person in England. Earlier today,people in Scotland were asked to limit socialising to three households at a timein the run-up to Christmas. It seems the numbers who voted in the Commons division on Covid passes might not be complete yet. The official division list - recording who voted for and against - shows only 123 of the MPs who opposed the government. The result in the Commons said 126 went this way. Anyway, as it stands, 96 Tory MPs defied the government, while two acted as tellers - vote counters - meaning they felt the same way but weren't counted themselves. Eight Labour MPs, 10 Liberal Democrats, six DUP, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Independent MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Rob Roberts also opposed the regulations.

officer, briefed MPs too  - telling them to expect a significant
increase in hospitalisations. But plenty of Conservative rebels - nearly 100 - simply
werenât for turning. That far outstrips the 55 MPs who voted against the Covid

the government and its backbenchers. And it suggests that, after weeks of negative headlines, the prime ministerâs authority has been seriously eroded - just as the country faces the next Covid crisis. Many Conservatives seem to have heeded the call
from former chief whip Mark Harper to use the vote to force the government
to show more respect for MPs. He is pressing for a recall of Parliament over Christmas, should the prime minister feel itâs necessary to introduce further
restrictions. Whether todayâs show of force from the back benches makes a
recall likely â or something Boris Johnson would want to avoid at all costs â
remains to be seen. The hope of many rebels is that the prime minister will
instead feel he can now go no further than Plan B. Itâs clear the mood on the Conservative benches is restless,
to say the least. All eyes at Westminster will be on Thursdayâs North Shropshire
by-election, as Conservative MPs openly mull over whether their big
electoral asset in 2019 - Johnson â has turned in to a liability. A body representing nightclubs says it is ""disappointed"" MPs have approved plans to make Covid passes mandatory for large venues. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, says his organisation has consistently opposed Covid passes because of the ""logistical challenges they pose"". ""It is very disappointing that, after flip-flopping on the
issue twice, the government have decided to press ahead with the plans despite
no evidence of their impact on transmission of the virus,"" he says. âThis is a slippery path we are
going down. I would urge the government to listen to its backbenchers now â
this far and no further.â If more restrictions are introduced, Kill says there must be a ""proportionate support package including a return of the furlough scheme"". Charles Walker, one of the 98 Tory MPs to rebel against the government on Covid passes, says the prime minister still has ""huge support"" but ""this was just a bridge too far"". âIt was a cry of pain from the Conservative Party,"" he tells the BBC. However, Walker says he does not believe the rebellion calls into question the PM's ability to persuade his own MPs over the things he wants to do. The Tory MP says many colleagues were ""holding their nose"" when voting for mandatory Covid passes and the prime minister and his team ""need to listen"". ""The mood has changed"" and backbench views on further restrictions ""are hardening"", he adds. Some figures are in. Ninety-eight Conservative MPs rebelled against the government over Covid passes in England. That's by far the biggest such act of defiance by his own troops since Boris Johnson became PM. Also, eight Labour MPs rebelled against their own front bench to oppose the plan - Sir Keir Starmer had ordered them to support it.  After several hours of debate, the government's proposals for tackling the Omicron variant in England have been approved by MPs - albeit with a significant rebellion by some Tories. Here's what they voted for: The result of the final vote is in, with the government's plans to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for front-line NHS workers in England passing by 385 votes to 100. So all the measures got through, one without a vote and the others by varying margins. Forty Conservative MPs rebelled  against government plans to make face coverings compulsory in most indoor settings. Thirty-eight Tories voted against the plans, while a further two who were opposed acted as tellers. A further three DUP MPs also voted against. Labour's whips office is suggesting that 101 Conservative MPs rebelled against the government on Covid passes for large venues in England. We'll have the full figures as soon as possible. The previous biggest rebellion against Boris Johnson's government involved 59 Tory MPs. And now for the final Commons vote this evening, on whether front-line NHS staff in England should be compelled to be vaccinated for Covid. Like the other measures, this is expected to pass easily, but the size of any Tory rebellion will be closely watched. It looks like there was a big one in the previous vote, on Covid passes for entry to large venues. The House of Commons backs the government's plan to introduce Covid passes - or passports - for entry to large venues in England, such as nightclubs, by 369 votes to 126. The Labour leadership supported the move, but the Liberal Democrats and many on Boris Johnson's own Conservative benches opposed it. MPs have unanimously voted to approve changing the rules so that vaccinated people who come into contact with suspected Omicron cases will no longer have to self-isolate. Anyone coming into contact with Covid cases of any kind will be""strongly advised"" to take lateral flow tests,externalfor seven days. Right, MPs are filing out for the second of tonight's votes. This time it's the one where the biggest Tory rebellion is expected - on whether to introduce a Covid pass - called a ""passport"" by many - to allow access to nightclubs and other sizeable venues. Another motion, on isolation, got through ""on the nod"" - that is, without opposition in the Commons chamber. Regulations making wearing face masks compulsory in most indoor settings, except for pubs and restaurants, have been approved by MPs. The government wins by 441 votes to 41. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The men bought five scratch cards, one of which had a Â£10 prize while another had the Â£4m jackpot (stock image) Two men who bought a National Lottery scratch card using stolen debit card details and then tried to claim the Â£4m jackpot they revealed have been jailed. Jon Watson, of Bolton, and Mark Goodram went to London to beg in 2019 and bought the winning card in Clapham. They were found out when claiming the prize, as they revealed they did not have a bank account, despite using a debit card to buy the item. Admitting fraud at Bolton Crown Court, they were both jailed for 18 months. The court heard the men, aged 34 and 38, travelled from Bolton to London on 22 April 2019. Denise Fitzpatrick, prosecuting, said the pair, who were both on licence following previous prison sentences, had the details of a debit card belonging to a man they did not know. She said Goodram had the card number and expiry date written on his hand and used them to buy Â£90 of shopping at a Londis store on Clapham High Street and Â£71 of goods, including five scratch cards, at a Waitrose store on Clapham Common. The court was told one card had a Â£10 prize, which was claimed in the Londis store, while another had the jackpot prize. The men bought the jackpot-holding scratch card at the Waitrose store on Clapham Common Watson telephoned the National Lottery line to tell them his friend had won, Ms Fitzpatrick said, before Goodram then told the operator he would be sharing the prize with his friend. He was informed the payment would be made by bank transfer. ""Mark Goodram explained he did not have a bank account, [but] the purchase of the winning scratch card had been made by debit card from a bank account... which immediately raised suspicions,"" she said. The court was also told Goodram, of no fixed address, and Watson, of Nuttall Avenue, Little Lever, spoke to the media when the prize was not paid out. Sentencing them, Recorder Sarah Johnston said the pair, who had numerous previous convictions, had deprived the next customer to win a ""life-changing sum of money"" before having the ""audacity to plead your sense of injustice in the national newspapers"". ""You must have thought all of your Christmases had come at once,"" she said. ""Despite knowing you had fraudulently acquired that prize money, you tried to claim it. ""I have no doubt that both of you will continue to offend in dishonest ways in the future."" Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

by-election, as Conservative MPs openly mull over whether their big
electoral asset in 2019 - Johnson â has turned in to a liability. A body representing nightclubs says it is ""disappointed"" MPs have approved plans to make Covid passes mandatory for large venues. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, says his organisation has consistently opposed Covid passes because of the ""logistical challenges they pose"". ""It is very disappointing that, after flip-flopping on the
issue twice, the government have decided to press ahead with the plans despite
no evidence of their impact on transmission of the virus,"" he says. âThis is a slippery path we are
going down. I would urge the government to listen to its backbenchers now â
this far and no further.â If more restrictions are introduced, Kill says there must be a ""proportionate support package including a return of the furlough scheme"". Charles Walker, one of the 98 Tory MPs to rebel against the government on Covid passes, says the prime minister still has ""huge support"" but ""this was just a bridge too far"". âIt was a cry of pain from the Conservative Party,"" he tells the BBC. However, Walker says he does not believe the rebellion calls into question the PM's ability to persuade his own MPs over the things he wants to do. The Tory MP says many colleagues were ""holding their nose"" when voting for mandatory Covid passes and the prime minister and his team ""need to listen"". ""The mood has changed"" and backbench views on further restrictions ""are hardening"", he adds. Some figures are in. Ninety-eight Conservative MPs rebelled against the government over Covid passes in England. That's by far the biggest such act of defiance by his own troops since Boris Johnson became PM. Also, eight Labour MPs rebelled against their own front bench to oppose the plan - Sir Keir Starmer had ordered them to support it.  After several hours of debate, the government's proposals for tackling the Omicron variant in England have been approved by MPs - albeit with a significant rebellion by some Tories. Here's what they voted for: The result of the final vote is in, with the government's plans to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for front-line NHS workers in England passing by 385 votes to 100. So all the measures got through, one without a vote and the others by varying margins. Forty Conservative MPs rebelled  against government plans to make face coverings compulsory in most indoor settings. Thirty-eight Tories voted against the plans, while a further two who were opposed acted as tellers. A further three DUP MPs also voted against. Labour's whips office is suggesting that 101 Conservative MPs rebelled against the government on Covid passes for large venues in England. We'll have the full figures as soon as possible. The previous biggest rebellion against Boris Johnson's government involved 59 Tory MPs. And now for the final Commons vote this evening, on whether front-line NHS staff in England should be compelled to be vaccinated for Covid. Like the other measures, this is expected to pass easily, but the size of any Tory rebellion will be closely watched. It looks like there was a big one in the previous vote, on Covid passes for entry to large venues. The House of Commons backs the government's plan to introduce Covid passes - or passports - for entry to large venues in England, such as nightclubs, by 369 votes to 126. The Labour leadership supported the move, but the Liberal Democrats and many on Boris Johnson's own Conservative benches opposed it. MPs have unanimously voted to approve changing the rules so that vaccinated people who come into contact with suspected Omicron cases will no longer have to self-isolate. Anyone coming into contact with Covid cases of any kind will be""strongly advised"" to take lateral flow tests,externalfor seven days. Right, MPs are filing out for the second of tonight's votes. This time it's the one where the biggest Tory rebellion is expected - on whether to introduce a Covid pass - called a ""passport"" by many - to allow access to nightclubs and other sizeable venues. Another motion, on isolation, got through ""on the nod"" - that is, without opposition in the Commons chamber. Regulations making wearing face masks compulsory in most indoor settings, except for pubs and restaurants, have been approved by MPs. The government wins by 441 votes to 41. Â© 2025 BBC.

Our writers have been Joseph Lee, Alexandra Fouche, Alex Kleiderman and Adam Durbin. The page has been edited by Alex Therrien, Holly Wallis, Emma Harrison and Tiffany Wertheimer. It's been a very busy day with plenty of developments. Here's a round up of the key headlines: And if you're keen to follow the debate and votes over Covid measures in the Commons, our friends and colleagues at BBC Politicshave you covered here.  The hospitality industry is feeling the impact of the new Covid curbs, with pubs and restaurants reporting a wave of Christmas cancellations. The Bar 44 chain tells the BBC 3,200 people have scrapped bookings in December alone across its four outlets in Bristol and Cardiff. Natalie Isaac, the business' operations director, says only a ""handful"" of people would have cancelled before the pandemic. She adds 1,000 of those bookings were lost because of the knock-on effects of cancelled concerts by Tom Jones and the Stereophonics. Others say that although they face no new rules, public caution is causing lower footfall and a loss of trade. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called for the government to provide financial support for businesses affected, but the Treasury has not unveiled any new measures. Read more here. Having to stay open but not getting the business is our big worry. This should be our bumper two weeks before Christmas, but the diary is worryingly empty. We're significantly impacted and without furlough, we won't be able to protect our staff. Natalie Isaac, Operations Director, Bar 44 Boris Johnson visiting a Covid vaccine centre in London yesterday Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed his thanks to people who have queued for booster jabs, No 10 has said. Johnson's official spokesman said the PM was grateful to those who ""queued for hours to get their jabs yesterday"", following theexpansion of the booster rollout to all adults in England. The spokesman adds the government wants to ""go further and faster"" with the rollout. He says: ""You'll have seen that the 15-minute wait has been temporarily paused by the UK chief medical officers. That will allow for significantly more people to go through those vaccination sites. ""It's something that will be very beneficial on the ground and I'll stress that that's been done on clinical advice and safety continues to be our top priority."" There have been long queues at many vaccination centres in England The UK government has reported that 513,722 booster shots were given on Monday, which means that 42% of the population has now been given a third dose - that's more than 24 million people. And as we've been reporting, the booster campaign is in full swing, having been brought forward in response to the Omicron variant. There have been some teething problems, with the NHS website crashing under the strain of so many people trying to book their appointment. In England and Scotland, it's hoped every adult will be able to book a Covid booster before the end of 2021. InEnglanda booster is now available to every adult aged 18 or over - as long as it's at least three months since their second dose. Over-30s can start booking their booster from two months after their second dose (but the appointment dates offered will only be after three months has passed) and from Wednesday, this will be extended to over-18s. There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination centres, but the government has urged people to be ""patient and keep trying, or book online"". Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. A doctor from Cambridge has spoken of the sadness his lab team felt at taking a decision to cancel their Christmas party, despite it being the ""right thing to do"". Prof Stefan Marciniak, a respiratory specialist, tells the BBC it was a ""unanimous decision"" from the whole team to protect the health of their family, friends and the wider community from the spread of the Omicron variant. He says: âSome of us are clinicians and we don't want to contribute to the coming wave that will hit us. ""We also
have responsibilities. If I can't do my ward rounds on Christmas Eve then
someone else has to do that."" Omicron is transmitting extremely quickly and coming into a population with relatively little protection from two doses of vaccine, although boosters appear to have a very good effect in early studies. Prof Stefan Marciniak, Doctor and Professor of Respiratory Science, University of Cambridge Indonesia has become one of the few countries in Asia to start vaccinating children against Covid-19. Those aged six to 11 will now receive China's Sinovac vaccine. Covid vaccinations for children have been a sensitive and sometimes controversial subject around the world. InEurope, the medicines regulator approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's lower-dose vaccine on children aged five to 11 last month, however different countries are approaching it in different ways. For example, one region in Italy is using clowns and jugglers at clinics andFranceandGermanyare targeting only the most vulnerable children.Denmark, on the other hand, has been giving the shots even before the specially-designed vials and syringes have arrived, according to Reuters news agency. In theUK,the government has been advised to offer 12 to 15-year-olds a second jab. Read more: The UK's four chief medical officers have just advised that the waiting period where people are monitored after getting their Pfizer or Moderna Covid jab in case of an allergic reaction should be temporarily suspended. They said scrapping the 15-minute observation period would speed the process up at vaccination centres and allow more people to get boosters. They also said the rates of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) after Covid vaccination are low - around one per 100,000 vaccine doses. Speaking in the Commons just now, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change would help the NHS ""get more jabs in arms more quickly to give people vital protection this winter"". Those who have a history of allergies, particularly to other vaccines, or have had an immediate reaction after previous doses may still be advised to stay for the 15 minutes. The French government is keeping a close eye on the Omicron situation in Britain, and may tighten entry restrictions to those travelling from the UK if the situation worsens, says a French government spokesman. ""We are always looking at means to tighten the framework, we are currently working on that and we should, I think, come to a conclusion in the coming days,"" Gabriel Attal told France Info radio on Tuesday. France is currently in the midst of a fifth coronavirus wave, mostly driven by the Delta variant. There are 133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in France, Mr Attal said. The UK government has updated its daily Covid numbers: Ministers have announced that all countries will be removed from the travel red list in England because the Omicron variant is spreading throughout the UK - but travel testing will remain in place. Now the travel trade body Abta is calling for all restrictions to be lifted. Chief executive Mark Tanzer says: ""The government has always been clear that once the Omicron variant is widespread across the UK there would be little rationale for retaining any restrictions on international travel."" Travel businesses are facing a ""serious situation"" with temporary testing requirements extending over Christmas and the New Year, and into the peak booking period for summer 2022, he says. He adds: ""Consumer confidence in travel has suffered a significant setback, which will outlast these restrictions. The government must acknowledge this by bringing forward grant support to help businesses through the difficult weeks ahead."" As the debate on Plan B measures continues, MPs have been indicating their concerns throughout in interventions. Tory
Alec Shelbrookeasked if variants keep coming, ""how do we avoid debating the same thing in three months or five
months' time?"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid responded that the key is the vaccine, and said the government has struck deals for 114 million more doses that could be adjusted for future variants. In light of the new data on Omicron, Covid passes will require booster jabs
and not just the initial two doses ""as soon as all adults have a reasonable
chance"" of having an extra jab, Javid says. One Tory MP said he is worried about a ""two-tier
system"" and wants the health secretary to assure him negative tests will always be an alternative as part of Covid passes. Javid said: ""This is not a vaccine passport, it is really important that people have a range of options."" ButLib Dem Alistair Carmichaelsaid ""a vaccine
passport with a lateral flow option is still a vaccine passport"" and questioned what effect they had had in other parts of the UK, where they have been in place for weeks. Back in the Commons, Labour's Wes Streeting has outlined his party's support for the government's Plan B measures. The shadow health secretary says mask wearing has been ""proven to be effective"" and adds the government should never have lifted the rules in the first place. On Covid passes, Streeting says Labour supports the requirement to have the option to show a negative lateral flow test and argues they are ""not vaccine passports"" as a result. Although the party doesn't support mandatory vaccination in general, he says it will back the measure for health and care workers. But he says the government must do more to persuade them to get jabs voluntarily. Some more details from Nicola Sturgeon's update for Scotland now. Visits to care home residents should not now involve any more than two households at a time, she announces. The new guidance also asks people to do a lateral flow Covid test before visiting. For hospitals, the Scottish government is recommending that no more than two people visit a patient at any one time. Meanwhile, on schools, Sturgeon tells MSPs that entire classes are not recommended to isolate when one pupil tests positive. She says a ""key aim"" is for schools to stay open to minimise disruption to learning. You can read more about the changes coming into effect in Scotland here. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting is speaking in the Commons, and opens by saying sincere beliefs are held on all sides, but he hopes the debate on Plan B measures can be worthy of Parliament. He criticises the comparison by one Tory MP of Covid passes to Nazi Germany's policies, saying: ""We are not living in the 1930s and the secretary of state
and his team are not Nazis."" Streeting says the health secretary has a responsibility to protect our NHS and calls the measures ""a necessary response to the Omicron threat"". But he says that confronting the challenges of this winter has been made much harder because we went into the pandemic with record waiting lists, 100,000 unfilled vacancies in the NHS and shortages of care staff. As we've just heard, a number of countries have now been removed from the travel red list, including South Africa. This has come too late for some people who have been forced to quarantine, including Alison Stitt. She was in South Africa visiting her father for his 90th birthday when the country went on the UK's red list. She says it took her days to re-arrange a flight home on a date that a quarantine hotel room was available. They had to stay longer in their Airbnb and re-book their car hire while they waited - on top of extending their car parking and kennels bookings in the UK. Now, she and her husband David are at a hotel near Gatwick. Alison says the total cost of their extended stay in South Africa and their quarantine, has been at least Â£5,500. Speaking to the BBC before all countries were taken off the red list, she said the idea of the travel rules being changed ""has fuelled our argument that this whole fiasco was wrong"". Read more here. ""It was one expense after another. It's all going on credit cards. It was meant to be a budget trip Alison Stitt Sajid Javid has told MPs he is seeking ""urgent advice"" about people currently in quarantine hotels being permitted to leave early. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw asks the health secretary if the government will now release people in isolation in quarantine hotels, given that all 11 African countries are to be removed from the red list. Javid says: ""I am told that the practice in the past has been requiring them to complete their quarantine period. However, I do understand the importance of that. ""I have asked for urgent advice about what this means and I hope to act very quickly on just that."" The health secretary has set out in Parliament the rationale for ending the travel red list, saying that as the new variant is spreading in the UK, travel restrictions are ""now less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad"". The decision means England will no longer require hotel quarantine for travellers from Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Travel rules are set by the four nations of the UK independently, but the other nations' governments often follow proposals from Westminster. Back to Nicola Sturgeon's update, and the first minister says firms in Scotland are being encouraged to bring back physical distancing and screens in shops and hospitality venues. Sturgeon says Scotland is facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. Businesses will have a legal requirement to take practicable measures to minimise the risk of transmission of Covid. In retail, it will involve a return to the kind of protections in place at the start of the pandemic - including physical distancing and measures to control the flow of customers and protective screens. For hospitality, it will mean, measures to avoid crowding at bars and between tables, and a reminder of the requirement to collect contact details of customers to help with contact tracing. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also confirmed that all 11 African countries on the UK's travel red list will be removed from tomorrow. And the minister announced on Twitter that all testing measures for arrivals will remain in place. The rules for England require all travellers to have a pre-arrival negative PCR or lateral flow test taken within the 48 hours before arriving. Arrivals must also self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test. Shapps adds: ""As always, we keep all our travel measures under review and we may impose new restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health."" Allow Twitter content?

electoral asset in 2019 - Johnson â has turned in to a liability. A body representing nightclubs says it is ""disappointed"" MPs have approved plans to make Covid passes mandatory for large venues. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, says his organisation has consistently opposed Covid passes because of the ""logistical challenges they pose"". ""It is very disappointing that, after flip-flopping on the
issue twice, the government have decided to press ahead with the plans despite
no evidence of their impact on transmission of the virus,"" he says. âThis is a slippery path we are
going down. I would urge the government to listen to its backbenchers now â
this far and no further.â If more restrictions are introduced, Kill says there must be a ""proportionate support package including a return of the furlough scheme"". Charles Walker, one of the 98 Tory MPs to rebel against the government on Covid passes, says the prime minister still has ""huge support"" but ""this was just a bridge too far"". âIt was a cry of pain from the Conservative Party,"" he tells the BBC. However, Walker says he does not believe the rebellion calls into question the PM's ability to persuade his own MPs over the things he wants to do. The Tory MP says many colleagues were ""holding their nose"" when voting for mandatory Covid passes and the prime minister and his team ""need to listen"". ""The mood has changed"" and backbench views on further restrictions ""are hardening"", he adds. Some figures are in. Ninety-eight Conservative MPs rebelled against the government over Covid passes in England. That's by far the biggest such act of defiance by his own troops since Boris Johnson became PM. Also, eight Labour MPs rebelled against their own front bench to oppose the plan - Sir Keir Starmer had ordered them to support it.  After several hours of debate, the government's proposals for tackling the Omicron variant in England have been approved by MPs - albeit with a significant rebellion by some Tories. Here's what they voted for: The result of the final vote is in, with the government's plans to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for front-line NHS workers in England passing by 385 votes to 100. So all the measures got through, one without a vote and the others by varying margins. Forty Conservative MPs rebelled  against government plans to make face coverings compulsory in most indoor settings. Thirty-eight Tories voted against the plans, while a further two who were opposed acted as tellers. A further three DUP MPs also voted against. Labour's whips office is suggesting that 101 Conservative MPs rebelled against the government on Covid passes for large venues in England. We'll have the full figures as soon as possible. The previous biggest rebellion against Boris Johnson's government involved 59 Tory MPs. And now for the final Commons vote this evening, on whether front-line NHS staff in England should be compelled to be vaccinated for Covid. Like the other measures, this is expected to pass easily, but the size of any Tory rebellion will be closely watched. It looks like there was a big one in the previous vote, on Covid passes for entry to large venues. The House of Commons backs the government's plan to introduce Covid passes - or passports - for entry to large venues in England, such as nightclubs, by 369 votes to 126. The Labour leadership supported the move, but the Liberal Democrats and many on Boris Johnson's own Conservative benches opposed it. MPs have unanimously voted to approve changing the rules so that vaccinated people who come into contact with suspected Omicron cases will no longer have to self-isolate. Anyone coming into contact with Covid cases of any kind will be""strongly advised"" to take lateral flow tests,externalfor seven days. Right, MPs are filing out for the second of tonight's votes. This time it's the one where the biggest Tory rebellion is expected - on whether to introduce a Covid pass - called a ""passport"" by many - to allow access to nightclubs and other sizeable venues. Another motion, on isolation, got through ""on the nod"" - that is, without opposition in the Commons chamber. Regulations making wearing face masks compulsory in most indoor settings, except for pubs and restaurants, have been approved by MPs. The government wins by 441 votes to 41. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The number of people in part-time work jumped in the three months to October, after falling sharply in the pandemic, official figures show. There was also a fall in unemployment among 16-24 year-olds, another group hit hard by the crisis. It comes unemployment continues to fall after a spike last year, with job vacancies now at a fresh record high. But the figures predate the arrival of the Omicron variant which some fear may lead to restrictions in some sectors. The overall unemployment rate fell to 4.2% between August and September,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. ""With still no sign of the end of the furlough scheme hitting the number of jobs, the total of employees on payroll continued to grow strongly in November,"" said head of economic statistics Darren Morgan. ""Separately, survey findings show much of the recent growth in employment has been among part-timers, who were particularly hard hit at the start of the pandemic."" As businesses struggled with successive lockdowns, the number of people working part-time fell sharply to 7.7 million in the March to May period this year. However, as employers expanded again, this number has risen to 8.07 million in the three months to October, driving the latest quarterly increase in employment. Younger, less experienced workers have also struggled to find work during the crisis. But the ONS said the unemployment rate among 16-24 year-olds had now recovered to pre-pandemic levels at 11.3% - down from a high of 14.8% in the July to September period of last year. Job vacancies have continued to rise over the past six months as the economy reopens and employers race to hire staff. Between September and November, they hit a fresh record of 1.22 million  - some 434,500 higher than before the pandemic. However, the ONS said the rate of growth was slowing. Rob Clarry, an economist at PwC UK, said there were ""tentative signs"" that demand for labour could be reaching its peak. The end of the job support scheme in October has not led to a significant rise in unemployment, the ONS said, looking at the quarter as whole. UK employers added 257,000 staff to their payrolls in November - taking the total number above pre-pandemic levels. But on a monthly basis, there was a slight increase in the unemployment rate between October and November - from 4% to 4.3%. And the ONS cautioned that some workers who have recently been made redundant may still be working out their notice. Mr Clarry said it remained too early to judge the impact of Omicron on the labour market. But he added: ""We expect it to hit consumer demand for contact-intensive sectors, such as food and hospitality, over the near term. This could reduce demand for labour in these sectors over the coming months."" However, the chairman of Reed Employment, James Reed, said: ""There's been plenty of talk from doomsayers that the Omicron variant will plunge us back into economic despair, but the outlook appears much more optimistic now compared with the first Covid wave we faced in March 2020. ""It's currently the best time in 50 years to look for a new job."" Commenting on the latest jobs figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The jobs outlook remains strong thanks to our Â£400bn economic support package, Plan for Jobs and fantastic vaccine programme. ""To keep safeguarding our economic recovery and the lives and livelihoods of the British people, I am now calling on everyone to keep playing their part and get boosted now."" In broad terms the jobs numbers continued to reflect an encouraging recovery from the traumatic impact of the lockdowns, with payroll levels higher and redundancy levels lower than before the pandemic. However, there was a modest impact from the end of the furlough scheme. On the monthly measure, unemployment in October, the first full month after the end of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, was up to 4.3% from 4.0% the month before. That represents an increase of 77,500. The full impact of the removal of furlough will take a few more months to filter into redundancy figures, given notice periods. The weekly measures suggest October's rise was the result of an initial spike in the first week of the month which settled down later. Vacancies continue to set new records, but this is holding back the underlying economic recovery. There is a post-Brexit factor here, but also a number of older workers who have retired during the pandemic and a lack of students doing part-time work. The impact of this ongoing jobs squeeze on annual wage settlements is the next unknown to watch for, after Omicron. The latest jobs figures come in the week that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decides on whether to raise its key interest rate from the current historic low of 0.1%. It is under pressure to address fast-rising inflation, but wants to be sure that the expiry of the furlough scheme at the end of September did not cause a jump in unemployment before any decision to raise rates for the first time since the pandemic. But the fast spread of Omicron has raised fears of a new economic slowdown and prompted investors to bet against a rate rise as soon as Thursday. ""The combination of a tight labour market and low unemployment evident in today's data could on their own be sufficient to merit a rate rise,"" said KPMG's UK chief economist Yael Selfin. ""Nonetheless, with the emergence of the Omicron variant over the recent weeks, we now expect the MPC to unanimously hold off raising rates until next year.""

"New guidelines on social contact are expected to be outlined by Scotland's first minister on Tuesday afternoon. BBC Scotland political editor Glenn Campbell said this could include advice on how many other people or households you should meet in one day. The limits are expected to be advice rather than law - and there could be exceptions around Christmas. There is not expected to be any extension to the vaccine passport scheme at this stage. That is because the passports only show that a person has had two vaccine doses, which offers limited protection against Omicron. But there may be a request to shops and places of worship to improve social distancing and other safety measures. And advice that has already been issued around taking regular tests, working from home where possible and putting off work Christmas parties may be extended. Follow Nicola Sturgeon's statement to Holyrood from 14:05 Jabs need a major scaling up - but can it be done? Why do boosters work if two doses struggle? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? The Scottish government has been looking at measures that Ireland has already put in place, which say that no more than four households should gather together in someone's home. Both the UK and Scottish governments are aiming to offer Covid booster vaccine appointments to all over-18s by the end of the year. The booster shot gives peoplefar greater protectionagainst the heavily-mutated Omicron variant than two vaccine doses alone. Nicola Sturgeon has made clear she wants to slow down the spread of the Omicron variant while the booster programme is being ramped up, with Health Secretary Humza Yousaf saying that new restrictions were ""inevitable"". Ms Sturgeon will unveil the new measures in the Scottish Parliament this afternoon Ms Sturgeon will host a meeting of her cabinet this morning to agree the new measures, before announcing them in the Scottish Parliament at about 14:05 this afternoon. She has already rejected calls from a teaching union to close schools early for the Christmas holidays, saying the priority was to keep them open safely. Speaking in advance of the statement, Ms Sturgeon said that there may be ""targeted and proportionate"" measures introduced as a trade-off for allowing families to meet at Christmas. She added: ""We need to try to protect peoples' ability to spend Christmas with their families, and I am personally hoping for a more normal Christmas than last year on behalf of everybody across the country. ""But we need to balance that with the need to keep people as safe as possible in the run up to, and throughout, the winter and into 2022"". A total of 186 cases of the Omicron variant have been confirmed across Scotland so far, although this is thought to be a significant under-estimate of the true picture. What are the Covid rules in Scotland? The UK's first death linked to the new variant was reported on Monday, and case numbers in Scotland are thought to be doubling every two to three days. Omicron is expected to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus this week. Julie Ashworth, who chairs Edinburgh branch of the Institute of Directors, said the Scottish government should set out clear and definitive measures in response to Omicron rather than attempting to introduce ""lockdown by stealth"". She added: ""What is happening is customers are filling in the gaps in terms of guidance. ""It means that all businesses across all sectors are impacted by that, particularly hospitality, travel, retail and smaller businesses - customers are staying away and being cautious. ""What we're seeing because of that lack of clarity is that both trade and customer sentiment is being hurt."" It comes as MPs prepare to vote on new Covid rules for England later, with about 70 Conservatives expected to rebel against Prime Minister Boris Johnson. His proposal to make Covid passes a requirement of entering large venues such as nightclubs - which is already the case in Scotland - has angered many of his own MPs. The measures are still likely to pass as Labour says it will support them.ó ¢ó ³ó £ó ´ó ¿ Do you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

"In a series of Commons votes, MPs have backed the government's Plan B measures aimed at tackling the Omicron variant of coronavirus MPs voted to approve changing the rules on mask wearing and self-isolation - the system is replaced by daily lateral flow tests The introduction of Covid passes for large venues passes by 369 votes to 126 Nearly 100 Conservative MPs voted against the regulations The measure requires people to show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter some venues Backbencher Sir Charles Walker said the rebellion was a ""cry of pain"" by the party Boris Johnson described the plan as ""balanced and proportionate"" in light of the new Omicron variant Edited by Rob Corp That's it from us today - thanks for following our live coverage of today's Commons debate on new Covid regulations for England. The live page was written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Scott and Justin Parkinson, with correspondent analysis by Iain Watson. The editor was Rob Corp. You can keep up to date with any developments by readingour main story. It's been a dramatic evening here in Westminster, with Boris Johnsonfacing his biggest rebellion since becoming prime minister. Here's what happened: The House of Commons official photographer has been in the chamber capturing some of the key moments of the debate today. Here are some of the best shots, as MPs consider the government's proposals to introduce its Plan B Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Sajid Javid faced many interventions from his fellow Tory MPs over the votes, with many expressing their intention to vote against the government Javid set out the reasons the government intended to move to Plan B as debate opened The health secretary's tough reception was not just from his own side of the House, the opposition benches also had some words for him Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting outlined the Labour Party's support for the government, which is expected to allow the votes to proceed despite a significant Tory rebellion Louie French was elected less than two weeks ago The Conservative Party's newest MP was among those to vote against the introduction of mandatory Covid passes. Louie French, who won the Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election less than two weeks ago, said he did so to fulfil an election pledge. He wrote on Twitter: ""I fully support the booster rollout and I will get mine ASAP thanks to the efforts of the government, NHS, pharmacies, Army and volunteers. ""But, I made a clear pre-election pledge that I would not support Covid passes for our domestic economy and voted accordingly."" Some more news on the last Covid-related vote of the evening, on compulsory vaccinations for frontline NHS staff in England. Sixty-three Tory MPs rebelled against the government. This is the second biggest Conservative rebellion - after the one on Covid venue passes earlier tonight - since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Reacting to the Conservative rebellion, Scotland's first minister says it makes ""all UK nations less safe"". Nicola Sturgeon writes on Twitter,external: ""Under current funding arrangements, without responsible public health protections in England, there's no financial provision for such protections in Scotland, Wales or NI. ""It's a big problem in [the] face of this Covid challenge."" Nations have the power to set their own Covid regulations but overall funding for public services is allocated from central government under the Barnett formula. The formula means funding is adjusted based on comparable spending per person in England. Earlier today,people in Scotland were asked to limit socialising to three households at a timein the run-up to Christmas. It seems the numbers who voted in the Commons division on Covid passes might not be complete yet. The official division list - recording who voted for and against - shows only 123 of the MPs who opposed the government. The result in the Commons said 126 went this way. Anyway, as it stands, 96 Tory MPs defied the government, while two acted as tellers - vote counters - meaning they felt the same way but weren't counted themselves. Eight Labour MPs, 10 Liberal Democrats, six DUP, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Independent MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Rob Roberts also opposed the regulations. We'll try to find out about the other three, Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent They tried to persuade. They tried to cajole. Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed a packed meeting of backbench
MPs, setting out the risks posed by the new Covid variant. Professor Chris Whitty, Englandâs chief medical
officer, briefed MPs too  - telling them to expect a significant
increase in hospitalisations. But plenty of Conservative rebels - nearly 100 - simply
werenât for turning. That far outstrips the 55 MPs who voted against the Covid
tier system â remember that? â last year. It says a lot about the scepticism towards Covid passports But it also highlights a significant and growing gap between
the government and its backbenchers. And it suggests that, after weeks of negative headlines, the prime ministerâs authority has been seriously eroded - just as the country faces the next Covid crisis. Many Conservatives seem to have heeded the call
from former chief whip Mark Harper to use the vote to force the government
to show more respect for MPs. He is pressing for a recall of Parliament over Christmas, should the prime minister feel itâs necessary to introduce further
restrictions. Whether todayâs show of force from the back benches makes a
recall likely â or something Boris Johnson would want to avoid at all costs â
remains to be seen. The hope of many rebels is that the prime minister will
instead feel he can now go no further than Plan B. Itâs clear the mood on the Conservative benches is restless,
to say the least. All eyes at Westminster will be on Thursdayâs North Shropshire
by-election, as Conservative MPs openly mull over whether their big
electoral asset in 2019 - Johnson â has turned in to a liability. A body representing nightclubs says it is ""disappointed"" MPs have approved plans to make Covid passes mandatory for large venues.

The UK government has announced more funding to each of the devolved nations ""to progress their vaccine rollout"" Opposition parties question the Scottish government's ability to deliver the booster programme BBC Scotland News It has been a hectic afternoon and early evening as Nicola Sturgeon outlined her plans to tackle the latest wave of coronavirus in Scotland. But what did we we learn from her statement to parliament and what new guidelines are in place?  That's it for our live page coverage of events today. Thanks for joining us. Mr Swinney is asked if people would still be allowed to stand up and drink at bars when the new rules come into force on Saturday. The deputy first minister says he expects people will ""exercise the type of caution they are familiar with already"". Mr Swinney says it is all about ""sensible
steps in the short term"" to allow hospitality businesses to stay open and keep people safe. Deputy first minister John Swinney says there are no
current plans to make changes to big sporting events. In the coming weeks, Scotland has a number of large
football matches coming up including the League Cup final this weekend and the
Celtic v Rangers derby on 2 January. But Mr Swinney toldDrivetimethere are no plans to make changes to
these âat this stageâ and added âI would hope for them not be under scrutinyâ. The deputy first minister says spectators will need to âexercise
extra careâ and adds there will be dialogue with clubs to ensure appropriate
social distancing measures are in place for people entering and leaving stadia. The UK government says an extra 100 Armed Forces personnel are being made available to
accelerate the vaccine rollout in Scotland. That is on top of the 121
personnel who have been supporting the vaccine programme since
early October. Defence
Secretary Ben Wallace said: âOur Armed Forces continue to tirelessly support the Covid-19
vaccination programme in Scotland to give people and communities vital
protection against this virus. âThis uplift in support will help to get more vaccines into arms
faster, working shoulder to shoulder with the dedicated health services.â Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor This
package of new rules for business and strong guidance to all of us to cut back
on social contact is the toughest anywhere in the UK. Nicola
Sturgeon argues that however unwelcome, it is necessary to help slow down the
spread of Omicron while booster vaccines are speeded up. Unlike
the political row over Plan B for England, these new measures for Scotland do
not face fierce resistance from the Conservatives or other opposition parties
at Holyrood. Instead,
they question the detailed arrangements for getting financial support to
businesses and accelerating the delivery of Covid jabs. Ms
Sturgeon said she would have tightened hospitality rules further with financial
support from the Treasury - support that has now been announced. While
rules on social distancing and other measures for retail and hospitality will
be backed up by regulations, the request for reduced social mixing is not. The
first minister said that did not make it optional. But it is not without
contradiction. How,
for instance, do you avoid contact with people from many households if you go
to nightclubs which remain open for business? Lady Poole Deputy first minister John Swinney announces the Scottish
Covid-19 inquiry will be chaired by Lady Poole. The public inquiry will investigate a number of areas
including:  Mr Swinney is due to appear onBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeshortly. Question from Kirsty in Montrose We have had a lot of questions about the potential impact of Omicron on major life events. During the pandemic, both weddings and funerals were hit hard by restrictions on guest and mourner numbers. But the legal requirement for physical distancing and limits on gatherings were removed on 9 August. Despite the concerns over the new variant, there has been no change to the current guidance. It states: ""There are no limits on the number of people who can attend weddings, civil partnerships and funerals. This is also the case for other life events such as christenings, anniversary celebrations, bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland has a number of large football matches coming up including the League Cup final this weekend and the Celtic v Rangers derby on 2 January. Dr Sandesh Gulhane, from the Scottish Conservatives, tellsDrivetimethat we need to have ""sensible precautions"" in place around such football matches. He says: ""My feeling would be we need to look very carefully at that
and possibly, possibly, may need to cancel that."" However, he adds that he hopes the Scottish government has done modelling around such events and decided on whether it is the ""correct thing to do"" - although he points out this data was not supplied in a recent evidence paper. The debate around restrictions and whether they go far enough is, understandably, a hot topic. Tory MSP and part-time GP Sandesh Gulhane says the measures announced today will suffice for this phase of the battle against Omicron. Speaking onBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime, Dr Gulhane says, ""at the moment I
donât think we need further restrictions"" but adds the key is speeding up the booster jab rollout. Dr Gulhane welcomes the move to open more large-scale vaccination centres but adds this should have been done earlier. Just to recap on the latest statistics around Covid in Scotland... There were 3,117 new cases of Covid-19 reported in the past 24 hours - and six new reported deaths of people who had tested positive. The number of Omicron cases confirmed in Scotland was 110, taking the total to 296, according to data released by the Scottish government. The S gene dropout - a good indication of Omicron levels - is currently present in 27.5% of cases 541 people are in hospital - 20 fewer than yesterday - but the figure now includes two confirmed Omicron cases. 38 people are in intensive care - down one Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton tellsDrivetimethat he believes the Scottish government wants to go further in tightening hospitality restrictions. He says he doesn't necessarily believe things like theatre productions should be cancelled unless there is ""pound for pound"" compensation. I rather suspect that we might be called back to Parliament in the coming days when the quantum of money from the UK government becomes apparent. I felt that there was a will in the Scottish government to go further in tightening regulations on hospitality. If the Omicron surge is so severe that we should restrict our domestic socialising to just three households, itâs a hard message to sell that itâs ok to go on to see the ballet or the panto. Alex Cole-Hamilton, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader A body representing part of Scotland's hospitality sector welcomes the Â£100m extra support for businesses affected by recent Covid announcements. Stephen Montgomery, of The Scottish Hospitality Group, says December
is a ""critically important trading month"" for hospitality and warns without support that ""many venues will struggle to survive"". He adds, ""We therefore welcome the Scottish government's
commitment to Â£100m of financial support for hospitality. ""Today's funding will provide a little breathing space in the short
term - but it is clear the hospitality sector will require much more support if
we are to save venues from going to the wall."" More reaction to the latest Covid changeson BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetimeprogramme now. As we have been reporting, the Scottish business community has been giving an - at best -  lukewarm reception to the first minister's announcements. Leon Thompson, the Scotland director for UK Hospitality, tells BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetime with John Beattiethat the Â£100m fund for businesses is a ""drop in the ocean"" for those that are already struggling. Last week the BBC told how the Chester Hotel in Aberdeen had900 cancellations within 48 hours. Mr Thompson says there needs to be further
conversations about the guidance and there will be a ""lot of questions"" as to how things work. It is still not clear when the latest social distancing rules for hospitality businesses will begin, however Mr Thompson says further talks are taking place tomorrow. Shortly before Ms Sturgeon started speaking to the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternnon, the UK Treasury said it would make extra funding available to devolved governments to accelerate the vaccine rollout and tackle the virus. However, the first minister later tweeted she believes the money is ""not additional"" to funding already allocated through Barnett consequentials. Allow Twitter content?

Magnus BennettBBC Scotland News The Scottish Chambers of Commerce says there will be some
disappointment among Scotlandâs business community at new measures announced by
the first minister to tackle the Omicron variant. It has welcomed the Â£100m of targeted support being made
available for the hospitality, wholesale and supply chain sectors but says âit
will not go anywhere near far enough to cover the financial losses being
incurredâ. Chief executive Liz Cameron adds: âWhat Scotlandâs
businesses need now is an extension of at least the 50% Covid-19 rates relief,
beyond the three months set out in the Scottish budget and guaranteed for the
next financial year, in full. âWith these additional restrictions now in place, extended
rates relief will be critical to giving thousands of Scottish businesses a shot
at survival.â The push to get people to test more regularly has meant increased demand for lateral flow kits in some areas. The UK government website where people can order the kits to be posted out to them has struggled to keep up with demand at times. And some pharmacies in Scotland do not have any kits in stock. A spokesman for trade body Community Pharmacy Scotland confirmed its members are seeing increased demand. This pharmacy in Edinburgh is among many to have run out of lateral flow test kits The range of new restrictions will make trading much more difficult, according to Scotland's Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). Policy chair Andrew McRae welcomes the news of the Â£100m support fund from the Scottish government, but says independent retailers have already reported fewer customers. The money must reach firms as quickly as possible, especially since the new household mixing rules are bound to cause another surge in cancellations. Governments in Edinburgh and London must co-operate to ensure the amount of cash support available to firms matches the scale of the restrictions. The financial firepower to help firms during this stage of the crisis must be found."" Andrew McRae, Federation of Small Businesses Following the Treasury's confirmation of further funding support, Scottish Secretary
Alister Jack says we need to do ""everything possible"" to get boosters rolled out quickly. He adds that the UK government has provided ""unprecedented support"" in all parts of the UK since the start of the pandemic and that support will continue. Allow Twitter content?

Question from Craig in Fife Despite the fears over Omicron no fresh mandatory restrictions have been announced for concerts and major events, such as football matches. Under thevaccine passport schemewhich was introduced in October, anyone over the age of 18 must show proof - if asked - that they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to:  Proof of a negative lateral flow device test will also now be accepted.

"3200 covers have already been cancelled for December across Ms Isaac's four restaurants As the hospitality industry reels from the impact of new Covid curbs, pubs and restaurants have reported a wave of Christmas cancellations. The Bar 44 chain, which has four outlets, told the BBC 3,200 people had scrapped bookings for December. Natalie Isaac, its operations director, said only a ""handful"" of people would have cancelled before the pandemic. Others say that although they face no new rules, public caution is causing lower footfall and a loss of trade. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called for the government to provide financial support for businesses affected, but the Treasury has not unveiled any new measures. Bar 44, which has restaurants in Bristol and Cardiff, says 1,000 of the 3,200 lost bookings were down to the knock-on effects of cancelled concerts by Tom Jones and the Stereophonics. ""Having to stay open but not getting the business is our big worry,"" Ms Isaac explained. ""This should be our bumper two weeks before Christmas, but the diary is worryingly empty. We're significantly impacted and without furlough, we won't be able to protect our staff."" Ms Isaac was unable to give a figure for the loss of trade across the month, as the venues are not operating at full pre-pandemic capacity. They have also been opening just five days a week, because of staff shortages that started before the new Plan B restrictions. ""We're slightly refilling with small groups, but people are worried to go out again as they don't want to catch Covid during Christmas."" 'People don't realise the impact of cancellations' 'Non-stop cancellations' after Christmas party plea UK alert level raised to four - what does that mean? The CBI said hospitality businesses and shops were facing a ""double whammy"" of collapsing demand and no financial help because of the government's Plan B, aimed at fighting the spread of the Omicron variant. CBI director general Tony Danker said the restrictions were ""balanced"", but ministers needed to clarify that they were temporary. ""Whilst we have measures to keep the economy open, we have messages that have ended up closing much of it down,"" he told the BBC. ""We saved these businesses in the last 18 months. We kept them flourishing,"" he said. ""We can't lose that now, to essentially if unintentionally close down the restaurant sector at this time of year. That's a huge cashflow hit,"" he added. ""We need to revisit cashflow measures to support those businesses. We can't pretend that the economy is still open when demand has been so suppressed for understandable reasons."" A Treasury spokesperson said that the government had ""acted early"" to help control the virus's spread while ""avoiding damaging economic and social restrictions by allowing businesses to remain open"". ""To continue to protect the NHS, as well as jobs and livelihoods across the country, our priority is to ensure everyone who is eligible gets their booster jabs as quickly as possible. ""Our Â£400bn Covid-19 support package will continue to help businesses into spring next year and we will continue to respond proportionately to the changing path of theâ¯virus, as we have done since the start of the pandemic,"" the spokesperson added. Clive Watson, boss of pub chain, City Pub Group, said every kind of booking was now in decline since the Plan B announcement. ""In an nutshell, the big corporate parties have really started to be cancelled, which were really lucrative,"" he explained. ""To a certain extent, these were being compensated by smaller groups still booking, but now they're starting to cancel as well. ""What we're facing is a partial lockdown, but with no government assistance this time round."" Mr Watson said it was still worth staying open, but added that the impact would be sizeable if no further financial assistance came from the government. Data for Monday to Sunday of last week from the trade body UKHospitality, for example, showed a 13% drop in business and a 15% increase in cancellations, compared with pre-pandemic levels. The Caviar and Chips hospitality group has had to pivot to weddings next year after corporate cancellations As people revise their Christmas plans, Marc Hornby, co-founder of the Caviar and Chips catering and hospitality group, says corporate event inquiries are now ""next to none"". The country-wide external catering firm based in Birmingham has had to pivot to focusing on wedding events for 2022 and 2023 because of the impact of the current restrictions. ""It's been a significant drop - we're seeing 25% of the business we'd usually see,"" Mr Hornby told the BBC. ""The biggest challenge has been the mixed messaging and the government not realising how much it costs to cancel events."" Recruitment has also been difficult for 18 months, but Mr Hornby said they had anticipated fresh restrictions, so had planned more small events. The group owns a pub in Kenilworth, opened in March 2020, a week before lockdown. After moving to takeaways during lockdown, it has reopened, but has also seen very few corporate bookings. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said that Plan B restrictions had ""destroyed"" the crucial Christmas trading time for pubs. ""Further restrictions such as limits on group sizes, or even closing pubs, would be disastrous,"" she explained. ""Pubs need all the trade they can get this Christmas to make it through the quiet winter months ahead. ""Without it, they will need a full financial package from the government, including support on VAT, business rates and a return of the local authority grants. ""The chancellor needs to come to our rescue once more."" A spokesperson from restaurants operator Mitchells & Butlers, which runs brands such as All Bar One, O'Neill's, Harvester and Toby Carvery, said: ""We are deeply disappointed by the announcement of Plan B and the knock-on effect this will have on our industry as we continue to try to rebuild our businesses during the pandemic. ""We will, of course, comply with the Plan B regulations.  Very few of our businesses will be affected by the Covid pass provisions, and face masks are not required in our pubs and restaurants under the new guidance. ""We have no plans to introduce any additional restrictions unless required to do so."" Have you cancelled your Christmas booking? How have your plans changed due to the Omicron coronavirus variant?

"Health officials hope to administer as many booster doses as possible before the end of December Medical students and army doctors may be drafted in to deliver booster jabs across Northern Ireland as quickly as possible, the health minister has said. Robin Swann said he mightreturn to the Ministry of Defence for help. He was speaking amid fears of a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases from the new Omicron variant. One expert has warned that Omicron cases could reach over 1,000 a day in Northern Ireland by Christmas Eve due to the speed at which it spreads. Ten cases of the Covid-19 varianthave been detected in Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned in a televised address on Sunday that there was a""tidal wave of Omicron coming"". Meanwhile, long queues of people have been waiting at vaccination centres across Northern Ireland to get their booster jabs. Boosters are now being made available at walk-in centres for those aged 30 and above, whose last dose was administered at least three months ago. The Department of Health in the Republic of Ireland have identified eight additional cases of the Omicron variant in the country on Monday. Long queues have been reported at some vaccination centres on Monday, including this one in Londonderry That brings the total number of cases identified by the department there to 18. The country will soon be moving to a three-month gap between Covid-19 vaccine and booster doses, following a recommendation from the country's National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). Currently boosters are being given out to people aged 50 and over, people with underlying health conditions and healthcare workers. Mr Swann said he intended to announce plans in the ""next few days"" around booster availability for younger age groups. ""I need to emphasise the scale of the booster programme challenge and the Herculean efforts being made to get jabs to as many people as possible in the coming weeks,"" he said. Mr Swann told the Northern Ireland Assembly that 513 additional vaccinators had been sourced and urged people to check updates from health trusts on social media to determine the best time to attend the various walk-in facilities. ""We're already seeing sites where unfortunately we're seeing more people turn up than we actually have capacity,"" he said. But the focus is to get as many vaccines into arms as soon as is practically possible, he added. Dr Andrew Kunzmann, an epidemiologist at Queen's University Belfast, said Omicron cases in Northern Ireland could reach over 1,000 a day ""by Christmas Eve"". He said it was an ""inexact science"" but he estimated there would be ""quite a lot of cases by Christmas Day"". Dr Andrew Kunzmann warned there could be 1,000 cases a day in Northern Ireland by Christmas ""We want to slow that down as much as possible so that at Christmas Day fewer families have someone sitting at the table that's infected so that then hopefully we don't have that big post-Christmas peak that we did last year,"" he said. Trust hubs will be extending their opening hours and days of operation with immediate effect and hundreds of additional vaccinators are in the process of being recruited. The deferral of some planned routine health service activity is also under consideration. UK alert level raised to four - what does that mean? NI Covid booster uptake rises but infection rate high Police to lead Covid-19 passport enforcement - Long ""GPs, community pharmacies and trust hubs will all have a central and vital role in making this happen,"" Mr Swann said ""It is also really important that people who are not yet vaccinated come forward for their first dose without delay."" Earlier on Monday, First Minister Paul Givan said Northern Ireland was facing a Covid-19 ""storm"". ""This new variant is two-and-a-half times more transmissible, there is not the same protection from the first and second doses, but the booster does provide additional protection and that's why we need to get it out there,"" he said. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said ministers had been warned Northern Ireland could be ""overwhelmed with this new variant by early January"". There are now 10 confirmed cases of Omicron in Northern Ireland. None of those cases are in hospital, and of course, the true number is likely to be much higher. I understand those cases are either travel related or household contacts - so there is either little or no community transmission that public health officials can identify. That is good but it is a situation that will change. It's all about trying to contain cases at this stage in order to protect the public and the health service, but with just weeks to go before Christmas - where travel and socialising really is at its peak - that's going to be very difficult to do. We are in a different position than this time last year - while the vaccine had just come on the market, a lot of us hadn't got it. The language used by the prime minister and the UK's chief medical officers on Sunday night was shocking - it was designed to jolt us and trigger a rapid acceleration of the booster programme. Chief scientific adviser Prof Ian Young said Northern Ireland now had an opportunity to get in the ""strongest possible position"" ahead of the inevitable rise in cases. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's chief scientific adviser says he is encouraged by the number of people coming forward to get their booster vaccines. He said a ""huge amount of work"" had taken place over the weekend to do with the booster jabs for the over-30s. Northern Ireland hashad a slower uptake for booster doses in comparison with Great Britain. The health officials in charge of vaccines have said that is because of the initial emphasis put on getting boosters into care homes. More than 500,000 booster/third doses have been delivered to date. Northern Ireland's Covid certificationbecame legally enforceable on Monday. The scheme requires people to prove Covid status to gain entry to a range of hospitality venues and larges attendance events.

"In a series of Commons votes, MPs have backed the government's Plan B measures aimed at tackling the Omicron variant of coronavirus MPs voted to approve changing the rules on mask wearing and self-isolation - the system is replaced by daily lateral flow tests The introduction of Covid passes for large venues passes by 369 votes to 126 Nearly 100 Conservative MPs voted against the regulations The measure requires people to show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter some venues Backbencher Sir Charles Walker said the rebellion was a ""cry of pain"" by the party Boris Johnson described the plan as ""balanced and proportionate"" in light of the new Omicron variant Edited by Rob Corp That's it from us today - thanks for following our live coverage of today's Commons debate on new Covid regulations for England. The live page was written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Scott and Justin Parkinson, with correspondent analysis by Iain Watson. The editor was Rob Corp. You can keep up to date with any developments by readingour main story. It's been a dramatic evening here in Westminster, with Boris Johnsonfacing his biggest rebellion since becoming prime minister. Here's what happened: The House of Commons official photographer has been in the chamber capturing some of the key moments of the debate today. Here are some of the best shots, as MPs consider the government's proposals to introduce its Plan B Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Sajid Javid faced many interventions from his fellow Tory MPs over the votes, with many expressing their intention to vote against the government Javid set out the reasons the government intended to move to Plan B as debate opened The health secretary's tough reception was not just from his own side of the House, the opposition benches also had some words for him Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting outlined the Labour Party's support for the government, which is expected to allow the votes to proceed despite a significant Tory rebellion Louie French was elected less than two weeks ago The Conservative Party's newest MP was among those to vote against the introduction of mandatory Covid passes. Louie French, who won the Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election less than two weeks ago, said he did so to fulfil an election pledge. He wrote on Twitter: ""I fully support the booster rollout and I will get mine ASAP thanks to the efforts of the government, NHS, pharmacies, Army and volunteers. ""But, I made a clear pre-election pledge that I would not support Covid passes for our domestic economy and voted accordingly."" Some more news on the last Covid-related vote of the evening, on compulsory vaccinations for frontline NHS staff in England. Sixty-three Tory MPs rebelled against the government. This is the second biggest Conservative rebellion - after the one on Covid venue passes earlier tonight - since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Reacting to the Conservative rebellion, Scotland's first minister says it makes ""all UK nations less safe"". Nicola Sturgeon writes on Twitter,external: ""Under current funding arrangements, without responsible public health protections in England, there's no financial provision for such protections in Scotland, Wales or NI. ""It's a big problem in [the] face of this Covid challenge."" Nations have the power to set their own Covid regulations but overall funding for public services is allocated from central government under the Barnett formula. The formula means funding is adjusted based on comparable spending per person in England. Earlier today,people in Scotland were asked to limit socialising to three households at a timein the run-up to Christmas. It seems the numbers who voted in the Commons division on Covid passes might not be complete yet. The official division list - recording who voted for and against - shows only 123 of the MPs who opposed the government. The result in the Commons said 126 went this way. Anyway, as it stands, 96 Tory MPs defied the government, while two acted as tellers - vote counters - meaning they felt the same way but weren't counted themselves. Eight Labour MPs, 10 Liberal Democrats, six DUP, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Independent MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Rob Roberts also opposed the regulations. We'll try to find out about the other three, Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent They tried to persuade. They tried to cajole. Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed a packed meeting of backbench
MPs, setting out the risks posed by the new Covid variant. Professor Chris Whitty, Englandâs chief medical
officer, briefed MPs too  - telling them to expect a significant
increase in hospitalisations. But plenty of Conservative rebels - nearly 100 - simply
werenât for turning. That far outstrips the 55 MPs who voted against the Covid
tier system â remember that? â last year. It says a lot about the scepticism towards Covid passports But it also highlights a significant and growing gap between
the government and its backbenchers. And it suggests that, after weeks of negative headlines, the prime ministerâs authority has been seriously eroded - just as the country faces the next Covid crisis. Many Conservatives seem to have heeded the call
from former chief whip Mark Harper to use the vote to force the government
to show more respect for MPs. He is pressing for a recall of Parliament over Christmas, should the prime minister feel itâs necessary to introduce further
restrictions. Whether todayâs show of force from the back benches makes a
recall likely â or something Boris Johnson would want to avoid at all costs â
remains to be seen. The hope of many rebels is that the prime minister will
instead feel he can now go no further than Plan B. Itâs clear the mood on the Conservative benches is restless,
to say the least. All eyes at Westminster will be on Thursdayâs North Shropshire
by-election, as Conservative MPs openly mull over whether their big
electoral asset in 2019 - Johnson â has turned in to a liability. A body representing nightclubs says it is ""disappointed"" MPs have approved plans to make Covid passes mandatory for large venues. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, says his organisation has consistently opposed Covid passes because of the ""logistical challenges they pose"". ""It is very disappointing that, after flip-flopping on the
issue twice, the government have decided to press ahead with the plans despite
no evidence of their impact on transmission of the virus,"" he says. âThis is a slippery path we are
going down. I would urge the government to listen to its backbenchers now â
this far and no further.â If more restrictions are introduced, Kill says there must be a ""proportionate support package including a return of the furlough scheme"". Charles Walker, one of the 98 Tory MPs to rebel against the government on Covid passes, says the prime minister still has ""huge support"" but ""this was just a bridge too far"". âIt was a cry of pain from the Conservative Party,"" he tells the BBC. However, Walker says he does not believe the rebellion calls into question the PM's ability to persuade his own MPs over the things he wants to do. The Tory MP says many colleagues were ""holding their nose"" when voting for mandatory Covid passes and the prime minister and his team ""need to listen"". ""The mood has changed"" and backbench views on further restrictions ""are hardening"", he adds. Some figures are in. Ninety-eight Conservative MPs rebelled against the government over Covid passes in England. That's by far the biggest such act of defiance by his own troops since Boris Johnson became PM. Also, eight Labour MPs rebelled against their own front bench to oppose the plan - Sir Keir Starmer had ordered them to support it.  After several hours of debate, the government's proposals for tackling the Omicron variant in England have been approved by MPs - albeit with a significant rebellion by some Tories. Here's what they voted for: The result of the final vote is in, with the government's plans to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for front-line NHS workers in England passing by 385 votes to 100. So all the measures got through, one without a vote and the others by varying margins. Forty Conservative MPs rebelled  against government plans to make face coverings compulsory in most indoor settings. Thirty-eight Tories voted against the plans, while a further two who were opposed acted as tellers. A further three DUP MPs also voted against. Labour's whips office is suggesting that 101 Conservative MPs rebelled against the government on Covid passes for large venues in England. We'll have the full figures as soon as possible. The previous biggest rebellion against Boris Johnson's government involved 59 Tory MPs. And now for the final Commons vote this evening, on whether front-line NHS staff in England should be compelled to be vaccinated for Covid. Like the other measures, this is expected to pass easily, but the size of any Tory rebellion will be closely watched. It looks like there was a big one in the previous vote, on Covid passes for entry to large venues. The House of Commons backs the government's plan to introduce Covid passes - or passports - for entry to large venues in England, such as nightclubs, by 369 votes to 126. The Labour leadership supported the move, but the Liberal Democrats and many on Boris Johnson's own Conservative benches opposed it. MPs have unanimously voted to approve changing the rules so that vaccinated people who come into contact with suspected Omicron cases will no longer have to self-isolate. Anyone coming into contact with Covid cases of any kind will be""strongly advised"" to take lateral flow tests,externalfor seven days. Right, MPs are filing out for the second of tonight's votes. This time it's the one where the biggest Tory rebellion is expected - on whether to introduce a Covid pass - called a ""passport"" by many - to allow access to nightclubs and other sizeable venues. Another motion, on isolation, got through ""on the nod"" - that is, without opposition in the Commons chamber. Regulations making wearing face masks compulsory in most indoor settings, except for pubs and restaurants, have been approved by MPs. The government wins by 441 votes to 41. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The government has said that all 11 countries will be removed from the UK's travel red list from 4am on Wednesday. Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe are on the list. The red list was reintroduced in late November as a precaution after the emergence of the Omicron variant. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it had spread so widely the rules no longer had much purpose. ""Now that there is community transmission of Omicron in the UK and Omicron has spread so widely across the world, the travel red list is now less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad,"" he told Parliament. ""Whilst we will maintain our temporary testing measures for international travel we will be removing all 11 countries from the travel red list effective from 4am tomorrow morning."" What tests do I need if I travel abroad? All UK arrivals from red list countries are required to pay for and self-isolate in a pre-booked, government-approved hotel for 10 days. But with all 11 countries being removed from that list, it was confirmed that those currently in managed quarantine would be allowed to leave early and ""follow the rules as if they had arrived from a non-red list country"". Some travellers had paid thousands of pounds to stay in government-approved quarantine hotels, with complaints of chaotic organisation and inedible food during their stays. Anyone who has tested positive will to remain in isolation, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Stephen Barclay told the House of Commons. Mr Javid also said earlier he was ""very persuaded"" by calls to reimburse people and hoped to make an announcement on that soon. The point of putting countries on the red list was to act quickly to slow the spread of Omicron. Now it has spread in the community, the government doesn't think putting people from a limited list of countries in hotels is useful. It will be welcome news to people with plans to come to the UK from countries like South Africa and Nigeria, or who had delayed their return from those countries. But it will be frustrating for those who did get caught up in the revival of the red list, which only started about a fortnight ago. Some people who have already paid for hotel stays want to see the government pay their costs. The travel industry wantsallrestrictions removed. Businesses see testing measures as putting a dampener on their recovery. It seems the government is not prepared to go that far, just yet. This will make travel companies, who normally benefit from a holiday booking rush in late December and early January, feel nervous. The move follows anger from African countries, with the UN describing the ban on non-UK residents entering England as ""travel apartheid"". South African Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said the UK announcement had ""come just in time to allow families and friends to unite over the festive season"". The travel industry had also warned the restrictions were hurting business. Tim Alderslade, head of trade group Airlines UK, said emptying the red list made ""complete sense"" but that the government should also scrap the remaining travel restrictions. Currently all arrivals, regardless of where they fly from, must take Covid tests within 48 hours of setting off for the UK and PCR tests within two days of their arrival. ""If the red list isn't necessary, given that Omicron is established here at home, then neither are the costly emergency testing and isolation measures imposed on even fully vaccinated travellers, which again put us completely at odds with the rest of Europe,"" he said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said these testing measures would be reviewed in the first week of January. ""As always, we keep all our travel measures under review and we may impose new restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health,"" he said on Twitter. Alison Stitt in her quarantine hotel room Alison Stitt says her experience in a quarantine hotel pushed her to the point of meltdown. She was in South Africa visiting her father for his 90th birthday when the country went on the UK's red list. It took days to rearrange a flight home on the same date that a quarantine hotel room was available. They had to stay longer in their AirBnB and re-book their car hire while they waited - on top of extending their car parking and kennels bookings in the UK. Now she and her husband David are at a hotel near Gatwick. Alison says the total cost of their extended stay in South Africa and paying for their quarantine facility has been at least Â£5,500. ""It was one expense after another. It's all going on credit cards. It was meant to be a budget trip."" She describes the experience of going into quarantine as a farce. ""We were herded into coaches after we landed. We got lucky coming to Gatwick, some were going to Manchester."" Alison says her room is clean and modern, but she doesn't feel safe in the hotel, saying she's seen guards sneezing with their masks down. The hotel had to be evacuated last week because of a fire alarm. ""We know someone has tested positive in the hotel. They came to re-test us, saying that we had been exposed to someone with Covid during the fire alarm."" Read more here How are travel rules being relaxed?

"In a series of Commons votes, MPs have backed the government's Plan B measures aimed at tackling the Omicron variant of coronavirus MPs voted to approve changing the rules on mask wearing and self-isolation - the system is replaced by daily lateral flow tests The introduction of Covid passes for large venues passes by 369 votes to 126 Nearly 100 Conservative MPs voted against the regulations The measure requires people to show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter some venues Backbencher Sir Charles Walker said the rebellion was a ""cry of pain"" by the party Boris Johnson described the plan as ""balanced and proportionate"" in light of the new Omicron variant Edited by Rob Corp That's it from us today - thanks for following our live coverage of today's Commons debate on new Covid regulations for England. The live page was written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Scott and Justin Parkinson, with correspondent analysis by Iain Watson. The editor was Rob Corp. You can keep up to date with any developments by readingour main story. It's been a dramatic evening here in Westminster, with Boris Johnsonfacing his biggest rebellion since becoming prime minister. Here's what happened: The House of Commons official photographer has been in the chamber capturing some of the key moments of the debate today. Here are some of the best shots, as MPs consider the government's proposals to introduce its Plan B Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Sajid Javid faced many interventions from his fellow Tory MPs over the votes, with many expressing their intention to vote against the government Javid set out the reasons the government intended to move to Plan B as debate opened The health secretary's tough reception was not just from his own side of the House, the opposition benches also had some words for him Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting outlined the Labour Party's support for the government, which is expected to allow the votes to proceed despite a significant Tory rebellion Louie French was elected less than two weeks ago The Conservative Party's newest MP was among those to vote against the introduction of mandatory Covid passes. Louie French, who won the Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election less than two weeks ago, said he did so to fulfil an election pledge. He wrote on Twitter: ""I fully support the booster rollout and I will get mine ASAP thanks to the efforts of the government, NHS, pharmacies, Army and volunteers. ""But, I made a clear pre-election pledge that I would not support Covid passes for our domestic economy and voted accordingly."" Some more news on the last Covid-related vote of the evening, on compulsory vaccinations for frontline NHS staff in England. Sixty-three Tory MPs rebelled against the government. This is the second biggest Conservative rebellion - after the one on Covid venue passes earlier tonight - since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Reacting to the Conservative rebellion, Scotland's first minister says it makes ""all UK nations less safe"". Nicola Sturgeon writes on Twitter,external: ""Under current funding arrangements, without responsible public health protections in England, there's no financial provision for such protections in Scotland, Wales or NI. ""It's a big problem in [the] face of this Covid challenge."" Nations have the power to set their own Covid regulations but overall funding for public services is allocated from central government under the Barnett formula. The formula means funding is adjusted based on comparable spending per person in England. Earlier today,people in Scotland were asked to limit socialising to three households at a timein the run-up to Christmas. It seems the numbers who voted in the Commons division on Covid passes might not be complete yet. The official division list - recording who voted for and against - shows only 123 of the MPs who opposed the government. The result in the Commons said 126 went this way. Anyway, as it stands, 96 Tory MPs defied the government, while two acted as tellers - vote counters - meaning they felt the same way but weren't counted themselves. Eight Labour MPs, 10 Liberal Democrats, six DUP, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Independent MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Rob Roberts also opposed the regulations. We'll try to find out about the other three, Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent They tried to persuade. They tried to cajole. Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed a packed meeting of backbench
MPs, setting out the risks posed by the new Covid variant. Professor Chris Whitty, Englandâs chief medical
officer, briefed MPs too  - telling them to expect a significant
increase in hospitalisations. But plenty of Conservative rebels - nearly 100 - simply
werenât for turning. That far outstrips the 55 MPs who voted against the Covid
tier system â remember that? â last year. It says a lot about the scepticism towards Covid passports But it also highlights a significant and growing gap between
the government and its backbenchers. And it suggests that, after weeks of negative headlines, the prime ministerâs authority has been seriously eroded - just as the country faces the next Covid crisis. Many Conservatives seem to have heeded the call
from former chief whip Mark Harper to use the vote to force the government
to show more respect for MPs. He is pressing for a recall of Parliament over Christmas, should the prime minister feel itâs necessary to introduce further
restrictions. Whether todayâs show of force from the back benches makes a
recall likely â or something Boris Johnson would want to avoid at all costs â
remains to be seen. The hope of many rebels is that the prime minister will
instead feel he can now go no further than Plan B. Itâs clear the mood on the Conservative benches is restless,
to say the least. All eyes at Westminster will be on Thursdayâs North Shropshire
by-election, as Conservative MPs openly mull over whether their big
electoral asset in 2019 - Johnson â has turned in to a liability. A body representing nightclubs says it is ""disappointed"" MPs have approved plans to make Covid passes mandatory for large venues. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, says his organisation has consistently opposed Covid passes because of the ""logistical challenges they pose"". ""It is very disappointing that, after flip-flopping on the
issue twice, the government have decided to press ahead with the plans despite
no evidence of their impact on transmission of the virus,"" he says. âThis is a slippery path we are
going down. I would urge the government to listen to its backbenchers now â
this far and no further.â If more restrictions are introduced, Kill says there must be a ""proportionate support package including a return of the furlough scheme"". Charles Walker, one of the 98 Tory MPs to rebel against the government on Covid passes, says the prime minister still has ""huge support"" but ""this was just a bridge too far"". âIt was a cry of pain from the Conservative Party,"" he tells the BBC. However, Walker says he does not believe the rebellion calls into question the PM's ability to persuade his own MPs over the things he wants to do. The Tory MP says many colleagues were ""holding their nose"" when voting for mandatory Covid passes and the prime minister and his team ""need to listen"". ""The mood has changed"" and backbench views on further restrictions ""are hardening"", he adds. Some figures are in. Ninety-eight Conservative MPs rebelled against the government over Covid passes in England. That's by far the biggest such act of defiance by his own troops since Boris Johnson became PM. Also, eight Labour MPs rebelled against their own front bench to oppose the plan - Sir Keir Starmer had ordered them to support it.  After several hours of debate, the government's proposals for tackling the Omicron variant in England have been approved by MPs - albeit with a significant rebellion by some Tories. Here's what they voted for: The result of the final vote is in, with the government's plans to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for front-line NHS workers in England passing by 385 votes to 100. So all the measures got through, one without a vote and the others by varying margins. Forty Conservative MPs rebelled  against government plans to make face coverings compulsory in most indoor settings. Thirty-eight Tories voted against the plans, while a further two who were opposed acted as tellers. A further three DUP MPs also voted against. Labour's whips office is suggesting that 101 Conservative MPs rebelled against the government on Covid passes for large venues in England. We'll have the full figures as soon as possible. The previous biggest rebellion against Boris Johnson's government involved 59 Tory MPs. And now for the final Commons vote this evening, on whether front-line NHS staff in England should be compelled to be vaccinated for Covid. Like the other measures, this is expected to pass easily, but the size of any Tory rebellion will be closely watched. It looks like there was a big one in the previous vote, on Covid passes for entry to large venues. The House of Commons backs the government's plan to introduce Covid passes - or passports - for entry to large venues in England, such as nightclubs, by 369 votes to 126. The Labour leadership supported the move, but the Liberal Democrats and many on Boris Johnson's own Conservative benches opposed it. MPs have unanimously voted to approve changing the rules so that vaccinated people who come into contact with suspected Omicron cases will no longer have to self-isolate. Anyone coming into contact with Covid cases of any kind will be""strongly advised"" to take lateral flow tests,externalfor seven days. Right, MPs are filing out for the second of tonight's votes. This time it's the one where the biggest Tory rebellion is expected - on whether to introduce a Covid pass - called a ""passport"" by many - to allow access to nightclubs and other sizeable venues. Another motion, on isolation, got through ""on the nod"" - that is, without opposition in the Commons chamber. Regulations making wearing face masks compulsory in most indoor settings, except for pubs and restaurants, have been approved by MPs. The government wins by 441 votes to 41. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The government has said that all 11 countries will be removed from the UK's travel red list from 4am on Wednesday. Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe are on the list. The red list was reintroduced in late November as a precaution after the emergence of the Omicron variant. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it had spread so widely the rules no longer had much purpose. ""Now that there is community transmission of Omicron in the UK and Omicron has spread so widely across the world, the travel red list is now less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad,"" he told Parliament. ""Whilst we will maintain our temporary testing measures for international travel we will be removing all 11 countries from the travel red list effective from 4am tomorrow morning."" What tests do I need if I travel abroad? All UK arrivals from red list countries are required to pay for and self-isolate in a pre-booked, government-approved hotel for 10 days. But with all 11 countries being removed from that list, it was confirmed that those currently in managed quarantine would be allowed to leave early and ""follow the rules as if they had arrived from a non-red list country"". Some travellers had paid thousands of pounds to stay in government-approved quarantine hotels, with complaints of chaotic organisation and inedible food during their stays. Anyone who has tested positive will to remain in isolation, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Stephen Barclay told the House of Commons. Mr Javid also said earlier he was ""very persuaded"" by calls to reimburse people and hoped to make an announcement on that soon. The point of putting countries on the red list was to act quickly to slow the spread of Omicron. Now it has spread in the community, the government doesn't think putting people from a limited list of countries in hotels is useful. It will be welcome news to people with plans to come to the UK from countries like South Africa and Nigeria, or who had delayed their return from those countries. But it will be frustrating for those who did get caught up in the revival of the red list, which only started about a fortnight ago. Some people who have already paid for hotel stays want to see the government pay their costs. The travel industry wantsallrestrictions removed. Businesses see testing measures as putting a dampener on their recovery. It seems the government is not prepared to go that far, just yet. This will make travel companies, who normally benefit from a holiday booking rush in late December and early January, feel nervous. The move follows anger from African countries, with the UN describing the ban on non-UK residents entering England as ""travel apartheid"". South African Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said the UK announcement had ""come just in time to allow families and friends to unite over the festive season"". The travel industry had also warned the restrictions were hurting business. Tim Alderslade, head of trade group Airlines UK, said emptying the red list made ""complete sense"" but that the government should also scrap the remaining travel restrictions. Currently all arrivals, regardless of where they fly from, must take Covid tests within 48 hours of setting off for the UK and PCR tests within two days of their arrival. ""If the red list isn't necessary, given that Omicron is established here at home, then neither are the costly emergency testing and isolation measures imposed on even fully vaccinated travellers, which again put us completely at odds with the rest of Europe,"" he said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said these testing measures would be reviewed in the first week of January. ""As always, we keep all our travel measures under review and we may impose new restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health,"" he said on Twitter.

"New guidelines on social contact are expected to be outlined by Scotland's first minister on Tuesday afternoon. BBC Scotland political editor Glenn Campbell said this could include advice on how many other people or households you should meet in one day. The limits are expected to be advice rather than law - and there could be exceptions around Christmas. There is not expected to be any extension to the vaccine passport scheme at this stage. That is because the passports only show that a person has had two vaccine doses, which offers limited protection against Omicron. But there may be a request to shops and places of worship to improve social distancing and other safety measures. And advice that has already been issued around taking regular tests, working from home where possible and putting off work Christmas parties may be extended. Follow Nicola Sturgeon's statement to Holyrood from 14:05 Jabs need a major scaling up - but can it be done? Why do boosters work if two doses struggle? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? The Scottish government has been looking at measures that Ireland has already put in place, which say that no more than four households should gather together in someone's home. Both the UK and Scottish governments are aiming to offer Covid booster vaccine appointments to all over-18s by the end of the year. The booster shot gives peoplefar greater protectionagainst the heavily-mutated Omicron variant than two vaccine doses alone. Nicola Sturgeon has made clear she wants to slow down the spread of the Omicron variant while the booster programme is being ramped up, with Health Secretary Humza Yousaf saying that new restrictions were ""inevitable"". Ms Sturgeon will unveil the new measures in the Scottish Parliament this afternoon Ms Sturgeon will host a meeting of her cabinet this morning to agree the new measures, before announcing them in the Scottish Parliament at about 14:05 this afternoon. She has already rejected calls from a teaching union to close schools early for the Christmas holidays, saying the priority was to keep them open safely. Speaking in advance of the statement, Ms Sturgeon said that there may be ""targeted and proportionate"" measures introduced as a trade-off for allowing families to meet at Christmas. She added: ""We need to try to protect peoples' ability to spend Christmas with their families, and I am personally hoping for a more normal Christmas than last year on behalf of everybody across the country. ""But we need to balance that with the need to keep people as safe as possible in the run up to, and throughout, the winter and into 2022"". A total of 186 cases of the Omicron variant have been confirmed across Scotland so far, although this is thought to be a significant under-estimate of the true picture. What are the Covid rules in Scotland? The UK's first death linked to the new variant was reported on Monday, and case numbers in Scotland are thought to be doubling every two to three days. Omicron is expected to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus this week. Julie Ashworth, who chairs Edinburgh branch of the Institute of Directors, said the Scottish government should set out clear and definitive measures in response to Omicron rather than attempting to introduce ""lockdown by stealth"". She added: ""What is happening is customers are filling in the gaps in terms of guidance. ""It means that all businesses across all sectors are impacted by that, particularly hospitality, travel, retail and smaller businesses - customers are staying away and being cautious. ""What we're seeing because of that lack of clarity is that both trade and customer sentiment is being hurt."" It comes as MPs prepare to vote on new Covid rules for England later, with about 70 Conservatives expected to rebel against Prime Minister Boris Johnson. His proposal to make Covid passes a requirement of entering large venues such as nightclubs - which is already the case in Scotland - has angered many of his own MPs. The measures are still likely to pass as Labour says it will support them.ó ¢ó ³ó £ó ´ó ¿ Do you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

"All 11 countries will be taken off England's travel red list from 04:00 GMT on Wednesday, the health secretary announces But testing measures - a pre-arrival negative test and then another PCR test after arrival - remain in place for all travellers Deputy PM Dominic Raab says people in England will be able to spend Christmas in a way they could not last year because of Plan B restrictions MPs are debating the new measures in the Commons today, with a big Tory rebellion expected over Covid passes for some venues In Scotland, people have been asked to limit socialising to three households at a time but this advice will not apply on Christmas day More than half a million people booked booster jabs on Monday and long queues were seen again at some vaccination centres on Tuesday A top South African doctor says the country is mainly seeing ""mild disease"" and intensive care units are not overwhelmed Emma Harrison We're closing our live coverage for the day, so thanks for joining us - we'll be back again tomorrow. Our writers have been Joseph Lee, Alexandra Fouche, Alex Kleiderman and Adam Durbin. The page has been edited by Alex Therrien, Holly Wallis, Emma Harrison and Tiffany Wertheimer. It's been a very busy day with plenty of developments. Here's a round up of the key headlines: And if you're keen to follow the debate and votes over Covid measures in the Commons, our friends and colleagues at BBC Politicshave you covered here.  The hospitality industry is feeling the impact of the new Covid curbs, with pubs and restaurants reporting a wave of Christmas cancellations. The Bar 44 chain tells the BBC 3,200 people have scrapped bookings in December alone across its four outlets in Bristol and Cardiff. Natalie Isaac, the business' operations director, says only a ""handful"" of people would have cancelled before the pandemic. She adds 1,000 of those bookings were lost because of the knock-on effects of cancelled concerts by Tom Jones and the Stereophonics. Others say that although they face no new rules, public caution is causing lower footfall and a loss of trade. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called for the government to provide financial support for businesses affected, but the Treasury has not unveiled any new measures. Read more here. Having to stay open but not getting the business is our big worry. This should be our bumper two weeks before Christmas, but the diary is worryingly empty. We're significantly impacted and without furlough, we won't be able to protect our staff. Natalie Isaac, Operations Director, Bar 44 Boris Johnson visiting a Covid vaccine centre in London yesterday Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed his thanks to people who have queued for booster jabs, No 10 has said. Johnson's official spokesman said the PM was grateful to those who ""queued for hours to get their jabs yesterday"", following theexpansion of the booster rollout to all adults in England. The spokesman adds the government wants to ""go further and faster"" with the rollout. He says: ""You'll have seen that the 15-minute wait has been temporarily paused by the UK chief medical officers. That will allow for significantly more people to go through those vaccination sites. ""It's something that will be very beneficial on the ground and I'll stress that that's been done on clinical advice and safety continues to be our top priority."" There have been long queues at many vaccination centres in England The UK government has reported that 513,722 booster shots were given on Monday, which means that 42% of the population has now been given a third dose - that's more than 24 million people. And as we've been reporting, the booster campaign is in full swing, having been brought forward in response to the Omicron variant. There have been some teething problems, with the NHS website crashing under the strain of so many people trying to book their appointment. In England and Scotland, it's hoped every adult will be able to book a Covid booster before the end of 2021. InEnglanda booster is now available to every adult aged 18 or over - as long as it's at least three months since their second dose. Over-30s can start booking their booster from two months after their second dose (but the appointment dates offered will only be after three months has passed) and from Wednesday, this will be extended to over-18s. There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination centres, but the government has urged people to be ""patient and keep trying, or book online"". Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. A doctor from Cambridge has spoken of the sadness his lab team felt at taking a decision to cancel their Christmas party, despite it being the ""right thing to do"". Prof Stefan Marciniak, a respiratory specialist, tells the BBC it was a ""unanimous decision"" from the whole team to protect the health of their family, friends and the wider community from the spread of the Omicron variant. He says: âSome of us are clinicians and we don't want to contribute to the coming wave that will hit us. ""We also
have responsibilities. If I can't do my ward rounds on Christmas Eve then
someone else has to do that."" Omicron is transmitting extremely quickly and coming into a population with relatively little protection from two doses of vaccine, although boosters appear to have a very good effect in early studies. Prof Stefan Marciniak, Doctor and Professor of Respiratory Science, University of Cambridge Indonesia has become one of the few countries in Asia to start vaccinating children against Covid-19. Those aged six to 11 will now receive China's Sinovac vaccine. Covid vaccinations for children have been a sensitive and sometimes controversial subject around the world. InEurope, the medicines regulator approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's lower-dose vaccine on children aged five to 11 last month, however different countries are approaching it in different ways. For example, one region in Italy is using clowns and jugglers at clinics andFranceandGermanyare targeting only the most vulnerable children.Denmark, on the other hand, has been giving the shots even before the specially-designed vials and syringes have arrived, according to Reuters news agency. In theUK,the government has been advised to offer 12 to 15-year-olds a second jab. Read more: The UK's four chief medical officers have just advised that the waiting period where people are monitored after getting their Pfizer or Moderna Covid jab in case of an allergic reaction should be temporarily suspended. They said scrapping the 15-minute observation period would speed the process up at vaccination centres and allow more people to get boosters. They also said the rates of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) after Covid vaccination are low - around one per 100,000 vaccine doses. Speaking in the Commons just now, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change would help the NHS ""get more jabs in arms more quickly to give people vital protection this winter"". Those who have a history of allergies, particularly to other vaccines, or have had an immediate reaction after previous doses may still be advised to stay for the 15 minutes. The French government is keeping a close eye on the Omicron situation in Britain, and may tighten entry restrictions to those travelling from the UK if the situation worsens, says a French government spokesman. ""We are always looking at means to tighten the framework, we are currently working on that and we should, I think, come to a conclusion in the coming days,"" Gabriel Attal told France Info radio on Tuesday. France is currently in the midst of a fifth coronavirus wave, mostly driven by the Delta variant. There are 133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in France, Mr Attal said. The UK government has updated its daily Covid numbers: Ministers have announced that all countries will be removed from the travel red list in England because the Omicron variant is spreading throughout the UK - but travel testing will remain in place. Now the travel trade body Abta is calling for all restrictions to be lifted. Chief executive Mark Tanzer says: ""The government has always been clear that once the Omicron variant is widespread across the UK there would be little rationale for retaining any restrictions on international travel."" Travel businesses are facing a ""serious situation"" with temporary testing requirements extending over Christmas and the New Year, and into the peak booking period for summer 2022, he says. He adds: ""Consumer confidence in travel has suffered a significant setback, which will outlast these restrictions. The government must acknowledge this by bringing forward grant support to help businesses through the difficult weeks ahead."" As the debate on Plan B measures continues, MPs have been indicating their concerns throughout in interventions. Tory
Alec Shelbrookeasked if variants keep coming, ""how do we avoid debating the same thing in three months or five
months' time?"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid responded that the key is the vaccine, and said the government has struck deals for 114 million more doses that could be adjusted for future variants. In light of the new data on Omicron, Covid passes will require booster jabs
and not just the initial two doses ""as soon as all adults have a reasonable
chance"" of having an extra jab, Javid says. One Tory MP said he is worried about a ""two-tier
system"" and wants the health secretary to assure him negative tests will always be an alternative as part of Covid passes. Javid said: ""This is not a vaccine passport, it is really important that people have a range of options."" ButLib Dem Alistair Carmichaelsaid ""a vaccine
passport with a lateral flow option is still a vaccine passport"" and questioned what effect they had had in other parts of the UK, where they have been in place for weeks. Back in the Commons, Labour's Wes Streeting has outlined his party's support for the government's Plan B measures. The shadow health secretary says mask wearing has been ""proven to be effective"" and adds the government should never have lifted the rules in the first place. On Covid passes, Streeting says Labour supports the requirement to have the option to show a negative lateral flow test and argues they are ""not vaccine passports"" as a result. Although the party doesn't support mandatory vaccination in general, he says it will back the measure for health and care workers. But he says the government must do more to persuade them to get jabs voluntarily. Some more details from Nicola Sturgeon's update for Scotland now. Visits to care home residents should not now involve any more than two households at a time, she announces. The new guidance also asks people to do a lateral flow Covid test before visiting. For hospitals, the Scottish government is recommending that no more than two people visit a patient at any one time. Meanwhile, on schools, Sturgeon tells MSPs that entire classes are not recommended to isolate when one pupil tests positive. She says a ""key aim"" is for schools to stay open to minimise disruption to learning. You can read more about the changes coming into effect in Scotland here. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting is speaking in the Commons, and opens by saying sincere beliefs are held on all sides, but he hopes the debate on Plan B measures can be worthy of Parliament. He criticises the comparison by one Tory MP of Covid passes to Nazi Germany's policies, saying: ""We are not living in the 1930s and the secretary of state
and his team are not Nazis."" Streeting says the health secretary has a responsibility to protect our NHS and calls the measures ""a necessary response to the Omicron threat"". But he says that confronting the challenges of this winter has been made much harder because we went into the pandemic with record waiting lists, 100,000 unfilled vacancies in the NHS and shortages of care staff. As we've just heard, a number of countries have now been removed from the travel red list, including South Africa. This has come too late for some people who have been forced to quarantine, including Alison Stitt. She was in South Africa visiting her father for his 90th birthday when the country went on the UK's red list. She says it took her days to re-arrange a flight home on a date that a quarantine hotel room was available. They had to stay longer in their Airbnb and re-book their car hire while they waited - on top of extending their car parking and kennels bookings in the UK. Now, she and her husband David are at a hotel near Gatwick. Alison says the total cost of their extended stay in South Africa and their quarantine, has been at least Â£5,500. Speaking to the BBC before all countries were taken off the red list, she said the idea of the travel rules being changed ""has fuelled our argument that this whole fiasco was wrong"". Read more here. ""It was one expense after another. It's all going on credit cards. It was meant to be a budget trip Alison Stitt Sajid Javid has told MPs he is seeking ""urgent advice"" about people currently in quarantine hotels being permitted to leave early. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw asks the health secretary if the government will now release people in isolation in quarantine hotels, given that all 11 African countries are to be removed from the red list. Javid says: ""I am told that the practice in the past has been requiring them to complete their quarantine period. However, I do understand the importance of that. ""I have asked for urgent advice about what this means and I hope to act very quickly on just that."" The health secretary has set out in Parliament the rationale for ending the travel red list, saying that as the new variant is spreading in the UK, travel restrictions are ""now less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad"". The decision means England will no longer require hotel quarantine for travellers from Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Travel rules are set by the four nations of the UK independently, but the other nations' governments often follow proposals from Westminster. Back to Nicola Sturgeon's update, and the first minister says firms in Scotland are being encouraged to bring back physical distancing and screens in shops and hospitality venues. Sturgeon says Scotland is facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. Businesses will have a legal requirement to take practicable measures to minimise the risk of transmission of Covid. In retail, it will involve a return to the kind of protections in place at the start of the pandemic - including physical distancing and measures to control the flow of customers and protective screens. For hospitality, it will mean, measures to avoid crowding at bars and between tables, and a reminder of the requirement to collect contact details of customers to help with contact tracing. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also confirmed that all 11 African countries on the UK's travel red list will be removed from tomorrow. And the minister announced on Twitter that all testing measures for arrivals will remain in place. The rules for England require all travellers to have a pre-arrival negative PCR or lateral flow test taken within the 48 hours before arriving. Arrivals must also self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test. Shapps adds: ""As always, we keep all our travel measures under review and we may impose new restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health."" Allow Twitter content?

"All 11 countries will be taken off England's travel red list from 04:00 GMT on Wednesday, the health secretary announces But testing measures - a pre-arrival negative test and then another PCR test after arrival - remain in place for all travellers Deputy PM Dominic Raab says people in England will be able to spend Christmas in a way they could not last year because of Plan B restrictions MPs are debating the new measures in the Commons today, with a big Tory rebellion expected over Covid passes for some venues In Scotland, people have been asked to limit socialising to three households at a time but this advice will not apply on Christmas day More than half a million people booked booster jabs on Monday and long queues were seen again at some vaccination centres on Tuesday A top South African doctor says the country is mainly seeing ""mild disease"" and intensive care units are not overwhelmed Emma Harrison We're closing our live coverage for the day, so thanks for joining us - we'll be back again tomorrow. Our writers have been Joseph Lee, Alexandra Fouche, Alex Kleiderman and Adam Durbin. The page has been edited by Alex Therrien, Holly Wallis, Emma Harrison and Tiffany Wertheimer. It's been a very busy day with plenty of developments. Here's a round up of the key headlines: And if you're keen to follow the debate and votes over Covid measures in the Commons, our friends and colleagues at BBC Politicshave you covered here.  The hospitality industry is feeling the impact of the new Covid curbs, with pubs and restaurants reporting a wave of Christmas cancellations. The Bar 44 chain tells the BBC 3,200 people have scrapped bookings in December alone across its four outlets in Bristol and Cardiff. Natalie Isaac, the business' operations director, says only a ""handful"" of people would have cancelled before the pandemic. She adds 1,000 of those bookings were lost because of the knock-on effects of cancelled concerts by Tom Jones and the Stereophonics. Others say that although they face no new rules, public caution is causing lower footfall and a loss of trade. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called for the government to provide financial support for businesses affected, but the Treasury has not unveiled any new measures. Read more here. Having to stay open but not getting the business is our big worry. This should be our bumper two weeks before Christmas, but the diary is worryingly empty. We're significantly impacted and without furlough, we won't be able to protect our staff. Natalie Isaac, Operations Director, Bar 44 Boris Johnson visiting a Covid vaccine centre in London yesterday Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed his thanks to people who have queued for booster jabs, No 10 has said. Johnson's official spokesman said the PM was grateful to those who ""queued for hours to get their jabs yesterday"", following theexpansion of the booster rollout to all adults in England. The spokesman adds the government wants to ""go further and faster"" with the rollout. He says: ""You'll have seen that the 15-minute wait has been temporarily paused by the UK chief medical officers. That will allow for significantly more people to go through those vaccination sites. ""It's something that will be very beneficial on the ground and I'll stress that that's been done on clinical advice and safety continues to be our top priority."" There have been long queues at many vaccination centres in England The UK government has reported that 513,722 booster shots were given on Monday, which means that 42% of the population has now been given a third dose - that's more than 24 million people. And as we've been reporting, the booster campaign is in full swing, having been brought forward in response to the Omicron variant. There have been some teething problems, with the NHS website crashing under the strain of so many people trying to book their appointment. In England and Scotland, it's hoped every adult will be able to book a Covid booster before the end of 2021. InEnglanda booster is now available to every adult aged 18 or over - as long as it's at least three months since their second dose. Over-30s can start booking their booster from two months after their second dose (but the appointment dates offered will only be after three months has passed) and from Wednesday, this will be extended to over-18s. There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination centres, but the government has urged people to be ""patient and keep trying, or book online"". Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. A doctor from Cambridge has spoken of the sadness his lab team felt at taking a decision to cancel their Christmas party, despite it being the ""right thing to do"". Prof Stefan Marciniak, a respiratory specialist, tells the BBC it was a ""unanimous decision"" from the whole team to protect the health of their family, friends and the wider community from the spread of the Omicron variant. He says: âSome of us are clinicians and we don't want to contribute to the coming wave that will hit us. ""We also
have responsibilities. If I can't do my ward rounds on Christmas Eve then
someone else has to do that."" Omicron is transmitting extremely quickly and coming into a population with relatively little protection from two doses of vaccine, although boosters appear to have a very good effect in early studies. Prof Stefan Marciniak, Doctor and Professor of Respiratory Science, University of Cambridge Indonesia has become one of the few countries in Asia to start vaccinating children against Covid-19. Those aged six to 11 will now receive China's Sinovac vaccine. Covid vaccinations for children have been a sensitive and sometimes controversial subject around the world. InEurope, the medicines regulator approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's lower-dose vaccine on children aged five to 11 last month, however different countries are approaching it in different ways. For example, one region in Italy is using clowns and jugglers at clinics andFranceandGermanyare targeting only the most vulnerable children.Denmark, on the other hand, has been giving the shots even before the specially-designed vials and syringes have arrived, according to Reuters news agency. In theUK,the government has been advised to offer 12 to 15-year-olds a second jab. Read more: The UK's four chief medical officers have just advised that the waiting period where people are monitored after getting their Pfizer or Moderna Covid jab in case of an allergic reaction should be temporarily suspended. They said scrapping the 15-minute observation period would speed the process up at vaccination centres and allow more people to get boosters. They also said the rates of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) after Covid vaccination are low - around one per 100,000 vaccine doses. Speaking in the Commons just now, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change would help the NHS ""get more jabs in arms more quickly to give people vital protection this winter"". Those who have a history of allergies, particularly to other vaccines, or have had an immediate reaction after previous doses may still be advised to stay for the 15 minutes. The French government is keeping a close eye on the Omicron situation in Britain, and may tighten entry restrictions to those travelling from the UK if the situation worsens, says a French government spokesman. ""We are always looking at means to tighten the framework, we are currently working on that and we should, I think, come to a conclusion in the coming days,"" Gabriel Attal told France Info radio on Tuesday. France is currently in the midst of a fifth coronavirus wave, mostly driven by the Delta variant. There are 133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in France, Mr Attal said. The UK government has updated its daily Covid numbers: Ministers have announced that all countries will be removed from the travel red list in England because the Omicron variant is spreading throughout the UK - but travel testing will remain in place. Now the travel trade body Abta is calling for all restrictions to be lifted. Chief executive Mark Tanzer says: ""The government has always been clear that once the Omicron variant is widespread across the UK there would be little rationale for retaining any restrictions on international travel."" Travel businesses are facing a ""serious situation"" with temporary testing requirements extending over Christmas and the New Year, and into the peak booking period for summer 2022, he says. He adds: ""Consumer confidence in travel has suffered a significant setback, which will outlast these restrictions. The government must acknowledge this by bringing forward grant support to help businesses through the difficult weeks ahead."" As the debate on Plan B measures continues, MPs have been indicating their concerns throughout in interventions. Tory
Alec Shelbrookeasked if variants keep coming, ""how do we avoid debating the same thing in three months or five
months' time?"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid responded that the key is the vaccine, and said the government has struck deals for 114 million more doses that could be adjusted for future variants. In light of the new data on Omicron, Covid passes will require booster jabs
and not just the initial two doses ""as soon as all adults have a reasonable
chance"" of having an extra jab, Javid says. One Tory MP said he is worried about a ""two-tier
system"" and wants the health secretary to assure him negative tests will always be an alternative as part of Covid passes. Javid said: ""This is not a vaccine passport, it is really important that people have a range of options."" ButLib Dem Alistair Carmichaelsaid ""a vaccine

"The government has said that all 11 countries will be removed from the UK's travel red list from 4am on Wednesday. Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe are on the list. The red list was reintroduced in late November as a precaution after the emergence of the Omicron variant. But Health Secretary Sajid Javid said it had spread so widely the rules no longer had much purpose. ""Now that there is community transmission of Omicron in the UK and Omicron has spread so widely across the world, the travel red list is now less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad,"" he told Parliament. ""Whilst we will maintain our temporary testing measures for international travel we will be removing all 11 countries from the travel red list effective from 4am tomorrow morning."" What tests do I need if I travel abroad? All UK arrivals from red list countries are required to pay for and self-isolate in a pre-booked, government-approved hotel for 10 days. But with all 11 countries being removed from that list, it was confirmed that those currently in managed quarantine would be allowed to leave early and ""follow the rules as if they had arrived from a non-red list country"". Some travellers had paid thousands of pounds to stay in government-approved quarantine hotels, with complaints of chaotic organisation and inedible food during their stays. Anyone who has tested positive will to remain in isolation, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Stephen Barclay told the House of Commons. Mr Javid also said earlier he was ""very persuaded"" by calls to reimburse people and hoped to make an announcement on that soon. The point of putting countries on the red list was to act quickly to slow the spread of Omicron. Now it has spread in the community, the government doesn't think putting people from a limited list of countries in hotels is useful. It will be welcome news to people with plans to come to the UK from countries like South Africa and Nigeria, or who had delayed their return from those countries. But it will be frustrating for those who did get caught up in the revival of the red list, which only started about a fortnight ago. Some people who have already paid for hotel stays want to see the government pay their costs. The travel industry wantsallrestrictions removed. Businesses see testing measures as putting a dampener on their recovery. It seems the government is not prepared to go that far, just yet. This will make travel companies, who normally benefit from a holiday booking rush in late December and early January, feel nervous. The move follows anger from African countries, with the UN describing the ban on non-UK residents entering England as ""travel apartheid"". South African Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu said the UK announcement had ""come just in time to allow families and friends to unite over the festive season"". The travel industry had also warned the restrictions were hurting business. Tim Alderslade, head of trade group Airlines UK, said emptying the red list made ""complete sense"" but that the government should also scrap the remaining travel restrictions. Currently all arrivals, regardless of where they fly from, must take Covid tests within 48 hours of setting off for the UK and PCR tests within two days of their arrival. ""If the red list isn't necessary, given that Omicron is established here at home, then neither are the costly emergency testing and isolation measures imposed on even fully vaccinated travellers, which again put us completely at odds with the rest of Europe,"" he said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said these testing measures would be reviewed in the first week of January. ""As always, we keep all our travel measures under review and we may impose new restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health,"" he said on Twitter.

"This video can not be played Sturgeon: 'Limit household mixing to a maximum of three' People in Scotland have been asked to limit socialising to three households at a time in the run-up to Christmas amid concerns over the Omicron variant. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the advice would not apply on Christmas Day and that plans should not be cancelled. But she said people should reduce their social contacts with other households ""as far as possible"". Shops and hospitality venues will also be told to bring back physical distancing and screens. Ms Sturgeon said that Scotland is facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. Live: Nicola Sturgeon updates MSPs on Covid rules Jabs need a major scaling up - but can it be done? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? She said: ""Before and immediately after Christmas, please minimise your social mixing with other households as much as you can. ""However, if you do plan on socialising - either at home or in indoor public places - we are asking that you limit the number of households represented in your group to a maximum of three. And make sure you test before you go."" The first minister stressed that she was not asking anyone to cancel their Christmas plans, and that places of worship would remain open. But she said that people should try to keep their festive celebrations ""as small as your family circumstances allow"" despite the new guidance not applying on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day or Boxing Day. The guidelines on social mixing will not be legally enforceable, but Ms Sturgeon warned: ""Although it is guidance, please do not think of it as optional."" The first minister outlined a series of measures aimed at reducing virus transmission. They include: no more than two people to visit a patient in hospital at any one time visits to care home residents should not involve any more than two households at a time businesses legally required to take steps to reduce the spread of Covid the return of measures to cut down crowding in shops and at bars physical distancing and the use of protective screens inside hospitality venues a legal requirement for employers to enable staff to work from home where possible. However, schools are to remain open, with Ms Sturgeon saying it was a ""key aim to ensure that schools stay open if at all possible to minimise further disruption to education"". The new guidelines will not apply on Christmas Day - but people have been urged to limit their gstherings as much as possible The Scottish government will provide Â£100m of funding to help businesses in hospitality and food supply chains which have been hit by advice to cancel work Christmas parties. And ministers are working to identify new mass vaccination centres as part of a push to offer a booster jab to all adults by the end of the month. Shortly before Ms Sturgeon started speaking, the UK Treasury said it would make extra funding available to devolved governments to accelerate the vaccine rollout and tackle the virus. An additional 100 military personnel have also been made available to accelerate the vaccine rollout in Scotland, bringing the total number to 221. The Omicron variant is believed to be spreading very rapidly in Scotland, with the number of cases doubling every two to three days. The heavily-mutated variant is expected to overtake Delta as the dominant form of the virus this week, with the latest data suggesting it accounts for 27.5% of new cases. The number of people in hospital has dropped by 20 to 541, but the figure now includes two confirmed Omicron cases. Ms Sturgeon said that even if the new strain proves milder than Delta, the fact it spreads much faster could still put ""significant"" pressure on health services. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said there would be ""disappointment"" among firms about the announcement, saying the Â£100m of funding announced ""will not go anywhere near far enough to cover the financial losses being incurred"". And CBI Scotland said the government ""must show the same urgency in addressing the economic consequences of Omicron"", saying ""urgent clarity"" was needed on what physical distancing and crowd control requirements would mean in practice. This package of new rules for businesses and strong guidance to all of us to cut back on social contact is the toughest anywhere in the UK. Nicola Sturgeon argues that however unwelcome, it is necessary to help slow down the spread of Omicron while booster vaccines are speeded up. Unlike thepolitical row over Plan B for England, these new measures for Scotland do not face fierce resistance from the Conservatives or other opposition parties at Holyrood. Instead, they question the detailed arrangements for getting financial support to businesses and accelerating the delivery of Covid jags. Ms Sturgeon said she would have tightened hospitality rules further with financial support from the Treasury. It has now promised extra cash which the first minister disputes is new. While rules on social distancing and other measures for retail and hospitality will be backed up by regulations, the request for reduced social mixing is not. The first minister said that did not make it optional. But it is not without contradiction. How, for instance, do you avoid contact with people from many households if you go to nightclubs which remain open for business? This video can not be played In full: Nicola Sturgeon sets Hogmanay booster target Ms Sturgeon said the new curbs were needed to slow the spread of the virus while the booster vaccine programme is accelerated. A target of offering appointments to all adults has been set for the end of the month, with the first minister saying the goal was to complete 80% of jabs by then and complete the others early in January. Booster appointments will be given priority over the remainder of the flu vaccination programme, and the requirement for people to wait in a vaccine centre for 15 minutes before going home will be dropped. Additional capacity for ""drop in"" jabs is to be added, while ""additional venues"" including new mass vaccination clinics are identified. As well as extra funding to support businesses, the government has added Â£100m to the self isolation support grant fund, with an expected increase in the number of people asked to quarantine. The UK government has confirmed that extra funding will be made available to the devolved administrations to deal with the Omicron variant. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""We are working with the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to drive the vaccine rollout to all corners of the United Kingdom and ensure people and businesses all across the country are supported."" Ms Sturgeon's announcement came shortly before MPs voted on new Covid rules for England which saw nearly 100 Conservatives rebel against Prime Minister Boris Johnson. His proposal to make Covid passes a requirement of entering large venues such as nightclubs - which is already the case in Scotland - has angered many of his own MPs. Despite the rebellion, the measures were passed into law as Labour supported them. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

Natalie Isaac, the business' operations director, says only a ""handful"" of people would have cancelled before the pandemic. She adds 1,000 of those bookings were lost because of the knock-on effects of cancelled concerts by Tom Jones and the Stereophonics. Others say that although they face no new rules, public caution is causing lower footfall and a loss of trade. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called for the government to provide financial support for businesses affected, but the Treasury has not unveiled any new measures. Read more here. Having to stay open but not getting the business is our big worry. This should be our bumper two weeks before Christmas, but the diary is worryingly empty. We're significantly impacted and without furlough, we won't be able to protect our staff. Natalie Isaac, Operations Director, Bar 44 Boris Johnson visiting a Covid vaccine centre in London yesterday Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed his thanks to people who have queued for booster jabs, No 10 has said. Johnson's official spokesman said the PM was grateful to those who ""queued for hours to get their jabs yesterday"", following theexpansion of the booster rollout to all adults in England. The spokesman adds the government wants to ""go further and faster"" with the rollout. He says: ""You'll have seen that the 15-minute wait has been temporarily paused by the UK chief medical officers. That will allow for significantly more people to go through those vaccination sites. ""It's something that will be very beneficial on the ground and I'll stress that that's been done on clinical advice and safety continues to be our top priority."" There have been long queues at many vaccination centres in England The UK government has reported that 513,722 booster shots were given on Monday, which means that 42% of the population has now been given a third dose - that's more than 24 million people. And as we've been reporting, the booster campaign is in full swing, having been brought forward in response to the Omicron variant. There have been some teething problems, with the NHS website crashing under the strain of so many people trying to book their appointment. In England and Scotland, it's hoped every adult will be able to book a Covid booster before the end of 2021. InEnglanda booster is now available to every adult aged 18 or over - as long as it's at least three months since their second dose. Over-30s can start booking their booster from two months after their second dose (but the appointment dates offered will only be after three months has passed) and from Wednesday, this will be extended to over-18s. There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination centres, but the government has urged people to be ""patient and keep trying, or book online"". Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. A doctor from Cambridge has spoken of the sadness his lab team felt at taking a decision to cancel their Christmas party, despite it being the ""right thing to do"". Prof Stefan Marciniak, a respiratory specialist, tells the BBC it was a ""unanimous decision"" from the whole team to protect the health of their family, friends and the wider community from the spread of the Omicron variant. He says: âSome of us are clinicians and we don't want to contribute to the coming wave that will hit us. ""We also
have responsibilities. If I can't do my ward rounds on Christmas Eve then
someone else has to do that."" Omicron is transmitting extremely quickly and coming into a population with relatively little protection from two doses of vaccine, although boosters appear to have a very good effect in early studies. Prof Stefan Marciniak, Doctor and Professor of Respiratory Science, University of Cambridge Indonesia has become one of the few countries in Asia to start vaccinating children against Covid-19. Those aged six to 11 will now receive China's Sinovac vaccine. Covid vaccinations for children have been a sensitive and sometimes controversial subject around the world. InEurope, the medicines regulator approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's lower-dose vaccine on children aged five to 11 last month, however different countries are approaching it in different ways. For example, one region in Italy is using clowns and jugglers at clinics andFranceandGermanyare targeting only the most vulnerable children.Denmark, on the other hand, has been giving the shots even before the specially-designed vials and syringes have arrived, according to Reuters news agency. In theUK,the government has been advised to offer 12 to 15-year-olds a second jab. Read more: The UK's four chief medical officers have just advised that the waiting period where people are monitored after getting their Pfizer or Moderna Covid jab in case of an allergic reaction should be temporarily suspended. They said scrapping the 15-minute observation period would speed the process up at vaccination centres and allow more people to get boosters. They also said the rates of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) after Covid vaccination are low - around one per 100,000 vaccine doses. Speaking in the Commons just now, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change would help the NHS ""get more jabs in arms more quickly to give people vital protection this winter"". Those who have a history of allergies, particularly to other vaccines, or have had an immediate reaction after previous doses may still be advised to stay for the 15 minutes. The French government is keeping a close eye on the Omicron situation in Britain, and may tighten entry restrictions to those travelling from the UK if the situation worsens, says a French government spokesman. ""We are always looking at means to tighten the framework, we are currently working on that and we should, I think, come to a conclusion in the coming days,"" Gabriel Attal told France Info radio on Tuesday. France is currently in the midst of a fifth coronavirus wave, mostly driven by the Delta variant. There are 133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in France, Mr Attal said. The UK government has updated its daily Covid numbers: Ministers have announced that all countries will be removed from the travel red list in England because the Omicron variant is spreading throughout the UK - but travel testing will remain in place. Now the travel trade body Abta is calling for all restrictions to be lifted. Chief executive Mark Tanzer says: ""The government has always been clear that once the Omicron variant is widespread across the UK there would be little rationale for retaining any restrictions on international travel."" Travel businesses are facing a ""serious situation"" with temporary testing requirements extending over Christmas and the New Year, and into the peak booking period for summer 2022, he says. He adds: ""Consumer confidence in travel has suffered a significant setback, which will outlast these restrictions. The government must acknowledge this by bringing forward grant support to help businesses through the difficult weeks ahead."" As the debate on Plan B measures continues, MPs have been indicating their concerns throughout in interventions. Tory
Alec Shelbrookeasked if variants keep coming, ""how do we avoid debating the same thing in three months or five
months' time?"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid responded that the key is the vaccine, and said the government has struck deals for 114 million more doses that could be adjusted for future variants. In light of the new data on Omicron, Covid passes will require booster jabs
and not just the initial two doses ""as soon as all adults have a reasonable
chance"" of having an extra jab, Javid says. One Tory MP said he is worried about a ""two-tier
system"" and wants the health secretary to assure him negative tests will always be an alternative as part of Covid passes. Javid said: ""This is not a vaccine passport, it is really important that people have a range of options."" ButLib Dem Alistair Carmichaelsaid ""a vaccine
passport with a lateral flow option is still a vaccine passport"" and questioned what effect they had had in other parts of the UK, where they have been in place for weeks. Back in the Commons, Labour's Wes Streeting has outlined his party's support for the government's Plan B measures. The shadow health secretary says mask wearing has been ""proven to be effective"" and adds the government should never have lifted the rules in the first place. On Covid passes, Streeting says Labour supports the requirement to have the option to show a negative lateral flow test and argues they are ""not vaccine passports"" as a result. Although the party doesn't support mandatory vaccination in general, he says it will back the measure for health and care workers. But he says the government must do more to persuade them to get jabs voluntarily. Some more details from Nicola Sturgeon's update for Scotland now. Visits to care home residents should not now involve any more than two households at a time, she announces. The new guidance also asks people to do a lateral flow Covid test before visiting. For hospitals, the Scottish government is recommending that no more than two people visit a patient at any one time. Meanwhile, on schools, Sturgeon tells MSPs that entire classes are not recommended to isolate when one pupil tests positive. She says a ""key aim"" is for schools to stay open to minimise disruption to learning. You can read more about the changes coming into effect in Scotland here. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting is speaking in the Commons, and opens by saying sincere beliefs are held on all sides, but he hopes the debate on Plan B measures can be worthy of Parliament. He criticises the comparison by one Tory MP of Covid passes to Nazi Germany's policies, saying: ""We are not living in the 1930s and the secretary of state
and his team are not Nazis."" Streeting says the health secretary has a responsibility to protect our NHS and calls the measures ""a necessary response to the Omicron threat"". But he says that confronting the challenges of this winter has been made much harder because we went into the pandemic with record waiting lists, 100,000 unfilled vacancies in the NHS and shortages of care staff. As we've just heard, a number of countries have now been removed from the travel red list, including South Africa. This has come too late for some people who have been forced to quarantine, including Alison Stitt. She was in South Africa visiting her father for his 90th birthday when the country went on the UK's red list. She says it took her days to re-arrange a flight home on a date that a quarantine hotel room was available. They had to stay longer in their Airbnb and re-book their car hire while they waited - on top of extending their car parking and kennels bookings in the UK. Now, she and her husband David are at a hotel near Gatwick. Alison says the total cost of their extended stay in South Africa and their quarantine, has been at least Â£5,500. Speaking to the BBC before all countries were taken off the red list, she said the idea of the travel rules being changed ""has fuelled our argument that this whole fiasco was wrong"". Read more here. ""It was one expense after another. It's all going on credit cards. It was meant to be a budget trip Alison Stitt Sajid Javid has told MPs he is seeking ""urgent advice"" about people currently in quarantine hotels being permitted to leave early. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw asks the health secretary if the government will now release people in isolation in quarantine hotels, given that all 11 African countries are to be removed from the red list. Javid says: ""I am told that the practice in the past has been requiring them to complete their quarantine period. However, I do understand the importance of that. ""I have asked for urgent advice about what this means and I hope to act very quickly on just that."" The health secretary has set out in Parliament the rationale for ending the travel red list, saying that as the new variant is spreading in the UK, travel restrictions are ""now less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad"". The decision means England will no longer require hotel quarantine for travellers from Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Travel rules are set by the four nations of the UK independently, but the other nations' governments often follow proposals from Westminster. Back to Nicola Sturgeon's update, and the first minister says firms in Scotland are being encouraged to bring back physical distancing and screens in shops and hospitality venues. Sturgeon says Scotland is facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. Businesses will have a legal requirement to take practicable measures to minimise the risk of transmission of Covid. In retail, it will involve a return to the kind of protections in place at the start of the pandemic - including physical distancing and measures to control the flow of customers and protective screens. For hospitality, it will mean, measures to avoid crowding at bars and between tables, and a reminder of the requirement to collect contact details of customers to help with contact tracing. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also confirmed that all 11 African countries on the UK's travel red list will be removed from tomorrow. And the minister announced on Twitter that all testing measures for arrivals will remain in place. The rules for England require all travellers to have a pre-arrival negative PCR or lateral flow test taken within the 48 hours before arriving. Arrivals must also self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test. Shapps adds: ""As always, we keep all our travel measures under review and we may impose new restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health."" Allow Twitter content?

"New guidelines on social contact are expected to be outlined by Scotland's first minister on Tuesday afternoon. BBC Scotland political editor Glenn Campbell said this could include advice on how many other people or households you should meet in one day. The limits are expected to be advice rather than law - and there could be exceptions around Christmas. There is not expected to be any extension to the vaccine passport scheme at this stage. That is because the passports only show that a person has had two vaccine doses, which offers limited protection against Omicron. But there may be a request to shops and places of worship to improve social distancing and other safety measures. And advice that has already been issued around taking regular tests, working from home where possible and putting off work Christmas parties may be extended. Follow Nicola Sturgeon's statement to Holyrood from 14:05 Jabs need a major scaling up - but can it be done? Why do boosters work if two doses struggle? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? The Scottish government has been looking at measures that Ireland has already put in place, which say that no more than four households should gather together in someone's home. Both the UK and Scottish governments are aiming to offer Covid booster vaccine appointments to all over-18s by the end of the year. The booster shot gives peoplefar greater protectionagainst the heavily-mutated Omicron variant than two vaccine doses alone. Nicola Sturgeon has made clear she wants to slow down the spread of the Omicron variant while the booster programme is being ramped up, with Health Secretary Humza Yousaf saying that new restrictions were ""inevitable"". Ms Sturgeon will unveil the new measures in the Scottish Parliament this afternoon Ms Sturgeon will host a meeting of her cabinet this morning to agree the new measures, before announcing them in the Scottish Parliament at about 14:05 this afternoon. She has already rejected calls from a teaching union to close schools early for the Christmas holidays, saying the priority was to keep them open safely. Speaking in advance of the statement, Ms Sturgeon said that there may be ""targeted and proportionate"" measures introduced as a trade-off for allowing families to meet at Christmas. She added: ""We need to try to protect peoples' ability to spend Christmas with their families, and I am personally hoping for a more normal Christmas than last year on behalf of everybody across the country. ""But we need to balance that with the need to keep people as safe as possible in the run up to, and throughout, the winter and into 2022"". A total of 186 cases of the Omicron variant have been confirmed across Scotland so far, although this is thought to be a significant under-estimate of the true picture. What are the Covid rules in Scotland? The UK's first death linked to the new variant was reported on Monday, and case numbers in Scotland are thought to be doubling every two to three days. Omicron is expected to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus this week. Julie Ashworth, who chairs Edinburgh branch of the Institute of Directors, said the Scottish government should set out clear and definitive measures in response to Omicron rather than attempting to introduce ""lockdown by stealth"". She added: ""What is happening is customers are filling in the gaps in terms of guidance. ""It means that all businesses across all sectors are impacted by that, particularly hospitality, travel, retail and smaller businesses - customers are staying away and being cautious. ""What we're seeing because of that lack of clarity is that both trade and customer sentiment is being hurt."" It comes as MPs prepare to vote on new Covid rules for England later, with about 70 Conservatives expected to rebel against Prime Minister Boris Johnson. His proposal to make Covid passes a requirement of entering large venues such as nightclubs - which is already the case in Scotland - has angered many of his own MPs. The measures are still likely to pass as Labour says it will support them.ó ¢ó ³ó £ó ´ó ¿ Do you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland?

"In a series of Commons votes, MPs have backed the government's Plan B measures aimed at tackling the Omicron variant of coronavirus MPs voted to approve changing the rules on mask wearing and self-isolation - the system is replaced by daily lateral flow tests The introduction of Covid passes for large venues passes by 369 votes to 126 Nearly 100 Conservative MPs voted against the regulations The measure requires people to show proof of vaccination or a negative test to enter some venues Backbencher Sir Charles Walker said the rebellion was a ""cry of pain"" by the party Boris Johnson described the plan as ""balanced and proportionate"" in light of the new Omicron variant Edited by Rob Corp That's it from us today - thanks for following our live coverage of today's Commons debate on new Covid regulations for England. The live page was written by Becky Morton, Jennifer Scott and Justin Parkinson, with correspondent analysis by Iain Watson. The editor was Rob Corp. You can keep up to date with any developments by readingour main story. It's been a dramatic evening here in Westminster, with Boris Johnsonfacing his biggest rebellion since becoming prime minister. Here's what happened: The House of Commons official photographer has been in the chamber capturing some of the key moments of the debate today. Here are some of the best shots, as MPs consider the government's proposals to introduce its Plan B Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Sajid Javid faced many interventions from his fellow Tory MPs over the votes, with many expressing their intention to vote against the government Javid set out the reasons the government intended to move to Plan B as debate opened The health secretary's tough reception was not just from his own side of the House, the opposition benches also had some words for him Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting outlined the Labour Party's support for the government, which is expected to allow the votes to proceed despite a significant Tory rebellion Louie French was elected less than two weeks ago The Conservative Party's newest MP was among those to vote against the introduction of mandatory Covid passes. Louie French, who won the Old Bexley and Sidcup by-election less than two weeks ago, said he did so to fulfil an election pledge. He wrote on Twitter: ""I fully support the booster rollout and I will get mine ASAP thanks to the efforts of the government, NHS, pharmacies, Army and volunteers. ""But, I made a clear pre-election pledge that I would not support Covid passes for our domestic economy and voted accordingly."" Some more news on the last Covid-related vote of the evening, on compulsory vaccinations for frontline NHS staff in England. Sixty-three Tory MPs rebelled against the government. This is the second biggest Conservative rebellion - after the one on Covid venue passes earlier tonight - since Boris Johnson became prime minister. Reacting to the Conservative rebellion, Scotland's first minister says it makes ""all UK nations less safe"". Nicola Sturgeon writes on Twitter,external: ""Under current funding arrangements, without responsible public health protections in England, there's no financial provision for such protections in Scotland, Wales or NI. ""It's a big problem in [the] face of this Covid challenge."" Nations have the power to set their own Covid regulations but overall funding for public services is allocated from central government under the Barnett formula. The formula means funding is adjusted based on comparable spending per person in England. Earlier today,people in Scotland were asked to limit socialising to three households at a timein the run-up to Christmas. It seems the numbers who voted in the Commons division on Covid passes might not be complete yet. The official division list - recording who voted for and against - shows only 123 of the MPs who opposed the government. The result in the Commons said 126 went this way. Anyway, as it stands, 96 Tory MPs defied the government, while two acted as tellers - vote counters - meaning they felt the same way but weren't counted themselves. Eight Labour MPs, 10 Liberal Democrats, six DUP, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Independent MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Rob Roberts also opposed the regulations. We'll try to find out about the other three, Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent They tried to persuade. They tried to cajole. Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed a packed meeting of backbench
MPs, setting out the risks posed by the new Covid variant. Professor Chris Whitty, Englandâs chief medical
officer, briefed MPs too  - telling them to expect a significant
increase in hospitalisations. But plenty of Conservative rebels - nearly 100 - simply
werenât for turning. That far outstrips the 55 MPs who voted against the Covid
tier system â remember that? â last year. It says a lot about the scepticism towards Covid passports But it also highlights a significant and growing gap between
the government and its backbenchers. And it suggests that, after weeks of negative headlines, the prime ministerâs authority has been seriously eroded - just as the country faces the next Covid crisis. Many Conservatives seem to have heeded the call
from former chief whip Mark Harper to use the vote to force the government
to show more respect for MPs. He is pressing for a recall of Parliament over Christmas, should the prime minister feel itâs necessary to introduce further
restrictions. Whether todayâs show of force from the back benches makes a
recall likely â or something Boris Johnson would want to avoid at all costs â
remains to be seen. The hope of many rebels is that the prime minister will
instead feel he can now go no further than Plan B. Itâs clear the mood on the Conservative benches is restless,
to say the least. All eyes at Westminster will be on Thursdayâs North Shropshire
by-election, as Conservative MPs openly mull over whether their big
electoral asset in 2019 - Johnson â has turned in to a liability. A body representing nightclubs says it is ""disappointed"" MPs have approved plans to make Covid passes mandatory for large venues. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, says his organisation has consistently opposed Covid passes because of the ""logistical challenges they pose"". ""It is very disappointing that, after flip-flopping on the
issue twice, the government have decided to press ahead with the plans despite
no evidence of their impact on transmission of the virus,"" he says. âThis is a slippery path we are
going down. I would urge the government to listen to its backbenchers now â
this far and no further.â If more restrictions are introduced, Kill says there must be a ""proportionate support package including a return of the furlough scheme"". Charles Walker, one of the 98 Tory MPs to rebel against the government on Covid passes, says the prime minister still has ""huge support"" but ""this was just a bridge too far"". âIt was a cry of pain from the Conservative Party,"" he tells the BBC. However, Walker says he does not believe the rebellion calls into question the PM's ability to persuade his own MPs over the things he wants to do. The Tory MP says many colleagues were ""holding their nose"" when voting for mandatory Covid passes and the prime minister and his team ""need to listen"". ""The mood has changed"" and backbench views on further restrictions ""are hardening"", he adds. Some figures are in. Ninety-eight Conservative MPs rebelled against the government over Covid passes in England. That's by far the biggest such act of defiance by his own troops since Boris Johnson became PM. Also, eight Labour MPs rebelled against their own front bench to oppose the plan - Sir Keir Starmer had ordered them to support it.  After several hours of debate, the government's proposals for tackling the Omicron variant in England have been approved by MPs - albeit with a significant rebellion by some Tories. Here's what they voted for: The result of the final vote is in, with the government's plans to make Covid vaccinations compulsory for front-line NHS workers in England passing by 385 votes to 100. So all the measures got through, one without a vote and the others by varying margins. Forty Conservative MPs rebelled  against government plans to make face coverings compulsory in most indoor settings. Thirty-eight Tories voted against the plans, while a further two who were opposed acted as tellers. A further three DUP MPs also voted against. Labour's whips office is suggesting that 101 Conservative MPs rebelled against the government on Covid passes for large venues in England. We'll have the full figures as soon as possible. The previous biggest rebellion against Boris Johnson's government involved 59 Tory MPs. And now for the final Commons vote this evening, on whether front-line NHS staff in England should be compelled to be vaccinated for Covid. Like the other measures, this is expected to pass easily, but the size of any Tory rebellion will be closely watched. It looks like there was a big one in the previous vote, on Covid passes for entry to large venues. The House of Commons backs the government's plan to introduce Covid passes - or passports - for entry to large venues in England, such as nightclubs, by 369 votes to 126. The Labour leadership supported the move, but the Liberal Democrats and many on Boris Johnson's own Conservative benches opposed it. MPs have unanimously voted to approve changing the rules so that vaccinated people who come into contact with suspected Omicron cases will no longer have to self-isolate. Anyone coming into contact with Covid cases of any kind will be""strongly advised"" to take lateral flow tests,externalfor seven days. Right, MPs are filing out for the second of tonight's votes. This time it's the one where the biggest Tory rebellion is expected - on whether to introduce a Covid pass - called a ""passport"" by many - to allow access to nightclubs and other sizeable venues. Another motion, on isolation, got through ""on the nod"" - that is, without opposition in the Commons chamber. Regulations making wearing face masks compulsory in most indoor settings, except for pubs and restaurants, have been approved by MPs. The government wins by 441 votes to 41. Â© 2025 BBC.

Our writers have been Joseph Lee, Alexandra Fouche, Alex Kleiderman and Adam Durbin. The page has been edited by Alex Therrien, Holly Wallis, Emma Harrison and Tiffany Wertheimer. It's been a very busy day with plenty of developments. Here's a round up of the key headlines: And if you're keen to follow the debate and votes over Covid measures in the Commons, our friends and colleagues at BBC Politicshave you covered here.  The hospitality industry is feeling the impact of the new Covid curbs, with pubs and restaurants reporting a wave of Christmas cancellations. The Bar 44 chain tells the BBC 3,200 people have scrapped bookings in December alone across its four outlets in Bristol and Cardiff. Natalie Isaac, the business' operations director, says only a ""handful"" of people would have cancelled before the pandemic. She adds 1,000 of those bookings were lost because of the knock-on effects of cancelled concerts by Tom Jones and the Stereophonics. Others say that although they face no new rules, public caution is causing lower footfall and a loss of trade. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called for the government to provide financial support for businesses affected, but the Treasury has not unveiled any new measures. Read more here. Having to stay open but not getting the business is our big worry. This should be our bumper two weeks before Christmas, but the diary is worryingly empty. We're significantly impacted and without furlough, we won't be able to protect our staff. Natalie Isaac, Operations Director, Bar 44 Boris Johnson visiting a Covid vaccine centre in London yesterday Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed his thanks to people who have queued for booster jabs, No 10 has said. Johnson's official spokesman said the PM was grateful to those who ""queued for hours to get their jabs yesterday"", following theexpansion of the booster rollout to all adults in England. The spokesman adds the government wants to ""go further and faster"" with the rollout. He says: ""You'll have seen that the 15-minute wait has been temporarily paused by the UK chief medical officers. That will allow for significantly more people to go through those vaccination sites. ""It's something that will be very beneficial on the ground and I'll stress that that's been done on clinical advice and safety continues to be our top priority."" There have been long queues at many vaccination centres in England The UK government has reported that 513,722 booster shots were given on Monday, which means that 42% of the population has now been given a third dose - that's more than 24 million people. And as we've been reporting, the booster campaign is in full swing, having been brought forward in response to the Omicron variant. There have been some teething problems, with the NHS website crashing under the strain of so many people trying to book their appointment. In England and Scotland, it's hoped every adult will be able to book a Covid booster before the end of 2021. InEnglanda booster is now available to every adult aged 18 or over - as long as it's at least three months since their second dose. Over-30s can start booking their booster from two months after their second dose (but the appointment dates offered will only be after three months has passed) and from Wednesday, this will be extended to over-18s. There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination centres, but the government has urged people to be ""patient and keep trying, or book online"". Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. A doctor from Cambridge has spoken of the sadness his lab team felt at taking a decision to cancel their Christmas party, despite it being the ""right thing to do"". Prof Stefan Marciniak, a respiratory specialist, tells the BBC it was a ""unanimous decision"" from the whole team to protect the health of their family, friends and the wider community from the spread of the Omicron variant. He says: âSome of us are clinicians and we don't want to contribute to the coming wave that will hit us. ""We also
have responsibilities. If I can't do my ward rounds on Christmas Eve then
someone else has to do that."" Omicron is transmitting extremely quickly and coming into a population with relatively little protection from two doses of vaccine, although boosters appear to have a very good effect in early studies. Prof Stefan Marciniak, Doctor and Professor of Respiratory Science, University of Cambridge Indonesia has become one of the few countries in Asia to start vaccinating children against Covid-19. Those aged six to 11 will now receive China's Sinovac vaccine. Covid vaccinations for children have been a sensitive and sometimes controversial subject around the world. InEurope, the medicines regulator approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's lower-dose vaccine on children aged five to 11 last month, however different countries are approaching it in different ways. For example, one region in Italy is using clowns and jugglers at clinics andFranceandGermanyare targeting only the most vulnerable children.Denmark, on the other hand, has been giving the shots even before the specially-designed vials and syringes have arrived, according to Reuters news agency. In theUK,the government has been advised to offer 12 to 15-year-olds a second jab. Read more: The UK's four chief medical officers have just advised that the waiting period where people are monitored after getting their Pfizer or Moderna Covid jab in case of an allergic reaction should be temporarily suspended. They said scrapping the 15-minute observation period would speed the process up at vaccination centres and allow more people to get boosters. They also said the rates of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) after Covid vaccination are low - around one per 100,000 vaccine doses. Speaking in the Commons just now, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change would help the NHS ""get more jabs in arms more quickly to give people vital protection this winter"". Those who have a history of allergies, particularly to other vaccines, or have had an immediate reaction after previous doses may still be advised to stay for the 15 minutes. The French government is keeping a close eye on the Omicron situation in Britain, and may tighten entry restrictions to those travelling from the UK if the situation worsens, says a French government spokesman. ""We are always looking at means to tighten the framework, we are currently working on that and we should, I think, come to a conclusion in the coming days,"" Gabriel Attal told France Info radio on Tuesday. France is currently in the midst of a fifth coronavirus wave, mostly driven by the Delta variant. There are 133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in France, Mr Attal said. The UK government has updated its daily Covid numbers: Ministers have announced that all countries will be removed from the travel red list in England because the Omicron variant is spreading throughout the UK - but travel testing will remain in place. Now the travel trade body Abta is calling for all restrictions to be lifted. Chief executive Mark Tanzer says: ""The government has always been clear that once the Omicron variant is widespread across the UK there would be little rationale for retaining any restrictions on international travel."" Travel businesses are facing a ""serious situation"" with temporary testing requirements extending over Christmas and the New Year, and into the peak booking period for summer 2022, he says. He adds: ""Consumer confidence in travel has suffered a significant setback, which will outlast these restrictions. The government must acknowledge this by bringing forward grant support to help businesses through the difficult weeks ahead."" As the debate on Plan B measures continues, MPs have been indicating their concerns throughout in interventions. Tory
Alec Shelbrookeasked if variants keep coming, ""how do we avoid debating the same thing in three months or five
months' time?"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid responded that the key is the vaccine, and said the government has struck deals for 114 million more doses that could be adjusted for future variants. In light of the new data on Omicron, Covid passes will require booster jabs
and not just the initial two doses ""as soon as all adults have a reasonable
chance"" of having an extra jab, Javid says. One Tory MP said he is worried about a ""two-tier
system"" and wants the health secretary to assure him negative tests will always be an alternative as part of Covid passes. Javid said: ""This is not a vaccine passport, it is really important that people have a range of options."" ButLib Dem Alistair Carmichaelsaid ""a vaccine
passport with a lateral flow option is still a vaccine passport"" and questioned what effect they had had in other parts of the UK, where they have been in place for weeks. Back in the Commons, Labour's Wes Streeting has outlined his party's support for the government's Plan B measures. The shadow health secretary says mask wearing has been ""proven to be effective"" and adds the government should never have lifted the rules in the first place. On Covid passes, Streeting says Labour supports the requirement to have the option to show a negative lateral flow test and argues they are ""not vaccine passports"" as a result. Although the party doesn't support mandatory vaccination in general, he says it will back the measure for health and care workers. But he says the government must do more to persuade them to get jabs voluntarily. Some more details from Nicola Sturgeon's update for Scotland now. Visits to care home residents should not now involve any more than two households at a time, she announces. The new guidance also asks people to do a lateral flow Covid test before visiting. For hospitals, the Scottish government is recommending that no more than two people visit a patient at any one time. Meanwhile, on schools, Sturgeon tells MSPs that entire classes are not recommended to isolate when one pupil tests positive. She says a ""key aim"" is for schools to stay open to minimise disruption to learning. You can read more about the changes coming into effect in Scotland here. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting is speaking in the Commons, and opens by saying sincere beliefs are held on all sides, but he hopes the debate on Plan B measures can be worthy of Parliament. He criticises the comparison by one Tory MP of Covid passes to Nazi Germany's policies, saying: ""We are not living in the 1930s and the secretary of state
and his team are not Nazis."" Streeting says the health secretary has a responsibility to protect our NHS and calls the measures ""a necessary response to the Omicron threat"". But he says that confronting the challenges of this winter has been made much harder because we went into the pandemic with record waiting lists, 100,000 unfilled vacancies in the NHS and shortages of care staff. As we've just heard, a number of countries have now been removed from the travel red list, including South Africa. This has come too late for some people who have been forced to quarantine, including Alison Stitt. She was in South Africa visiting her father for his 90th birthday when the country went on the UK's red list. She says it took her days to re-arrange a flight home on a date that a quarantine hotel room was available. They had to stay longer in their Airbnb and re-book their car hire while they waited - on top of extending their car parking and kennels bookings in the UK. Now, she and her husband David are at a hotel near Gatwick. Alison says the total cost of their extended stay in South Africa and their quarantine, has been at least Â£5,500. Speaking to the BBC before all countries were taken off the red list, she said the idea of the travel rules being changed ""has fuelled our argument that this whole fiasco was wrong"". Read more here. ""It was one expense after another. It's all going on credit cards. It was meant to be a budget trip Alison Stitt Sajid Javid has told MPs he is seeking ""urgent advice"" about people currently in quarantine hotels being permitted to leave early. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw asks the health secretary if the government will now release people in isolation in quarantine hotels, given that all 11 African countries are to be removed from the red list. Javid says: ""I am told that the practice in the past has been requiring them to complete their quarantine period. However, I do understand the importance of that. ""I have asked for urgent advice about what this means and I hope to act very quickly on just that."" The health secretary has set out in Parliament the rationale for ending the travel red list, saying that as the new variant is spreading in the UK, travel restrictions are ""now less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad"". The decision means England will no longer require hotel quarantine for travellers from Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Travel rules are set by the four nations of the UK independently, but the other nations' governments often follow proposals from Westminster. Back to Nicola Sturgeon's update, and the first minister says firms in Scotland are being encouraged to bring back physical distancing and screens in shops and hospitality venues. Sturgeon says Scotland is facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. Businesses will have a legal requirement to take practicable measures to minimise the risk of transmission of Covid. In retail, it will involve a return to the kind of protections in place at the start of the pandemic - including physical distancing and measures to control the flow of customers and protective screens. For hospitality, it will mean, measures to avoid crowding at bars and between tables, and a reminder of the requirement to collect contact details of customers to help with contact tracing. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also confirmed that all 11 African countries on the UK's travel red list will be removed from tomorrow. And the minister announced on Twitter that all testing measures for arrivals will remain in place. The rules for England require all travellers to have a pre-arrival negative PCR or lateral flow test taken within the 48 hours before arriving. Arrivals must also self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test. Shapps adds: ""As always, we keep all our travel measures under review and we may impose new restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health."" Allow Twitter content?

"All 11 countries will be taken off England's travel red list from 04:00 GMT on Wednesday, the health secretary announces But testing measures - a pre-arrival negative test and then another PCR test after arrival - remain in place for all travellers Deputy PM Dominic Raab says people in England will be able to spend Christmas in a way they could not last year because of Plan B restrictions MPs are debating the new measures in the Commons today, with a big Tory rebellion expected over Covid passes for some venues In Scotland, people have been asked to limit socialising to three households at a time but this advice will not apply on Christmas day More than half a million people booked booster jabs on Monday and long queues were seen again at some vaccination centres on Tuesday A top South African doctor says the country is mainly seeing ""mild disease"" and intensive care units are not overwhelmed Emma Harrison We're closing our live coverage for the day, so thanks for joining us - we'll be back again tomorrow. Our writers have been Joseph Lee, Alexandra Fouche, Alex Kleiderman and Adam Durbin. The page has been edited by Alex Therrien, Holly Wallis, Emma Harrison and Tiffany Wertheimer. It's been a very busy day with plenty of developments. Here's a round up of the key headlines: And if you're keen to follow the debate and votes over Covid measures in the Commons, our friends and colleagues at BBC Politicshave you covered here.  The hospitality industry is feeling the impact of the new Covid curbs, with pubs and restaurants reporting a wave of Christmas cancellations. The Bar 44 chain tells the BBC 3,200 people have scrapped bookings in December alone across its four outlets in Bristol and Cardiff. Natalie Isaac, the business' operations director, says only a ""handful"" of people would have cancelled before the pandemic. She adds 1,000 of those bookings were lost because of the knock-on effects of cancelled concerts by Tom Jones and the Stereophonics. Others say that although they face no new rules, public caution is causing lower footfall and a loss of trade. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called for the government to provide financial support for businesses affected, but the Treasury has not unveiled any new measures. Read more here. Having to stay open but not getting the business is our big worry. This should be our bumper two weeks before Christmas, but the diary is worryingly empty. We're significantly impacted and without furlough, we won't be able to protect our staff. Natalie Isaac, Operations Director, Bar 44 Boris Johnson visiting a Covid vaccine centre in London yesterday Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed his thanks to people who have queued for booster jabs, No 10 has said. Johnson's official spokesman said the PM was grateful to those who ""queued for hours to get their jabs yesterday"", following theexpansion of the booster rollout to all adults in England. The spokesman adds the government wants to ""go further and faster"" with the rollout. He says: ""You'll have seen that the 15-minute wait has been temporarily paused by the UK chief medical officers. That will allow for significantly more people to go through those vaccination sites. ""It's something that will be very beneficial on the ground and I'll stress that that's been done on clinical advice and safety continues to be our top priority."" There have been long queues at many vaccination centres in England The UK government has reported that 513,722 booster shots were given on Monday, which means that 42% of the population has now been given a third dose - that's more than 24 million people. And as we've been reporting, the booster campaign is in full swing, having been brought forward in response to the Omicron variant. There have been some teething problems, with the NHS website crashing under the strain of so many people trying to book their appointment. In England and Scotland, it's hoped every adult will be able to book a Covid booster before the end of 2021. InEnglanda booster is now available to every adult aged 18 or over - as long as it's at least three months since their second dose. Over-30s can start booking their booster from two months after their second dose (but the appointment dates offered will only be after three months has passed) and from Wednesday, this will be extended to over-18s. There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination centres, but the government has urged people to be ""patient and keep trying, or book online"". Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. A doctor from Cambridge has spoken of the sadness his lab team felt at taking a decision to cancel their Christmas party, despite it being the ""right thing to do"". Prof Stefan Marciniak, a respiratory specialist, tells the BBC it was a ""unanimous decision"" from the whole team to protect the health of their family, friends and the wider community from the spread of the Omicron variant. He says: âSome of us are clinicians and we don't want to contribute to the coming wave that will hit us. ""We also
have responsibilities. If I can't do my ward rounds on Christmas Eve then
someone else has to do that.""

"The temporary lack of in-person PCR tests in England on Tuesday was due to exceptionally high demand, UK Health Security Agency sources say. While home testing kits remained available, the UK's official booking website briefly showed no appointments available anywhere in England. However, more time slots have since been released to cope with demand. PCR tests are required for people who have Covid symptoms or who have tested positive on a lateral flow test. As the testing slots ran out, a statement on the booking website read: ""If you cannot get a test now, try again later. You will not be able to get a test through the helplines."" PCR tests are now once again available at testing sites in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But there are still none listed as available in London, Hertfordshire, Suffolk, the Isle of Wight, Bristol, and Mendip - while there are ""very few"" in Stockton-on-Tees. How do I book my vaccine booster? How do I get a lateral flow or PCR Covid test? On Monday, the ordering of lateral flow test kits from the government website was also temporarily suspended - again due to high demand - while members of the public complained of waiting for hours in online queues for the chance to book a Covid vaccine appointment. Downing Street said ministers were working with Royal Mail and Amazon to ensure more lateral flow tests can be delivered. The surge in demand for both tests and vaccines comes as the UK battles to slow the spread of the Omicron variant in the run-up to Christmas. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all over-18s across the UK will be offered the chance to get a booster jab before the end of the month, while MPs are set to vote later on a raft of new restrictions for England, some of which are already in effect. Under the new rules: Face coverings are compulsory in most indoor public venues, including theatres and cinemas - as well as on public transport and in places like shops and hairdressers People should work from home ""if they can"" Daily lateral flow testing for seven days is required for fully-vaccinated people who are contacts of positive Covid cases From Wednesday, some venues and events would be legally required to check the Covid status of visitors During the Commons debate on the new rules, Health Secretary Sajid Javid described Omicron as a ""grave threat"", adding scientists ""have never seen a variant capable of spreading so rapidly"" and the government needed to slow its advance. However, due to the widespread prevalence of Omicron internationally, England's travel red list, which restricts travel to certain countries, will cease to exist from Wednesday at 04:00 GMT, Mr Javid said. Monday saw online booster jab bookings open for people aged 30 and over - a day after the prime minister announced an expansion to the rollout amid the ""Omicron emergency"". People aged 18 to 29 will be able to book their booster jabs online from Wednesday. More than 500,000 people booked a vaccine appointment online on Monday, while others queued up at walk-in centres across the country. Modelling by the UKHSA estimates the current number of daily Omicron infections is around 200,000, and Dr Susan Hopkins, its chief medical adviser, has said the growth rate of Omicron seems to be ""shortening rather than lengthening"". ""We have been studying this virus for three weeks today and in that time period we have shown that in the UK this is growing very fast, with a growth rate initially two to three days and that growth rate seems to be shortening, rather than lengthening at the moment,"" she told the Science and Technology Committee of MPs. UK expected to remove 11 countries from red list Why do boosters work if two doses struggle? The latest official figures show there are 4,713 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant, with 10 people, aged between 18 and 85, hospitalised with the variant in England. However, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab caused confusion on Tuesday when he told Sky News there were 250 Omicron cases in hospital, then immediately afterwards told the BBC there were nine cases. When contacted by the BBC, the UKHSA said neither answer was right, and the actual number was still 10. The PM's official spokesman said ministers had been told by England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, that a ""significant increase in hospitalisations"" from Omicron is expected. But the spokesman added it was still ""too early to say"" how severe the illness caused by the Omicron variant is. Who can get an NHS Covid jab this autumn?

"A number of positive Covid-19 results were recorded at Manchester United on Sunday morning after Saturday's win at Norwich Manchester United's Premier League match against Brentford on Tuesday night has been postponed after a Covid-19 outbreak at the Old Trafford club. The league says the decision was made ""following guidance from medical advisers due to the exceptional circumstances"" of the outbreak. Earlier, Unitedshut down operationsat their Carrington training ground to minimise the risk of infection. In the past week42 Premier League players and staffhave tested positive. Brighton, Tottenham, Leicester, Aston Villa and Norwich have all confirmed cases and Sunday's Brighton v Tottenham fixture was postponed following a Covid-19 outbreak at Spurs. United say positive cases among staff and players reported on Sunday have been confirmed by PCR tests and the outbreak ""requires ongoing surveillance"". All of Manchester United's players tested negative before Saturday's 1-0 win at Norwich, but some tested positive before training on Sunday morning. ""Given cancellation of training and disruption to the squad, and with the health of players and staff the priority, the club requested the match to be rearranged,"" United said in a statement released at 23:50 GMT on Monday. ""The Premier League Board took the decision to postpone based on guidance from medical advisors."" The league says the fixture, due to have been played at 19:30 GMT, will be rearranged ""in due course"". Brentford apologised to their fans for the ""disruption"" but they ""respect"" the decision, adding the ""health and safety of both clubs' players and staff must always come first"". The latest positive cases in the league are the highest recorded in a seven-day period since testing began in May 2020. On Thursday, following the introduction of new coronavirus rules in England to limit the spread of Omicron, the Premier League told clubs to return to emergency measures, including social distancing and wearing masks. A league statement on Monday said the frequency of lateral flow and PCR tests for players and staff would increase. Last season, Newcastle United's game at Aston Villa in the Premier League was postponed following a ""significant increase"" in Covid-19 cases at the Magpies' training ground. Later that month, a coronavirus outbreak at Manchester City caused their Premier League match at Everton to be postponed four hours before kick-off. Villa also had a Covid-19 outbreak in January, which meant no first-team players were available for an FA Cup third-round defeat by Liverpool, while Premier League games against Everton and Tottenham were then rescheduled.

"All 11 countries will be taken off England's travel red list from 04:00 GMT on Wednesday, the health secretary announces But testing measures - a pre-arrival negative test and then another PCR test after arrival - remain in place for all travellers Deputy PM Dominic Raab says people in England will be able to spend Christmas in a way they could not last year because of Plan B restrictions MPs are debating the new measures in the Commons today, with a big Tory rebellion expected over Covid passes for some venues In Scotland, people have been asked to limit socialising to three households at a time but this advice will not apply on Christmas day More than half a million people booked booster jabs on Monday and long queues were seen again at some vaccination centres on Tuesday A top South African doctor says the country is mainly seeing ""mild disease"" and intensive care units are not overwhelmed Emma Harrison We're closing our live coverage for the day, so thanks for joining us - we'll be back again tomorrow. Our writers have been Joseph Lee, Alexandra Fouche, Alex Kleiderman and Adam Durbin. The page has been edited by Alex Therrien, Holly Wallis, Emma Harrison and Tiffany Wertheimer. It's been a very busy day with plenty of developments. Here's a round up of the key headlines: And if you're keen to follow the debate and votes over Covid measures in the Commons, our friends and colleagues at BBC Politicshave you covered here.  The hospitality industry is feeling the impact of the new Covid curbs, with pubs and restaurants reporting a wave of Christmas cancellations. The Bar 44 chain tells the BBC 3,200 people have scrapped bookings in December alone across its four outlets in Bristol and Cardiff. Natalie Isaac, the business' operations director, says only a ""handful"" of people would have cancelled before the pandemic. She adds 1,000 of those bookings were lost because of the knock-on effects of cancelled concerts by Tom Jones and the Stereophonics. Others say that although they face no new rules, public caution is causing lower footfall and a loss of trade. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called for the government to provide financial support for businesses affected, but the Treasury has not unveiled any new measures. Read more here. Having to stay open but not getting the business is our big worry. This should be our bumper two weeks before Christmas, but the diary is worryingly empty. We're significantly impacted and without furlough, we won't be able to protect our staff. Natalie Isaac, Operations Director, Bar 44 Boris Johnson visiting a Covid vaccine centre in London yesterday Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed his thanks to people who have queued for booster jabs, No 10 has said. Johnson's official spokesman said the PM was grateful to those who ""queued for hours to get their jabs yesterday"", following theexpansion of the booster rollout to all adults in England. The spokesman adds the government wants to ""go further and faster"" with the rollout. He says: ""You'll have seen that the 15-minute wait has been temporarily paused by the UK chief medical officers. That will allow for significantly more people to go through those vaccination sites. ""It's something that will be very beneficial on the ground and I'll stress that that's been done on clinical advice and safety continues to be our top priority."" There have been long queues at many vaccination centres in England The UK government has reported that 513,722 booster shots were given on Monday, which means that 42% of the population has now been given a third dose - that's more than 24 million people. And as we've been reporting, the booster campaign is in full swing, having been brought forward in response to the Omicron variant. There have been some teething problems, with the NHS website crashing under the strain of so many people trying to book their appointment. In England and Scotland, it's hoped every adult will be able to book a Covid booster before the end of 2021. InEnglanda booster is now available to every adult aged 18 or over - as long as it's at least three months since their second dose. Over-30s can start booking their booster from two months after their second dose (but the appointment dates offered will only be after three months has passed) and from Wednesday, this will be extended to over-18s. There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination centres, but the government has urged people to be ""patient and keep trying, or book online"". Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. A doctor from Cambridge has spoken of the sadness his lab team felt at taking a decision to cancel their Christmas party, despite it being the ""right thing to do"". Prof Stefan Marciniak, a respiratory specialist, tells the BBC it was a ""unanimous decision"" from the whole team to protect the health of their family, friends and the wider community from the spread of the Omicron variant. He says: âSome of us are clinicians and we don't want to contribute to the coming wave that will hit us. ""We also
have responsibilities. If I can't do my ward rounds on Christmas Eve then
someone else has to do that."" Omicron is transmitting extremely quickly and coming into a population with relatively little protection from two doses of vaccine, although boosters appear to have a very good effect in early studies. Prof Stefan Marciniak, Doctor and Professor of Respiratory Science, University of Cambridge Indonesia has become one of the few countries in Asia to start vaccinating children against Covid-19. Those aged six to 11 will now receive China's Sinovac vaccine. Covid vaccinations for children have been a sensitive and sometimes controversial subject around the world. InEurope, the medicines regulator approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's lower-dose vaccine on children aged five to 11 last month, however different countries are approaching it in different ways. For example, one region in Italy is using clowns and jugglers at clinics andFranceandGermanyare targeting only the most vulnerable children.Denmark, on the other hand, has been giving the shots even before the specially-designed vials and syringes have arrived, according to Reuters news agency. In theUK,the government has been advised to offer 12 to 15-year-olds a second jab. Read more: The UK's four chief medical officers have just advised that the waiting period where people are monitored after getting their Pfizer or Moderna Covid jab in case of an allergic reaction should be temporarily suspended. They said scrapping the 15-minute observation period would speed the process up at vaccination centres and allow more people to get boosters. They also said the rates of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) after Covid vaccination are low - around one per 100,000 vaccine doses. Speaking in the Commons just now, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change would help the NHS ""get more jabs in arms more quickly to give people vital protection this winter"". Those who have a history of allergies, particularly to other vaccines, or have had an immediate reaction after previous doses may still be advised to stay for the 15 minutes. The French government is keeping a close eye on the Omicron situation in Britain, and may tighten entry restrictions to those travelling from the UK if the situation worsens, says a French government spokesman. ""We are always looking at means to tighten the framework, we are currently working on that and we should, I think, come to a conclusion in the coming days,"" Gabriel Attal told France Info radio on Tuesday. France is currently in the midst of a fifth coronavirus wave, mostly driven by the Delta variant. There are 133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in France, Mr Attal said. The UK government has updated its daily Covid numbers: Ministers have announced that all countries will be removed from the travel red list in England because the Omicron variant is spreading throughout the UK - but travel testing will remain in place. Now the travel trade body Abta is calling for all restrictions to be lifted. Chief executive Mark Tanzer says: ""The government has always been clear that once the Omicron variant is widespread across the UK there would be little rationale for retaining any restrictions on international travel."" Travel businesses are facing a ""serious situation"" with temporary testing requirements extending over Christmas and the New Year, and into the peak booking period for summer 2022, he says. He adds: ""Consumer confidence in travel has suffered a significant setback, which will outlast these restrictions. The government must acknowledge this by bringing forward grant support to help businesses through the difficult weeks ahead."" As the debate on Plan B measures continues, MPs have been indicating their concerns throughout in interventions. Tory
Alec Shelbrookeasked if variants keep coming, ""how do we avoid debating the same thing in three months or five
months' time?"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid responded that the key is the vaccine, and said the government has struck deals for 114 million more doses that could be adjusted for future variants. In light of the new data on Omicron, Covid passes will require booster jabs
and not just the initial two doses ""as soon as all adults have a reasonable
chance"" of having an extra jab, Javid says. One Tory MP said he is worried about a ""two-tier
system"" and wants the health secretary to assure him negative tests will always be an alternative as part of Covid passes. Javid said: ""This is not a vaccine passport, it is really important that people have a range of options."" ButLib Dem Alistair Carmichaelsaid ""a vaccine
passport with a lateral flow option is still a vaccine passport"" and questioned what effect they had had in other parts of the UK, where they have been in place for weeks. Back in the Commons, Labour's Wes Streeting has outlined his party's support for the government's Plan B measures. The shadow health secretary says mask wearing has been ""proven to be effective"" and adds the government should never have lifted the rules in the first place. On Covid passes, Streeting says Labour supports the requirement to have the option to show a negative lateral flow test and argues they are ""not vaccine passports"" as a result. Although the party doesn't support mandatory vaccination in general, he says it will back the measure for health and care workers. But he says the government must do more to persuade them to get jabs voluntarily. Some more details from Nicola Sturgeon's update for Scotland now. Visits to care home residents should not now involve any more than two households at a time, she announces. The new guidance also asks people to do a lateral flow Covid test before visiting. For hospitals, the Scottish government is recommending that no more than two people visit a patient at any one time. Meanwhile, on schools, Sturgeon tells MSPs that entire classes are not recommended to isolate when one pupil tests positive. She says a ""key aim"" is for schools to stay open to minimise disruption to learning. You can read more about the changes coming into effect in Scotland here. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting is speaking in the Commons, and opens by saying sincere beliefs are held on all sides, but he hopes the debate on Plan B measures can be worthy of Parliament. He criticises the comparison by one Tory MP of Covid passes to Nazi Germany's policies, saying: ""We are not living in the 1930s and the secretary of state
and his team are not Nazis."" Streeting says the health secretary has a responsibility to protect our NHS and calls the measures ""a necessary response to the Omicron threat"". But he says that confronting the challenges of this winter has been made much harder because we went into the pandemic with record waiting lists, 100,000 unfilled vacancies in the NHS and shortages of care staff. As we've just heard, a number of countries have now been removed from the travel red list, including South Africa. This has come too late for some people who have been forced to quarantine, including Alison Stitt. She was in South Africa visiting her father for his 90th birthday when the country went on the UK's red list. She says it took her days to re-arrange a flight home on a date that a quarantine hotel room was available. They had to stay longer in their Airbnb and re-book their car hire while they waited - on top of extending their car parking and kennels bookings in the UK. Now, she and her husband David are at a hotel near Gatwick. Alison says the total cost of their extended stay in South Africa and their quarantine, has been at least Â£5,500. Speaking to the BBC before all countries were taken off the red list, she said the idea of the travel rules being changed ""has fuelled our argument that this whole fiasco was wrong"". Read more here. ""It was one expense after another. It's all going on credit cards. It was meant to be a budget trip Alison Stitt Sajid Javid has told MPs he is seeking ""urgent advice"" about people currently in quarantine hotels being permitted to leave early. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw asks the health secretary if the government will now release people in isolation in quarantine hotels, given that all 11 African countries are to be removed from the red list. Javid says: ""I am told that the practice in the past has been requiring them to complete their quarantine period. However, I do understand the importance of that. ""I have asked for urgent advice about what this means and I hope to act very quickly on just that."" The health secretary has set out in Parliament the rationale for ending the travel red list, saying that as the new variant is spreading in the UK, travel restrictions are ""now less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad"". The decision means England will no longer require hotel quarantine for travellers from Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Travel rules are set by the four nations of the UK independently, but the other nations' governments often follow proposals from Westminster. Back to Nicola Sturgeon's update, and the first minister says firms in Scotland are being encouraged to bring back physical distancing and screens in shops and hospitality venues. Sturgeon says Scotland is facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. Businesses will have a legal requirement to take practicable measures to minimise the risk of transmission of Covid. In retail, it will involve a return to the kind of protections in place at the start of the pandemic - including physical distancing and measures to control the flow of customers and protective screens. For hospitality, it will mean, measures to avoid crowding at bars and between tables, and a reminder of the requirement to collect contact details of customers to help with contact tracing. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also confirmed that all 11 African countries on the UK's travel red list will be removed from tomorrow. And the minister announced on Twitter that all testing measures for arrivals will remain in place. The rules for England require all travellers to have a pre-arrival negative PCR or lateral flow test taken within the 48 hours before arriving. Arrivals must also self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test. Shapps adds: ""As always, we keep all our travel measures under review and we may impose new restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health."" Allow Twitter content?

"The number of people in part-time work jumped in the three months to October, after falling sharply in the pandemic, official figures show. There was also a fall in unemployment among 16-24 year-olds, another group hit hard by the crisis. It comes unemployment continues to fall after a spike last year, with job vacancies now at a fresh record high. But the figures predate the arrival of the Omicron variant which some fear may lead to restrictions in some sectors. The overall unemployment rate fell to 4.2% between August and September,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external. ""With still no sign of the end of the furlough scheme hitting the number of jobs, the total of employees on payroll continued to grow strongly in November,"" said head of economic statistics Darren Morgan. ""Separately, survey findings show much of the recent growth in employment has been among part-timers, who were particularly hard hit at the start of the pandemic."" As businesses struggled with successive lockdowns, the number of people working part-time fell sharply to 7.7 million in the March to May period this year. However, as employers expanded again, this number has risen to 8.07 million in the three months to October, driving the latest quarterly increase in employment. Younger, less experienced workers have also struggled to find work during the crisis. But the ONS said the unemployment rate among 16-24 year-olds had now recovered to pre-pandemic levels at 11.3% - down from a high of 14.8% in the July to September period of last year. Job vacancies have continued to rise over the past six months as the economy reopens and employers race to hire staff. Between September and November, they hit a fresh record of 1.22 million  - some 434,500 higher than before the pandemic. However, the ONS said the rate of growth was slowing. Rob Clarry, an economist at PwC UK, said there were ""tentative signs"" that demand for labour could be reaching its peak. The end of the job support scheme in October has not led to a significant rise in unemployment, the ONS said, looking at the quarter as whole. UK employers added 257,000 staff to their payrolls in November - taking the total number above pre-pandemic levels. But on a monthly basis, there was a slight increase in the unemployment rate between October and November - from 4% to 4.3%. And the ONS cautioned that some workers who have recently been made redundant may still be working out their notice. Mr Clarry said it remained too early to judge the impact of Omicron on the labour market. But he added: ""We expect it to hit consumer demand for contact-intensive sectors, such as food and hospitality, over the near term. This could reduce demand for labour in these sectors over the coming months."" However, the chairman of Reed Employment, James Reed, said: ""There's been plenty of talk from doomsayers that the Omicron variant will plunge us back into economic despair, but the outlook appears much more optimistic now compared with the first Covid wave we faced in March 2020. ""It's currently the best time in 50 years to look for a new job."" Commenting on the latest jobs figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The jobs outlook remains strong thanks to our Â£400bn economic support package, Plan for Jobs and fantastic vaccine programme. ""To keep safeguarding our economic recovery and the lives and livelihoods of the British people, I am now calling on everyone to keep playing their part and get boosted now."" In broad terms the jobs numbers continued to reflect an encouraging recovery from the traumatic impact of the lockdowns, with payroll levels higher and redundancy levels lower than before the pandemic. However, there was a modest impact from the end of the furlough scheme. On the monthly measure, unemployment in October, the first full month after the end of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, was up to 4.3% from 4.0% the month before. That represents an increase of 77,500. The full impact of the removal of furlough will take a few more months to filter into redundancy figures, given notice periods. The weekly measures suggest October's rise was the result of an initial spike in the first week of the month which settled down later. Vacancies continue to set new records, but this is holding back the underlying economic recovery. There is a post-Brexit factor here, but also a number of older workers who have retired during the pandemic and a lack of students doing part-time work. The impact of this ongoing jobs squeeze on annual wage settlements is the next unknown to watch for, after Omicron. The latest jobs figures come in the week that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decides on whether to raise its key interest rate from the current historic low of 0.1%. It is under pressure to address fast-rising inflation, but wants to be sure that the expiry of the furlough scheme at the end of September did not cause a jump in unemployment before any decision to raise rates for the first time since the pandemic. But the fast spread of Omicron has raised fears of a new economic slowdown and prompted investors to bet against a rate rise as soon as Thursday. ""The combination of a tight labour market and low unemployment evident in today's data could on their own be sufficient to merit a rate rise,"" said KPMG's UK chief economist Yael Selfin. ""Nonetheless, with the emergence of the Omicron variant over the recent weeks, we now expect the MPC to unanimously hold off raising rates until next year.""

"Belfast customers showing their proof of Covid-19 immunity Police will visit licensed premises to make sure they comply with Covid-19 passport rules, Northern Ireland's justice minister has said. Naomi Long said police will be ""leading enforcement"". Regulations are now legally enforceable and venues who breach them could face fines of up to Â£10,000. Customers must show either proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from Covid to enter licensed premises and entertainment venues. Ministersvoted for mandatory checks last month, despite Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) opposition. Entrancechecks were introduced without enforcement on 29 Novemberbut the two-week grace period has now ended. It comes as10 cases of the Omicron Covid-19 variant were detectedin Northern Ireland. Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI? What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? A debate on the regulations in the Northern Ireland Assembly ended after five hours on Monday night without a vote, after Speaker Alex Maskey said he had decided to postpone the result to avoid the ""risk of a legal challenge"". It is understood the vote will now take place on Tuesday afternoon, with the majority of assembly members expected to back the scheme. Speaking to BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mrs Long, the leader of the Alliance Party, said the introduction of Covid certification checks was ""not about trying to police our way out of a crisis"" but to encourage people to take Covid seriously. ""There will be proactive policing with visits to licensed premises just to ensure the right measures are being taken,"" she said. ""But the focus of this will be to support those proprietors who are trying to do their best. It's really where people are clearly not trying to comply with the advice."" She said further questions about enforcement would be ""a matter for the chief constable"". The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said officers routinely visit licensed premises and venues as part of their normal patrol duties and speak with staff around potential breaches of both the Licensing (NI) Order and the Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) Regulations. ""These visits have been increased over recent weeks and this will remain to be the case in the days and weeks ahead,"" the PSNI said in a statement. ""The policing approach has always been to engage, explain and encourage people to adhere to the regulations and only enforce where necessary. ""In the case of licensed premises, this will involve working with business owners to ensure regulations are followed and that we jointly promote the continued safe and peaceful enjoyment of such premises."" Last week Ms Long saidpolice would take enforcement action against people who abused staffover Covid restrictions. Police will be visiting licensed premises to make sure staff and customers comply with Covid-19 passport rules Mark Lindsay, chair of the Police Federation, said officers understood enforcement was ""part of the job"". ""On some occasions it will be totally appropriate for police to be involved in enforcement,"" he said. ""But there is a little bit of resentment as to why once again everything is being thrown at the police to deal with and not being seen as a wider issue"". A crowd gathered outside Stormont on Monday in protest against Covid passports More than 200 protesters gathered at Stormont to express opposition to the vaccine certificates. Ahead of an assembly debate on the issue, a series of speakers urged assembly members (MLAs) not to support the scheme. On Monday evening, after almost five hours of a debate, the sitting was adjourned without a vote at the 21:00 GMT cut-off time as the Health Minister Robin Swann was about to give his closing remarks. Speaker Alex Maskey said he had taken procedural advice to postpone the result to avoid any possible legal challenge. Earlier, Mr Swann said politicians joking about the Covid pandemic were ""pathetic"" and criticised some pictures and ""rhymes"" posted on social media about coronavirus. ""Shame on anyone who thinks this pandemic is a laughing matter,"" he said. As it happened: Stormont debates implementation of Covid-19 passports ""Sadly we still have some other senior politicians who think it's acceptable to joke about Covid 19."" Earlier, DUP MLA Paul Givan, the first minister of Northern Ireland, said evidence certification would stop the spread of Covid was lacking and such schemes were ""hardening"" some people's resistance to getting vaccinated. Declan Jordan, general manager of Rosie Joe's bar in Londonderry, told BBC Radio Foyle they had already had to turn away big groups who were unvaccinated. ""If this is what they are telling us to do to keep our business open, we will do anything we can to do it,"" he said. Owner of Belfast's Blank and Shed restaurants Christina Taylor said the grace period had ""got them into the swing of things."" ""We have a responsibility towards our guests to keep them safe,"" she added. The Gov.uk website stated there were ""no more home tests available"" On Monday, the Gov.uk website, from where free NHS lateral flow tests can be ordered, said it had temporarily run out of the kits. A message on the site apologised to those trying to order the test kits, and urged them to ""try again later"". It follows achange in rules for those identified as close contactsof a positive Covid case in England, which requires more lateral flow testing. The Department of Health said there was sufficient stock of lateral flow tests in Northern Ireland to supply local collect sites, which include chemists. Health Minister Robin Swann has urged Stormont opponents of Covid passports to spell out their alternatives telling them ""simply shouting no whilst failing to come forward with any genuine alternatives is not a credible position"". In a letter to assembly members, he urged them to vote for the scheme and appealed for a ""respectful"" debate on the issue. ""Certification is certainly not a panacea and will need to be complemented by widespread adherence to public health advice,"" he said. There are several ways in which customers can prove their Covid-19 status: By downloading theCovidCertNIapp on a smart phone, which shows proof of double vaccination By showing a paper vaccination card along with photo ID, such as a driver's licence By showing proof of a negative lateral flow test (reported to the NHS within the past 48 hours) along with photo ID By showing proof of a positive PCR test result within the last 30-180 days, along with photo ID Full details of the rules for businesses have been published on theTourism NI website,external. The rules apply for access to: Nightclubs Licensed hospitality premises, including bring your own alcohol venues Cinemas, theatres and conference halls Indoor events with 500 or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated Outdoor events with 4,000 or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated Events where more than 10,000 people will be present regardless of whether they are seated Covid passports are already being used in other parts of the UK and in the Republic of Ireland. TheScottish government's vaccine passport scheme came into effect in Octoberand, from last week, their system was updated to include lateral flow tests results. In Wales,NHS Covid passeshave been required to enter nightclubs and large events since 11 October and last month the rules were extended to cinemas, theatres and concert halls. People in Englandwill soon need to show their Covid statusto get into nightclubs and other large venues, subject to approval from MPs. The Irish government made proof of Covid-19 immunity a requirement for entry into hospitality venues since the sector reopened in July. The certification scheme has been creditedwith high vaccine uptake in the Republic of Ireland. Ten Omicron cases identified in Northern Ireland Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI?

"Toyota said production of the Lexus UX 300e electric car will be impacted by the stoppages Toyota has announced that it will extend production stoppages at some factories in Japan as it continues to feel the impact of supply chain issues. The world's largest carmaker said its components factories in South East Asia had faced disruptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Land Cruiser and Lexus production will be hit by the delays. The company said that lost production from the latest halts will total about 14,000 vehicles in December. In an email sent to the BBC, Toyota said the stoppages were due to ""lower attendance rate at suppliers in South East Asia due to the re-spread of Covid-19 and tight logistics situation in Japan."" However, company also said it aimed to stick to its annual global production target for the year ending on 31 March: ""We would like to maintain 9 million units, but we will keep a close eye on the situation."" In August, the Japanese automakerslashed its global production forecast due to the computer chip shortage. Japan export growth hit by supply chain crisis Factory blaze adds to computer chip supply crisis Toyota's rivals, including General Motors, Ford, Nissan, Daimler, BMW and Renault, have also been forced to scale back production as they struggled to secure enough semiconductors. As well as disruptions caused by the pandemic, car makers have also been impacted after one of the industry's biggest suppliers of computer chips suffered a major fire at one of its factories in Japan. In March, Renesas warned it could have a ""massive impact"" on its ability to fulfil orders. The global supply chain crisis hitting Japan's motor industry is also having an impact on the country's economy as a whole. Japan's exports broke a seven month streak of double-digit expansion, rising by 9.4% in the year to October. It was the slowest growth in eight months and lower than forecasts. Shipments of cars were hit particularly hard, down by almost 37% from the same time in 2020. Car exports to Japan's two largest trading partners, China and the US, dropped by almost half, according to data from the country's Ministry of Finance.

"All 11 countries will be taken off England's travel red list from 04:00 GMT on Wednesday, the health secretary announces But testing measures - a pre-arrival negative test and then another PCR test after arrival - remain in place for all travellers Deputy PM Dominic Raab says people in England will be able to spend Christmas in a way they could not last year because of Plan B restrictions MPs are debating the new measures in the Commons today, with a big Tory rebellion expected over Covid passes for some venues In Scotland, people have been asked to limit socialising to three households at a time but this advice will not apply on Christmas day More than half a million people booked booster jabs on Monday and long queues were seen again at some vaccination centres on Tuesday A top South African doctor says the country is mainly seeing ""mild disease"" and intensive care units are not overwhelmed Emma Harrison We're closing our live coverage for the day, so thanks for joining us - we'll be back again tomorrow. Our writers have been Joseph Lee, Alexandra Fouche, Alex Kleiderman and Adam Durbin. The page has been edited by Alex Therrien, Holly Wallis, Emma Harrison and Tiffany Wertheimer. It's been a very busy day with plenty of developments. Here's a round up of the key headlines: And if you're keen to follow the debate and votes over Covid measures in the Commons, our friends and colleagues at BBC Politicshave you covered here.  The hospitality industry is feeling the impact of the new Covid curbs, with pubs and restaurants reporting a wave of Christmas cancellations. The Bar 44 chain tells the BBC 3,200 people have scrapped bookings in December alone across its four outlets in Bristol and Cardiff. Natalie Isaac, the business' operations director, says only a ""handful"" of people would have cancelled before the pandemic. She adds 1,000 of those bookings were lost because of the knock-on effects of cancelled concerts by Tom Jones and the Stereophonics. Others say that although they face no new rules, public caution is causing lower footfall and a loss of trade. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has called for the government to provide financial support for businesses affected, but the Treasury has not unveiled any new measures. Read more here. Having to stay open but not getting the business is our big worry. This should be our bumper two weeks before Christmas, but the diary is worryingly empty. We're significantly impacted and without furlough, we won't be able to protect our staff. Natalie Isaac, Operations Director, Bar 44 Boris Johnson visiting a Covid vaccine centre in London yesterday Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed his thanks to people who have queued for booster jabs, No 10 has said. Johnson's official spokesman said the PM was grateful to those who ""queued for hours to get their jabs yesterday"", following theexpansion of the booster rollout to all adults in England. The spokesman adds the government wants to ""go further and faster"" with the rollout. He says: ""You'll have seen that the 15-minute wait has been temporarily paused by the UK chief medical officers. That will allow for significantly more people to go through those vaccination sites. ""It's something that will be very beneficial on the ground and I'll stress that that's been done on clinical advice and safety continues to be our top priority."" There have been long queues at many vaccination centres in England The UK government has reported that 513,722 booster shots were given on Monday, which means that 42% of the population has now been given a third dose - that's more than 24 million people. And as we've been reporting, the booster campaign is in full swing, having been brought forward in response to the Omicron variant. There have been some teething problems, with the NHS website crashing under the strain of so many people trying to book their appointment. In England and Scotland, it's hoped every adult will be able to book a Covid booster before the end of 2021. InEnglanda booster is now available to every adult aged 18 or over - as long as it's at least three months since their second dose. Over-30s can start booking their booster from two months after their second dose (but the appointment dates offered will only be after three months has passed) and from Wednesday, this will be extended to over-18s. There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination centres, but the government has urged people to be ""patient and keep trying, or book online"". Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. A doctor from Cambridge has spoken of the sadness his lab team felt at taking a decision to cancel their Christmas party, despite it being the ""right thing to do"". Prof Stefan Marciniak, a respiratory specialist, tells the BBC it was a ""unanimous decision"" from the whole team to protect the health of their family, friends and the wider community from the spread of the Omicron variant. He says: âSome of us are clinicians and we don't want to contribute to the coming wave that will hit us. ""We also
have responsibilities. If I can't do my ward rounds on Christmas Eve then
someone else has to do that."" Omicron is transmitting extremely quickly and coming into a population with relatively little protection from two doses of vaccine, although boosters appear to have a very good effect in early studies. Prof Stefan Marciniak, Doctor and Professor of Respiratory Science, University of Cambridge Indonesia has become one of the few countries in Asia to start vaccinating children against Covid-19. Those aged six to 11 will now receive China's Sinovac vaccine. Covid vaccinations for children have been a sensitive and sometimes controversial subject around the world. InEurope, the medicines regulator approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's lower-dose vaccine on children aged five to 11 last month, however different countries are approaching it in different ways. For example, one region in Italy is using clowns and jugglers at clinics andFranceandGermanyare targeting only the most vulnerable children.Denmark, on the other hand, has been giving the shots even before the specially-designed vials and syringes have arrived, according to Reuters news agency. In theUK,the government has been advised to offer 12 to 15-year-olds a second jab. Read more: The UK's four chief medical officers have just advised that the waiting period where people are monitored after getting their Pfizer or Moderna Covid jab in case of an allergic reaction should be temporarily suspended. They said scrapping the 15-minute observation period would speed the process up at vaccination centres and allow more people to get boosters. They also said the rates of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) after Covid vaccination are low - around one per 100,000 vaccine doses. Speaking in the Commons just now, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change would help the NHS ""get more jabs in arms more quickly to give people vital protection this winter"". Those who have a history of allergies, particularly to other vaccines, or have had an immediate reaction after previous doses may still be advised to stay for the 15 minutes. The French government is keeping a close eye on the Omicron situation in Britain, and may tighten entry restrictions to those travelling from the UK if the situation worsens, says a French government spokesman. ""We are always looking at means to tighten the framework, we are currently working on that and we should, I think, come to a conclusion in the coming days,"" Gabriel Attal told France Info radio on Tuesday. France is currently in the midst of a fifth coronavirus wave, mostly driven by the Delta variant. There are 133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in France, Mr Attal said. The UK government has updated its daily Covid numbers: Ministers have announced that all countries will be removed from the travel red list in England because the Omicron variant is spreading throughout the UK - but travel testing will remain in place. Now the travel trade body Abta is calling for all restrictions to be lifted. Chief executive Mark Tanzer says: ""The government has always been clear that once the Omicron variant is widespread across the UK there would be little rationale for retaining any restrictions on international travel."" Travel businesses are facing a ""serious situation"" with temporary testing requirements extending over Christmas and the New Year, and into the peak booking period for summer 2022, he says. He adds: ""Consumer confidence in travel has suffered a significant setback, which will outlast these restrictions. The government must acknowledge this by bringing forward grant support to help businesses through the difficult weeks ahead."" As the debate on Plan B measures continues, MPs have been indicating their concerns throughout in interventions. Tory
Alec Shelbrookeasked if variants keep coming, ""how do we avoid debating the same thing in three months or five
months' time?"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid responded that the key is the vaccine, and said the government has struck deals for 114 million more doses that could be adjusted for future variants. In light of the new data on Omicron, Covid passes will require booster jabs
and not just the initial two doses ""as soon as all adults have a reasonable
chance"" of having an extra jab, Javid says. One Tory MP said he is worried about a ""two-tier
system"" and wants the health secretary to assure him negative tests will always be an alternative as part of Covid passes. Javid said: ""This is not a vaccine passport, it is really important that people have a range of options."" ButLib Dem Alistair Carmichaelsaid ""a vaccine
passport with a lateral flow option is still a vaccine passport"" and questioned what effect they had had in other parts of the UK, where they have been in place for weeks. Back in the Commons, Labour's Wes Streeting has outlined his party's support for the government's Plan B measures. The shadow health secretary says mask wearing has been ""proven to be effective"" and adds the government should never have lifted the rules in the first place. On Covid passes, Streeting says Labour supports the requirement to have the option to show a negative lateral flow test and argues they are ""not vaccine passports"" as a result. Although the party doesn't support mandatory vaccination in general, he says it will back the measure for health and care workers. But he says the government must do more to persuade them to get jabs voluntarily. Some more details from Nicola Sturgeon's update for Scotland now. Visits to care home residents should not now involve any more than two households at a time, she announces. The new guidance also asks people to do a lateral flow Covid test before visiting. For hospitals, the Scottish government is recommending that no more than two people visit a patient at any one time. Meanwhile, on schools, Sturgeon tells MSPs that entire classes are not recommended to isolate when one pupil tests positive. She says a ""key aim"" is for schools to stay open to minimise disruption to learning. You can read more about the changes coming into effect in Scotland here. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting is speaking in the Commons, and opens by saying sincere beliefs are held on all sides, but he hopes the debate on Plan B measures can be worthy of Parliament. He criticises the comparison by one Tory MP of Covid passes to Nazi Germany's policies, saying: ""We are not living in the 1930s and the secretary of state
and his team are not Nazis."" Streeting says the health secretary has a responsibility to protect our NHS and calls the measures ""a necessary response to the Omicron threat"". But he says that confronting the challenges of this winter has been made much harder because we went into the pandemic with record waiting lists, 100,000 unfilled vacancies in the NHS and shortages of care staff. As we've just heard, a number of countries have now been removed from the travel red list, including South Africa. This has come too late for some people who have been forced to quarantine, including Alison Stitt. She was in South Africa visiting her father for his 90th birthday when the country went on the UK's red list. She says it took her days to re-arrange a flight home on a date that a quarantine hotel room was available. They had to stay longer in their Airbnb and re-book their car hire while they waited - on top of extending their car parking and kennels bookings in the UK. Now, she and her husband David are at a hotel near Gatwick. Alison says the total cost of their extended stay in South Africa and their quarantine, has been at least Â£5,500. Speaking to the BBC before all countries were taken off the red list, she said the idea of the travel rules being changed ""has fuelled our argument that this whole fiasco was wrong"". Read more here. ""It was one expense after another. It's all going on credit cards. It was meant to be a budget trip Alison Stitt Sajid Javid has told MPs he is seeking ""urgent advice"" about people currently in quarantine hotels being permitted to leave early. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw asks the health secretary if the government will now release people in isolation in quarantine hotels, given that all 11 African countries are to be removed from the red list. Javid says: ""I am told that the practice in the past has been requiring them to complete their quarantine period. However, I do understand the importance of that. ""I have asked for urgent advice about what this means and I hope to act very quickly on just that."" The health secretary has set out in Parliament the rationale for ending the travel red list, saying that as the new variant is spreading in the UK, travel restrictions are ""now less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad"". The decision means England will no longer require hotel quarantine for travellers from Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Travel rules are set by the four nations of the UK independently, but the other nations' governments often follow proposals from Westminster. Back to Nicola Sturgeon's update, and the first minister says firms in Scotland are being encouraged to bring back physical distancing and screens in shops and hospitality venues. Sturgeon says Scotland is facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. Businesses will have a legal requirement to take practicable measures to minimise the risk of transmission of Covid. In retail, it will involve a return to the kind of protections in place at the start of the pandemic - including physical distancing and measures to control the flow of customers and protective screens. For hospitality, it will mean, measures to avoid crowding at bars and between tables, and a reminder of the requirement to collect contact details of customers to help with contact tracing. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also confirmed that all 11 African countries on the UK's travel red list will be removed from tomorrow. And the minister announced on Twitter that all testing measures for arrivals will remain in place. The rules for England require all travellers to have a pre-arrival negative PCR or lateral flow test taken within the 48 hours before arriving. Arrivals must also self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test. Shapps adds: ""As always, we keep all our travel measures under review and we may impose new restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health."" Allow Twitter content?

Over-30s can start booking their booster from two months after their second dose (but the appointment dates offered will only be after three months has passed) and from Wednesday, this will be extended to over-18s. There have been long queues at walk-in vaccination centres, but the government has urged people to be ""patient and keep trying, or book online"". Scotlandaims to offer booster appointments to all eligible adultsbefore the end of the year. A doctor from Cambridge has spoken of the sadness his lab team felt at taking a decision to cancel their Christmas party, despite it being the ""right thing to do"". Prof Stefan Marciniak, a respiratory specialist, tells the BBC it was a ""unanimous decision"" from the whole team to protect the health of their family, friends and the wider community from the spread of the Omicron variant. He says: âSome of us are clinicians and we don't want to contribute to the coming wave that will hit us. ""We also
have responsibilities. If I can't do my ward rounds on Christmas Eve then
someone else has to do that."" Omicron is transmitting extremely quickly and coming into a population with relatively little protection from two doses of vaccine, although boosters appear to have a very good effect in early studies. Prof Stefan Marciniak, Doctor and Professor of Respiratory Science, University of Cambridge Indonesia has become one of the few countries in Asia to start vaccinating children against Covid-19. Those aged six to 11 will now receive China's Sinovac vaccine. Covid vaccinations for children have been a sensitive and sometimes controversial subject around the world. InEurope, the medicines regulator approved the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's lower-dose vaccine on children aged five to 11 last month, however different countries are approaching it in different ways. For example, one region in Italy is using clowns and jugglers at clinics andFranceandGermanyare targeting only the most vulnerable children.Denmark, on the other hand, has been giving the shots even before the specially-designed vials and syringes have arrived, according to Reuters news agency. In theUK,the government has been advised to offer 12 to 15-year-olds a second jab. Read more: The UK's four chief medical officers have just advised that the waiting period where people are monitored after getting their Pfizer or Moderna Covid jab in case of an allergic reaction should be temporarily suspended. They said scrapping the 15-minute observation period would speed the process up at vaccination centres and allow more people to get boosters. They also said the rates of anaphylaxis (a severe allergic reaction) after Covid vaccination are low - around one per 100,000 vaccine doses. Speaking in the Commons just now, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the change would help the NHS ""get more jabs in arms more quickly to give people vital protection this winter"". Those who have a history of allergies, particularly to other vaccines, or have had an immediate reaction after previous doses may still be advised to stay for the 15 minutes. The French government is keeping a close eye on the Omicron situation in Britain, and may tighten entry restrictions to those travelling from the UK if the situation worsens, says a French government spokesman. ""We are always looking at means to tighten the framework, we are currently working on that and we should, I think, come to a conclusion in the coming days,"" Gabriel Attal told France Info radio on Tuesday. France is currently in the midst of a fifth coronavirus wave, mostly driven by the Delta variant. There are 133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in France, Mr Attal said. The UK government has updated its daily Covid numbers: Ministers have announced that all countries will be removed from the travel red list in England because the Omicron variant is spreading throughout the UK - but travel testing will remain in place. Now the travel trade body Abta is calling for all restrictions to be lifted. Chief executive Mark Tanzer says: ""The government has always been clear that once the Omicron variant is widespread across the UK there would be little rationale for retaining any restrictions on international travel."" Travel businesses are facing a ""serious situation"" with temporary testing requirements extending over Christmas and the New Year, and into the peak booking period for summer 2022, he says. He adds: ""Consumer confidence in travel has suffered a significant setback, which will outlast these restrictions. The government must acknowledge this by bringing forward grant support to help businesses through the difficult weeks ahead."" As the debate on Plan B measures continues, MPs have been indicating their concerns throughout in interventions. Tory
Alec Shelbrookeasked if variants keep coming, ""how do we avoid debating the same thing in three months or five
months' time?"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid responded that the key is the vaccine, and said the government has struck deals for 114 million more doses that could be adjusted for future variants. In light of the new data on Omicron, Covid passes will require booster jabs
and not just the initial two doses ""as soon as all adults have a reasonable
chance"" of having an extra jab, Javid says. One Tory MP said he is worried about a ""two-tier
system"" and wants the health secretary to assure him negative tests will always be an alternative as part of Covid passes. Javid said: ""This is not a vaccine passport, it is really important that people have a range of options."" ButLib Dem Alistair Carmichaelsaid ""a vaccine
passport with a lateral flow option is still a vaccine passport"" and questioned what effect they had had in other parts of the UK, where they have been in place for weeks. Back in the Commons, Labour's Wes Streeting has outlined his party's support for the government's Plan B measures. The shadow health secretary says mask wearing has been ""proven to be effective"" and adds the government should never have lifted the rules in the first place. On Covid passes, Streeting says Labour supports the requirement to have the option to show a negative lateral flow test and argues they are ""not vaccine passports"" as a result. Although the party doesn't support mandatory vaccination in general, he says it will back the measure for health and care workers. But he says the government must do more to persuade them to get jabs voluntarily. Some more details from Nicola Sturgeon's update for Scotland now. Visits to care home residents should not now involve any more than two households at a time, she announces. The new guidance also asks people to do a lateral flow Covid test before visiting. For hospitals, the Scottish government is recommending that no more than two people visit a patient at any one time. Meanwhile, on schools, Sturgeon tells MSPs that entire classes are not recommended to isolate when one pupil tests positive. She says a ""key aim"" is for schools to stay open to minimise disruption to learning. You can read more about the changes coming into effect in Scotland here. Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting is speaking in the Commons, and opens by saying sincere beliefs are held on all sides, but he hopes the debate on Plan B measures can be worthy of Parliament. He criticises the comparison by one Tory MP of Covid passes to Nazi Germany's policies, saying: ""We are not living in the 1930s and the secretary of state
and his team are not Nazis."" Streeting says the health secretary has a responsibility to protect our NHS and calls the measures ""a necessary response to the Omicron threat"". But he says that confronting the challenges of this winter has been made much harder because we went into the pandemic with record waiting lists, 100,000 unfilled vacancies in the NHS and shortages of care staff. As we've just heard, a number of countries have now been removed from the travel red list, including South Africa. This has come too late for some people who have been forced to quarantine, including Alison Stitt. She was in South Africa visiting her father for his 90th birthday when the country went on the UK's red list. She says it took her days to re-arrange a flight home on a date that a quarantine hotel room was available. They had to stay longer in their Airbnb and re-book their car hire while they waited - on top of extending their car parking and kennels bookings in the UK. Now, she and her husband David are at a hotel near Gatwick. Alison says the total cost of their extended stay in South Africa and their quarantine, has been at least Â£5,500. Speaking to the BBC before all countries were taken off the red list, she said the idea of the travel rules being changed ""has fuelled our argument that this whole fiasco was wrong"". Read more here. ""It was one expense after another. It's all going on credit cards. It was meant to be a budget trip Alison Stitt Sajid Javid has told MPs he is seeking ""urgent advice"" about people currently in quarantine hotels being permitted to leave early. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw asks the health secretary if the government will now release people in isolation in quarantine hotels, given that all 11 African countries are to be removed from the red list. Javid says: ""I am told that the practice in the past has been requiring them to complete their quarantine period. However, I do understand the importance of that. ""I have asked for urgent advice about what this means and I hope to act very quickly on just that."" The health secretary has set out in Parliament the rationale for ending the travel red list, saying that as the new variant is spreading in the UK, travel restrictions are ""now less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad"". The decision means England will no longer require hotel quarantine for travellers from Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Travel rules are set by the four nations of the UK independently, but the other nations' governments often follow proposals from Westminster. Back to Nicola Sturgeon's update, and the first minister says firms in Scotland are being encouraged to bring back physical distancing and screens in shops and hospitality venues. Sturgeon says Scotland is facing a ""likely tsunami"" of new infections of Covid-19 in the weeks ahead, with a ""very significant"" impact on health services. Businesses will have a legal requirement to take practicable measures to minimise the risk of transmission of Covid. In retail, it will involve a return to the kind of protections in place at the start of the pandemic - including physical distancing and measures to control the flow of customers and protective screens. For hospitality, it will mean, measures to avoid crowding at bars and between tables, and a reminder of the requirement to collect contact details of customers to help with contact tracing. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has also confirmed that all 11 African countries on the UK's travel red list will be removed from tomorrow. And the minister announced on Twitter that all testing measures for arrivals will remain in place. The rules for England require all travellers to have a pre-arrival negative PCR or lateral flow test taken within the 48 hours before arriving. Arrivals must also self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test. Shapps adds: ""As always, we keep all our travel measures under review and we may impose new restrictions should there be a need to do so to protect public health."" Allow Twitter content?

"Covid restrictions including mask-wearing are still in place in Scottish secondary schools Scottish ministers will discuss new Covid-19 restrictions on Tuesday but will not consider closing schools early, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The first minister said action needed to be taken to slow the spread of the new Omicron variant while the booster vaccination programme is accelerated. But she rejected calls from a teaching union to close schools, saying the priority was to keep them open safely. Ms Sturgeon will update MSPs on the latest data and plans on Tuesday. She is also expected to make a televised address later in the evening, following on from Prime Minister Boris Johnson'sdeclaration of an ""Omicron emergency"" on Sunday. First UK death recorded with Omicron variant Aim to offer boosters to all adults by end of year A total of 186 cases of the Omicron variant have been confirmed across Scotland so far, although this is thought to be a significant under-estimate of the true picture. The UK's first death linked to the new variant was reported on Monday, and Ms Sturgeon said it was ""inevitable"" that more would follow in Scotland. The first minister said Omicron was ""going much faster than anything we have encountered before"", with case numbers doubling every two to three days, and said it was a ""near certainty"" that it would be the dominant strain of the virus within the week. An evidence paperpublished by the government on Friday,externalsuggested that in a worst-case scenario, there could be up to 25,000 new infections daily by 20 December. Ms Sturgeon said it was not yet known whether Omicron would cause more severe illness than the previously dominant Delta variant, but she said that ""even if it is milder, the sheer weight of numbers presents a challenge"" to health services. Queues formed outside a Glasgow vaccine centre on Monday as the booster programme was accelerated On Monday morning, Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said it was ""inevitable"" that further restrictions would be needed, and Ms Sturgeon appeared to confirm this - while stressing that decisions are yet to be confirmed. She said: ""In my judgement, as well as speeding up the booster vaccination programme we need to slow down the virus while we do that. ""This has been going on for almost two years, people are thoroughly exhausted with it and they want to get on with their lives, so we will think carefully about anything that we are going to ask people to do. ""We will be proportionate, we will be as targeted as possible and we will be seeking to minimise the further impact on people's lives."" Travel restrictions have been already been tightened up along with self-isolation rules for close contacts of Omicron cases, and people have beenadvised to ""defer"" work Christmas parties. While ministers have refused to be drawn on what could result from Tuesday's meeting of cabinet, the government haspreviously considered extending vaccine certificationto more hospitality and leisure venues, and a teaching union has called for the school term to end early. Nicola Sturgeon has made clear she wants to slow down the spread of omicron while speeding up booster jags to renew covid protection. One of the most effective ways to break transmission is to reduce social contact, withIreland already having re-introduced rules on meeting up indoors,external. It would not surprise me if the Scottish government suggested a limit to the number of people and/or the number of households we mix with each day. This would probably include some flexibility around the celebration of Christmas. There may also be a request to shops and places of worship to improve social distancing and other safety measures. I am using words like ""suggest"" and ""request"" because we are not necessarily looking at legally-enforceable rules. Instead, ministers may choose to extend the advice they have already issued to take regular tests, work from home where possible and put off work Christmas parties. The EIS said it wanted to see schools close on Friday to avoid pupils and staff being exposed to the new variant before mixing during the Christmas holidays. However, Ms Sturgeon said school closures would not be on the table when ministers meet on Tuesday. She said: ""Any leader that stands and says 100% that anything can be ruled out forever is not being straight with you, but we are not considering the closure of schools. ""Children have suffered disproportionately in this. The priority is to keep schools open and keep them open safely - I am not considering at this stage closing schools early or not reopening schools."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""Omicron is going to very quickly overtake Delta as the dominant Covid strain in Scotland"" Ms Sturgeon also said health teams would ""bust a gut"" to get booster jabs to all adults as quickly as possible. Efforts have been stepped up across the UK to deliver booster vaccinations, with Ms Sturgeon saying they were ""our best defence against this"". A goal has been set of offering an appointment to all adults by the end of the month, with those aged over 30 now able to make a booking. The first minister said officials were ""looking at all the possible options to build capacity"" in the system, including bringing in extra staff, increasing the number of appointments at existing facilities, and opening up more vaccination centres. The Scottish Conservatives have called for mass vaccination clinics to be re-opened, with leader Douglas Ross urging ministers to ""pull out all the stops"". He said: ""The rapid rollout of mass vaccine centres and more drop-in clinics is now a necessity. It is mission critical that the booster jag programme accelerates to win the race between the vaccine and the virus."" Scottish Labour meanwhile has called for more support for the hospitality industry after the advice to cancel Christmas parties, with deputy leader Jackie Baillie saying firms were ""being left high and dry"". Ms Sturgeon said devolved governments were in a ""difficult position"" when it came to offering financial assistance or compensation to firms, with the UK government having stopped short of funding new business relief programmes. A Treasury spokesperson said it would ""continue to work effectively with the Scottish Government to protect the NHS, and support businesses and jobs across the country"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson confirms a patient has died with Omicron in UK At least one person in the UK has died with the Omicron coronavirus variant, the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said the new variant was also resulting in hospital admissions, and the ""best thing"" people could do was get their booster jab. Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs Omicron now represented 20% of cases in England. The PM has set a new target for all adults in England to be offered a booster by the end of the month. Mr Johnson said people needed to recognise ""the sheer pace at which [Omicron] accelerates through the population"" and that they should set aside the idea that Omicron was a milder variant. The prime ministertweeted,externalthat more than half a million people had booked their booster jab on Monday, which he described as an ""incredible feat"". The UK recorded 54,661 new coronavirus cases on Monday, as well as 38 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. There are 4,713 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant but Mr Javid said the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) estimated the current number of daily infections was around 200,000. Omicron has risen to more than 44% of cases in London and is expected to become the dominant variant in the city in the next 48 hours, he said. The 200,000 figure for Omicron infections is based upon UKHSA modelling. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh said with Omicron doubling every two to three days, it could go from a small to a huge number very quickly. How do I book my vaccine booster? Is a million boosters a day achievable? And other questions Johnson: I broke no rules over Christmas parties What are the new Covid rules across the UK? Parliament will vote on the government's strategy to counter the Omicron variant on Tuesday, with a Conservative rebellion expected, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was his party's ""patriotic duty"" to back the measures. In a televised address, he said Labour backed the target of giving boosters to all adults by the end of the month and urged people to come forward for their top-up jab. On Monday, the UKHSA confirmed 10 people had been admitted to hospital in England with the Omicron variant. Their ages ranged from 18 to 85 years old and the majority had received two doses of a Covid vaccination, the agency said. This video can not be played Starmer: Labour supports the government's booster drive As hospital admissions and deaths lag behind infections by about two weeks, Mr Javid said the country could ""expect those numbers to dramatically increase in the days and weeks that lie ahead"". England's booster programme has been expanded in response to the new variant, with online bookings for boosters opened for over-30s on Monday, while 18 to 29-year-olds will be able to book online from Wednesday. The health secretary described the UK as being in a ""race between the virus and the vaccine"", stressing that the vaccination push would come with ""difficult trade-offs"" - with primary care services focusing on urgent clinical needs and vaccines. Cancer treatments would not be affected by the requirement to redeploy staff, the prime minister's official spokesman has said. Mr Javid said setting the booster target would mean ""asking a huge amount"" of NHS staff and was not a guarantee that every person would get their vaccine by the end of the month. The NHS had announced it would return to its highest level of emergency preparedness, he said, meaning the response to Omicron could be coordinated as a national effort rather than led by individual trusts. He also said the NHS Covid pass would be rolled out to 12 to 15-year-olds for international travel. Meanwhile, the NHS website crashed on Mondayas thousands of people tried to book their booster, and there have also been long queues at walk-in centres. There have been long queues at some walk-in vaccination centres New orders for lateral flow tests on the government website were temporarily suspended due to high demand, after it was announced that from Tuesday people who are fully vaccinated will be advised to take daily tests if they are identified as a contact of someone who has Covid. Mr Javid said limits on ordering tests were linked to delivery capacity, not due to a shortage of the tests themselves, and that new arrangements had been reached with Amazon and others to address this. As well as the expansion of boosters,new Plan B measuresare being introduced in England to slow the spread of Omicron including advising people to work from home, making facemasks mandatory in most indoor public spaces and requiring Covid passes for entry to nightclubs and other large venues. Around 70 Conservative MPs have signalled theycould oppose some of the new measures in a Commons vote on Tuesday, particularly mandatory Covid passes. But with Labour's backing, the measures will almost certainly pass. Mr Javid said that once all adults had been given a ""reasonable chance"" of getting a booster jab, the rules would be changed so that three jabs were necessary to be considered fully vaccinated for entry to nightclubs and large events using the NHS Covid pass. The health secretary suggested travel restrictions on people arriving in the UK could be changed, saying the justification for the rules was ""minimised"" as the new variant was already ""spreading rapidly"" throughout the country. The prime minister visited a vaccination clinic in west London on Monday The prime minister has repeatedly declined to rule out further restrictions ahead of Christmas. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton has warned thatcurbs on people socialising may have to be reimposedin response to the Omicron variant. Data suggests Omicron is more transmissible than previous variants, with cases doubling in the UK every two to three days. The UK's Covid alert levelhas been raised to level four- which means a high or rising level of transmission - for the first time since May due to its spread. Early analysis suggested two doses of a Covid vaccine were not enough to stop people catching Omicron, but the UK Health Security Agency found a third dose gave around 70% to 75% protection against symptomatic infection. To reach the government's boosters target, one million doses would have to be administered a day. More than half a million booster jabs and third doses were given in the UK on Saturday, but on Sunday the figure was down to 397,532. Some 750 armed forces personnel have been made available to support the booster rollout in England and Scotland. And England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam has written to everyone who previously volunteered to help the vaccine rollout to encourage them to return to help with boosters. ScotlandandWalesare also aiming to offer booster vaccine appointments to all over-18s by the end of the year.In Northern Ireland, over-30s are now eligible for booster jabs.

"A number of positive Covid-19 results were recorded at Manchester United on Sunday morning after Saturday's win at Norwich Manchester United's Premier League match against Brentford on Tuesday night has been postponed after a Covid-19 outbreak at the Old Trafford club. The league says the decision was made ""following guidance from medical advisers due to the exceptional circumstances"" of the outbreak. Earlier, Unitedshut down operationsat their Carrington training ground to minimise the risk of infection. In the past week42 Premier League players and staffhave tested positive. Brighton, Tottenham, Leicester, Aston Villa and Norwich have all confirmed cases and Sunday's Brighton v Tottenham fixture was postponed following a Covid-19 outbreak at Spurs. United say positive cases among staff and players reported on Sunday have been confirmed by PCR tests and the outbreak ""requires ongoing surveillance"". All of Manchester United's players tested negative before Saturday's 1-0 win at Norwich, but some tested positive before training on Sunday morning. ""Given cancellation of training and disruption to the squad, and with the health of players and staff the priority, the club requested the match to be rearranged,"" United said in a statement released at 23:50 GMT on Monday. ""The Premier League Board took the decision to postpone based on guidance from medical advisors."" The league says the fixture, due to have been played at 19:30 GMT, will be rearranged ""in due course"". Brentford apologised to their fans for the ""disruption"" but they ""respect"" the decision, adding the ""health and safety of both clubs' players and staff must always come first"". The latest positive cases in the league are the highest recorded in a seven-day period since testing began in May 2020. On Thursday, following the introduction of new coronavirus rules in England to limit the spread of Omicron, the Premier League told clubs to return to emergency measures, including social distancing and wearing masks. A league statement on Monday said the frequency of lateral flow and PCR tests for players and staff would increase. Last season, Newcastle United's game at Aston Villa in the Premier League was postponed following a ""significant increase"" in Covid-19 cases at the Magpies' training ground. Later that month, a coronavirus outbreak at Manchester City caused their Premier League match at Everton to be postponed four hours before kick-off. Villa also had a Covid-19 outbreak in January, which meant no first-team players were available for an FA Cup third-round defeat by Liverpool, while Premier League games against Everton and Tottenham were then rescheduled.
