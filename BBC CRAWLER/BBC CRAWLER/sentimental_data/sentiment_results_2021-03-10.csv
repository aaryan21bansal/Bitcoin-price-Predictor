"The inquiry has already found the cladding was the main cause of the fire spreading The firm that made the Grenfell Tower cladding was warned of the risks of a building fire that would kill ""60 to 70"" people a decade before the tragedy. The chilling prediction of the Grenfell fire came at a presentation attended by a marketing manager from Arconic. Gerard Sonntag sent an internal memo suggesting the company stop selling the flammable version of its product, the public inquiry heard. It never happened and the fire, made worse by Arconic's cladding, killed 72. The public inquiry is hearing evidence relating to three Arconic employees who have refused to give evidence, citing a law in France where they live. Reading from internal company documents obtained by investigators, the senior inquiry counsel, Richard Millett QC said that the company's marketing manager had been ""very impressed"" by a presentation on fire safety which he attended in 2007. A consultant, Fred-Roderich Pohl set out the risks of the plastic used to make aluminium composite cladding (ACM), which he said had the same ""fuel power"" as a 19,000-litre truck of oil. The plastic, polyethylene or PE, is highly flammable. Mr Pohl showed pictures of a fire in Doha, Qatar, which developed quickly in the cladding system. In his memo about the presentation, Mr Sonntag said Mr Pohl warned: ""What will happen if only one building made out of PE is on fire and kills 60 to 70 persons."" It was a chilling prediction of the exact circumstances of the Grenfell Tower fire. In his memo, Mr Sonntag also asked colleagues what the responsibility of the cladding supplier would be in that situation. This is now a key question for the inquiry and the police, who are investigating Arconic's sales of flammable cladding. 11 key things weâve learned from the inquiry Who were the victims? Arconic now says that it made the raw materials for cladding systems and could not be held responsible for the ways in which they were used. Mr Sonntag's response to the 2007 presentation was to recommend the company stop selling the PE version of the cladding in favour of a fire-retardant (FR) type. He also said Arconic should cut production costs so that the FR version could be produced at the same price as the cheaper PE version. The company did pursue this strategy but kept the PE version on the market until after the Grenfell fire, when the role of the product in allowing flames to spread had become clear. Because three key French Arconic employees won't give evidence, Mr Millett said open questions remained, including whether Mr Sonntag's recommendations were fully discussed by the company.

"The steakhouse firm said all staff had got their money back plus 20% extra as a ""thank you"" A restaurant chain which asked furloughed staff to loan it 10% of their wages, amid claims of potential sackings, has paid the money back. Tomahawk Steakhouse asked 500 workers to lend some of their pay to cover pension and national insurance contributions. All the workers agreed. The firm denied the claim staff might lose their jobs, but said all staff had got their money back plus 20% extra. The GMB union said the return of the cash was a ""massive win"" for workers. In a letter to staff seen by the BBC, Tomahawk, which has restaurants in York, Middlesbrough, Beverley, Newcastle, Durham and Hoxton, east London, said it had a ""short-term cash flow issue and it requires your help and support"". At the time of the company's request the GMB claimed staff who refused were told their ""suitability for the role will have to be reviewed"". Staff agreed to the request. Tomahawk says that money has now been returned with the 20% addition. A spokeswoman for Tomahawk said: ""As part of the voluntary agreement signed by all of our staff, we promised that any monies loaned would be returned as soon as we were financially able. ""Following the budget announcement last week, we are delighted to have been able to swiftly honour that promise this week. ""All staff have now received the loaned amount, along with an additional 20%, as a thank you for supporting the business at this critical time."" GMB regional secretary Neil Derrick said it was an ""abuse of the furlough scheme"" GMB regional secretary Neil Derrick said: ""This was always an outrageous exploitation of both the furlough scheme and low paid, young workers. ""The cash should never have been taken in the first place as no employee can afford a further reduction in their take home pay - especially when it's to cover their employer's own obligations. ""Tomahawk's bullying behaviour was rightly condemned across the board. Their U-turn is a massive win for workers."" Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Labour has accused Boris Johnson of lying to MPs after he wrongly claimed Sir Keir Starmer had voted against a pay rise for NHS workers in England. The party is calling on the PM to ""correct the record"" after he said Labour had voted against a 2.1% rise. The 2.1% proposal  - which has since been scrapped in favour of 1% - was approved without a vote in 2020. Downing Street said the mistake had been clarified and there was no need for the PM to apologise. As it happened: Prime Minister's Questions Give MPs a vote on NHS pay - Starmer Nurses are well-paid for the job, says minister How much will NHS staff be paid? During exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said: ""Two years ago he made a promise to the NHS - here in black and white, his document - it commits to a minimum pay rise of 2.1%. It's being budgeted for and now it's being taken away. ""He shakes his head - his MPs voted for it. So why, after everything the NHS has done for us, is he now breaking promise after promise?"" Mr Johnson replied: ""He voted against the document in question to crown the absurdity of his point."" Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called on Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to ""get the prime minister to return to the House and correct the record"". Mr Ashworth said: ""The prime minister has twice, from that dispatch box, said that the Labour opposition voted against the NHS Funding Bill and the 2.1% increase for NHS staff. This is not the case."" Sir Lindsay said Mr Ashworth's intervention was not something he would rule on but added ""it is certainly a point of clarification - that part has been achieved"". Writing on Twitter later, Mr Ashworth said that Mr Johnson had ""lied at PMQs"" and repeated Labour's demand for a vote in Parliament on the 1% offer. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer asks whether nursing staff deserve a bigger rise than the PM's former adviser Dominic Cummings. He has written to the PM to ask him to ""correct the record"", telling him: ""At all times in the debate, Labour attempted to secure a greater financial settlement for the NHS in order to improve patient care."" Labour says the proposed 1% rise amounts to a pay cut, when inflation has been taken into account. Mr Johnson says it is all the country can afford at the present time, and NHS workers are set for a rise amid a public sector pay freeze, to reflect the ""massive debt"" owed to them by the nation. The PM says he will make a final decision on pay when an independent review reports back in May. Boris Johnson told MPs Sir Keir Starmer voted against the 2019 long-term plan for the NHS, after the Labour leader referred to it. That is not correct - there were no votes on the NHS Funding Bill 2019-20 during its main stages through parliament. Sir Keir had referred to the plan, saying thatit committed the government to a 2.1% pay rise,externalfor the NHS. The government has now recommended that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year. On Tuesday, the head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens told a committee of MPs that the plan had indeed assumed a 2.1% rise. But he also said ""things have changed"" since then and that it should now be up to the pay-review body. The prime minister's press secretary Allegra Stratton was asked more than 20 questions about the row at briefing for Westminster journalists. She indicated that he would neither apologise nor correct the record. ""The key thing is that this was dealt with swiftly and the Speaker - who has enormous respect and authority in Parliament - regards it as a point of clarification and it has now been dealt with,"" she told reporters. Asked if Mr Johnson had a problem with facts, Ms Stratton said: ""No, he doesn't. The Speaker addressed this as a point of clarification and it has been dealt with today."" The ministerial code states that it is of ""paramount importance that Ministers give accurate and truthful information to Parliament, correcting any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity"". Ms Stratton said Mr Johnson ""absolutely agrees"" with the ministerial code and ""in this instance the system worked"" because the Speaker had responded to Mr Ashworth.

"President Joe Biden's $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) relief bill to help Americans deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has cleared its final hurdle in Congress. The House of Representatives approved the massive economic aid plan 220-211 on Wednesday along partisan lines, with no Republicans voting in favour. Having already passed through the Senate, the relief package now heads to Mr Biden's desk to be signed into law. This sixth Covid-19 relief bill is a major legislative win for Mr Biden. The bill passed with all but one House Democrat voting in favour. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said the president will sign the bill into law on Friday. The bill ""is about giving the backbone of this nation - the essential workers, the working people who built this country, the people who keep this country going - a fighting chance"" Mr Biden said. He later vowed to share any surplus Covid-19 vaccines globally after ensuring that Americans are immunised. ""If we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world,"" he said. The final bill includes one-off direct payments worth $1,400 to be sent off to most Americans. It extends weekly jobless benefit payments of $300 until September. It also allocates $350bn to state and local governments, some $130bn to school reopening, $49bn for expanded Covid-19 testing and research, as well as $14bn for vaccine distribution. A proposal to raise the national minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour became a sticking point in the Senate and did not make it into the final version of the bill. The package has been broadly popular among Americans. A March Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of US adults surveyed expressed support for the bill, including 41% of Republicans. Democrats - who control both chambers of Congress by narrow margins - largely stuck together and managed to retain most of what was initially proposed. When announcing the so-called American Rescue Plan in January, Mr Biden said the government needed to ""go big"" in order to boost the flagging economy. America's worst public health crisis in a century has left more than 527,000 people dead and over 29 million infected. Unemployment skyrocketed over the last year, with a current rate of 6.2%, according to the US Labor Department. Republicans in Congress objected to the bill's price tag. They have called for various elements of the package to be smaller and more targeted, including suggesting stimulus cheques should not go to people who have not lost income in the past year. ""House Democrats have abandoned any pretence of unity,"" House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said on the floor ahead of the vote. ""After five relief bills, it is on track to be the first passed by strictly party lines."" He noted it was the most expensive single bill in US history. Joe Biden just notched his first legislative victory. Now that the $1.9tn Covid relief bill has cleared Congress, the new administration will have a firehose of money to fight the economic and social consequences of the pandemic. How effectively and efficiently Biden's team distributes that aid will go a long way toward determining the success of its first term. If the record amounts of spending boost the economy - without overheating it - the president could reap the political benefits of a revitalised nation. And because Democrats enacted the legislation with no help from Republicans, it may also prove to be an effective cudgel in upcoming elections. The unilateral nature of the law's passage, however, comes at a cost. Republicans are now dug in to their partisan trenches, and Biden's lofty inaugural rhetoric of a new era of co-operation seems a distant memory. Because of procedural maneuvres, Democrats were able to pass Biden's Covid bill with a simple majority. Future legislative priorities will almost certainly require some Republican support. This massive relief package, which provides record amounts of support for low-income families, is a significant accomplishment. Democrats have a lot of work to do if they want any more such wins. More than 32 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, either receiving two jabs of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Alaska has become the first US state to expand eligibility for Covid-19 vaccines to all residents above the age of 16. Texas lifts its statewide mask mandate and business capacity limits on Wednesday, becoming the second state to do so after Mississippi. Mr Biden announced Wednesday that the administration has secured 100m more doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" Police investigating the disappearance of Sarah Everard are searching a home and woodland in Kent following the arrest of a serving Met officer. The 33-year-old was last seen in Clapham, south London, on 3 March. The policeman and a woman were arrested at a house in Kent on Tuesday. Searches are being carried out at a building in Deal as well as on land near Ashford. The Met said it was ""shocking and deeply disturbing"" that the arrested man was a serving officer. Ms Everard's family have been kept updated, the force added. An area of woodland near Ashford is being searched by police Met Police officers have been searching land near to Great Chart Golf and Leisure in Ashford, Kent A tent has been erected outside a house in Deal and a car was earlier seen being taken away from the property. Officers have also been carrying out searches on land near to Great Chart Golf and Leisure in Ashford. Retired farmer Derek Batt, 72, of nearby Fridd Farm, said officers visited his property late on Tuesday. He said: ""They said they were investigating a missing person. I said 'is it Sarah that I have seen on TV?' and she (the officer) said 'yes'."" Mr Batt said he had not seen any suspicious activity in the area. Fridd Farm is located almost three miles away from Great Chart Golf and Leisure complex In a statement, the Met Police said the man and the woman had both been taken into custody at a London police station. Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said the arrests were ""a serious and significant development"". ""We will continue to work with all speed on this investigation but the fact that the arrested man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing."" During a later statement, he added the officer ""was not on duty at the time"" when Ms Everard went missing and would only confirm he had been arrested ""in connection"" with her disappearance. He also would not say if the officer was known to the 33-year-old. This video can not be played Met Police Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave: Arrest of officer ""shocking and deeply disturbing"" When asked by reporters if police believed she was still alive, Mr Ephgrave replied: ""We are searching as hard as we can to find Sarah, so we really hope that is the case.

"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" A serving Met police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the disappearance of Sarah Everard. Ms Everard, 33, was last seen a week ago in Clapham, south London, on her way home from a friend's house. The suspect, in his 40s, is an officer with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, the Met said. A woman, in her 30s, is also in custody after being arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. The Met said Ms Everard had not yet been found. Her cousin, Tom Everard, said the family want to ""focus on the facts as they emerge"". ""I want to encourage people to come forward with anything they might have, and to continue supporting the police investigation,"" the 36-year-old added. ""We have to believe Sarah will still be found and brought back safely."" Met Police officers have been searching land near to Great Chart Golf and Leisure in Ashford, Kent Officers are currently searching locations in London and Kent including a property in Deal and an area of woodland near Ashford. The arrested officer, who was initially held on suspicion of kidnap, is also being questioned about a separate allegation of indecent exposure. He was responsible for uniformed patrolling of diplomatic premises - including Downing Street, the Palace of Westminster, as well as foreign embassies in London. He was off duty at the time of his arrest. Ms Everard's family said it was out of character for her to disappear Since last Wednesday, officers have visited more than 750 homes in the Clapham area and have received more than 120 phone calls from the public, the Met said. Marketing executive Ms Everard vanished on 3 March and was last captured on adoorbell camera walking alone alongthe A205 Poynders Road towards Tulse Hill at about 21:30 GMT. Ms Everard'sfamily previously said it was out of character for her to disappear. She is thought to have walked through Clapham Common towards her house in Brixton - a journey which should have taken about 50 minutes. Speaking after the arrest on Tuesday, Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said: ""The fact that the man who has been arrested is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing."" This video can not be played The BBC's Jon Donnison reports on Sarah Everard's last known movements Ms Everard, who is originally from York and attended Durham University, was last seen wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers.

Home and woods searched over missing Sarah Everard Family 'desperate for news' about missing woman Detectives confirm last sighting of missing woman After the arrest the Met referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The IOPC said a mandatory referral was made in relation to the Met's actions after Ms Everard was reported missing. Specialist officers have been drafted in from across the Met Police to help with the search BBC London's Home Affairs correspondent Katharine Carpenter Sarah Everard is thought to have walked through Clapham Common towards her house in Brixton This morning Mr Ephgrave described the arrest of a serving Met Police officer as both shocking and disturbing. That officer has now been further arrested on suspicion of murder. It's unusual for such a senior officer to give a statement at this stage of an investigation and perhaps reflects the horror felt within the force - a profession where colleagues often describe themselves as family. We have now learnt the arrested officer is in his 40s and works in the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command where his primary role was to patrol diplomatic premises. Understandably, Sarah's disappearance has made some people in and around Clapham nervous for their own safety. Social media users have said the arrest of a police officer has heightened anxiety. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: ""All women and girls should be able to feel safe on the streets of London at all times.

"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" A serving Met police officer has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the disappearance of Sarah Everard. Ms Everard, 33, was last seen a week ago in Clapham, south London, on her way home from a friend's house. The suspect, in his 40s, is an officer with the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, the Met said. A woman, in her 30s, is also in custody after being arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. The Met said Ms Everard had not yet been found. Her cousin, Tom Everard, said the family want to ""focus on the facts as they emerge"". ""I want to encourage people to come forward with anything they might have, and to continue supporting the police investigation,"" the 36-year-old added. ""We have to believe Sarah will still be found and brought back safely."" Met Police officers have been searching land near to Great Chart Golf and Leisure in Ashford, Kent Officers are currently searching locations in London and Kent including a property in Deal and an area of woodland near Ashford. The arrested officer, who was initially held on suspicion of kidnap, is also being questioned about a separate allegation of indecent exposure. He was responsible for uniformed patrolling of diplomatic premises - including Downing Street, the Palace of Westminster, as well as foreign embassies in London. He was off duty at the time of his arrest. Ms Everard's family said it was out of character for her to disappear Since last Wednesday, officers have visited more than 750 homes in the Clapham area and have received more than 120 phone calls from the public, the Met said. Marketing executive Ms Everard vanished on 3 March and was last captured on adoorbell camera walking alone alongthe A205 Poynders Road towards Tulse Hill at about 21:30 GMT. Ms Everard'sfamily previously said it was out of character for her to disappear. She is thought to have walked through Clapham Common towards her house in Brixton - a journey which should have taken about 50 minutes. Speaking after the arrest on Tuesday, Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said: ""The fact that the man who has been arrested is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing."" This video can not be played The BBC's Jon Donnison reports on Sarah Everard's last known movements Ms Everard, who is originally from York and attended Durham University, was last seen wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern, and turquoise and orange trainers. She is thought to have been wearing green earphones and a white beanie hat. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his thoughts were with Ms Everard and her friends and family. Home and woods searched over missing Sarah Everard Family 'desperate for news' about missing woman Detectives confirm last sighting of missing woman After the arrest the Met referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The IOPC said a mandatory referral was made in relation to the Met's actions after Ms Everard was reported missing. Specialist officers have been drafted in from across the Met Police to help with the search BBC London's Home Affairs correspondent Katharine Carpenter Sarah Everard is thought to have walked through Clapham Common towards her house in Brixton This morning Mr Ephgrave described the arrest of a serving Met Police officer as both shocking and disturbing. That officer has now been further arrested on suspicion of murder. It's unusual for such a senior officer to give a statement at this stage of an investigation and perhaps reflects the horror felt within the force - a profession where colleagues often describe themselves as family. We have now learnt the arrested officer is in his 40s and works in the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command where his primary role was to patrol diplomatic premises. Understandably, Sarah's disappearance has made some people in and around Clapham nervous for their own safety. Social media users have said the arrest of a police officer has heightened anxiety. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan said: ""All women and girls should be able to feel safe on the streets of London at all times. ""I know how shocked and worried Londoners are by Sarah's disappearance and the developments in the case."" 3 March:Sarah Everard vanishes after leaving a friend's house on Leathwaite Road, Clapham, around 21:00 GMT 5 March:Met Police says it is ""increasingly concerned"" forMs Everard and make an appeal on Twitter at 11:30,external 6 March:Ms Everard's family say her disappearance is""totally out of character""as officers search Clapham Common's ponds 7 March:Footage taken from a doorbell camera showsMs Everard walking alonealong the A205 Poynder Road towards Tulse Hill at 21:30.

"The last confirmed sighting of Ms Everard was 30 minutes after she left her friend's home in Clapham Detectives investigating the disappearance of a woman who has been missing since Wednesday in south London have confirmed where she was last seen. Sarah Everard, 33, was last spotted on CCTV walking alone on the A205 Poynders Road, from the junction with Cavendish Road, in the direction of Tulse Hill. The time was about 21:30 GMT, 30 minutes after she had left her friend's home in Leathwaite Road, Battersea. Her walk home to Brixton was expected to have taken her 50 minutes. Detectives said it was unclear whether she returned to her home address but think she may have walked across Clapham Common. Her parents have said it was ""totally out of character"" for her to not be in contact with them An extensive investigation is under way, including searches and house-to-house inquiries, to establish whether there were any further sightings of Ms Everard beyond that which was captured on CCTV. The investigation continues to be treated as a missing person's inquiry, but due to its complex nature and concerns for her welfare, the Met's Specialist Crime Command is now leading the case. Her family said it was""totally out of character"" for her to not be in contact with them. Police officers have searched Eagle Pond on Clapham Common Volunteers from London Search and Rescue are helping the police Det Ch Insp Katherine Goodwin said: ""I would like to stress that there is no information at this stage to suggest anything untoward may have happened to Sarah. ""The focus remains on returning her home to her family safe and well and that is our number one priority. ""I would like to thank Sarah's family and friends, the local community and members of the public for their help to raise awareness of this appeal and for coming forward with information. ""I would urge anybody who has information or noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact us if you haven't already. "" Ms Everard was wearing wearing clothes and earphones like these when she was last seen She was last seen wearing a green rain jacket, navy blue trousers with a white diamond pattern and turquoise and orange trainers. She was also thought to have been wearing green earphones and a white beanie hat. Detectives have urged people to check any dashcam or doorbell cameras for sightings of her, particularly along these roads: The A205 South Circular around Clapham Common Cavendish Road New Park Road Brixton Hill Brixton Water Lane Family 'desperate for news' about missing woman Fears grow for woman who vanished on walk home The Met Police âYour house looks like love islandâ Sainsbury's jobs: how much are staff paid as UK supermarket announces 5% pay rises - how to apply for careers Who built the Tower of London?

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland's objective must be ""to eliminate"" coronavirus. She told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that striving to get new case numbers as low as possible was the only way to keep it under control. Ms Sturgeon said ""the virus won't play ball"" with any effort to maintain case numbers at a ""medium level"". The Scottish government has begun to ease some lockdown restrictions, although a stay at home order remains. Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said he did not believe coronavirus could be ""eradicated"", but said an elimination strategy of driving case numbers as low as possible would make outbreaks more manageable. Scotland eases rules on people meeting outdoors What Covid rules are changing, and when? The government has brought forward some ""relatively minor"" easing of restrictions, with an increase in the number of people who are allowed to mix outdoors to begin on Friday. Ms Sturgeon will set out a more detailed timetable for lifting lockdown next week, with the government aiming to return to a regional ""levels"" system of local restrictions by late April. She told MSPs that the country was ""heading firmly in the right direction right now"", but said ""we cannot afford to take our foot off the brake too soon"". The vaccination programme is widely seen as being one of the key ways out of the pandemic The first minister told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that the exit from lockdown ""may be slower than everyone wants it to be"". She said her focus was for easing to be ""steady and one-directional"", rather than going too quickly and taking ""one step forward and two steps back"". Ms Sturgeon backed an ""elimination"" strategy of driving virus levels as low as possible. She said: ""With a virus like this, what you absolutely can't do is just say we're going to let it simmer at this medium level, like a gently simmering pot. ""You can't just say you'll accept X number of cases a year and X number of deaths and X number of hospitalisations a year.  The virus won't behave, it won't play ball with you like that. She added: ""You have to have an approach, in my view, where our objective has to be to eliminate. Even if you don't quite achieve elimination it is the act of trying to get it as low as possible that keeps it under control."" The Scottish Greens believed that if elimination was achievable there had to be a ""step up"" on testing and better support for those who needed to self-isolate. MSP Mark Ruskell, who sits on the committee, said: ""It is welcome that the first minister has moved away from talking about suppression of the virus and is now talking about eliminating it. The Scottish Greens support an elimination strategy, as pursued by countries like New Zealand, but to get there we need to see more ambition on testing and support to self-isolate."" He added that when restrictions are ""gradually lifted"", workplaces would need the support of a ""robust testing regime"" to prevent the virus from spreading. The change to the rules will allow four people from two households to meet anywhere outdoors, including in gardens Dr Gregor Smith said driving case numbers low would allow for outbreaks to be managed, in the same way as outbreaks of infectious diseases like measles. He said: ""What we mean by eliminate is not to eradicate the virus. Its my view that we won't eradicate Coronavirus. ""But what we can do on a regional basis and gradually expand that internationally is to drive these numbers down to as low a level as possible so it has as little impact on communities as is possible in morbidity and mortality. ""If we can do that then we can then manage the outbreaks, just as we do when we manage measles."" Ms Sturgeon faced a range of questions during the committee session, with Conservative MSP Donald Cameron saying there was a ""strong argument"" for taking stock of whether emergency powers should be extended. The first minister said she did not want emergency legislation to be in place ""for a minute longer than it needs to be"", but said the country was still in a difficult situation and that the government needed flexibility to act. Meanwhile, Labour's Monica Lennon highlighted the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on people from lower income backgrounds. Ms Sturgeon replied that there had been ""targeted investment"" to help those who needed most, saying there was ""a need for us to continue to look with a fresh eye at some of the new inequalities that have been created by the pandemic"".

"MPs say NHS Test and Trace appears to have failed to achieve its stated aim of preventing lockdowns in England The Public Accounts Committee said its Â£37bn budget was ""unimaginable"" and warned the taxpayer could not be treated like an ""ATM machine"" But Boris Johnson defends the programme, saying it has helped reopen schools The PM also defends the proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff, adding that the government had already boosted nurses' starting pay A fresh row has broken out between the UK and the EU over exporting vaccines made in the UK European Council President Charles Michel wrongly claimed the UK had an ""outright ban"" on exports of jabs Health systems in most of Brazil's largest cities are close to collapse due to Covid-19 cases, a report warns Globally, there have now been more than 117 million recorded cases of Covid-19, and 2.6 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University A further 231 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, and there were 5,766 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours Edited by Lauren Turner and Alex Therrien That's all from the coronavirus live page for today - we will be back with more updates tomorrow. The writers were Alice Evans, Doug Faulkner, George Bowden and Jennifer Meierhans. The page was edited by Lauren Turner and Alex Therrien. We will soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here's a look at some of the stories we've been talking about: A restaurant chain which asked furloughed staff to loan it 10% of their wages, amid claims of potential sackings, has paid the money back. Tomahawk Steakhouse borrowed money from 500 workers to cover pension and national insurance contributions. The firm denied that it had warned staff they might lose their jobs if they refused to lend the money. It said all staff have now had their money returned with 20% extra as a ""thank you"". The GMB union said the return of the cash was a ""massive win"" for workers. In a letter to staff seen by the BBC, Tomahawk, which has restaurants in York, Middlesbrough, Beverley, Newcastle, Durham and Hoxton, east London, said it had a ""short-term cash flow issue and it requires your help and support"". At the time of the company's request the GMB claimed staff who refused were told their ""suitability for the role will have to be reviewed"". Read the full story here. Two Dracula fans who made a pit stop at the port where their fictional hero arrived in England have been fined for breaching Covid-19 rules. The pair were on a 350-mile trip from Edinburgh to Cambridge at the weekend when they decided to take a detour to Whitby Abbey, police said. The abbey features in Bram Stoker's 1897 Gothic horror novel and Dracula's first victim is in Whitby. Police warned they would be on the lookout for other would-be visitors Supt Mike Walker, North Yorkshire Police's lead officer for Covid response, said the couple were not the only people to opt to visit Whitby in recent days. He said four more people had been found making a 140-mile (225km) round trip to visit the attraction. Readmore on this story here. Extra testing will be carried out in parts of Wandsworth, south-west London, after cases of a coronavirus variant of concern were identified. The variant first identified in South Africa - like the one found in Brazil - is not considered to be more dangerous than other strains. However, there are concerns it could spread more easily and be more resistant to the vaccine.  Additional testing and genomic sequencing is being deployed within the SW11 and SW15 postcodes to help stop the spread of cases of the South Africa variant, the Department of Health said. Enhanced contact tracing will be used for anyone who is found to have the variant. Everyone living in the targeted areas are being strongly encouraged to take a Covid test when offered, whether or not they are showing symptoms. Surge testing for the South African variantwas first rolled out at the beginning of February, after cases with no links to travel were detected. At that stage, about 80,000 people in parts of Surrey, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Southport and Walsall were asked to take tests, regardless of symptoms. Although our explainer doesn't reflect the latest news on Wandsworth, it does show you the other areas in the UK that are getting surge testing at the moment, and why. Read more here. People quarantining at home after travelling into the UK could face daily calls to check they are following the rules, MPs were told. They're currently phoned up to three times over a three-day period until they answer the phone and confirm they understand the 10-day isolation rules and are abiding by them. Sitel UK carries out the checks on those isolating at home, not those in hotel quarantine after visiting from a ""red list"" country. The company's director of businesses development, Ian Conduit, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee he was in discussions with the government ""about contacting everybody for every day of their isolation and we are just waiting for that policy to be defined so, effectively, if it is agreed, (we can) roll that out"". Conduit says the firm deals on average with up to 20,000 contacts a day and this could be expanded if needed. If someone fails to answer after three attempts, or there is concern they may not be sticking to the rules, the details are passed to Public Health England and the Home Office for further investigation, while cases are ""immediately escalated"" if someone says they are not following the rules. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says claims that coronavirus vaccines affect fertility are ""completely untrue, but incredibly dangerous and potent"". He says the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had raised no concerns about any of the vaccines and fertility. Asked what action the government was taking to counteract disinformation on this issue, he told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee:""We stood up a unit across government back in March last year, a Covid disinformation unit, that works with the social networks to highlight to them any misinformation, disinformation, around issues like this. ""In terms of fertility, the non-clinical evidence around all the vaccines, whether it's Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, have been reviewed by our regulator - it's a world-class regulator, the MHRA - [and] has raised no concerns about safety in pregnancy. ""What we are trying to do is do two things - one, obviously highlight any disinformation and deal with that, but also get the message out from trusted voices."" Read more:Claims vaccinations harm fertility unfounded As we mentioned earlier, a further 231 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and 5,766 new infections have been recorded, according to the latest daily figures. Here's a closer look at the situation in the UK, in charts. Team leader Jeremy Moss carries out a swab test on himself A passenger train has been converted into a rapid lateral flow Covid-19 testing station for railway staff. The Southern Class 313 Coastway train stationed at platform 8 of Brighton station will be used with two other bases to test up to 1,250 workers for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which operates Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express. Mark Whitley, GTR head of safety and health, says: ""It will help prevent workplace outbreaks and, along with regular sanitising, give our staff and passengers added reassurance."" Brad Lade, an onboard supervisor with Southern who has volunteered as one of the team of 15 testers, says: ""I wanted to do something which will benefit people, to give them and my family peace of mind that my colleagues and I are Covid-free."" Brad Lade has volunteered to test colleagues Smitha MundasadHealth reporter Scientists are concerned that Brazil has almost become a ""natural laboratory"" - where people can see what happens when coronavirus goes relatively unchecked. Some warn the country is now a breeding ground for new variants of the virus, unhindered by effective social distancing and fuelled by vaccine shortages. That's because the longer a virus circulates in a country, the more chances it has to mutate - in this case giving rise to the P1 variant. Scientists say it is partly the spread of P1 around Brazil that is behind the current devastating upsurge in infections. Read morehere. A minister joined a coronavirus vaccine trial after seeing misinformation about jabs being tested on ethnic minorities. Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said having a different perspective from colleagues helped identify ""early warning signals"" ahead of the vaccine roll out. She told a committee of MPs: ""You will remember back in 2020 we didn't even know if we were going to have a vaccine and the emphasis was actually on trials. ""We could see the misinformation around the vaccine being tested on ethnic minorities and things like that. ""That was one of the reasons why very early on I decided to go on vaccine trials and encouraged others to do so, Nadhim [Zahawi, the vaccines minister] did the same thing. ""All of that was trying to build the confidence in people that this is something that is safe, this is something that we want to encourage as many people as possible to get involved in, and improve their understanding of what trials means."" Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent After heavy criticism over their handling of the procurement and delivery of vaccines, EU leaders are trying to point to the bigger picture. Charles Michel paints the EU as leading the effort to vaccinate the globe. Analysis by the New York Times suggests the EU exported 25 million doses in February, despite production problems in Europe, and that eight million of these were despatched to the UK. Brussels bosses remain deeply frustrated the UK is, as they see it, racing to vaccinate its own citizens before thinking about the wider world. London rejects this. Michel's bitterly disputed ""outright ban"" claim follows Ursula von der Leyen's assertion last month that Britain had a system that effectively blocked the export of vaccines. But the European Commission's chief spokesman said he was aware of no restrictive measures concerning vaccines leaving the UK. Read morehere. Businesses struggling to pay rent as normal due to the pandemic have received a boost in support after the government extended a ban on commercial evictions in England until 30 June. Affected premises, including hospitality venues that cannot trade fully until at least 17 May in England, will be given ""breathing space"" to prepare to reopen, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. Residential tenants facing hardship will see a ban on evictions in England extended until at least 31 May, the housing secretary said as part of the same announcement. Robert Jenrick confirmed a requirement for landlords to provide six-month notice periods to tenants before they are evicted will also be extended until at least 31 May. Residential evictions were banned in most circumstances at the start of the first pandemic lockdown last March until September when courts began to clear a backlog, beginning with the most serious cases. Mr Jenrick called a so-called ""Christmas truce"", meaning bailiffs were not allowed to enforce possession orders between 11 December and 11 January, before a ban was re-introduced for the current lockdown. The number of patients in intensive care has reached a new high in theCzech Republic, asseveral Central European countries struggle with a new waveof the virus. Czech authorities have started to send patients to Poland for treatment, as its facilities struggled to cope. InHungarythe number of cases in the current wave has surpassed the previous peak in December and it has one of the highest recent fatality rates in the world. Cases are also on the rise inPoland, where the government recorded the highest number of daily cases since late November on Wednesday, with 17,260 new infections. The EU has been widely criticised for the slow pace of immunisations, and initial delays were partially blamed on Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca failing to supply doses to member states.

He told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee: ""When I took this job on back in mid-November, I think if you look at the ONS data or other published polls, vaccine positivity was in the high 70s, touching 80%. ""It's now at 94% of the UK adult population saying that they are likely or very likely to take the vaccine. ""I think that is, for your committee, the best measure that the strategy is working, watching that number continue to climb - the highest probably in the world, I think, if I'm not mistaken, in terms of vaccine positivity."" A total of 22,809,829 people have received their first Covid vaccination in the UK, the latestgovernment data shows.,external And 1,254,353 people have received their second dose as well. A further 190 deaths of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days have been recorded in the UK, the government'sdaily figures show.,external This takes the total number of deaths using that measure to 124,987. There were also 5,926 positive cases recorded in the last 24 hours. This is down from last Wednesday when there were 315 deaths and 6,385 positive cases reported. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government's refusal to let pupils have follow-up tests to confirmpositive Covid results is ""ruining"" their return to school, parents say. They are reporting cases of families having to isolate after a child tests positive at school - even when more reliable tests show a negative result. Pupils at secondary schools are being offered three lateral-flow tests following their return to school. But the rapid-testing policy does not allow them to have the more accurate lab-based PCR tests to overrule these in-school tests. Experts say the risk of ""false positives"" among the rapid tests is high, with the Royal Statistical Society believing more positive results could be wrong than right this week. But the situation will change after next week when pupils will be allowed to do tests at home and a positive result will need to be followed up with a PCR test. Any guidance advising people in Wales to ""stay-local"" as lockdown is eased is likely to differ depending on where people live, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething suggested people living in rural areas might be able to travel further to access facilities easily available to people in urban areas. He says there could be a ""few weeks"" of stay-local guidance. Last year,a stay-local rule was in placeas the strict lockdown was eased, with guidance - rather than law - that people should stay within five miles of home. This led to some people arguing it discriminated against people living in rural areas who needed to travel further, for example to see family members. Ministers have previously pointed to an opening of holiday accommodation for the Easter period, which Gething acknowledged would not be feasible if a stay-local policy was in place. Here's more on the stay-local guidance. Mutations that make coronavirus more transmissible and more deadly highlight ""how dangerous this virus could potentially be"" in the future, a leading data scientist has said. Dr Leon Danon told BBC Radio 4's World at One new research suggested the virus variant first found in Kent was up to twice as deadly as the previous variants in circulation (see post at11:44). He cautioned that the overall risk of death for those who catch the virus remains relatively low - perhaps less than half a percent for those with the Kent variant. But he said a central estimate suggested the Kent variant was 64% more deadly when cases were compared like-for-like with another common variant. Danon said the effort now should be on reducing infections to avoid further mutations. ""The only way it is going to be able to mutate is if it is able to go between people,"" he said. ""We really need to be working hard to keep the rate of infections low."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Bill Harkin dreamed the design of the Pyramid Stage, along with rolling hills and beams of light Tributes have been paid to Bill Harkin, who designed and built the first Glastonbury Pyramid Stage, following his death at the age of 83. The Pyramid Stage came to Mr Harkin in a dream and in 1971 it was built for the second Glastonbury Festival. The original stage was constructed out of scaffolding and plastic sheeting. Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis, said Mr Harkin had lived an ""inspirational life"" and was ""simply loved by us all"". The original Pyramid Stage was erected for the second Glastonbury Festival in June 1971 The first festival was held in 1970, when 1,500 people paid Â£1 for a ticket, which included free milk from Worthy Farm, the home of the Somerset event. Mr Eavis said it was at the end of that year that Mr Harkin came to Glastonbury and met Andrew Kerr, one of the festival's co-founders, walking up the tor. ""They both became aware of very powerful feelings of spirituality,"" Mr Eavis said. ""This led to the idea of a large music festival with a pyramid as centre stage and that's when they came to me for a suitable site."" He said he had ""liked the idea"" and been ""captivated by their childlike excitement"". ""Bill was a top-flight architect working for British Leyland at the time but he soon became caught up with the festival, and came up with the very first Pyramid at Worthy Farm,"" he said. ""His enthusiasm and dedication led to what we have now - thank you so much, Bill."" Crowds of 12,000 got their first sighting of the Pyramid Stage, at what was then known as Glastonbury Fayre The current version - with Stormzy performing on it - was designed by local man Bill Burroughs Mr Harkin's Pyramid Stage was the first of three versions of the famous festival platform which has been graced by iconic names from music history for 50 years. Made from sheeting bought at Taunton cattle market, it took about three months to build. It was replaced in 1981 with a more permanent structure which doubled as a cow shed in winter, but burned down shortly before the festival in 1994. Between 1994 and 1999 a replacement stage powered by wind turbines was used, with the likes of Peter Gabriel, Elvis Costello and Johnny Cash performing on it. During these years the main stage was not a pyramid, more a regular stage, but in the year 2000 the third version of the Pyramid Stage was built Pilton resident Bill Burroughs' version of the stage, based on the Egyptian Pyramids of Giza, is the one still seen at the site today and is four times larger than the 1981 version.

"The Lagonda is an electric, zero-emissions car which Aston Martin planned to start making at St Athan About 200 workers are being made redundant at the Aston Martin car plant in the Vale of Glamorgan, according to the union Unite. The St Athan plant opened in 2018, near Cardiff Airport, with plans to employ 300 by 2019 and 700 by spring 2020. Unite said the car maker was seeking 95 job losses among its staff, with 100-plus jobs at an on-site agency that supplies workers also set to go. Aston Martin confirmed it had issued redundancy notices at the site. The luxury car manufacturer added it was ""also looking to release contractors"", a spokeswoman added. Aston Martin's Â£19m from Welsh government Aston Martin creates 750 jobs in St Athan In a statement, Unite said the scale of the losses was ""extremely concerning"", adding: ""[It] raises serious questions regarding Aston Martins employment practices and its wider commitment to south Wales."" When announcing its plans in 2018, the company said it would produce its first electric car, the Rapide E, in St Athan. It also said it wanted to make the site near Llantwit Major its ""home of electrification"" and make their luxury Lagona car there. The first Wales-made vehicle to come out of its workforce in St Athan, the DBX sport utility vehicle, was unveiled in November 2019. The DBX, a sport utility vehicle made at the St Athan plant, was unveiled in November 2019 At the time, bosses said they hoped it would deliver a sales boost after posting losses of Â£13.5m in the three months to September. The Welsh governmentpledged millions of poundsof public money to attract the carmaker to the Vale of Glamorgan ahead of its decision to set up in Wales. Bryan Godsall, regional co-ordination officer for Unite, said: ""It is deeply disappointing for workers who left other secure jobs for the hope of long term employment security at Aston Martin . ""We will be working hard to protect as many jobs as possible within consultation with Aston Martin."" A 30-day consultation started last week, he added. An Aston Martin spokeswoman said: ""Aston Martin moves into a new era, with new investment and a new business plan to position the company for success, and to operate as a self-sustaining business in the near future. ""In order to secure the future of its Gaydon and St Athan manufacturing facilities, Aston Martin continues to execute on actions to improve the cost efficiency of the business, in alignment with its transformation plan. ""Project Horizon has been launched to revitalise its products and deliver a level of operational excellence, agility and efficiency throughout every aspect of the organisation."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says the Welsh government has serious questions to answer Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it was ""dreadful news"", adding the Welsh government had ""serious questions to answer"". ""It's nothing short of a scandal that millions of pounds of taxpayers money has been thrown at Aston Martin by the Labour Welsh government and the plant in St Athan only for it to be thrown back in their faces by cutting almost 200 jobs,"" he said. ""We need to see some transparency here. The Welsh public have a right to know the details of the Welsh government's deal with Aston Martin, and implications for public spending if they decide to leave the St Athan plant."" Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies said it was ""worrying news"" as many jobs had been promised as part of the development along with money from Welsh government. ""We need assurances on two fronts that the money is safe that has been invested by Welsh government and, secondly, that jobs will bounce back as soon as the company gets back on its feet,"" he said. A Welsh government spokesman said it was ""working with Aston Martin to support the workforce and we continue to monitor the situation very closely"". ""This news highlights the economic challenges facing many companies, and the incredibly difficult decisions some are now facing,"" he said. ""As in all cases of Welsh government support, there are clear conditions relating to the assistance Aston Martin has received and we will consider whether any repayment is appropriate once the outcome of the consultation is known.""

"Helen Mary Jones deactivated her personal Twitter account hours after promising to close it down A politician has apologised to the trans community for causing ""pain and hurt"" over her actions on social media. Plaid Cymru Senedd member Helen Mary Jones has closed her personal Twitter account after admitting she followed others that shared transphobic content. The Mid and West Wales MS has promised to undergo awareness training. It comes afterPlaid election candidate Owen Hurcum resignedfrom a party list over the row. The deputy mayor of Bangor welcomed Ms Jones' apology but questioned why it took media pressure before she took action. A Twitter account called Team Helen Mary Jones, which was set up last December, remains online. It tweets updates from Ms Jones' work in the Senedd. Plaid MS denies transphobia after candidate quits Politician's murder trial retweet 'irresponsible' ""I have taken time to reflect and to understand how the actions and comments that I have made and shared on social media and elsewhere, including historic comments that have resurfaced, have caused a lot of hurt and harm to people,"" Ms Jones said in a statement. ""None more so than the trans community. ""I specifically recognise that some of the accounts I follow and retweet have shared content which is unacceptable and transphobic and I very much regret the impact of this on individuals as well as the trans community more broadly. ""For this, I sincerely apologise to the trans community for the pain and hurt I have caused. I am still learning."" Owen Hurcum was the fourth Plaid Cymru candidate on the north Wales regional list The candidate for Llanelli and Mid and West Wales said she would be undertaking ""relevant awareness training"" from an external organisation. Ms Jones deactivated her personal Twitter account hours after promising to close it down and BBC Wales has been told she does not intend to reactivate it. Owen Hurcum, who was fourth Plaid Cymru candidate on the north Wales regional list, welcomed the apology but said it was not the first she had made. ""Questions must still be asked why it took the media pressure resulting in my resignation from the 2021 Senedd elections, as Plaid's first openly non-binary candidate, for her to make the commitments she makes,"" they said. The councillor added that Ms Jones' continued candidacy for Plaid was ""somewhat disappointing"", but acknowledged the statement was ""an initial step"" for Ms Jones and the party. ""Plaid Cymru acknowledges the statement issued by Helen Mary Jones and the spirit of sincerity in which it is intended"", said a spokeswoman for the party. ""We remain steadfast in our commitment to creating a Wales which is fair, equal and just for all its citizens. ""This will be reflected in the manifesto which will include a clear statement of support for the trans community, endorsed by all the candidates standing in Plaid Cymru's name.""

"President Joe Biden's $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) relief bill to help Americans deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has cleared its final hurdle in Congress. The House of Representatives approved the massive economic aid plan 220-211 on Wednesday along partisan lines, with no Republicans voting in favour. Having already passed through the Senate, the relief package now heads to Mr Biden's desk to be signed into law. This sixth Covid-19 relief bill is a major legislative win for Mr Biden. The bill passed with all but one House Democrat voting in favour. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said the president will sign the bill into law on Friday. The bill ""is about giving the backbone of this nation - the essential workers, the working people who built this country, the people who keep this country going - a fighting chance"" Mr Biden said. He later vowed to share any surplus Covid-19 vaccines globally after ensuring that Americans are immunised. ""If we have a surplus, we're going to share it with the rest of the world,"" he said. The final bill includes one-off direct payments worth $1,400 to be sent off to most Americans. It extends weekly jobless benefit payments of $300 until September. It also allocates $350bn to state and local governments, some $130bn to school reopening, $49bn for expanded Covid-19 testing and research, as well as $14bn for vaccine distribution. A proposal to raise the national minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour became a sticking point in the Senate and did not make it into the final version of the bill. The package has been broadly popular among Americans. A March Pew Research Center poll found that 70% of US adults surveyed expressed support for the bill, including 41% of Republicans. Democrats - who control both chambers of Congress by narrow margins - largely stuck together and managed to retain most of what was initially proposed. When announcing the so-called American Rescue Plan in January, Mr Biden said the government needed to ""go big"" in order to boost the flagging economy. America's worst public health crisis in a century has left more than 527,000 people dead and over 29 million infected. Unemployment skyrocketed over the last year, with a current rate of 6.2%, according to the US Labor Department. Republicans in Congress objected to the bill's price tag. They have called for various elements of the package to be smaller and more targeted, including suggesting stimulus cheques should not go to people who have not lost income in the past year. ""House Democrats have abandoned any pretence of unity,"" House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy said on the floor ahead of the vote. ""After five relief bills, it is on track to be the first passed by strictly party lines."" He noted it was the most expensive single bill in US history. Joe Biden just notched his first legislative victory. Now that the $1.9tn Covid relief bill has cleared Congress, the new administration will have a firehose of money to fight the economic and social consequences of the pandemic. How effectively and efficiently Biden's team distributes that aid will go a long way toward determining the success of its first term. If the record amounts of spending boost the economy - without overheating it - the president could reap the political benefits of a revitalised nation. And because Democrats enacted the legislation with no help from Republicans, it may also prove to be an effective cudgel in upcoming elections. The unilateral nature of the law's passage, however, comes at a cost. Republicans are now dug in to their partisan trenches, and Biden's lofty inaugural rhetoric of a new era of co-operation seems a distant memory. Because of procedural maneuvres, Democrats were able to pass Biden's Covid bill with a simple majority. Future legislative priorities will almost certainly require some Republican support. This massive relief package, which provides record amounts of support for low-income families, is a significant accomplishment. Democrats have a lot of work to do if they want any more such wins. More than 32 million Americans have been fully vaccinated, either receiving two jabs of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

Texas lifts its statewide mask mandate and business capacity limits on Wednesday, becoming the second state to do so after Mississippi.

During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson was asked why so much money had been spent on the system when the government said a 1% pay rise for NHS staff was all that it could afford. ""It is thanks to NHS Test and Trace that we're able to send kids back to school and begin cautiously and irreversibly to reopen our economy and restart our lives,"" he said. He also defended the 1% pay rise, saying NHS workers were at least getting an increase, unlike other public sector workers. Inside NHS Test and Trace How do I get a coronavirus test? Is NHS Test and Trace working? The cross-party Public Accounts Committee is in charge of scrutinising the value for money of government programmes and was looking at spending on NHS Test and Trace, which is run separately from the health service. Spending on the programme amounted to Â£22bn in 2020-21 and another Â£15bn is budgeted for 2021-22. This video can not be played Meg Hillier: ""We need to see a clearer connection between testing and stemming the spread of the virus"" The MP who chairs the committee, Meg Hillier, said it was hard to point to a ""measurable difference"" the programme had made and taxpayers should not be treated ""like an ATM machine"". The committee's report warned of: An over-reliance on consultants, with some paid more than Â£6,600 a day A failure to be ready for the surge in demand for tests seen last September Never meeting its target to turn around tests done face-to-face within 24 hours Contact tracers only having enough work to fill half their time even when cases were rising A splurge on rapid tests with no clear evidence they will help Earlier, government ministers and the programme's boss also defended the scheme. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the MPs' report ""defies logic"", telling BBC Breakfast it was ""thanks to Test and Trace"" that UK cases of the variants first identified in South Africa and Brazil had been limited to 285 and six cases respectively. ""Yes, it's been very expensive... but I think the idea that we would be somehow better off without it is crazy,"" he said. This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps defended the cost of NHS Test and Trace on BBC Breakfast Baroness Dido Harding, head of the National Institute for Health Protection, which runs the system, pointed out it had been built from scratch and was now doing more tests than any other comparable country. She said performance had been improving with more people who tested positive being reached and more of their close contacts being asked to isolate. ""It is making a real impact in breaking the chains of transmission,"" she added. Not all of the money has been allocated yet. But the bulk of it is going on the lab-based PCR testing system, which includes the hundreds of local testing centres and network of mega-labs across the UK to process the tests. Some Â£10bn has been set aside for rapid testing, which is currently being used in schools in England as well as being sent to employers. The money has also been used to set up the 12,000-strong national contact tracing team in England and support councils to run their own local teams. The devolved nations are responsible for contact tracing individually. The committee acknowledges significant investment was needed to set up the system at speed after the pandemic struck. But it criticised an over-use of consultants, saying it needed to ""wean itself off its persistent reliance on consultants"" which were costing an average of Â£1,100 a day each, and some of whom had been paid more than Â£6,600 a day. On last count, there were still 2,500 being used, the MPs said. The complexity of the system was also laid bare with news that it had involved more than 400 contracts being signed with 217 different suppliers. Some 70% of the value of those contracts were directly awarded rather than being put out to tender. But the MPs said the investment had helped to massively increase testing capacity. When the pandemic started the UK could only process about 3,000 tests a day, but that had increased to more than 800,000 by January. This video can not be played WATCH: How to install the NHS Covid-19 app Meanwhile, the committee pointed out that while capacity has grown, the system has still never met its target to turnaround all tests in a face-to-face setting in 24 hours. And it was found lacking at the crucial point in September when there was a surge in demand for testing. By contrast, contact tracers have been under-used, with just half of time spent working on cases in October. This video can not be played Alex spent four months as a coronavirus tracer and spoke to only one person with the virus in that time By January, contact tracers had been in touch with 2.5 million people testing positive and advised more than 4.5 million of their close contacts to self-isolate. But it warned compliance with self-isolation seemed to be low. It also raised concerns about the use of rapid on-the-spot tests. Pilots in Liverpool did not show ""clear evidence"" of a reduction in infection levels or hospital cases. Labour's Rachel Reeves said the report showed the system had ""failed the British people"" and underlined the ""epic amounts of waste and incompetence"" in the way Test and Trace had been set up and run. Meanwhile, the head of the Royal College of Nursing, Dame Donna Kinnair said nurses ""will be furious to hear of the millions of pounds being spent on private sector consultants"". And Dr Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, added: ""The promise of a world-beating test-and-trace system has just not materialised, and the eye-watering sums of public money poured into this system are set to increase even further."" He said despite the rollout of the vaccination programme, it would remain an important tool and urged ministers to do more to financially support people to isolate.

The writers were Alice Evans, Doug Faulkner, George Bowden and Jennifer Meierhans. The page was edited by Lauren Turner and Alex Therrien. We will soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here's a look at some of the stories we've been talking about: A restaurant chain which asked furloughed staff to loan it 10% of their wages, amid claims of potential sackings, has paid the money back. Tomahawk Steakhouse borrowed money from 500 workers to cover pension and national insurance contributions. The firm denied that it had warned staff they might lose their jobs if they refused to lend the money. It said all staff have now had their money returned with 20% extra as a ""thank you"". The GMB union said the return of the cash was a ""massive win"" for workers. In a letter to staff seen by the BBC, Tomahawk, which has restaurants in York, Middlesbrough, Beverley, Newcastle, Durham and Hoxton, east London, said it had a ""short-term cash flow issue and it requires your help and support"". At the time of the company's request the GMB claimed staff who refused were told their ""suitability for the role will have to be reviewed"". Read the full story here. Two Dracula fans who made a pit stop at the port where their fictional hero arrived in England have been fined for breaching Covid-19 rules. The pair were on a 350-mile trip from Edinburgh to Cambridge at the weekend when they decided to take a detour to Whitby Abbey, police said. The abbey features in Bram Stoker's 1897 Gothic horror novel and Dracula's first victim is in Whitby. Police warned they would be on the lookout for other would-be visitors Supt Mike Walker, North Yorkshire Police's lead officer for Covid response, said the couple were not the only people to opt to visit Whitby in recent days. He said four more people had been found making a 140-mile (225km) round trip to visit the attraction. Readmore on this story here. Extra testing will be carried out in parts of Wandsworth, south-west London, after cases of a coronavirus variant of concern were identified. The variant first identified in South Africa - like the one found in Brazil - is not considered to be more dangerous than other strains. However, there are concerns it could spread more easily and be more resistant to the vaccine.  Additional testing and genomic sequencing is being deployed within the SW11 and SW15 postcodes to help stop the spread of cases of the South Africa variant, the Department of Health said. Enhanced contact tracing will be used for anyone who is found to have the variant. Everyone living in the targeted areas are being strongly encouraged to take a Covid test when offered, whether or not they are showing symptoms. Surge testing for the South African variantwas first rolled out at the beginning of February, after cases with no links to travel were detected. At that stage, about 80,000 people in parts of Surrey, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Southport and Walsall were asked to take tests, regardless of symptoms. Although our explainer doesn't reflect the latest news on Wandsworth, it does show you the other areas in the UK that are getting surge testing at the moment, and why. Read more here. People quarantining at home after travelling into the UK could face daily calls to check they are following the rules, MPs were told. They're currently phoned up to three times over a three-day period until they answer the phone and confirm they understand the 10-day isolation rules and are abiding by them. Sitel UK carries out the checks on those isolating at home, not those in hotel quarantine after visiting from a ""red list"" country. The company's director of businesses development, Ian Conduit, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee he was in discussions with the government ""about contacting everybody for every day of their isolation and we are just waiting for that policy to be defined so, effectively, if it is agreed, (we can) roll that out"". Conduit says the firm deals on average with up to 20,000 contacts a day and this could be expanded if needed. If someone fails to answer after three attempts, or there is concern they may not be sticking to the rules, the details are passed to Public Health England and the Home Office for further investigation, while cases are ""immediately escalated"" if someone says they are not following the rules. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says claims that coronavirus vaccines affect fertility are ""completely untrue, but incredibly dangerous and potent"". He says the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had raised no concerns about any of the vaccines and fertility. Asked what action the government was taking to counteract disinformation on this issue, he told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee:""We stood up a unit across government back in March last year, a Covid disinformation unit, that works with the social networks to highlight to them any misinformation, disinformation, around issues like this. ""In terms of fertility, the non-clinical evidence around all the vaccines, whether it's Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, have been reviewed by our regulator - it's a world-class regulator, the MHRA - [and] has raised no concerns about safety in pregnancy. ""What we are trying to do is do two things - one, obviously highlight any disinformation and deal with that, but also get the message out from trusted voices.""

Here's a closer look at the situation in the UK, in charts. Team leader Jeremy Moss carries out a swab test on himself A passenger train has been converted into a rapid lateral flow Covid-19 testing station for railway staff. The Southern Class 313 Coastway train stationed at platform 8 of Brighton station will be used with two other bases to test up to 1,250 workers for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which operates Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express. Mark Whitley, GTR head of safety and health, says: ""It will help prevent workplace outbreaks and, along with regular sanitising, give our staff and passengers added reassurance."" Brad Lade, an onboard supervisor with Southern who has volunteered as one of the team of 15 testers, says: ""I wanted to do something which will benefit people, to give them and my family peace of mind that my colleagues and I are Covid-free."" Brad Lade has volunteered to test colleagues Smitha MundasadHealth reporter Scientists are concerned that Brazil has almost become a ""natural laboratory"" - where people can see what happens when coronavirus goes relatively unchecked. Some warn the country is now a breeding ground for new variants of the virus, unhindered by effective social distancing and fuelled by vaccine shortages. That's because the longer a virus circulates in a country, the more chances it has to mutate - in this case giving rise to the P1 variant. Scientists say it is partly the spread of P1 around Brazil that is behind the current devastating upsurge in infections. Read morehere. A minister joined a coronavirus vaccine trial after seeing misinformation about jabs being tested on ethnic minorities. Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said having a different perspective from colleagues helped identify ""early warning signals"" ahead of the vaccine roll out. She told a committee of MPs: ""You will remember back in 2020 we didn't even know if we were going to have a vaccine and the emphasis was actually on trials. ""We could see the misinformation around the vaccine being tested on ethnic minorities and things like that. ""That was one of the reasons why very early on I decided to go on vaccine trials and encouraged others to do so, Nadhim [Zahawi, the vaccines minister] did the same thing. ""All of that was trying to build the confidence in people that this is something that is safe, this is something that we want to encourage as many people as possible to get involved in, and improve their understanding of what trials means."" Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent After heavy criticism over their handling of the procurement and delivery of vaccines, EU leaders are trying to point to the bigger picture. Charles Michel paints the EU as leading the effort to vaccinate the globe. Analysis by the New York Times suggests the EU exported 25 million doses in February, despite production problems in Europe, and that eight million of these were despatched to the UK. Brussels bosses remain deeply frustrated the UK is, as they see it, racing to vaccinate its own citizens before thinking about the wider world. London rejects this. Michel's bitterly disputed ""outright ban"" claim follows Ursula von der Leyen's assertion last month that Britain had a system that effectively blocked the export of vaccines. But the European Commission's chief spokesman said he was aware of no restrictive measures concerning vaccines leaving the UK. Read morehere. Businesses struggling to pay rent as normal due to the pandemic have received a boost in support after the government extended a ban on commercial evictions in England until 30 June. Affected premises, including hospitality venues that cannot trade fully until at least 17 May in England, will be given ""breathing space"" to prepare to reopen, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. Residential tenants facing hardship will see a ban on evictions in England extended until at least 31 May, the housing secretary said as part of the same announcement. Robert Jenrick confirmed a requirement for landlords to provide six-month notice periods to tenants before they are evicted will also be extended until at least 31 May. Residential evictions were banned in most circumstances at the start of the first pandemic lockdown last March until September when courts began to clear a backlog, beginning with the most serious cases. Mr Jenrick called a so-called ""Christmas truce"", meaning bailiffs were not allowed to enforce possession orders between 11 December and 11 January, before a ban was re-introduced for the current lockdown. The number of patients in intensive care has reached a new high in theCzech Republic, asseveral Central European countries struggle with a new waveof the virus. Czech authorities have started to send patients to Poland for treatment, as its facilities struggled to cope. InHungarythe number of cases in the current wave has surpassed the previous peak in December and it has one of the highest recent fatality rates in the world. Cases are also on the rise inPoland, where the government recorded the highest number of daily cases since late November on Wednesday, with 17,260 new infections. The EU has been widely criticised for the slow pace of immunisations, and initial delays were partially blamed on Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca failing to supply doses to member states. Read morehere.  Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has told MPs that 94% of the UK adult population have said they were likely or very likely to take up the coronavirus vaccine. He told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee: ""When I took this job on back in mid-November, I think if you look at the ONS data or other published polls, vaccine positivity was in the high 70s, touching 80%. ""It's now at 94% of the UK adult population saying that they are likely or very likely to take the vaccine. ""I think that is, for your committee, the best measure that the strategy is working, watching that number continue to climb - the highest probably in the world, I think, if I'm not mistaken, in terms of vaccine positivity."" A total of 22,809,829 people have received their first Covid vaccination in the UK, the latestgovernment data shows.,external And 1,254,353 people have received their second dose as well. A further 190 deaths of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days have been recorded in the UK, the government'sdaily figures show.,external This takes the total number of deaths using that measure to 124,987. There were also 5,926 positive cases recorded in the last 24 hours. This is down from last Wednesday when there were 315 deaths and 6,385 positive cases reported. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government's refusal to let pupils have follow-up tests to confirmpositive Covid results is ""ruining"" their return to school, parents say. They are reporting cases of families having to isolate after a child tests positive at school - even when more reliable tests show a negative result. Pupils at secondary schools are being offered three lateral-flow tests following their return to school. But the rapid-testing policy does not allow them to have the more accurate lab-based PCR tests to overrule these in-school tests. Experts say the risk of ""false positives"" among the rapid tests is high, with the Royal Statistical Society believing more positive results could be wrong than right this week. But the situation will change after next week when pupils will be allowed to do tests at home and a positive result will need to be followed up with a PCR test. Any guidance advising people in Wales to ""stay-local"" as lockdown is eased is likely to differ depending on where people live, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething suggested people living in rural areas might be able to travel further to access facilities easily available to people in urban areas. He says there could be a ""few weeks"" of stay-local guidance. Last year,a stay-local rule was in placeas the strict lockdown was eased, with guidance - rather than law - that people should stay within five miles of home. This led to some people arguing it discriminated against people living in rural areas who needed to travel further, for example to see family members. Ministers have previously pointed to an opening of holiday accommodation for the Easter period, which Gething acknowledged would not be feasible if a stay-local policy was in place. Here's more on the stay-local guidance. Mutations that make coronavirus more transmissible and more deadly highlight ""how dangerous this virus could potentially be"" in the future, a leading data scientist has said. Dr Leon Danon told BBC Radio 4's World at One new research suggested the virus variant first found in Kent was up to twice as deadly as the previous variants in circulation (see post at11:44). He cautioned that the overall risk of death for those who catch the virus remains relatively low - perhaps less than half a percent for those with the Kent variant. But he said a central estimate suggested the Kent variant was 64% more deadly when cases were compared like-for-like with another common variant. Danon said the effort now should be on reducing infections to avoid further mutations. ""The only way it is going to be able to mutate is if it is able to go between people,"" he said. ""We really need to be working hard to keep the rate of infections low."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The inquiry has already found the cladding was the main cause of the fire spreading The firm that made the Grenfell Tower cladding was warned of the risks of a building fire that would kill ""60 to 70"" people a decade before the tragedy. The chilling prediction of the Grenfell fire came at a presentation attended by a marketing manager from Arconic. Gerard Sonntag sent an internal memo suggesting the company stop selling the flammable version of its product, the public inquiry heard. It never happened and the fire, made worse by Arconic's cladding, killed 72. The public inquiry is hearing evidence relating to three Arconic employees who have refused to give evidence, citing a law in France where they live. Reading from internal company documents obtained by investigators, the senior inquiry counsel, Richard Millett QC said that the company's marketing manager had been ""very impressed"" by a presentation on fire safety which he attended in 2007. A consultant, Fred-Roderich Pohl set out the risks of the plastic used to make aluminium composite cladding (ACM), which he said had the same ""fuel power"" as a 19,000-litre truck of oil. The plastic, polyethylene or PE, is highly flammable. Mr Pohl showed pictures of a fire in Doha, Qatar, which developed quickly in the cladding system. In his memo about the presentation, Mr Sonntag said Mr Pohl warned: ""What will happen if only one building made out of PE is on fire and kills 60 to 70 persons."" It was a chilling prediction of the exact circumstances of the Grenfell Tower fire. In his memo, Mr Sonntag also asked colleagues what the responsibility of the cladding supplier would be in that situation. This is now a key question for the inquiry and the police, who are investigating Arconic's sales of flammable cladding. 11 key things weâve learned from the inquiry Who were the victims? Arconic now says that it made the raw materials for cladding systems and could not be held responsible for the ways in which they were used. Mr Sonntag's response to the 2007 presentation was to recommend the company stop selling the PE version of the cladding in favour of a fire-retardant (FR) type. He also said Arconic should cut production costs so that the FR version could be produced at the same price as the cheaper PE version. The company did pursue this strategy but kept the PE version on the market until after the Grenfell fire, when the role of the product in allowing flames to spread had become clear. Because three key French Arconic employees won't give evidence, Mr Millett said open questions remained, including whether Mr Sonntag's recommendations were fully discussed by the company.

Some warn the country is now a breeding ground for new variants of the virus, unhindered by effective social distancing and fuelled by vaccine shortages. That's because the longer a virus circulates in a country, the more chances it has to mutate - in this case giving rise to the P1 variant. Scientists say it is partly the spread of P1 around Brazil that is behind the current devastating upsurge in infections. Read morehere. A minister joined a coronavirus vaccine trial after seeing misinformation about jabs being tested on ethnic minorities. Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said having a different perspective from colleagues helped identify ""early warning signals"" ahead of the vaccine roll out. She told a committee of MPs: ""You will remember back in 2020 we didn't even know if we were going to have a vaccine and the emphasis was actually on trials. ""We could see the misinformation around the vaccine being tested on ethnic minorities and things like that. ""That was one of the reasons why very early on I decided to go on vaccine trials and encouraged others to do so, Nadhim [Zahawi, the vaccines minister] did the same thing. ""All of that was trying to build the confidence in people that this is something that is safe, this is something that we want to encourage as many people as possible to get involved in, and improve their understanding of what trials means."" Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent After heavy criticism over their handling of the procurement and delivery of vaccines, EU leaders are trying to point to the bigger picture. Charles Michel paints the EU as leading the effort to vaccinate the globe. Analysis by the New York Times suggests the EU exported 25 million doses in February, despite production problems in Europe, and that eight million of these were despatched to the UK. Brussels bosses remain deeply frustrated the UK is, as they see it, racing to vaccinate its own citizens before thinking about the wider world. London rejects this. Michel's bitterly disputed ""outright ban"" claim follows Ursula von der Leyen's assertion last month that Britain had a system that effectively blocked the export of vaccines. But the European Commission's chief spokesman said he was aware of no restrictive measures concerning vaccines leaving the UK. Read morehere. Businesses struggling to pay rent as normal due to the pandemic have received a boost in support after the government extended a ban on commercial evictions in England until 30 June. Affected premises, including hospitality venues that cannot trade fully until at least 17 May in England, will be given ""breathing space"" to prepare to reopen, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. Residential tenants facing hardship will see a ban on evictions in England extended until at least 31 May, the housing secretary said as part of the same announcement. Robert Jenrick confirmed a requirement for landlords to provide six-month notice periods to tenants before they are evicted will also be extended until at least 31 May. Residential evictions were banned in most circumstances at the start of the first pandemic lockdown last March until September when courts began to clear a backlog, beginning with the most serious cases. Mr Jenrick called a so-called ""Christmas truce"", meaning bailiffs were not allowed to enforce possession orders between 11 December and 11 January, before a ban was re-introduced for the current lockdown. The number of patients in intensive care has reached a new high in theCzech Republic, asseveral Central European countries struggle with a new waveof the virus. Czech authorities have started to send patients to Poland for treatment, as its facilities struggled to cope. InHungarythe number of cases in the current wave has surpassed the previous peak in December and it has one of the highest recent fatality rates in the world. Cases are also on the rise inPoland, where the government recorded the highest number of daily cases since late November on Wednesday, with 17,260 new infections. The EU has been widely criticised for the slow pace of immunisations, and initial delays were partially blamed on Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca failing to supply doses to member states. Read morehere.  Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has told MPs that 94% of the UK adult population have said they were likely or very likely to take up the coronavirus vaccine. He told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee: ""When I took this job on back in mid-November, I think if you look at the ONS data or other published polls, vaccine positivity was in the high 70s, touching 80%. ""It's now at 94% of the UK adult population saying that they are likely or very likely to take the vaccine. ""I think that is, for your committee, the best measure that the strategy is working, watching that number continue to climb - the highest probably in the world, I think, if I'm not mistaken, in terms of vaccine positivity."" A total of 22,809,829 people have received their first Covid vaccination in the UK, the latestgovernment data shows.,external And 1,254,353 people have received their second dose as well. A further 190 deaths of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days have been recorded in the UK, the government'sdaily figures show.,external This takes the total number of deaths using that measure to 124,987. There were also 5,926 positive cases recorded in the last 24 hours. This is down from last Wednesday when there were 315 deaths and 6,385 positive cases reported. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government's refusal to let pupils have follow-up tests to confirmpositive Covid results is ""ruining"" their return to school, parents say. They are reporting cases of families having to isolate after a child tests positive at school - even when more reliable tests show a negative result. Pupils at secondary schools are being offered three lateral-flow tests following their return to school. But the rapid-testing policy does not allow them to have the more accurate lab-based PCR tests to overrule these in-school tests. Experts say the risk of ""false positives"" among the rapid tests is high, with the Royal Statistical Society believing more positive results could be wrong than right this week. But the situation will change after next week when pupils will be allowed to do tests at home and a positive result will need to be followed up with a PCR test. Any guidance advising people in Wales to ""stay-local"" as lockdown is eased is likely to differ depending on where people live, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething suggested people living in rural areas might be able to travel further to access facilities easily available to people in urban areas. He says there could be a ""few weeks"" of stay-local guidance. Last year,a stay-local rule was in placeas the strict lockdown was eased, with guidance - rather than law - that people should stay within five miles of home. This led to some people arguing it discriminated against people living in rural areas who needed to travel further, for example to see family members. Ministers have previously pointed to an opening of holiday accommodation for the Easter period, which Gething acknowledged would not be feasible if a stay-local policy was in place. Here's more on the stay-local guidance. Mutations that make coronavirus more transmissible and more deadly highlight ""how dangerous this virus could potentially be"" in the future, a leading data scientist has said. Dr Leon Danon told BBC Radio 4's World at One new research suggested the virus variant first found in Kent was up to twice as deadly as the previous variants in circulation (see post at11:44). He cautioned that the overall risk of death for those who catch the virus remains relatively low - perhaps less than half a percent for those with the Kent variant. But he said a central estimate suggested the Kent variant was 64% more deadly when cases were compared like-for-like with another common variant. Danon said the effort now should be on reducing infections to avoid further mutations. ""The only way it is going to be able to mutate is if it is able to go between people,"" he said. ""We really need to be working hard to keep the rate of infections low."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"It is still too early to book foreign summer holidays, the transport secretary has said, despite countries saying they hope to welcome vaccinated British tourists from May. Grant Shapps said there were ""lots of questions"" to answer about ""how safe it will be in June to travel"". People in England could be allowed to go on holiday abroad from 17 May at the earliest, according to current plans. A Greek minister said his country hoped to welcome visitors from mid-May. Cyprus and Portugal are alsoamong the countries keen to welcome UK visitors. Under the current rules, foreign travel from the UK is bannedapart from for exceptional reasons. While 17 May has been marked as the date that rule could change - the decision is subject to a review closer to the time. According tothe latest figures,external, another 190 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, and a further 5,926 positive cases have been reported. When can I go on holiday in the UK or travel abroad? Will there be 'vaccine passports' and will I need one? Which countries trigger hotel quarantine? UK domestic cruises 'could restart in May' Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether it was too early to book a summer holiday, Mr Shapps said: ""Yes."" He added: ""We have said it will remain illegal to travel internationally until at least 17 May - that's an at-the-earliest date."" Mr Shapps said people should look towards 12 April, when he would publish a global travel taskforce report, and said the government was weighing up not only the ""extraordinary"" UK vaccination rollout but also other countries' vaccine programmes. ""So there are lots of questions, the answer to which we simply don't know yet, about how safe it will be in June to travel around,"" he said. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have not set a date for the start of international travel. Once travel is allowed again, the success of the UK vaccination programme is likely to make British holidaymakers attractive to countries looking to rebuild their tourism sectors, which have been badly hit by the pandemic. Greece tourism minister Haris Theoharis said his country hoped to welcome foreign tourists from 14 May, during an appearance at a travel trade show. He said: ""Regarding 2021, in Greece we are more than optimistic."" Visitors will be required to have been vaccinated, have had a recent negative Covid-19 test or have coronavirus antibodies, he said.

"These officers are among the first defectors to share eyewitness accounts of what they say is happening inside Myanmar Police officers from Myanmar have told the BBC they fled across the border into India after refusing to carry out the orders of the military which seized power in a coup last month. In some of the first such interviews, more than a dozen defectors told us they escaped, fearing they'd be forced to kill or harm civilians. ""I was given orders to shoot at protesters. I told them I can't."" For nine years Naing - whose name we have changed for his safety -  served as a policeman in Myanmar, also known as Burma. Now, the 27-year-old is in hiding in the north-east Indian state of Mizoram. I met him, and a group of  policemen and women in their twenties, who say they ran away from their jobs back home, after refusing to carry out orders. ""I was afraid that I would be forced to kill or harm innocent people who are protesting against the military,"" one officer said. ""We feel that it was wrong for the military to overthrow an elected government."" Ever since the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, seized power on 1 February, thousands of pro-democracy protesters have taken to the streets. Protesters have taken to the streets in their thousands since the coup - and have been met with increasing force Security forces have been accused of killing more than 50 people. Naing, who is a low-ranking officer from a town in the west of the country, says protests in his area began to escalate at the end of February. He says he ran, after refusing twice to fire at demonstrators. ""I told my boss I couldn't do that, and that I was going to side with the people. ""The military is edgy. They are becoming more and more brutal."" As we speak, Naing pulls out his phone to show me photos of the family he left behind - a wife, and two daughters aged just five and six months. ""I am worried that it may not be possible to meet them again,"" he told me. The BBC met the group less than 10 miles from their home country, Myanmar I met him and the rest of the group in an undisclosed location, overlooking the hills and valleys of the mountainous state of Mizoram, their home country of Myanmar less than 10 miles (16km) away from where we were chatting. The officers we spoke to are among the first defectors to share eyewitness accounts of what they say is happening inside the country. They say they're part of a growing number of officials who are joining the pro-democracy, civil disobedience movement (CDM) in the country. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why?

The BBC was unable to independently verify any of the claims made by the police who spoke to us. The UN, the US and a host of other countries have condemned the killing of civilians in the crackdown against anti-coup protesters in Myanmar, and called on the authorities to exercise restraint. The military has dismissed criticism of its actions and said it is ready to withstand sanctions and isolation after it seized power. According to local officials, more than 100 people have escaped from Myanmar to Mizoram since the military coup. Local officials say more than 100 people have escaped from Myanmar to Mizoram since the military coup Htut - not his real name - recalls the night the military junta overthrew the government, after the internet was shut down and an army post was erected close to his station. ""A few hours later we learned the military had staged a coup."" Htut, who is 22, says he and other police were paired with members of the military as they patrolled the streets. Protesters who were peacefully banging utensils in support of the pro-democracy movement were threatened with arrest. Htut, who is from a large city in Myanmar, says he too was asked to fire at protesters, a demand he refused. ""The military officer in charge ordered us to shoot people coming out in groups of more than five. I know that people were beaten up. I had sleepless nights. ""When I saw innocent people bleeding, my conscience wouldn't permit me to take part in such evil acts."" Htut says he was the only one from his police station to flee, making the journey by motorbike. He says he was terrified as he passed from village to village to reach the border with India. Those we spoke to crossed into India over the Tiau river, which we visited. The 250-mile stretch of river forms part of the boundary between India and Myanmar. The Tiau river on the border is where the defectors crossed into India from Myanmar Groups we've spoken to say they expect more police to make this journey to India in the coming days. Grace, whose name we have changed, is one of two female police officers we met who has defected. She said she saw the military use sticks and rubber bullets to round up protesters, and on one occasion tear gas being fired into a group which included children. ""They wanted us to disperse the crowds, and arrest our friends, but we couldn't do it,"" she said. ""We love the police, but now the system has changed, we can't continue our job."" Grace says she had no choice but to leave her family behind The 24-year-old says she also wrestled with leaving her family back home, in particular her mother who has a serious heart condition. ""My parents are old, and they're also afraid. But we young people have no choice but to flee and leave them behind."" Authorities in Myanmar have asked India to return any defectors, to ""uphold friendly relations"". Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga said those who have arrived should be given temporary shelter, while the national government decides what to do next. Local groups have told us they expect many more defectors to make the journey to India in the coming days.

"This video can not be played The UK has not ""blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components"", the PM tells the Commons Boris Johnson has ""corrected"" European Council President Charles Michel after he claimed the UK had imposed an ""outright ban"" on the export of Covid-19 vaccines. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said the government had ""not blocked"" any sales to other countries. Mr Michel had said his claim about the UK's position was based on ""facts"". But the Foreign Office summoned an EU official to explain what it called the president's ""incorrect assertions"". The argument over vaccine exports comes at a time when European leaders are under pressure over the slow distribution of jabs. In the UK, meanwhile, more than 22.5 million people - around a third of the population - have received their first dose. EU backtracks on vaccine export controls for NI Urgent reset needed on NI trade rules - Gove Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Mr Johnson told MPs he was ""proud"" of the progress made, adding that the UK had alsodonated Â£548mto the Covax initiative, set up to distribute vaccines around the world. The Gavi vaccines alliance, which co-runs the scheme, told the BBC this would pay for ""more than 70 million"" of the two billion doses expected to be given this year. Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""correct the suggestion from the European Council president that the UK has blocked vaccine exports"", adding: ""Let me be clear: we have not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components."" Mr Johnson said he was against ""vaccine nationalism in all its forms"" and called on all countries to ""work together to tackle this pandemic"". After heavy criticism over their handling of the procurement and delivery of vaccines, EU leaders are trying to point to the bigger picture. Charles Michel paints the EU as leading the effort to vaccinate the globe. Analysis by the New York Times suggests the EU exported 25 million doses in February, despite production problems in Europe, and that eight million of these were despatched to the UK. Brussels bosses remain deeply frustrated the UK is, as they see it, racing to vaccinate its own citizens before thinking about the wider world. London rejects this. Mr Michel's bitterly disputed ""outright ban"" claim follows Ursula von der Leyen's assertion last month that Britain had a system that effectively blocked the export of vaccines. But the European Commission's chief spokesman said he was aware of no restrictive measures concerning vaccines leaving the UK. In his weekly briefing note on Tuesday,,externalMr Michel said: ""The United Kingdom and the United States have imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory."" After the UK government insisted this was not true,Mr Michel tweeted,externalthat there were ""different ways of imposing bans or restrictions on vaccines/medicines"". But he did not elaborate on this. At the European Commission's press briefing in Brussels, spokesman Eric Mamer declined to comment on Mr Michel's statements. He added that Mr Johnson and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had had a phone call ""some time ago"", during which he had ""assured her the UK did not have any issue when it came to the delivery of vaccines to the European Union"". The EU was a ""very, very active exporter of vaccines, and that is not necessarily the case of all our partners"", Mr Mamer said. The EU has faced production problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. In January, it introduced a system of controls on exports, requiring manufacturers to seek permission from national governments for planned sales. The EU also drafted regulations which would haveoverridden the Northern Ireland Protocol- agreed with the UK last year - potentially allowing it to stop vaccines bound for Northern Ireland. But it backed down following widespread criticism.

"Tesco is rolling out collection points for soft plastic packaging like crisp packets, pet food pouches and bread bags at stores in England and Wales. The supermarket chain is aiming to establish a nationwide recycling network for these harder to process plastics. Currently most soft plastic ends up in landfill. The recycled material will be used to package food, household and beauty products, Tesco said. The supermarket said it prioritised reducing the plastic packaging it used, but that the new service would also have ""a real impact"". ""Where plastic serves an important purpose such as reducing food waste, these new recycling points make sure that every piece can be easily recycled,"" said Sarah Bradbury, Tesco's director of quality. What do you do with 86 tonnes of celeriac? Tesco urged by investors to sell more healthy food Lockdown pet boom 'causing food pouch shortages' The roll-out will start with new collection points at 171 stores in the south west of England and in Wales. During a 10-store trial in 2018 Tesco said the most commonly returned packaging was bread bags, fruit and vegetable packaging, crisp packets, salad bags, and baby and pet food pouches. Customers may return packaging bought from other retailers as well as Tesco's own packaging, however they will need to clean items that are heavily soiled and take them back to participating stores, while the rest of their recycling is collected at the kerbside. Tesco said it expected to collect 1,000 tonnes of soft plastic a year. One estimate suggests UK supermarketsproduce 800,000 tonnes of plastic,externalevery year, although they don't make figures publicly available. What do you find hardest to recycle and why? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Packaging food correctly helps to avoid food spoiling and going to waste, causing higher carbon emissions. However campaign groups have urged producers to switch to packaging materials that are easier to recycle and to improve labelling so shoppers know how to dispose of each item. ""Our research has shown that almost half of grocery packaging used by supermarkets is not widely recyclable, so it is good to see Tesco widening its recycling facilities to help consumers dispose of packaging in a more sustainable way,"" said Michael Briggs, Head of Sustainability at consumer group Which?. ""To further reduce the waste that goes to landfill, the government should make recycling labels on food packaging mandatory, simple and clear, enabling shoppers to know exactly how to dispose of packaging on the products they consume."" In 2018 Which? examined the packaging of a typical household shop at eleven UK supermarkets. It found only 52% of the packaging could go into household recycling bins and that 42% of products lacked adequate labelling. Which? pinpointed products like KitKat, Babybel and Pringles, that came in packaging that was particularly challenging to dispose of. Last year, Which? examined the recyclability of 89 branded grocery products sold in UK supermarkets. Only 30 of the 89 items were in fully recyclable packaging. When it grouped the items into categories, it found that some products had packaging that was particularly difficult to recycle. For example, 93% of the packaging generated by the snacks and crisps products could not be recycled, either at the kerbside or at collection points. David Moon, head of business collaboration at Wrap, which campaigns to reduce packaging waste, also welcomed Tesco's move as ""a step in the right direction"". ""We need all supermarkets to collect all plastic films, adopt consistent messaging and share their insights to make this work,"" he added. Wrap said its research showed at least a quarter of people would be wiling to take plastic bags and wrappers back to the supermarket, but that the key was to make sure the services were convenient to use. Many UK brands and retailers have signed up to the UK Plastics Pact, committing them to remove by 2025 all packaging that cannot be recycled. Several have introduced in-store recycling collections. Sainsbury's, the UK's second largest supermarket, collects and recycles carrier bags and some other soft plastic packaging, such as the bags that apples and pears are sold in. Items can be handed to home delivery drivers or taken into stores. Sainsbury's is also trialling the collection in some stores of polypropylene film and plastic, typically used to wrap salad, frozen food and cakes. Waitrose said it also accepted carrier bags and plastic films, during deliveries and in-store and was currently planning a trial to expand the flexible plastics it accepts. Morrisons said it was reducing plastic use overall and already had in-store recycling bins to collect plastic bags, films and wraps. The Co-op has trialled collection at 50 of its stores of a range of plastic types similar to those that Tesco plans to collect. Wrap said that overall, the UK recycled about half of its plastic packaging. What do you do with 86 tonnes of celeriac?

"Sarah Everard has been described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" Police investigating the disappearance of Sarah Everard are searching a home and woodland in Kent following the arrest of a serving Met officer. The 33-year-old was last seen in Clapham, south London, on 3 March. The policeman and a woman were arrested at a house in Kent on Tuesday. Searches are being carried out at a building in Deal as well as on land near Ashford. The Met said it was ""shocking and deeply disturbing"" that the arrested man was a serving officer. Ms Everard's family have been kept updated, the force added. An area of woodland near Ashford is being searched by police Met Police officers have been searching land near to Great Chart Golf and Leisure in Ashford, Kent A tent has been erected outside a house in Deal and a car was earlier seen being taken away from the property. Officers have also been carrying out searches on land near to Great Chart Golf and Leisure in Ashford. Retired farmer Derek Batt, 72, of nearby Fridd Farm, said officers visited his property late on Tuesday. He said: ""They said they were investigating a missing person. I said 'is it Sarah that I have seen on TV?' and she (the officer) said 'yes'."" Mr Batt said he had not seen any suspicious activity in the area. Fridd Farm is located almost three miles away from Great Chart Golf and Leisure complex In a statement, the Met Police said the man and the woman had both been taken into custody at a London police station. Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said the arrests were ""a serious and significant development"". ""We will continue to work with all speed on this investigation but the fact that the arrested man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing."" During a later statement, he added the officer ""was not on duty at the time"" when Ms Everard went missing and would only confirm he had been arrested ""in connection"" with her disappearance. He also would not say if the officer was known to the 33-year-old. This video can not be played Met Police Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave: Arrest of officer ""shocking and deeply disturbing"" When asked by reporters if police believed she was still alive, Mr Ephgrave replied: ""We are searching as hard as we can to find Sarah, so we really hope that is the case.

"The M4 around Newport is historically Wales' busiest stretch of road A UK government project will examine the case for the M4 relief road and upgrades along the A55, according to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Major road projects in Wales have been the responsibility of Welsh ministers in Cardiff since devolution in 1999. But a Westminster review says there is a strong case for a pan-UK network. The Welsh government said there were ""important"" parts of the review but warned UK ministers not to ""trample over devolution"". Mr Shapps said he wanted to work with the Welsh government to get both roads - which have suffered from congestion over the years - ""fixed"". He said a Â£20m scheme off the back of the review - which is looking at a number of transport projects - would look at Wales' two busiest and most congested roads. Four trains an hour pledge for 'Cinderella' line UK ministers 'could bypass Welsh Government' on M4 'Better public transport' needed for M4 congestion The Welsh government has previously saidthe relief road was a matter for Wales. The report looks at rail, road, air and maritime transport, with the review also looking at a ferry link between Holyhead and Northern Ireland. Mr Shapps denied the UK government wanted to take control of building trunk roads from the Welsh government adding: ""This isn't about powers."" ""There's lots of areas we already work closely together, rail infrastructure for example, which we already work on together,"" he told BBC Wales. The now-scrapped relief road was proposed as a solution to tackling congestion on the M4 around Newport The Â£1.6bn M4 relief road was axed by the Welsh government in 2019over cost and its impact on the environmentfollowing ministers inWales declaring a climate emergency. To build roads in Wales, the UK government would need to change the laws that govern the country unless it worked with Welsh ministers. It is not clear in the review how a pan-UK network would be implemented and the study is being led by Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy. An interim report says that following conversations with stakeholders ""the review believes that there is a strong strategic case for a new pan-UK transport network"". Both the A55 and the M4 in south-east Wales are identified by the report as being of interest to the review. It says that UK government funding would, like former EU funding for the TransEuropean Network for Transport, ""be used to add to existing funding streams, to enable higher capacity, faster, and more reliable connectivity"". This video can not be played This video reveals the possible route of the M4 relief road Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for a UK-wide transport strategy in the Telegraph on Tuesday, saying the Welsh Labour government has ""mystifyingly junked"" the M4 relief road after spending Â£144m. Now, speaking to BBC Wales, Mr Shapps said: ""The A55, people know, gets very choca-bloca if you're trying to get through to Manchester and Liverpool and north Wales. The review will also look at the A55 dual carriageway which runs across the north Wales coast The minister said: ""We've already been speaking to the Welsh government throughout, for example with Ken Skates in Welsh government who broadly welcomes this, and I think everyone's keen to make that connection between England and Wales work a lot more smoothly. ""And we know the M4 - there's been a lot of talk about an M4 relief road - or indeed the Welsh government through the Burns review has looked at different solutions to that. ""This is really just to say, 'brilliant, let's work together to get them fixed'."" Is there One Direction for new M4 stretch? Tunnels' jams 'cost Â£31m in lost time' 'Unique' tunnels celebrate 50th birthday Mr Shapps said the review ""says we will primarily look to work with devolved administrations - the Welsh government in this case - to help to build, construct, with assistance where appropriate, and maintain these things"". The transport minister added ""the M4 relief road was the most obvious way"" to deal with congestion. The UK government said it would fund a Â£20m project to look at a wide-range of projects across the UK that were identified by the review. It will look at rail improvements in south-east Wales, building on ideas from the Welsh government's Burns Commission which proposed spendingÂ£800m on public transportto deal with the bottlenecks on the M4 around Newport, as well as the wider motorway. Grant Shapps said he was investing Â£20m to kickstart work on projects identified in the review Mr Shapps said: ""I'm putting in Â£20m to kickstart work on some of these projects so we can get to the appropriate answers like what happens to the A55 in north Wales connecting England? ""What happens with the M4 - whether the relief road is the right approach or whether some other sort of Burns report type approach - is a question we can answer in the process."" During the interview, Mr Shapps said: ""I think I'm right in saying something like a quarter of Welsh people actually work in England."" Figures from Stats Wales showed that in 2019, 98,500 of 1.4m working Welsh residents commute outside of Wales - 6.8%. A spokesman for the Welsh government said: ""As a Welsh government we are clear. There are some important areas coming out of this Union Connectivity Review where governments across the UK can and should work collaboratively, respecting each other's powers, to create a stronger transport network. ""Today's review recognises the success of transport devolution and highlights the important role the recent Burns recommendations are to addressing issues like congestion on the M4. ""But if the UK government simply want to ignore all of that, including the content of their own report, and use this as yet another attempt to trample over the devolution settlement - just as it is with the Levelling Up Fund - then we will get nowhere."" Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts accused the UK government of seeking to split Wales into north and south, with an obsession that ""all roads lead to London"". ""Proper cross-border links are of course needed. But any ambition to improve cross-border transport must prioritise improving transport links within Wales first as an essential foundation for improved cross-border connections."" The interim report says the review will also look at faster and higher capacity connections for passengers from HS2 to Scotland and north Wales. Rail upgrades in south-east Wales to Bristol are also being discussed, as well as whether there should be a new ferry route from Holyhead to Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile it is is assessing the feasibility of abridge or tunnel between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Part of the UK government's strategy to ""boost the union"" at the moment is to invest in projects - particularly infrastructure - around the UK, which can then be branded as ""UK government funded"". This review looking at transport links between the four nations appears to be their latest tool to do this. At times some Conservative MPs and figures in UK government have expressed frustration that they hadn't, until a new law passed last year, kept hold of powers as a central UK government to invest in devolved areas like road infrastructure in the nations. But the strategy hasn't always made them popular with the Welsh government who have accused them of trying to ride roughshod over devolved responsibilities. So what's not clear is: what happens if the UK government decide a project like the M4 relief road, which Welsh ministers scrapped, is a solution they want to invest in? UK ministers 'could bypass Welsh Government' on M4 Million spent on M4 road homes weeks before axe 'Better public transport' needed for M4 congestion Prime minister has 'no say' on the M4 relief road Â£114m spent on axed M4 road project M4 relief road axed by Welsh Government Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

The change will take place from Friday Communal worship will resume from 26 March. Social distancing needs to be applied but groups of 50 will be able to gather Next week the first minister will give indicative dates for the opening of shops, hairdressers, gyms and hospitality In the week ending 7 March, 141 additional deaths linked to Covid-19 have been registered.

John Mason asks the first minister if Police Scotland's Covid strategy of only using enforcement as a last resort has been working. Ms Sturgeon believes it has and adds the force has responded ""very well"" to the crisis. She adds: ""The vast majority of people have complied with all the restrictions."" Willie Coffey MSP says he takes prides in reading that it was a Scottish doctor, Alexander Wood, who is widelycredited with inventing the modern-day hypodermic syringe- thanks for the plug, Mr Coffey - and asks whether there is more we could be dong to assist other countries with their vaccination programme. Nicola Sturgeon says ""absolutely"" and despite being ""really pleased"" with the vaccine rollout in the UK, she says ""we kid ourselves on"" if we think just vaccinating our own population solves a
global pandemic for us. We will be this pandemic as long as other countries are in
it, the first minister points out. We have a shared interest â not just out of altruism, but actually a ""selfish self-interest"" - in other countries getting themselves vaccinated as well, she says. The Scottish government has already helped prepare health systems in countries like Malawi,
Zambia and Rwanda for distribution of the vaccine through its international development
programme, Ms Sturgeon adds. Since around September, it has also carried out a review of its approach with a view to ring-fencing some funding for Covid-specific responses. Stuart McMillan MSP asks the chief medical officer whether we are likely to need an annual, or regular, vaccine - akin to the flu vaccine - to help us live with Covid in the future. Dr Gregor Smith says it is âhighly likelyâ we will get into regular vaccination updates for this virus, but he canât say with confidence yet what form those updates will take. We still donât know how long the immunity the vaccinations confer lasts for, he points out. Once we have more information about that, we will be able to say what any 'booster programme' looks like, Dr Smith says. But given the new variants that are emerging around the world, for that
reason alone it is ""almost inevitable"" that more vaccinations will be required, he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Annabelle Ewing concludes her questions by asking the first minister when people can expect to go to the hairdressers? The first minister says she is not able to give a date but adds: ""I can give you a 100% assurance though that I will not delay our ability to visit the hairdresser any longer than is necessary. ""I am saying that out of pure self-interest, as you can see. ""There are still conspiracy theories that circulate on social media from time to time that I have got a secret hairdresser somewhere."" Ms Sturgeon jokes: ""I can say, firstly, that's not true and, secondly, I don't know how anybody looking at me right now could reach that conclusion. ""No hairdresser is responsible, or would take responsibility, for this."" Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, asks the first minister about the amount of in-school time for S1-S3 pupils when they return to classrooms partially from next Monday, 15 March. Mr Rennie says it will be less than two hours a week for some pupils, and asks whether the first minister still plans to go ahead with the proposed arrangements. Nicola Sturgeon says yes she does, though she appreciates there will be different views on the matter. The judgement the government had to make was whether to have no provision at all for S1-S3s until after Easter,
or some limited time before the holidays. The concern was not just about the educational impact but their wellbeing and being separated from friends, she explains. ""I appreciate this puts pressure on teachers and local authorities but we are trying to get back to full-time provision as quickly as possible,"" she adds, even if it is partial and phased and limited initially. There is nothing perfect or ideal here; we are trying to balance considerations in the best way possible."" Nicola Sturgeon Mark Ruskell MSP asks the first minister about self isolation support grants and whether they should be universal. The first minister says she would not be averse to such a position if the Scottish government's budget was unlimited as it would remove the application process. But she adds: ""We wouldn't have the financial cover and wherewithal to pay for that at times when the levels of virus and the numbers of people requiring to self isolate are anywhere near what they have been in recent times."" Ms Sturgeon says it ""becomes more possible"" if prevalence was low but admits she is concerned at what would happen in the event of a surge in cases. As well as financial support, she adds there is provision to help people who live on their own and those who need to be put in alternative accommodation to self isolate. Another 141 deaths were recorded last week where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate,according to the National Records for Scotland (NRS),external. It's a decrease of 89 deaths on the previous week and the sixth time in a row that the number of weekly deaths has fallen. The NRS said the ""fastest decrease"" in deaths was in care homes, which now account for 10% of all Covid-19 deaths. The total number of Covid deaths in Scotland using the NRS measure is now 9,725.

The first minister says there has been ""targeted investment"" to help those who need it most, from additional money to support local authority service delivery to food insecurity. She also says ministers must not only focus on long-standing inequalities across society. There is also a need for us to continue to look with a fresh eye at some of the new inequalities that have been created by the pandemic and how we best respond to them.""

The Covid-19 committee was set up last Spring and met for the first time in late April 2020. Scottish Conservatives MSP Donald Cameron is the current convener of the committee, with Scottish Labourâs Monica Lennon the deputy convener. In total, nine MSPs are on the committee today, including the SNPâs Willie Coffey, Annabelle Ewing, Stuart McMillan and John Mason. Maurice Corry is the other Conservative member, with Mark Ruskell representing the Scottish Greens today and Willie Rennie the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The committee's official remit, in case you were wondering, is ""to consider and report on the Scottish Governmentâs response to Covid-19 including the operation of powers under the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act, the Coronavirus Act and any other legislation in relation to the response to Covid-19 and any secondary legislation arising from the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act and any other legislation in relation to the response to Covid-19.â Donald Cameron, the committee convener, also asks the first minister about the potential
extension of coronavirus legislation, citing a ""strong argument"" that it may be better to take stock after a year when so much has happened. Nicola Sturgeon says she has ""a lot of sympathy"" on the question of emergency
legislation and she doesn't want it to be in place ""for a minute longer than it has
to be"". But we are still in an emergency situation, says the first minister, so it is important there is a
degree of flexibility, which is why the government thinks the extension is appropriate and it is ""proportionate"" to
continue with it Ms Sturgeon reminds the committee that the extension would be until September, and it would be up to an incoming administration to judge whether to extend it beyond September, following the Scottish Parliament elections in May. Hundreds of millions of adults around the world can expect to be vaccinated against Covid over the next few months. It will be delivered by hypodermic syringe - but who invented it? Most people with access to healthcare take vaccinations for granted. The syringe that is now being used to provide protection against Covid may look simple enough - but appearances can be deceptive. It took millennia to create the hypodermic syringe in a form that was to allow mass vaccinations to take place today. An Irish surgeon, Francis Rynd, and French physician, Charles Pravaz, made a huge contribution to the field in the mid-19th Century. But it was a Scottish doctor, Alexander Wood, who is now widely credited with inventing the modern-day hypodermic syringe. Readmore here. Committee convenor Donald Cameron asks the chief medical officer about the vaccine rollout. He asks what the expected weekly vaccination rate is likely to be by mid-April. Dr Smith says the weekly vaccination rate is going to be ""wholly determined"" by the supplies coming into the country at that point in time. The first minister later says she hopes to get the rate up to 400,000 a week ""as supplies permit"". And she adds the government hopes to have vaccinated the entire adult population by the end of July. Scotland chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith says the country is dealing with a ""very different situation"" than it faced when the first lockdown ended last summer. He says: ""The virus that we are now dealing with is a completely different virus, certainly in the way that it behaves than we have become used to."" Dr Smith adds the current ""measured"" approach is essential to prevent the balance being tipped in the virus' favour again. He says: ""There is a very real risk that will happen if we move too quickly"". Dr Smith tells the committee the virus is now somewhere between 30% and 70% more transmissible. The change to the rules will allow four people from two households to meet anywhere outdoors, including in gardens Up to four adults from two different households will be able to meet outdoors in Scotland from Friday of this week. The current rules only allow outdoor meetings between two adults from two households. Restrictions on young people will also be eased, with four people aged between 12-17 able to meet even if they are all from different households. Outdoor non-contact group sports for adults will also restart on Friday. And people will be able to gather for communal worship from 26 March, so long as no more than 50 people are in attendance and physical distancing is maintained throughout. Readmore here. Asked about the easing of coronavirus restrictions, the first minister says the exit from lockdown ""may be slower than everyone wants it to be"". Ms Sturgeon says her focus is to make it ""steady and one-directional"" rather than
going too fast now and finding we take ""one step forward and two steps back"". The first minister says a bit of caution at this stage is the ""best mitigation"" against that possibility.

"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland's objective must be ""to eliminate"" coronavirus. She told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that striving to get new case numbers as low as possible was the only way to keep it under control. Ms Sturgeon said ""the virus won't play ball"" with any effort to maintain case numbers at a ""medium level"". The Scottish government has begun to ease some lockdown restrictions, although a stay at home order remains. Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said he did not believe coronavirus could be ""eradicated"", but said an elimination strategy of driving case numbers as low as possible would make outbreaks more manageable. Scotland eases rules on people meeting outdoors What Covid rules are changing, and when? The government has brought forward some ""relatively minor"" easing of restrictions, with an increase in the number of people who are allowed to mix outdoors to begin on Friday. Ms Sturgeon will set out a more detailed timetable for lifting lockdown next week, with the government aiming to return to a regional ""levels"" system of local restrictions by late April. She told MSPs that the country was ""heading firmly in the right direction right now"", but said ""we cannot afford to take our foot off the brake too soon"". The vaccination programme is widely seen as being one of the key ways out of the pandemic The first minister told Holyrood's Covid-19 committee that the exit from lockdown ""may be slower than everyone wants it to be"". She said her focus was for easing to be ""steady and one-directional"", rather than going too quickly and taking ""one step forward and two steps back"". Ms Sturgeon backed an ""elimination"" strategy of driving virus levels as low as possible. She said: ""With a virus like this, what you absolutely can't do is just say we're going to let it simmer at this medium level, like a gently simmering pot. ""You can't just say you'll accept X number of cases a year and X number of deaths and X number of hospitalisations a year.  The virus won't behave, it won't play ball with you like that. She added: ""You have to have an approach, in my view, where our objective has to be to eliminate. Even if you don't quite achieve elimination it is the act of trying to get it as low as possible that keeps it under control."" The Scottish Greens believed that if elimination was achievable there had to be a ""step up"" on testing and better support for those who needed to self-isolate. MSP Mark Ruskell, who sits on the committee, said: ""It is welcome that the first minister has moved away from talking about suppression of the virus and is now talking about eliminating it. The Scottish Greens support an elimination strategy, as pursued by countries like New Zealand, but to get there we need to see more ambition on testing and support to self-isolate."" He added that when restrictions are ""gradually lifted"", workplaces would need the support of a ""robust testing regime"" to prevent the virus from spreading. The change to the rules will allow four people from two households to meet anywhere outdoors, including in gardens Dr Gregor Smith said driving case numbers low would allow for outbreaks to be managed, in the same way as outbreaks of infectious diseases like measles. He said: ""What we mean by eliminate is not to eradicate the virus. Its my view that we won't eradicate Coronavirus. ""But what we can do on a regional basis and gradually expand that internationally is to drive these numbers down to as low a level as possible so it has as little impact on communities as is possible in morbidity and mortality. ""If we can do that then we can then manage the outbreaks, just as we do when we manage measles."" Ms Sturgeon faced a range of questions during the committee session, with Conservative MSP Donald Cameron saying there was a ""strong argument"" for taking stock of whether emergency powers should be extended. The first minister said she did not want emergency legislation to be in place ""for a minute longer than it needs to be"", but said the country was still in a difficult situation and that the government needed flexibility to act. Meanwhile, Labour's Monica Lennon highlighted the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on people from lower income backgrounds. Ms Sturgeon replied that there had been ""targeted investment"" to help those who needed most, saying there was ""a need for us to continue to look with a fresh eye at some of the new inequalities that have been created by the pandemic"".

"Boris Johnson has been urged to give MPs a vote on NHS pay in England, at Prime Minister's Questions. Sir Keir Starmer said a proposed 1% rise amounted to a pay cut once inflation had been taken into account. ""Even his own MPs know he's got this wrong,"" the Labour leader told the PM. Mr Johnson said he would ""study"" what an independent pay review panel says when it reports in May - but the government wanted to give NHS workers a rise, amid a public sector pay freeze. LIVE: Prime Minister's Questions Nurses are well-paid for the job, says minister How much will NHS staff be paid? The government has recommended a 1% increase to the pay body, saying it is all the country can afford at the present time. The NHS in England had budgeted for a 2.1% rise this year before the pandemic, the service's chief Sir Simon Stevens confirmed on Tuesday. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer asks whether nursing staff deserve a bigger rise than the PM's former adviser Dominic Cummings. Sir Keir said the government had broken its promise to health workers - and he accused the PM of choosing to ""shut the door in their face at the first opportunity"", having previously clapped for carers on the steps of Downing Street. He also contrasted the proposed pay deal for the NHS with theÂ£45,000 pay rise awarded to the PM's former adviserDominic Cummings, who has since left Downing Street. Sir Keir said: ""The mask really is slipping and we can see what the Conservative Party now stands for - cutting pay for nurses, putting taxes up on families. ""He's had the opportunity to change course but he's refused, so if he's so determined to cut NHS pay, will he at least show some courage and put it to a vote in this Parliament?"" The Labour leaderhighlighted reported comments from unnamed Conservative MPs,externalcalling the proposed pay deal ""inept"" and ""unacceptable"". He claimed NHS pay had ""fallen in real terms by more than Â£800"". Boris Johnson told MPs Sir Keir Starmer voted against the 2019 long-term plan for the NHS, after the Labour leader referred to it. That is not correct - there were no votes on the NHS Funding Bill 2019-20 during its main stages through parliament. Sir Keir had referred to the plan, saying thatit committed the government to a 2.1% pay rise,externalfor the NHS. The government has now recommended that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year. On Tuesday, the head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens told a committee of MPs that the plan had indeed assumed a 2.1% rise. But he also said ""things have changed"" since then and that it should now be up to the pay-review body. Mr Johnson said a ""massive debt"" was owed to NHS workers and the government had asked the review board to treat their pay award ""exceptionally,"" in comparison with other public sector workers. ""We're increasing pay for nurses, we're massively increasing our investment in the NHS,"" he told MPs.

"Sara Manchipp was stalked for eight months New powers to protect stalking victims are not being used by police, a BBC Wales investigation has found. In January 2020,stalking protection orders were introducedto make it easier for victims to get support. But since then only two full orders have been granted in Wales despite 3,000 stalking offences being reported to police. All four Welsh police forces have been asked to comment on the findings by Eye on Wales. The data also shows all four forces in Wales have made an application for an order to the courts, or currently have a application pending on behalf of victims. What to do if you're being stalked New order for stalker investigations has 'teeth' Funding call for stalking victim support Only one by Dyfed-Powys Police was granted, with an interim order given to North Wales Police, which later became a full order. There are calls for better education and training so officers can recognise when action is needed to apply for an order. Det Ch Insp Richard Yelland, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said there were other options aside from protection orders. This video can not be played Former Miss Wales Sarah Manchipp was stalked for eight months ""There are so many tools in our toolbox now thankfully with other legislation,"" he said. ""In those cases where it's appropriate, we will seek to use a protection order."" Former Miss Wales Sarah Manchipp was stalked for eight months. The perpetrator was caught and has now been jailed. She told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme it was difficult to talk about what had happened but she wanted to raise awareness. ""It still affects me, but I want to talk about it and by talking about it I hope it gives confidence to other victims to go to the police. ""To begin with I received Facebook messages from this person saying he was going to rape me and kill me, but I have to say the police were great. ""Officers really took me seriously, but I am disappointed to hear they haven't been using these additional powers - more women need to come forward and talk about their experiences."" Bethan - not her real name to protect her identity - is based in Wales and shared her experience of being stalked and reporting it to the police. ""I'd wake up and have 100 missed calls in an hour, floods of text messages. It was persistent,"" she said. ""He'd also be outside and could tell me what I was wearing and who I was with."" Bethan said the long-lasting effects of the stalker's behaviour were devastating. ""I've got complex PTSD because of this; it made me very ill. I'm constantly on edge all the time."" It took Bethan a long time to recognise she was being stalked. However, once she recognised the behaviours, she reported it to the police several times. ""It was termed 'harassment' when I reported it, but nothing was done so I stopped reporting it,"" she said. This was before stalking protection orders were introduced and Bethan feels they could have made a difference in her situation. ""If they were about for me back then, something would have been done - it would have been taken more seriously,"" she said. ""People should speak out about it now there's these new laws and more support. They're more likely to be believed."" Police now have extra powers with stalking protection orders Stalking protection orders were introduced in January 2020 to police forces in Wales and England. They are civil orders which aim to protect victims, and it is a criminal offence to breach the terms of an order. Police apply to magistrates for an order, which usually remains in place for two years. The idea is that it can be used quickly and an interim order provides immediate protection while a decision is being made. When issued, they can include banning an offender contacting a person through social media, through a third party or being within a certain distance of their home or workplace. There are also solution-based requirements, which aim to tackle the obsessive behaviour traits in the perpetrator. This can include mental health programmes, drug and alcohol support or counselling. Criminologist Professor Jane Monckton Smith, of the University of Gloucestershire, has been working with Dyfed-Powys Police to train officers to spot the signs of stalking. ""It seems to be a postcode lottery to how these protection orders are used, but I don't think many of the forces are using them routinely,"" she said. ""It's not necessarily a very simple process but the more police forces use them, the easier that process will be become."" The Suzy Lamplugh Trust is the UK's leading personal safety charity, which also manages the National Stalking Helpline. Chief executive Suky Bhaker said: ""Overall, the introduction of stalking protection orders is proving to be a positive and useful tool for victims of stalking. ""However, there have been a number of cases where clients have not been adequately supported. ""We know that training varies in the police across Wales and England in stalking and what tools are available to help those victims varies as a result."" Katy Bourne, Police and Crime Commissioner for Sussex, is also a victim of stalking Katy Bourne, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Sussex, is the lead for stalking in Wales and England. She is also a victim of stalking and has urged other forces to use the orders to protect victims. ""We've issued about 30 stalking protection orders and we've got several others in the pipeline,"" she said. ""It says to the victim, 'we take you seriously', and that in itself is such a relief that the police are listening to you and believe you."" A Gwent Police spokesperson said: ""Gwent Police employs a range of tactics to tackle this serious offence. ""This includes education and awareness training for our frontline staff, which has resulted in the successful prosecution of suspects responsible for stalking. ""We've also assisted the courts by providing support to survivors of this crime who are protected by restraining orders. ""Gwent Police will not tolerate this form of behaviour. We take all allegations of stalking seriously and our officers will investigate them thoroughly.""

"This video can not be played The UK has not ""blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components"", the PM tells the Commons Boris Johnson has ""corrected"" European Council President Charles Michel after he claimed the UK had imposed an ""outright ban"" on the export of Covid-19 vaccines. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said the government had ""not blocked"" any sales to other countries. Mr Michel had said his claim about the UK's position was based on ""facts"". But the Foreign Office summoned an EU official to explain what it called the president's ""incorrect assertions"". The argument over vaccine exports comes at a time when European leaders are under pressure over the slow distribution of jabs. In the UK, meanwhile, more than 22.5 million people - around a third of the population - have received their first dose. EU backtracks on vaccine export controls for NI Urgent reset needed on NI trade rules - Gove Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Mr Johnson told MPs he was ""proud"" of the progress made, adding that the UK had alsodonated Â£548mto the Covax initiative, set up to distribute vaccines around the world. The Gavi vaccines alliance, which co-runs the scheme, told the BBC this would pay for ""more than 70 million"" of the two billion doses expected to be given this year. Mr Johnson said he wanted to ""correct the suggestion from the European Council president that the UK has blocked vaccine exports"", adding: ""Let me be clear: we have not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components."" Mr Johnson said he was against ""vaccine nationalism in all its forms"" and called on all countries to ""work together to tackle this pandemic"". After heavy criticism over their handling of the procurement and delivery of vaccines, EU leaders are trying to point to the bigger picture. Charles Michel paints the EU as leading the effort to vaccinate the globe. Analysis by the New York Times suggests the EU exported 25 million doses in February, despite production problems in Europe, and that eight million of these were despatched to the UK. Brussels bosses remain deeply frustrated the UK is, as they see it, racing to vaccinate its own citizens before thinking about the wider world. London rejects this. Mr Michel's bitterly disputed ""outright ban"" claim follows Ursula von der Leyen's assertion last month that Britain had a system that effectively blocked the export of vaccines. But the European Commission's chief spokesman said he was aware of no restrictive measures concerning vaccines leaving the UK. In his weekly briefing note on Tuesday,,externalMr Michel said: ""The United Kingdom and the United States have imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory."" After the UK government insisted this was not true,Mr Michel tweeted,externalthat there were ""different ways of imposing bans or restrictions on vaccines/medicines"". But he did not elaborate on this. At the European Commission's press briefing in Brussels, spokesman Eric Mamer declined to comment on Mr Michel's statements. He added that Mr Johnson and Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had had a phone call ""some time ago"", during which he had ""assured her the UK did not have any issue when it came to the delivery of vaccines to the European Union"". The EU was a ""very, very active exporter of vaccines, and that is not necessarily the case of all our partners"", Mr Mamer said. The EU has faced production problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. In January, it introduced a system of controls on exports, requiring manufacturers to seek permission from national governments for planned sales. The EU also drafted regulations which would haveoverridden the Northern Ireland Protocol- agreed with the UK last year - potentially allowing it to stop vaccines bound for Northern Ireland. But it backed down following widespread criticism.

"This video can not be played Meg Hillier: ""We need to see a clearer connection between testing and stemming the spread of the virus"" The impact of NHS Test and Trace is still unclear - despite the UK government setting aside Â£37bn for it over two years, MPs are warning. The Public Accounts Committee said it was set up on the basis it would help prevent future lockdowns - but since its creation there had been two more. It said the spending was ""unimaginable"" and warned the taxpayer could not be treated like an ""ATM machine"". But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the MPs' report ""defies logic"". Baroness Dido Harding, head of the National Institute for Health Protection, which runs the system, pointed out it had been built from scratch and was now doing more tests than any other comparable country. She said performance had been improving with more people who tested positive being reached and more of their close contacts being asked to isolate. ""It is making a real impact in breaking the chains of transmission,"" she added. But the MPs' report questioned: An over-reliance on consultants, with some paid more than Â£6,600 a day A failure to be ready for the surge in demand for tests seen last September Never meeting its target to turn around tests done face-to-face within 24 hours Contact tracers only having enough work to fill half their time even when cases were rising A splurge on rapid tests with no clear evidence they will help Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said it was hard to point to a ""measurable difference"" the test-and-trace system had made. ""The promise on which this huge expense was justified - avoiding another lockdown - has been broken, twice,"" she said. Test-and-trace 'finds half contacts in some areas' How do I get a coronavirus test? Is NHS Test and Trace working? During Prime Minister's Questions,Boris Johnson was asked why so much money had been spent on the system while the government said a 1% pay rise for NHS staff was all that it could afford. Mr Johnson defended the pay rise, saying NHS workers were getting an increase unlike other public sector workers, and added: ""It is thanks to NHS Test and Trace that we're able to send kids back to school and begin cautiously and irreversibly to reopen our economy and restart our lives."" This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps defended the cost of NHS Test and Trace on BBC Breakfast The cross-party group of MPs was looking at spending on all elements of the NHS Test and Trace system, which despite its name is run separately from the health service. This amounts to Â£22bn in 2020-21 and another Â£15bn in 2021-22. Not all of the money has been allocated yet. But the bulk of it is going on the lab-based PCR testing system, which includes the hundreds of local testing centres and network of mega-labs across the UK to process the tests. Some Â£10bn has been set aside for rapid testing, which is currently being used in schools in England as well as being sent to employers. The money has also been used to set up the 12,000-strong national contact tracing team in England and support councils to run their own local teams. The devolved nations are responsible for contact tracing individually. The committee acknowledges significant investment was needed to set up the system at speed after the pandemic struck. But it criticised an over-use of consultants, saying it needed to ""wean itself off its persistent reliance on consultants"" which were costing an average of Â£1,100 a day each and some of whom had been paid more than Â£6,600 a day. On last count, there were still 2,500 being used, the MPs said. The complexity of the system was also laid bare with news that it had involved more than 400 contracts being signed with 217 different suppliers. Some 70% of the value of those contracts were directly awarded rather than being put out to tender. But the MPs said the investment had helped to massively increase testing capacity. When the pandemic started the UK could only process about 3,000 tests a day, but that had increased to more than 800,000 by January. The committee pointed out that while capacity has grown, the system has still never met its target to turnaround all tests in a face-to-face setting in 24 hours. And it was found lacking at the crucial point in September when there was a surge in demand for testing. By contrast, contact tracers have been under-used with just half of time spent working on cases in October. By January, contact tracers had been in touch with 2.5 million people testing positive and advised more than 4.5 million of their close contact to self-isolate. But it warned compliance with self-isolation seemed to be low. It also raised concerns about the use of rapid on-the-spot tests. Pilots in Liverpool did not show ""clear evidence"" of a reduction in infection levels or hospital cases. Labour's Rachel Reeves said the report showed the system had ""failed the British people"" and underlined the ""epic amounts of waste and incompetence"" in the way Test and Tace had been set up and run. Dr Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, added: ""The promise of a world-beating test-and-trace system has just not materialised, and the eye-watering sums of public money poured into this system are set to increase even further."" He said despite the rollout of the vaccination programme, it would remain an important tool and urged ministers to do more to financially support people to isolate. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast it was ""thanks to Test and Trace"" that UK cases of the variants first identified in South Africa and Brazil had been limited to 285 and six cases respectively. ""Yes, it's been very expensive... but I think the idea that we would be somehow better off without it is crazy,"" he said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the system had been built ""from nothing a year ago"" but had done ""an amazing job"" and he was ""incredibly grateful"". Who can still get free Covid tests?

"A diplomatic row has broken out after the EU's top official claimed the UK had imposed an ""outright ban"" on the export of Covid vaccines. European Council President Charles Michel said it applied to all vaccines and components produced in the UK. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described the suggestion as ""completely false"", the BBC understands. The EU's deputy ambassador to the UK, Nicole Mannion, was summoned to the Foreign Office for ""discussions"". An EU spokesperson said there would be ""no further comment"" on the meeting ""at this stage"". EU backtracks on vaccine export controls for NI Urgent reset needed on NI trade rules - Gove Why is the EU having vaccine problems? The argument over vaccines comes with European leaders under pressure over the slow distribution of jabs. In the UK, meanwhile, 22.5 million people - a third of the population - have received their first dose. In his weekly briefing note,external, Mr Michel said he was ""shocked"" to hear the 27-member bloc being accused of ""vaccine nationalism"" following changes it made to export rules earlier this year. ""Here again, the facts do not lie,"" he wrote. ""The United Kingdom and the United States have imposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory. ""But the European Union, the region with the largest vaccine production capacity in the world, has simply put in place a system for controlling the export of doses produced in the EU."" In response, Mr Raab has written to Mr Michel to ""set the record straight"", saying the ""false claim has been repeated at various levels within the EU and the Commission"". His letter is understood to say: ""The UK government has not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components."" After news of the row broke,Mr Michel tweeted,externalthat there were ""different ways of imposing bans or restrictions on vaccines/medicines"". But he did not elaborate on this comment. The EU has faced production problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. In January, it introduced a system of controls on exports, requiring manufacturers to seek permission from national governments for planned sales. The EU also drafted regulations which would haveoverridden the Northern Ireland Protocol- agreed with the UK last year - potentially allowing it to stop vaccines bound for Northern Ireland. But it backed down following widespread criticism. Earlier this month, Italy blocked a shipment of 250,000 doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia. The UK, which is expected to have a large surplus of vaccines after ordering 400 million doses, has said it will donate most of those left over to poorer countries. France's President Emmanuel Macron has urged richer countries to put aside up to 5% of their current supplies for this purpose.

"Mr Christiansen's favourite Lego is the build-what-you want box of bricks. Danish toy giant Lego plans to recruit hundreds of computer experts in the UK, Denmark and China to expand its digital games and online sales operation. In 2020, the company saw its fastest sales growth in five years, helped by locked-down families buying bigger Lego sets they could make together. But a new Super Mario set, which blends physical bricks with online games, has been one of the biggest launches ever. Boss Niels Christiansen told the BBC Lego would speed up its digital plans. The company has just released Lego VIDIYO, a partnership with Universal Music, which allows children to make their own music videos with special effects and filters. ""For the past two years we've made large-scale investments in initiatives designed to support long-term growth,"" the Lego chief executive said. ""We are accelerating our digital transformation. This is a big investment area for customers and suppliers,"" he said. He told the BBC that every 2.77 seconds ""someone uploads a Lego creation to our digital platforms that they have created and want to share. The Lego community is based on the brick, but this shows there is no limit to where we can take this."" While the Lego brick will always be at the heart of the business, he said: ""Today's children are growing up in a digital world and they effortlessly blend online and physical play."" The stores are key to building the ""brand experience"", the chief executive said. The digital expansion will mean recruiting more computer games and website specialists over the next couple of years, said Mr Christiansen, who praised the UK's expertise in this sector. ""We go where the talent is available. Where we find the best talent is in UK and Denmark. I think the number will be in the hundreds. ""We have a solid digital foundation, but must move faster. The past year has shown the importance of having an agile, responsive business built on strong digital foundations,"" Mr Christiansen said. In addition to its 17 stores - and another due to open in Edinburgh soon - Lego has two UK offices and employs almost 750 people. Despite store closures across the world due to the pandemic, and temporary production shutdowns at factories in China and Mexico, Lego saw a 19% jump in profits to 12.9bn Danish kroner (Â£1.5bn) for 2020. Revenues rose 13% to 43.7bn kroner (Â£5bn). Sales growth in all Lego's markets was in the double-digits. Mr Christiansen said there had been an increase in sales of bigger, more complicated Lego sets. ""Instead of buying Lego sets for kids, families were buying big sets and building them together,"" he said. And the growth in interest for adult Lego sets continues, he added. A strong seller in 2020 - and a favourite of Mr Christiansen - was a complex Lamborghini car. However, his number one favourite is the traditional build-what-you-want box of bricks, which consistently remains in Lego's top ten best sellers each year. Lego is investing heavily to build the brand in China Despite the pandemic, Lego continued with store openings - with another 134 new shops, including 91 in China, expanding the chain to 678. Lego plans to open another 120 sites in 2021, with 80 in China where development of the brand had not been as fast as in Europe and the US. Mr Christiansen said bricks and mortar remained key to Lego's growth, in large part because ""the shops are not about getting the product across the counter"". He said: ""The stores are much more a brand-builder and experience outlet. A lot of the new stores will be in China. It makes a big, big difference if there is a store in town for creating awareness of the brand."" The company, founded in 1932 and still family-owned, is trying to find alternatives to plastic for its bricks. Lego said it could not give a figure for how many were made each year. Mr Christiansen said Lego is investing heavily in researching new materials, but has already introduced more bio-based elements into the manufacturing. The plan remains to introduce a sustainable product by 2030. Finding a quality, long-lasting material was not as easy as people might think. ""Lego sets will be used for 40, 50 years. They will still work even though they might have been lying in the basement until brought out for the grandchildren. ""That lasting quality needs to stay there even when we sustainably source. We cannot just go out and buy that material. We are actually trying to develop it,"" he said.

"These officers are among the first defectors to share eyewitness accounts of what they say is happening inside Myanmar Police officers from Myanmar have told the BBC they fled across the border into India after refusing to carry out the orders of the military which seized power in a coup last month. In some of the first such interviews, more than a dozen defectors told us they escaped, fearing they'd be forced to kill or harm civilians. ""I was given orders to shoot at protesters. I told them I can't."" For nine years Naing - whose name we have changed for his safety -  served as a policeman in Myanmar, also known as Burma. Now, the 27-year-old is in hiding in the north-east Indian state of Mizoram. I met him, and a group of  policemen and women in their twenties, who say they ran away from their jobs back home, after refusing to carry out orders. ""I was afraid that I would be forced to kill or harm innocent people who are protesting against the military,"" one officer said. ""We feel that it was wrong for the military to overthrow an elected government."" Ever since the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, seized power on 1 February, thousands of pro-democracy protesters have taken to the streets. Protesters have taken to the streets in their thousands since the coup - and have been met with increasing force Security forces have been accused of killing more than 50 people. Naing, who is a low-ranking officer from a town in the west of the country, says protests in his area began to escalate at the end of February. He says he ran, after refusing twice to fire at demonstrators. ""I told my boss I couldn't do that, and that I was going to side with the people. ""The military is edgy. They are becoming more and more brutal."" As we speak, Naing pulls out his phone to show me photos of the family he left behind - a wife, and two daughters aged just five and six months. ""I am worried that it may not be possible to meet them again,"" he told me. The BBC met the group less than 10 miles from their home country, Myanmar I met him and the rest of the group in an undisclosed location, overlooking the hills and valleys of the mountainous state of Mizoram, their home country of Myanmar less than 10 miles (16km) away from where we were chatting. The officers we spoke to are among the first defectors to share eyewitness accounts of what they say is happening inside the country. They say they're part of a growing number of officials who are joining the pro-democracy, civil disobedience movement (CDM) in the country. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why?

The BBC was unable to independently verify any of the claims made by the police who spoke to us. The UN, the US and a host of other countries have condemned the killing of civilians in the crackdown against anti-coup protesters in Myanmar, and called on the authorities to exercise restraint. The military has dismissed criticism of its actions and said it is ready to withstand sanctions and isolation after it seized power.

Local officials say more than 100 people have escaped from Myanmar to Mizoram since the military coup Htut - not his real name - recalls the night the military junta overthrew the government, after the internet was shut down and an army post was erected close to his station. ""A few hours later we learned the military had staged a coup."" Htut, who is 22, says he and other police were paired with members of the military as they patrolled the streets. Protesters who were peacefully banging utensils in support of the pro-democracy movement were threatened with arrest. Htut, who is from a large city in Myanmar, says he too was asked to fire at protesters, a demand he refused. ""The military officer in charge ordered us to shoot people coming out in groups of more than five. I know that people were beaten up. I had sleepless nights. ""When I saw innocent people bleeding, my conscience wouldn't permit me to take part in such evil acts."" Htut says he was the only one from his police station to flee, making the journey by motorbike. He says he was terrified as he passed from village to village to reach the border with India. Those we spoke to crossed into India over the Tiau river, which we visited. The 250-mile stretch of river forms part of the boundary between India and Myanmar. The Tiau river on the border is where the defectors crossed into India from Myanmar Groups we've spoken to say they expect more police to make this journey to India in the coming days. Grace, whose name we have changed, is one of two female police officers we met who has defected. She said she saw the military use sticks and rubber bullets to round up protesters, and on one occasion tear gas being fired into a group which included children. ""They wanted us to disperse the crowds, and arrest our friends, but we couldn't do it,"" she said. ""We love the police, but now the system has changed, we can't continue our job."" Grace says she had no choice but to leave her family behind The 24-year-old says she also wrestled with leaving her family back home, in particular her mother who has a serious heart condition. ""My parents are old, and they're also afraid. But we young people have no choice but to flee and leave them behind."" Authorities in Myanmar have asked India to return any defectors, to ""uphold friendly relations"".

"Boris Johnson told MPs the UK has not blocked the exports of ""a single vaccine or its components"". An EU diplomat was summoned to a meeting at the Foreign Office for ""further discussions"" in a row over Covid-19 vaccine exports Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM on the proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff, comparing it to an increase given to the PM's former aide Dominic Cummings A cross party group of MPs has said the impact of NHS Test and Trace is still unclear, and that the Â£37bn allocated for it ""unimaginable"" The PM has said he wants to cut air passenger duty on domestic flights in a bid to boost travel across the UK The National Audit Office has warned some local councils in England are at risk of financial failure amid a Â£605m funding shortfall Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll end our coverage now of this week's PMQs. Our reporters today were Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon and Richard Morris. Thanks for following along with us. Do join us again next week. The row over a pay rise for NHS staff has dominate this week in Westminster. The government has recommended that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year. Many other public-sector workers will have their pay frozen, with the government warning that the country's finances are under ""huge pressure"" because of the pandemic. Health unions have criticised the 1% pay proposal and one - representing nurses - is calling for a 12.5% increase instead. But how is NHS pay decided? You can read more here. Allow Twitter content?

MPs that Sir Keir Starmer voted against the 2019 long-term plan for the NHS,
after the Labour leader referred to it. That is not correct â there were no votes on
the NHS Funding Bill 2019-20 during its main stages through parliament. Sir Keir had referred to the plan,
saying that itcommitted the government to a 2.1% pay rise,externalfor the NHS. The government
has now recommended that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase
this year. On Tuesday, the head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevenstold a committee of MPsthat the plan had indeed assumed a 2.1% rise. But he also said ""things have
changed"" since then and that it should now be up to the pay-review body. Another session of Prime Minister's Questions has come to an end, here's what happened: Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played PMQs: Boris Johnson on exports of Covid vaccine exports Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""correct the suggestionâ from EU Council president Charles Michel that the UK had blocked the export of coronavirus vaccines. The PM said the UK could be ""proud of the support the UK has given to the international Covid responseâ including Â£548m towards the Covax project to get vaccines to poorer countries. As PMQs finishes, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth intervened to ask apoint of order,external. He says Boris Johnson said twice that Labour voted against the 2.1% pay rise for nurses debated in Parliament in 2019. ""This is not the case,"" he tells MPs. He points out that Labour approved the 2.1% pay deal for nurses in 2019 without taking it to a vote. He calls for the prime minister return to the House to correct the record, and says that if the PM wants to cut nurses pay he should have ""the courage of his convictions to bring a vote back to the House."" With that, question time is over. Former cabinet minister Chris Grayling asks the last question of today's PMQs. He says he is passionate about ""reversing the tide of deforestation"" and suggests a kite mark scheme for food products from the UK. He says it will allow consumers to ""see clearly if [products] come from sustainable sources or from producers who do further damage to the environment"". Mr Johnson says it is a ""very impressive suggestion"" that he will look into, but says the UK is already ""leading the world in tackling deforestation"". Labour's Dan Jarvis - who is also mayor of the Sheffield City Region - asks if levelling-up the north is fair when Barnsley needs investment, but money is actually being spent in the chancellor's Richmond constituency in Yorkshire. Boris Johnson says ""we are devoted to levelling-up across the entire country"" and that counts Barnsley and ""everywhere else"". Labour MP Alison McGovern asks why 375,000 care workers are on zero-hours contracts. Boris Johnson says workers in the care sector will be among those benefiting from ""record rises"" to the national minimum wage. He also says the speed of the UK's vaccination programme has offered quick protection to care staff and residents. Labour's Karin Smyth says the government was ""failing young people"" before the pandemic. She said apprenticeship starts had been down by 29% and they missed their target of new apprentices by 81%. She asks the PM to urge young people to go to a jobs fair in her constituency, and to ""apologise to them for failing them so far"". Boris Johnson praises job fairs, but says the government ""can be proud of its record"" on apprenticeships. Labour's Kate Osamor calls for the reduced VAT rate of 5% offered to the hospitality industry during the Covid-19 pandemic to be extended to the beauty industry. She accuses the prime minister of ""refusing to listen"" to the demands of salons. The prime minister doesn't reply directly to her point about VAT, but says his ""cautious but irreversible"" roadmap for easing restrictions in England will allow a ""fully recovery"" in the sector. On the video link, SDP MP Claire Hanna says there are 16,000 ""dedicated nurses"" who staff the NHS in Northern Ireland. And she says the cost to pay for them equates to less than 2% of UK sales for Amazon whose revenues doubled during the pandemic. She asks ""what possible reason"" the PM has for not imposing a ""modest windfall tax"" on companies who have benefited during the crisis in order to ""properly pay though staff who have worked so hard"" in the NHS. Boris Johnson says she makes ""an important point"" about the discrepancy in tax paid by online companies and physical businesses, and promises it is an issue ""the chancellor is trying to address"". The SNP's David Linden says by extending universal credit uplift of Â£20 a week to the end of the pandemic, the government is ""conceding"" that social security in the UK does not pay enough. He asks why this uplift has not been extended to those on legacy benefits, such as disabled people. Boris Johnson says the government has done ""whatever it can"" to support people during the pandemic. He asks Mr Linden to take this up with those in the Labour party who ""want to abolish universal credit"". The SDLP's Colum Eastwood criticises the idea of a bridge from Northern Ireland to Scotland, after the PM announced afeasibility studyinto the idea today. He says the ""fantasy bridge"" could cost up to Â£33bn and will have to be built through unexploded munitions and radioactive waste. The prime minister says the connectivity improvements suggested in the accompanying interim Hendy review, published today, will be a ""massive benefit"" to Northern Ireland. He also accuses Mr Eastwood of being unduly pessimistic. Now it is time for the SNP's two questions - being asked today by Kirsten Oswald, after a power cut stopped the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, getting online. As the party's deputy leader at Westminster she asks the prime minister about the replacement for the Erasmus scheme - known as the Turing project - for studying overseas. She says it offers less support across the board, and will be ""taking opportunities away from our young people"". Boris Johnson says the MP is ""wrong"", saying Erasmus went to ""kids from better off homes"" rather than the whole country, which is the plan for its replacement. Ms Oswald says students ""can't trust a word the prime minister says"" on the project - and cites a Scottish Tory telling the BBC ""young people won't benefit from Brexit"" - asking him again to reconsider rejoining Erasmus. But the PM flatly refuses. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Amid the blizzard of figures from the
prime minister in response to Sir Keir Starmer's questions about NHS pay was a
significant sentence or two. He said the government would look at what
the independent pay review body had to say. Perhaps a simple statement of fact but
perhaps also a signal that if the body recommends a higher pay rise than
ministers suggested, the government would not oppose it. Other than that it didn't seem that Sir
Keir Starmer was able to break any new ground in his argument that nurses
deserve more. Boris Johnson stressed the importance of
recruitment and retention along with pay and sound management of the economy. The Labour leader couldn't resist a couple
of digs at the money spent on a TV studio in Downing Street and renovations of
the flat above number 10. And months after his departure, mention of
Dominic Cummings' shows Labour clearly see his legacy (and pay rise) as a
potent weapon against Boris Johnson. Sir Keir Starmer ends his questions saying the PM claims nurses will be rewarded, but the government are cutting their pay. He says a 1% rise in pay but a 1.7% rise in inflation equals a real terms pay cut. He repeats his line that Dominic Cummings got a 40% pay rise, but pay was cut for nurses, while taxes increase on families. Starmer asks for a vote to be put on nurses pay in Parliament. Boris Johnson says the government is 'steering a steady course' during the pandemic, and accuses Sir Keir of asking for more testing, and then complaining at the cost of NHS Test and Trace.

"These officers are among the first defectors to share eyewitness accounts of what they say is happening inside Myanmar Police officers from Myanmar have told the BBC they fled across the border into India after refusing to carry out the orders of the military which seized power in a coup last month. In some of the first such interviews, more than a dozen defectors told us they escaped, fearing they'd be forced to kill or harm civilians. ""I was given orders to shoot at protesters. I told them I can't."" For nine years Naing - whose name we have changed for his safety -  served as a policeman in Myanmar, also known as Burma. Now, the 27-year-old is in hiding in the north-east Indian state of Mizoram. I met him, and a group of  policemen and women in their twenties, who say they ran away from their jobs back home, after refusing to carry out orders. ""I was afraid that I would be forced to kill or harm innocent people who are protesting against the military,"" one officer said. ""We feel that it was wrong for the military to overthrow an elected government."" Ever since the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw, seized power on 1 February, thousands of pro-democracy protesters have taken to the streets. Protesters have taken to the streets in their thousands since the coup - and have been met with increasing force Security forces have been accused of killing more than 50 people. Naing, who is a low-ranking officer from a town in the west of the country, says protests in his area began to escalate at the end of February. He says he ran, after refusing twice to fire at demonstrators. ""I told my boss I couldn't do that, and that I was going to side with the people. ""The military is edgy. They are becoming more and more brutal."" As we speak, Naing pulls out his phone to show me photos of the family he left behind - a wife, and two daughters aged just five and six months. ""I am worried that it may not be possible to meet them again,"" he told me. The BBC met the group less than 10 miles from their home country, Myanmar I met him and the rest of the group in an undisclosed location, overlooking the hills and valleys of the mountainous state of Mizoram, their home country of Myanmar less than 10 miles (16km) away from where we were chatting. The officers we spoke to are among the first defectors to share eyewitness accounts of what they say is happening inside the country. They say they're part of a growing number of officials who are joining the pro-democracy, civil disobedience movement (CDM) in the country. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Myanmar coup: The young rebels risking their lives for the future Analysis: Can Asia help Myanmar find a way out of coup crisis? The BBC was unable to independently verify any of the claims made by the police who spoke to us. The UN, the US and a host of other countries have condemned the killing of civilians in the crackdown against anti-coup protesters in Myanmar, and called on the authorities to exercise restraint. The military has dismissed criticism of its actions and said it is ready to withstand sanctions and isolation after it seized power. According to local officials, more than 100 people have escaped from Myanmar to Mizoram since the military coup. Local officials say more than 100 people have escaped from Myanmar to Mizoram since the military coup Htut - not his real name - recalls the night the military junta overthrew the government, after the internet was shut down and an army post was erected close to his station. ""A few hours later we learned the military had staged a coup."" Htut, who is 22, says he and other police were paired with members of the military as they patrolled the streets. Protesters who were peacefully banging utensils in support of the pro-democracy movement were threatened with arrest. Htut, who is from a large city in Myanmar, says he too was asked to fire at protesters, a demand he refused. ""The military officer in charge ordered us to shoot people coming out in groups of more than five. I know that people were beaten up. I had sleepless nights. ""When I saw innocent people bleeding, my conscience wouldn't permit me to take part in such evil acts."" Htut says he was the only one from his police station to flee, making the journey by motorbike. He says he was terrified as he passed from village to village to reach the border with India. Those we spoke to crossed into India over the Tiau river, which we visited. The 250-mile stretch of river forms part of the boundary between India and Myanmar. The Tiau river on the border is where the defectors crossed into India from Myanmar Groups we've spoken to say they expect more police to make this journey to India in the coming days. Grace, whose name we have changed, is one of two female police officers we met who has defected. She said she saw the military use sticks and rubber bullets to round up protesters, and on one occasion tear gas being fired into a group which included children. ""They wanted us to disperse the crowds, and arrest our friends, but we couldn't do it,"" she said. ""We love the police, but now the system has changed, we can't continue our job."" Grace says she had no choice but to leave her family behind The 24-year-old says she also wrestled with leaving her family back home, in particular her mother who has a serious heart condition. ""My parents are old, and they're also afraid. But we young people have no choice but to flee and leave them behind."" Authorities in Myanmar have asked India to return any defectors, to ""uphold friendly relations"". Mizoram Chief Minister Zoramthanga said those who have arrived should be given temporary shelter, while the national government decides what to do next. Local groups have told us they expect many more defectors to make the journey to India in the coming days.

"Boris Johnson told MPs the UK has not blocked the exports of ""a single vaccine or its components"". An EU diplomat was summoned to a meeting at the Foreign Office for ""further discussions"" in a row over Covid-19 vaccine exports Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM on the proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff, comparing it to an increase given to the PM's former aide Dominic Cummings A cross party group of MPs has said the impact of NHS Test and Trace is still unclear, and that the Â£37bn allocated for it ""unimaginable"" The PM has said he wants to cut air passenger duty on domestic flights in a bid to boost travel across the UK The National Audit Office has warned some local councils in England are at risk of financial failure amid a Â£605m funding shortfall Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll end our coverage now of this week's PMQs. Our reporters today were Jennifer Scott, Paul Seddon and Richard Morris. Thanks for following along with us. Do join us again next week. The row over a pay rise for NHS staff has dominate this week in Westminster. The government has recommended that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase this year. Many other public-sector workers will have their pay frozen, with the government warning that the country's finances are under ""huge pressure"" because of the pandemic. Health unions have criticised the 1% pay proposal and one - representing nurses - is calling for a 12.5% increase instead. But how is NHS pay decided? You can read more here. Allow Twitter content?

MPs that Sir Keir Starmer voted against the 2019 long-term plan for the NHS,
after the Labour leader referred to it. That is not correct â there were no votes on
the NHS Funding Bill 2019-20 during its main stages through parliament. Sir Keir had referred to the plan,
saying that itcommitted the government to a 2.1% pay rise,externalfor the NHS. The government
has now recommended that NHS staff in England should receive a 1% pay increase
this year. On Tuesday, the head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevenstold a committee of MPsthat the plan had indeed assumed a 2.1% rise. But he also said ""things have
changed"" since then and that it should now be up to the pay-review body. Another session of Prime Minister's Questions has come to an end, here's what happened: Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played PMQs: Boris Johnson on exports of Covid vaccine exports Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""correct the suggestionâ from EU Council president Charles Michel that the UK had blocked the export of coronavirus vaccines. The PM said the UK could be ""proud of the support the UK has given to the international Covid responseâ including Â£548m towards the Covax project to get vaccines to poorer countries. As PMQs finishes, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth intervened to ask apoint of order,external. He says Boris Johnson said twice that Labour voted against the 2.1% pay rise for nurses debated in Parliament in 2019. ""This is not the case,"" he tells MPs. He points out that Labour approved the 2.1% pay deal for nurses in 2019 without taking it to a vote. He calls for the prime minister return to the House to correct the record, and says that if the PM wants to cut nurses pay he should have ""the courage of his convictions to bring a vote back to the House."" With that, question time is over. Former cabinet minister Chris Grayling asks the last question of today's PMQs. He says he is passionate about ""reversing the tide of deforestation"" and suggests a kite mark scheme for food products from the UK. He says it will allow consumers to ""see clearly if [products] come from sustainable sources or from producers who do further damage to the environment"". Mr Johnson says it is a ""very impressive suggestion"" that he will look into, but says the UK is already ""leading the world in tackling deforestation"". Labour's Dan Jarvis - who is also mayor of the Sheffield City Region - asks if levelling-up the north is fair when Barnsley needs investment, but money is actually being spent in the chancellor's Richmond constituency in Yorkshire. Boris Johnson says ""we are devoted to levelling-up across the entire country"" and that counts Barnsley and ""everywhere else"". Labour MP Alison McGovern asks why 375,000 care workers are on zero-hours contracts. Boris Johnson says workers in the care sector will be among those benefiting from ""record rises"" to the national minimum wage. He also says the speed of the UK's vaccination programme has offered quick protection to care staff and residents. Labour's Karin Smyth says the government was ""failing young people"" before the pandemic. She said apprenticeship starts had been down by 29% and they missed their target of new apprentices by 81%. She asks the PM to urge young people to go to a jobs fair in her constituency, and to ""apologise to them for failing them so far"". Boris Johnson praises job fairs, but says the government ""can be proud of its record"" on apprenticeships. Labour's Kate Osamor calls for the reduced VAT rate of 5% offered to the hospitality industry during the Covid-19 pandemic to be extended to the beauty industry. She accuses the prime minister of ""refusing to listen"" to the demands of salons. The prime minister doesn't reply directly to her point about VAT, but says his ""cautious but irreversible"" roadmap for easing restrictions in England will allow a ""fully recovery"" in the sector. On the video link, SDP MP Claire Hanna says there are 16,000 ""dedicated nurses"" who staff the NHS in Northern Ireland. And she says the cost to pay for them equates to less than 2% of UK sales for Amazon whose revenues doubled during the pandemic. She asks ""what possible reason"" the PM has for not imposing a ""modest windfall tax"" on companies who have benefited during the crisis in order to ""properly pay though staff who have worked so hard"" in the NHS. Boris Johnson says she makes ""an important point"" about the discrepancy in tax paid by online companies and physical businesses, and promises it is an issue ""the chancellor is trying to address"". The SNP's David Linden says by extending universal credit uplift of Â£20 a week to the end of the pandemic, the government is ""conceding"" that social security in the UK does not pay enough. He asks why this uplift has not been extended to those on legacy benefits, such as disabled people. Boris Johnson says the government has done ""whatever it can"" to support people during the pandemic. He asks Mr Linden to take this up with those in the Labour party who ""want to abolish universal credit"". The SDLP's Colum Eastwood criticises the idea of a bridge from Northern Ireland to Scotland, after the PM announced afeasibility studyinto the idea today. He says the ""fantasy bridge"" could cost up to Â£33bn and will have to be built through unexploded munitions and radioactive waste. The prime minister says the connectivity improvements suggested in the accompanying interim Hendy review, published today, will be a ""massive benefit"" to Northern Ireland. He also accuses Mr Eastwood of being unduly pessimistic. Now it is time for the SNP's two questions - being asked today by Kirsten Oswald, after a power cut stopped the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, getting online. As the party's deputy leader at Westminster she asks the prime minister about the replacement for the Erasmus scheme - known as the Turing project - for studying overseas. She says it offers less support across the board, and will be ""taking opportunities away from our young people"". Boris Johnson says the MP is ""wrong"", saying Erasmus went to ""kids from better off homes"" rather than the whole country, which is the plan for its replacement. Ms Oswald says students ""can't trust a word the prime minister says"" on the project - and cites a Scottish Tory telling the BBC ""young people won't benefit from Brexit"" - asking him again to reconsider rejoining Erasmus. But the PM flatly refuses. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Amid the blizzard of figures from the
prime minister in response to Sir Keir Starmer's questions about NHS pay was a
significant sentence or two. He said the government would look at what
the independent pay review body had to say. Perhaps a simple statement of fact but
perhaps also a signal that if the body recommends a higher pay rise than
ministers suggested, the government would not oppose it. Other than that it didn't seem that Sir
Keir Starmer was able to break any new ground in his argument that nurses
deserve more. Boris Johnson stressed the importance of
recruitment and retention along with pay and sound management of the economy. The Labour leader couldn't resist a couple
of digs at the money spent on a TV studio in Downing Street and renovations of
the flat above number 10. And months after his departure, mention of
Dominic Cummings' shows Labour clearly see his legacy (and pay rise) as a
potent weapon against Boris Johnson. Sir Keir Starmer ends his questions saying the PM claims nurses will be rewarded, but the government are cutting their pay. He says a 1% rise in pay but a 1.7% rise in inflation equals a real terms pay cut. He repeats his line that Dominic Cummings got a 40% pay rise, but pay was cut for nurses, while taxes increase on families. Starmer asks for a vote to be put on nurses pay in Parliament. Boris Johnson says the government is 'steering a steady course' during the pandemic, and accuses Sir Keir of asking for more testing, and then complaining at the cost of NHS Test and Trace.

"The owner of Wagamama is seeking to raise millions of pounds after many of its restaurants had to close their doors amid lockdown restrictions. The Restaurant Group (TRG) will seek to raise Â£175m from its shareholders to pay down debt and use as a buffer in case of any Covid resurgence. Its boss said the pandemic had presented ""enormous challenges"" for the sector. Total sales dropped by 57% to Â£459.8m in 2020 as many TRG sites were closed. Dented sales and pandemic costs meant the group, which also owns other restaurant chains such as Frankie & Benny's, reported a Â£127.6m pre-tax loss last year, compared to a Â£37.3m loss in 2019. It added that its short-term outlook remains ""uncertain"" while lockdown restrictions remain in place. Chief executive Andy Hornby said that TRG has ""responded decisively"" to restructure the businesses while preserving the ""maximum number of long-term roles for our colleagues"". ""Whilst the sector outlook remains uncertain, and we are mindful of continuing restrictions across the UK, we are confident that the actions announced today will allow us to emerge as one of the long-term winners."" Under the prime minister's current ""roadmap"" for easing lockdown restrictions, hospitality venues will be able to reopen for customers dining outside 12 April at the earliest, with indoor dining set for 17 May. During the pandemic,TRG started a major restructuring, closing about 250 sites, which largely affected staff across its Frankie & Benny's, Chiquito and Food & Fuel brands. It also tapped investors for cash last April, raising Â£54.6m from a share placing. The firm, which now has about 400 restaurants, pubs and concessions, said the additional funds it planned to raise would be the ""last step"" in the restructuring plan as it prepares to reopen sites once restrictions lift. Run Eat Out to Help Out again, says takeaway giant When can pubs and restaurants reopen? It said Wagamama delivered ""exceptional"" like-for-like sales growth when it was open for dine-in trading and that the Wagamama restaurants operating takeaways and delivery services saw sales two and a half times higher than pre-Covid levels. But Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that it could take some time for pent-up demand to ""unleash"" as restaurants reopen. ""Many of The Restaurant Group's sites have limited outdoor seating so are unlikely to fully benefit from the phased opening of the hospitality industry from 12 April,"" she said. ""The cash injection from this latest rights issue will give it some breathing space but there may well be more restructuring pain to come, as a slimmed down version of Restaurant Group emerges from the crisis.'' Separately, the owner of delivery giant Just Eat said on Wednesday that it expected orders to ramp up further in 2021. Dutch-based Just Eat Takeaway.com reported a sharp increase in sales of â¬2.4bn (Â£2bn) in 2020, up 54% from â¬1.6bn the previous year. It said this was due to a 42% leap in online orders. UK food orders increased 35% over the year and the group said this had accelerated further under current lockdown measures. McDonald's and Greggs orders have proven popular with UK customers during lockdown. Just Eat Takeaway said UK orders were 88% higher in the first two months of 2021, with delivery orders up by more than 600% compared with a year earlier. Partnerships with chains such as Greggs and McDonald's were particularly popular with UK customers, it added. However, despite the high demand for home deliveries, the platform reported a pre-tax loss of â¬147m euros against â¬88m in 2019. It said the figure reflected costs associated with the group's takeover of GrubHub in the US and the merger of Just Eat with Takeaway.com. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, added that a ""number of potential clouds"" could be on the horizon for the group. ""Competition in the space is intense and, in the post-pandemic world, it is impossible to guarantee that its business model will continue to generate such strong growth as the easing of lockdown restrictions allow the global population to visit restaurants in person once more,"" he said.

"MPs say NHS Test and Trace appears to have failed to achieve its stated aim of preventing lockdowns in England The Public Accounts Committee said its Â£37bn budget was ""unimaginable"" and warned the taxpayer could not be treated like an ""ATM machine"" But Boris Johnson defends the programme, saying it has helped reopen schools The PM also defends the proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff, adding that the government had already boosted nurses' starting pay A fresh row has broken out between the UK and the EU over exporting vaccines made in the UK European Council President Charles Michel wrongly claimed the UK had an ""outright ban"" on exports of jabs Health systems in most of Brazil's largest cities are close to collapse due to Covid-19 cases, a report warns Globally, there have now been more than 117 million recorded cases of Covid-19, and 2.6 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University A further 231 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, and there were 5,766 new infections recorded in the last 24 hours Edited by Lauren Turner and Alex Therrien That's all from the coronavirus live page for today - we will be back with more updates tomorrow. The writers were Alice Evans, Doug Faulkner, George Bowden and Jennifer Meierhans. The page was edited by Lauren Turner and Alex Therrien. We will soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here's a look at some of the stories we've been talking about: A restaurant chain which asked furloughed staff to loan it 10% of their wages, amid claims of potential sackings, has paid the money back. Tomahawk Steakhouse borrowed money from 500 workers to cover pension and national insurance contributions. The firm denied that it had warned staff they might lose their jobs if they refused to lend the money. It said all staff have now had their money returned with 20% extra as a ""thank you"". The GMB union said the return of the cash was a ""massive win"" for workers. In a letter to staff seen by the BBC, Tomahawk, which has restaurants in York, Middlesbrough, Beverley, Newcastle, Durham and Hoxton, east London, said it had a ""short-term cash flow issue and it requires your help and support"". At the time of the company's request the GMB claimed staff who refused were told their ""suitability for the role will have to be reviewed"". Read the full story here. Two Dracula fans who made a pit stop at the port where their fictional hero arrived in England have been fined for breaching Covid-19 rules. The pair were on a 350-mile trip from Edinburgh to Cambridge at the weekend when they decided to take a detour to Whitby Abbey, police said. The abbey features in Bram Stoker's 1897 Gothic horror novel and Dracula's first victim is in Whitby. Police warned they would be on the lookout for other would-be visitors Supt Mike Walker, North Yorkshire Police's lead officer for Covid response, said the couple were not the only people to opt to visit Whitby in recent days. He said four more people had been found making a 140-mile (225km) round trip to visit the attraction. Readmore on this story here. Extra testing will be carried out in parts of Wandsworth, south-west London, after cases of a coronavirus variant of concern were identified. The variant first identified in South Africa - like the one found in Brazil - is not considered to be more dangerous than other strains. However, there are concerns it could spread more easily and be more resistant to the vaccine.  Additional testing and genomic sequencing is being deployed within the SW11 and SW15 postcodes to help stop the spread of cases of the South Africa variant, the Department of Health said. Enhanced contact tracing will be used for anyone who is found to have the variant. Everyone living in the targeted areas are being strongly encouraged to take a Covid test when offered, whether or not they are showing symptoms. Surge testing for the South African variantwas first rolled out at the beginning of February, after cases with no links to travel were detected. At that stage, about 80,000 people in parts of Surrey, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Southport and Walsall were asked to take tests, regardless of symptoms. Although our explainer doesn't reflect the latest news on Wandsworth, it does show you the other areas in the UK that are getting surge testing at the moment, and why. Read more here. People quarantining at home after travelling into the UK could face daily calls to check they are following the rules, MPs were told. They're currently phoned up to three times over a three-day period until they answer the phone and confirm they understand the 10-day isolation rules and are abiding by them. Sitel UK carries out the checks on those isolating at home, not those in hotel quarantine after visiting from a ""red list"" country. The company's director of businesses development, Ian Conduit, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee he was in discussions with the government ""about contacting everybody for every day of their isolation and we are just waiting for that policy to be defined so, effectively, if it is agreed, (we can) roll that out"". Conduit says the firm deals on average with up to 20,000 contacts a day and this could be expanded if needed. If someone fails to answer after three attempts, or there is concern they may not be sticking to the rules, the details are passed to Public Health England and the Home Office for further investigation, while cases are ""immediately escalated"" if someone says they are not following the rules. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says claims that coronavirus vaccines affect fertility are ""completely untrue, but incredibly dangerous and potent"". He says the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had raised no concerns about any of the vaccines and fertility. Asked what action the government was taking to counteract disinformation on this issue, he told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee:""We stood up a unit across government back in March last year, a Covid disinformation unit, that works with the social networks to highlight to them any misinformation, disinformation, around issues like this. ""In terms of fertility, the non-clinical evidence around all the vaccines, whether it's Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, have been reviewed by our regulator - it's a world-class regulator, the MHRA - [and] has raised no concerns about safety in pregnancy. ""What we are trying to do is do two things - one, obviously highlight any disinformation and deal with that, but also get the message out from trusted voices.""

Team leader Jeremy Moss carries out a swab test on himself A passenger train has been converted into a rapid lateral flow Covid-19 testing station for railway staff. The Southern Class 313 Coastway train stationed at platform 8 of Brighton station will be used with two other bases to test up to 1,250 workers for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which operates Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express. Mark Whitley, GTR head of safety and health, says: ""It will help prevent workplace outbreaks and, along with regular sanitising, give our staff and passengers added reassurance."" Brad Lade, an onboard supervisor with Southern who has volunteered as one of the team of 15 testers, says: ""I wanted to do something which will benefit people, to give them and my family peace of mind that my colleagues and I are Covid-free."" Brad Lade has volunteered to test colleagues Smitha MundasadHealth reporter Scientists are concerned that Brazil has almost become a ""natural laboratory"" - where people can see what happens when coronavirus goes relatively unchecked. Some warn the country is now a breeding ground for new variants of the virus, unhindered by effective social distancing and fuelled by vaccine shortages. That's because the longer a virus circulates in a country, the more chances it has to mutate - in this case giving rise to the P1 variant. Scientists say it is partly the spread of P1 around Brazil that is behind the current devastating upsurge in infections. Read morehere. A minister joined a coronavirus vaccine trial after seeing misinformation about jabs being tested on ethnic minorities. Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said having a different perspective from colleagues helped identify ""early warning signals"" ahead of the vaccine roll out.

Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent After heavy criticism over their handling of the procurement and delivery of vaccines, EU leaders are trying to point to the bigger picture. Charles Michel paints the EU as leading the effort to vaccinate the globe. Analysis by the New York Times suggests the EU exported 25 million doses in February, despite production problems in Europe, and that eight million of these were despatched to the UK. Brussels bosses remain deeply frustrated the UK is, as they see it, racing to vaccinate its own citizens before thinking about the wider world. London rejects this. Michel's bitterly disputed ""outright ban"" claim follows Ursula von der Leyen's assertion last month that Britain had a system that effectively blocked the export of vaccines. But the European Commission's chief spokesman said he was aware of no restrictive measures concerning vaccines leaving the UK. Read morehere. Businesses struggling to pay rent as normal due to the pandemic have received a boost in support after the government extended a ban on commercial evictions in England until 30 June. Affected premises, including hospitality venues that cannot trade fully until at least 17 May in England, will be given ""breathing space"" to prepare to reopen, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. Residential tenants facing hardship will see a ban on evictions in England extended until at least 31 May, the housing secretary said as part of the same announcement. Robert Jenrick confirmed a requirement for landlords to provide six-month notice periods to tenants before they are evicted will also be extended until at least 31 May. Residential evictions were banned in most circumstances at the start of the first pandemic lockdown last March until September when courts began to clear a backlog, beginning with the most serious cases. Mr Jenrick called a so-called ""Christmas truce"", meaning bailiffs were not allowed to enforce possession orders between 11 December and 11 January, before a ban was re-introduced for the current lockdown. The number of patients in intensive care has reached a new high in theCzech Republic, asseveral Central European countries struggle with a new waveof the virus. Czech authorities have started to send patients to Poland for treatment, as its facilities struggled to cope. InHungarythe number of cases in the current wave has surpassed the previous peak in December and it has one of the highest recent fatality rates in the world. Cases are also on the rise inPoland, where the government recorded the highest number of daily cases since late November on Wednesday, with 17,260 new infections. The EU has been widely criticised for the slow pace of immunisations, and initial delays were partially blamed on Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca failing to supply doses to member states.

He told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee: ""When I took this job on back in mid-November, I think if you look at the ONS data or other published polls, vaccine positivity was in the high 70s, touching 80%. ""It's now at 94% of the UK adult population saying that they are likely or very likely to take the vaccine. ""I think that is, for your committee, the best measure that the strategy is working, watching that number continue to climb - the highest probably in the world, I think, if I'm not mistaken, in terms of vaccine positivity."" A total of 22,809,829 people have received their first Covid vaccination in the UK, the latestgovernment data shows.,external And 1,254,353 people have received their second dose as well. A further 190 deaths of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days have been recorded in the UK, the government'sdaily figures show.,external This takes the total number of deaths using that measure to 124,987. There were also 5,926 positive cases recorded in the last 24 hours. This is down from last Wednesday when there were 315 deaths and 6,385 positive cases reported. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government's refusal to let pupils have follow-up tests to confirmpositive Covid results is ""ruining"" their return to school, parents say. They are reporting cases of families having to isolate after a child tests positive at school - even when more reliable tests show a negative result. Pupils at secondary schools are being offered three lateral-flow tests following their return to school. But the rapid-testing policy does not allow them to have the more accurate lab-based PCR tests to overrule these in-school tests. Experts say the risk of ""false positives"" among the rapid tests is high, with the Royal Statistical Society believing more positive results could be wrong than right this week. But the situation will change after next week when pupils will be allowed to do tests at home and a positive result will need to be followed up with a PCR test. Any guidance advising people in Wales to ""stay-local"" as lockdown is eased is likely to differ depending on where people live, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething suggested people living in rural areas might be able to travel further to access facilities easily available to people in urban areas. He says there could be a ""few weeks"" of stay-local guidance. Last year,a stay-local rule was in placeas the strict lockdown was eased, with guidance - rather than law - that people should stay within five miles of home. This led to some people arguing it discriminated against people living in rural areas who needed to travel further, for example to see family members. Ministers have previously pointed to an opening of holiday accommodation for the Easter period, which Gething acknowledged would not be feasible if a stay-local policy was in place. Here's more on the stay-local guidance. Mutations that make coronavirus more transmissible and more deadly highlight ""how dangerous this virus could potentially be"" in the future, a leading data scientist has said. Dr Leon Danon told BBC Radio 4's World at One new research suggested the virus variant first found in Kent was up to twice as deadly as the previous variants in circulation (see post at11:44). He cautioned that the overall risk of death for those who catch the virus remains relatively low - perhaps less than half a percent for those with the Kent variant. But he said a central estimate suggested the Kent variant was 64% more deadly when cases were compared like-for-like with another common variant. Danon said the effort now should be on reducing infections to avoid further mutations. ""The only way it is going to be able to mutate is if it is able to go between people,"" he said. ""We really need to be working hard to keep the rate of infections low."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Meg Hillier: ""We need to see a clearer connection between testing and stemming the spread of the virus"" The impact of NHS Test and Trace is still unclear - despite the UK government setting aside Â£37bn for it over two years, MPs are warning. The Public Accounts Committee said it was set up on the basis it would help prevent future lockdowns - but since its creation there had been two more. It said the spending was ""unimaginable"" and warned the taxpayer could not be treated like an ""ATM machine"". But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the MPs' report ""defies logic"". Baroness Dido Harding, head of the National Institute for Health Protection, which runs the system, pointed out it had been built from scratch and was now doing more tests than any other comparable country. She said performance had been improving with more people who tested positive being reached and more of their close contacts being asked to isolate. ""It is making a real impact in breaking the chains of transmission,"" she added. But the MPs' report questioned: An over-reliance on consultants, with some paid more than Â£6,600 a day A failure to be ready for the surge in demand for tests seen last September Never meeting its target to turn around tests done face-to-face within 24 hours Contact tracers only having enough work to fill half their time even when cases were rising A splurge on rapid tests with no clear evidence they will help Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said it was hard to point to a ""measurable difference"" the test-and-trace system had made. ""The promise on which this huge expense was justified - avoiding another lockdown - has been broken, twice,"" she said. Test-and-trace 'finds half contacts in some areas' How do I get a coronavirus test? Is NHS Test and Trace working? During Prime Minister's Questions,Boris Johnson was asked why so much money had been spent on the system while the government said a 1% pay rise for NHS staff was all that it could afford. Mr Johnson defended the pay rise, saying NHS workers were getting an increase unlike other public sector workers, and added: ""It is thanks to NHS Test and Trace that we're able to send kids back to school and begin cautiously and irreversibly to reopen our economy and restart our lives."" This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps defended the cost of NHS Test and Trace on BBC Breakfast The cross-party group of MPs was looking at spending on all elements of the NHS Test and Trace system, which despite its name is run separately from the health service. This amounts to Â£22bn in 2020-21 and another Â£15bn in 2021-22. Not all of the money has been allocated yet. But the bulk of it is going on the lab-based PCR testing system, which includes the hundreds of local testing centres and network of mega-labs across the UK to process the tests. Some Â£10bn has been set aside for rapid testing, which is currently being used in schools in England as well as being sent to employers. The money has also been used to set up the 12,000-strong national contact tracing team in England and support councils to run their own local teams. The devolved nations are responsible for contact tracing individually. The committee acknowledges significant investment was needed to set up the system at speed after the pandemic struck. But it criticised an over-use of consultants, saying it needed to ""wean itself off its persistent reliance on consultants"" which were costing an average of Â£1,100 a day each and some of whom had been paid more than Â£6,600 a day. On last count, there were still 2,500 being used, the MPs said. The complexity of the system was also laid bare with news that it had involved more than 400 contracts being signed with 217 different suppliers. Some 70% of the value of those contracts were directly awarded rather than being put out to tender. But the MPs said the investment had helped to massively increase testing capacity. When the pandemic started the UK could only process about 3,000 tests a day, but that had increased to more than 800,000 by January. The committee pointed out that while capacity has grown, the system has still never met its target to turnaround all tests in a face-to-face setting in 24 hours. And it was found lacking at the crucial point in September when there was a surge in demand for testing. By contrast, contact tracers have been under-used with just half of time spent working on cases in October. By January, contact tracers had been in touch with 2.5 million people testing positive and advised more than 4.5 million of their close contact to self-isolate. But it warned compliance with self-isolation seemed to be low. It also raised concerns about the use of rapid on-the-spot tests. Pilots in Liverpool did not show ""clear evidence"" of a reduction in infection levels or hospital cases. Labour's Rachel Reeves said the report showed the system had ""failed the British people"" and underlined the ""epic amounts of waste and incompetence"" in the way Test and Tace had been set up and run. Dr Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, added: ""The promise of a world-beating test-and-trace system has just not materialised, and the eye-watering sums of public money poured into this system are set to increase even further."" He said despite the rollout of the vaccination programme, it would remain an important tool and urged ministers to do more to financially support people to isolate. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast it was ""thanks to Test and Trace"" that UK cases of the variants first identified in South Africa and Brazil had been limited to 285 and six cases respectively. ""Yes, it's been very expensive... but I think the idea that we would be somehow better off without it is crazy,"" he said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the system had been built ""from nothing a year ago"" but had done ""an amazing job"" and he was ""incredibly grateful"". Who can still get free Covid tests?

The writers were Alice Evans, Doug Faulkner, George Bowden and Jennifer Meierhans. The page was edited by Lauren Turner and Alex Therrien. We will soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here's a look at some of the stories we've been talking about: A restaurant chain which asked furloughed staff to loan it 10% of their wages, amid claims of potential sackings, has paid the money back. Tomahawk Steakhouse borrowed money from 500 workers to cover pension and national insurance contributions. The firm denied that it had warned staff they might lose their jobs if they refused to lend the money. It said all staff have now had their money returned with 20% extra as a ""thank you"". The GMB union said the return of the cash was a ""massive win"" for workers. In a letter to staff seen by the BBC, Tomahawk, which has restaurants in York, Middlesbrough, Beverley, Newcastle, Durham and Hoxton, east London, said it had a ""short-term cash flow issue and it requires your help and support"". At the time of the company's request the GMB claimed staff who refused were told their ""suitability for the role will have to be reviewed"". Read the full story here. Two Dracula fans who made a pit stop at the port where their fictional hero arrived in England have been fined for breaching Covid-19 rules. The pair were on a 350-mile trip from Edinburgh to Cambridge at the weekend when they decided to take a detour to Whitby Abbey, police said. The abbey features in Bram Stoker's 1897 Gothic horror novel and Dracula's first victim is in Whitby. Police warned they would be on the lookout for other would-be visitors Supt Mike Walker, North Yorkshire Police's lead officer for Covid response, said the couple were not the only people to opt to visit Whitby in recent days. He said four more people had been found making a 140-mile (225km) round trip to visit the attraction. Readmore on this story here. Extra testing will be carried out in parts of Wandsworth, south-west London, after cases of a coronavirus variant of concern were identified. The variant first identified in South Africa - like the one found in Brazil - is not considered to be more dangerous than other strains. However, there are concerns it could spread more easily and be more resistant to the vaccine.  Additional testing and genomic sequencing is being deployed within the SW11 and SW15 postcodes to help stop the spread of cases of the South Africa variant, the Department of Health said. Enhanced contact tracing will be used for anyone who is found to have the variant. Everyone living in the targeted areas are being strongly encouraged to take a Covid test when offered, whether or not they are showing symptoms. Surge testing for the South African variantwas first rolled out at the beginning of February, after cases with no links to travel were detected. At that stage, about 80,000 people in parts of Surrey, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Southport and Walsall were asked to take tests, regardless of symptoms. Although our explainer doesn't reflect the latest news on Wandsworth, it does show you the other areas in the UK that are getting surge testing at the moment, and why. Read more here. People quarantining at home after travelling into the UK could face daily calls to check they are following the rules, MPs were told. They're currently phoned up to three times over a three-day period until they answer the phone and confirm they understand the 10-day isolation rules and are abiding by them. Sitel UK carries out the checks on those isolating at home, not those in hotel quarantine after visiting from a ""red list"" country. The company's director of businesses development, Ian Conduit, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee he was in discussions with the government ""about contacting everybody for every day of their isolation and we are just waiting for that policy to be defined so, effectively, if it is agreed, (we can) roll that out"". Conduit says the firm deals on average with up to 20,000 contacts a day and this could be expanded if needed. If someone fails to answer after three attempts, or there is concern they may not be sticking to the rules, the details are passed to Public Health England and the Home Office for further investigation, while cases are ""immediately escalated"" if someone says they are not following the rules. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says claims that coronavirus vaccines affect fertility are ""completely untrue, but incredibly dangerous and potent"". He says the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had raised no concerns about any of the vaccines and fertility. Asked what action the government was taking to counteract disinformation on this issue, he told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee:""We stood up a unit across government back in March last year, a Covid disinformation unit, that works with the social networks to highlight to them any misinformation, disinformation, around issues like this. ""In terms of fertility, the non-clinical evidence around all the vaccines, whether it's Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, have been reviewed by our regulator - it's a world-class regulator, the MHRA - [and] has raised no concerns about safety in pregnancy. ""What we are trying to do is do two things - one, obviously highlight any disinformation and deal with that, but also get the message out from trusted voices.""

Team leader Jeremy Moss carries out a swab test on himself A passenger train has been converted into a rapid lateral flow Covid-19 testing station for railway staff. The Southern Class 313 Coastway train stationed at platform 8 of Brighton station will be used with two other bases to test up to 1,250 workers for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which operates Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express. Mark Whitley, GTR head of safety and health, says: ""It will help prevent workplace outbreaks and, along with regular sanitising, give our staff and passengers added reassurance."" Brad Lade, an onboard supervisor with Southern who has volunteered as one of the team of 15 testers, says: ""I wanted to do something which will benefit people, to give them and my family peace of mind that my colleagues and I are Covid-free."" Brad Lade has volunteered to test colleagues Smitha MundasadHealth reporter Scientists are concerned that Brazil has almost become a ""natural laboratory"" - where people can see what happens when coronavirus goes relatively unchecked. Some warn the country is now a breeding ground for new variants of the virus, unhindered by effective social distancing and fuelled by vaccine shortages. That's because the longer a virus circulates in a country, the more chances it has to mutate - in this case giving rise to the P1 variant. Scientists say it is partly the spread of P1 around Brazil that is behind the current devastating upsurge in infections. Read morehere. A minister joined a coronavirus vaccine trial after seeing misinformation about jabs being tested on ethnic minorities. Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said having a different perspective from colleagues helped identify ""early warning signals"" ahead of the vaccine roll out.

"It is still too early to book foreign summer holidays, the transport secretary has said, despite countries saying they hope to welcome vaccinated British tourists from May. Grant Shapps said there were ""lots of questions"" to answer about ""how safe it will be in June to travel"". People in England could be allowed to go on holiday abroad from 17 May at the earliest, according to current plans. A Greek minister said his country hoped to welcome visitors from mid-May. Cyprus and Portugal are alsoamong the countries keen to welcome UK visitors. Under the current rules, foreign travel from the UK is bannedapart from for exceptional reasons. While 17 May has been marked as the date that rule could change - the decision is subject to a review closer to the time. According tothe latest figures,external, another 190 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, and a further 5,926 positive cases have been reported. When can I go on holiday in the UK or travel abroad? Will there be 'vaccine passports' and will I need one? Which countries trigger hotel quarantine? UK domestic cruises 'could restart in May' Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether it was too early to book a summer holiday, Mr Shapps said: ""Yes."" He added: ""We have said it will remain illegal to travel internationally until at least 17 May - that's an at-the-earliest date."" Mr Shapps said people should look towards 12 April, when he would publish a global travel taskforce report, and said the government was weighing up not only the ""extraordinary"" UK vaccination rollout but also other countries' vaccine programmes. ""So there are lots of questions, the answer to which we simply don't know yet, about how safe it will be in June to travel around,"" he said. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have not set a date for the start of international travel. Once travel is allowed again, the success of the UK vaccination programme is likely to make British holidaymakers attractive to countries looking to rebuild their tourism sectors, which have been badly hit by the pandemic. Greece tourism minister Haris Theoharis said his country hoped to welcome foreign tourists from 14 May, during an appearance at a travel trade show. He said: ""Regarding 2021, in Greece we are more than optimistic."" Visitors will be required to have been vaccinated, have had a recent negative Covid-19 test or have coronavirus antibodies, he said. A pilot reopening of borders is likely to take place next month, he added. OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries VACCINE:When will I get the jab?

John Mason asks the first minister if Police Scotland's Covid strategy of only using enforcement as a last resort has been working. Ms Sturgeon believes it has and adds the force has responded ""very well"" to the crisis. She adds: ""The vast majority of people have complied with all the restrictions."" Willie Coffey MSP says he takes prides in reading that it was a Scottish doctor, Alexander Wood, who is widelycredited with inventing the modern-day hypodermic syringe- thanks for the plug, Mr Coffey - and asks whether there is more we could be dong to assist other countries with their vaccination programme. Nicola Sturgeon says ""absolutely"" and despite being ""really pleased"" with the vaccine rollout in the UK, she says ""we kid ourselves on"" if we think just vaccinating our own population solves a
global pandemic for us. We will be this pandemic as long as other countries are in
it, the first minister points out. We have a shared interest â not just out of altruism, but actually a ""selfish self-interest"" - in other countries getting themselves vaccinated as well, she says. The Scottish government has already helped prepare health systems in countries like Malawi,
Zambia and Rwanda for distribution of the vaccine through its international development
programme, Ms Sturgeon adds. Since around September, it has also carried out a review of its approach with a view to ring-fencing some funding for Covid-specific responses. Stuart McMillan MSP asks the chief medical officer whether we are likely to need an annual, or regular, vaccine - akin to the flu vaccine - to help us live with Covid in the future. Dr Gregor Smith says it is âhighly likelyâ we will get into regular vaccination updates for this virus, but he canât say with confidence yet what form those updates will take. We still donât know how long the immunity the vaccinations confer lasts for, he points out. Once we have more information about that, we will be able to say what any 'booster programme' looks like, Dr Smith says. But given the new variants that are emerging around the world, for that
reason alone it is ""almost inevitable"" that more vaccinations will be required, he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Annabelle Ewing concludes her questions by asking the first minister when people can expect to go to the hairdressers? The first minister says she is not able to give a date but adds: ""I can give you a 100% assurance though that I will not delay our ability to visit the hairdresser any longer than is necessary. ""I am saying that out of pure self-interest, as you can see. ""There are still conspiracy theories that circulate on social media from time to time that I have got a secret hairdresser somewhere."" Ms Sturgeon jokes: ""I can say, firstly, that's not true and, secondly, I don't know how anybody looking at me right now could reach that conclusion. ""No hairdresser is responsible, or would take responsibility, for this."" Willie Rennie, the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, asks the first minister about the amount of in-school time for S1-S3 pupils when they return to classrooms partially from next Monday, 15 March. Mr Rennie says it will be less than two hours a week for some pupils, and asks whether the first minister still plans to go ahead with the proposed arrangements. Nicola Sturgeon says yes she does, though she appreciates there will be different views on the matter. The judgement the government had to make was whether to have no provision at all for S1-S3s until after Easter,
or some limited time before the holidays. The concern was not just about the educational impact but their wellbeing and being separated from friends, she explains. ""I appreciate this puts pressure on teachers and local authorities but we are trying to get back to full-time provision as quickly as possible,"" she adds, even if it is partial and phased and limited initially. There is nothing perfect or ideal here; we are trying to balance considerations in the best way possible."" Nicola Sturgeon Mark Ruskell MSP asks the first minister about self isolation support grants and whether they should be universal. The first minister says she would not be averse to such a position if the Scottish government's budget was unlimited as it would remove the application process. But she adds: ""We wouldn't have the financial cover and wherewithal to pay for that at times when the levels of virus and the numbers of people requiring to self isolate are anywhere near what they have been in recent times."" Ms Sturgeon says it ""becomes more possible"" if prevalence was low but admits she is concerned at what would happen in the event of a surge in cases. As well as financial support, she adds there is provision to help people who live on their own and those who need to be put in alternative accommodation to self isolate. Another 141 deaths were recorded last week where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate,according to the National Records for Scotland (NRS),external. It's a decrease of 89 deaths on the previous week and the sixth time in a row that the number of weekly deaths has fallen. The NRS said the ""fastest decrease"" in deaths was in care homes, which now account for 10% of all Covid-19 deaths. The total number of Covid deaths in Scotland using the NRS measure is now 9,725.

The committee's deputy convenor Monica Lennon highlights the disproportionate impact the pandemic has had on people from low income backgrounds. Ms Lennon asks what the government has done to prevent this and what action is planned to reduce inequalities. The first minister says there has been ""targeted investment"" to help those who need it most, from additional money to support local authority service delivery to food insecurity. She also says ministers must not only focus on long-standing inequalities across society. There is also a need for us to continue to look with a fresh eye at some of the new inequalities that have been created by the pandemic and how we best respond to them.""

The Covid-19 committee was set up last Spring and met for the first time in late April 2020. Scottish Conservatives MSP Donald Cameron is the current convener of the committee, with Scottish Labourâs Monica Lennon the deputy convener. In total, nine MSPs are on the committee today, including the SNPâs Willie Coffey, Annabelle Ewing, Stuart McMillan and John Mason. Maurice Corry is the other Conservative member, with Mark Ruskell representing the Scottish Greens today and Willie Rennie the Scottish Liberal Democrats. The committee's official remit, in case you were wondering, is ""to consider and report on the Scottish Governmentâs response to Covid-19 including the operation of powers under the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act, the Coronavirus Act and any other legislation in relation to the response to Covid-19 and any secondary legislation arising from the Coronavirus (Scotland) Act and any other legislation in relation to the response to Covid-19.â Donald Cameron, the committee convener, also asks the first minister about the potential
extension of coronavirus legislation, citing a ""strong argument"" that it may be better to take stock after a year when so much has happened. Nicola Sturgeon says she has ""a lot of sympathy"" on the question of emergency
legislation and she doesn't want it to be in place ""for a minute longer than it has
to be"". But we are still in an emergency situation, says the first minister, so it is important there is a
degree of flexibility, which is why the government thinks the extension is appropriate and it is ""proportionate"" to
continue with it Ms Sturgeon reminds the committee that the extension would be until September, and it would be up to an incoming administration to judge whether to extend it beyond September, following the Scottish Parliament elections in May. Hundreds of millions of adults around the world can expect to be vaccinated against Covid over the next few months. It will be delivered by hypodermic syringe - but who invented it? Most people with access to healthcare take vaccinations for granted. The syringe that is now being used to provide protection against Covid may look simple enough - but appearances can be deceptive. It took millennia to create the hypodermic syringe in a form that was to allow mass vaccinations to take place today. An Irish surgeon, Francis Rynd, and French physician, Charles Pravaz, made a huge contribution to the field in the mid-19th Century. But it was a Scottish doctor, Alexander Wood, who is now widely credited with inventing the modern-day hypodermic syringe. Readmore here. Committee convenor Donald Cameron asks the chief medical officer about the vaccine rollout. He asks what the expected weekly vaccination rate is likely to be by mid-April. Dr Smith says the weekly vaccination rate is going to be ""wholly determined"" by the supplies coming into the country at that point in time. The first minister later says she hopes to get the rate up to 400,000 a week ""as supplies permit"". And she adds the government hopes to have vaccinated the entire adult population by the end of July. Scotland chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith says the country is dealing with a ""very different situation"" than it faced when the first lockdown ended last summer. He says: ""The virus that we are now dealing with is a completely different virus, certainly in the way that it behaves than we have become used to."" Dr Smith adds the current ""measured"" approach is essential to prevent the balance being tipped in the virus' favour again. He says: ""There is a very real risk that will happen if we move too quickly"". Dr Smith tells the committee the virus is now somewhere between 30% and 70% more transmissible. The change to the rules will allow four people from two households to meet anywhere outdoors, including in gardens Up to four adults from two different households will be able to meet outdoors in Scotland from Friday of this week. The current rules only allow outdoor meetings between two adults from two households. Restrictions on young people will also be eased, with four people aged between 12-17 able to meet even if they are all from different households. Outdoor non-contact group sports for adults will also restart on Friday. And people will be able to gather for communal worship from 26 March, so long as no more than 50 people are in attendance and physical distancing is maintained throughout. Readmore here. Asked about the easing of coronavirus restrictions, the first minister says the exit from lockdown ""may be slower than everyone wants it to be"". Ms Sturgeon says her focus is to make it ""steady and one-directional"" rather than
going too fast now and finding we take ""one step forward and two steps back"". The first minister says a bit of caution at this stage is the ""best mitigation"" against that possibility.

The writers were Alice Evans, Doug Faulkner, George Bowden and Jennifer Meierhans. The page was edited by Lauren Turner and Alex Therrien. We will soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here's a look at some of the stories we've been talking about: A restaurant chain which asked furloughed staff to loan it 10% of their wages, amid claims of potential sackings, has paid the money back. Tomahawk Steakhouse borrowed money from 500 workers to cover pension and national insurance contributions. The firm denied that it had warned staff they might lose their jobs if they refused to lend the money. It said all staff have now had their money returned with 20% extra as a ""thank you"". The GMB union said the return of the cash was a ""massive win"" for workers. In a letter to staff seen by the BBC, Tomahawk, which has restaurants in York, Middlesbrough, Beverley, Newcastle, Durham and Hoxton, east London, said it had a ""short-term cash flow issue and it requires your help and support"". At the time of the company's request the GMB claimed staff who refused were told their ""suitability for the role will have to be reviewed"". Read the full story here. Two Dracula fans who made a pit stop at the port where their fictional hero arrived in England have been fined for breaching Covid-19 rules. The pair were on a 350-mile trip from Edinburgh to Cambridge at the weekend when they decided to take a detour to Whitby Abbey, police said. The abbey features in Bram Stoker's 1897 Gothic horror novel and Dracula's first victim is in Whitby. Police warned they would be on the lookout for other would-be visitors Supt Mike Walker, North Yorkshire Police's lead officer for Covid response, said the couple were not the only people to opt to visit Whitby in recent days. He said four more people had been found making a 140-mile (225km) round trip to visit the attraction. Readmore on this story here. Extra testing will be carried out in parts of Wandsworth, south-west London, after cases of a coronavirus variant of concern were identified. The variant first identified in South Africa - like the one found in Brazil - is not considered to be more dangerous than other strains. However, there are concerns it could spread more easily and be more resistant to the vaccine.  Additional testing and genomic sequencing is being deployed within the SW11 and SW15 postcodes to help stop the spread of cases of the South Africa variant, the Department of Health said. Enhanced contact tracing will be used for anyone who is found to have the variant. Everyone living in the targeted areas are being strongly encouraged to take a Covid test when offered, whether or not they are showing symptoms. Surge testing for the South African variantwas first rolled out at the beginning of February, after cases with no links to travel were detected. At that stage, about 80,000 people in parts of Surrey, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Southport and Walsall were asked to take tests, regardless of symptoms. Although our explainer doesn't reflect the latest news on Wandsworth, it does show you the other areas in the UK that are getting surge testing at the moment, and why. Read more here. People quarantining at home after travelling into the UK could face daily calls to check they are following the rules, MPs were told. They're currently phoned up to three times over a three-day period until they answer the phone and confirm they understand the 10-day isolation rules and are abiding by them. Sitel UK carries out the checks on those isolating at home, not those in hotel quarantine after visiting from a ""red list"" country. The company's director of businesses development, Ian Conduit, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee he was in discussions with the government ""about contacting everybody for every day of their isolation and we are just waiting for that policy to be defined so, effectively, if it is agreed, (we can) roll that out"". Conduit says the firm deals on average with up to 20,000 contacts a day and this could be expanded if needed. If someone fails to answer after three attempts, or there is concern they may not be sticking to the rules, the details are passed to Public Health England and the Home Office for further investigation, while cases are ""immediately escalated"" if someone says they are not following the rules. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says claims that coronavirus vaccines affect fertility are ""completely untrue, but incredibly dangerous and potent"". He says the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had raised no concerns about any of the vaccines and fertility. Asked what action the government was taking to counteract disinformation on this issue, he told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee:""We stood up a unit across government back in March last year, a Covid disinformation unit, that works with the social networks to highlight to them any misinformation, disinformation, around issues like this. ""In terms of fertility, the non-clinical evidence around all the vaccines, whether it's Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, have been reviewed by our regulator - it's a world-class regulator, the MHRA - [and] has raised no concerns about safety in pregnancy. ""What we are trying to do is do two things - one, obviously highlight any disinformation and deal with that, but also get the message out from trusted voices."" Read more:Claims vaccinations harm fertility unfounded As we mentioned earlier, a further 231 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and 5,766 new infections have been recorded, according to the latest daily figures. Here's a closer look at the situation in the UK, in charts. Team leader Jeremy Moss carries out a swab test on himself A passenger train has been converted into a rapid lateral flow Covid-19 testing station for railway staff. The Southern Class 313 Coastway train stationed at platform 8 of Brighton station will be used with two other bases to test up to 1,250 workers for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which operates Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express. Mark Whitley, GTR head of safety and health, says: ""It will help prevent workplace outbreaks and, along with regular sanitising, give our staff and passengers added reassurance."" Brad Lade, an onboard supervisor with Southern who has volunteered as one of the team of 15 testers, says: ""I wanted to do something which will benefit people, to give them and my family peace of mind that my colleagues and I are Covid-free."" Brad Lade has volunteered to test colleagues Smitha MundasadHealth reporter Scientists are concerned that Brazil has almost become a ""natural laboratory"" - where people can see what happens when coronavirus goes relatively unchecked. Some warn the country is now a breeding ground for new variants of the virus, unhindered by effective social distancing and fuelled by vaccine shortages. That's because the longer a virus circulates in a country, the more chances it has to mutate - in this case giving rise to the P1 variant. Scientists say it is partly the spread of P1 around Brazil that is behind the current devastating upsurge in infections. Read morehere. A minister joined a coronavirus vaccine trial after seeing misinformation about jabs being tested on ethnic minorities. Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said having a different perspective from colleagues helped identify ""early warning signals"" ahead of the vaccine roll out. She told a committee of MPs: ""You will remember back in 2020 we didn't even know if we were going to have a vaccine and the emphasis was actually on trials. ""We could see the misinformation around the vaccine being tested on ethnic minorities and things like that. ""That was one of the reasons why very early on I decided to go on vaccine trials and encouraged others to do so, Nadhim [Zahawi, the vaccines minister] did the same thing. ""All of that was trying to build the confidence in people that this is something that is safe, this is something that we want to encourage as many people as possible to get involved in, and improve their understanding of what trials means."" Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent After heavy criticism over their handling of the procurement and delivery of vaccines, EU leaders are trying to point to the bigger picture. Charles Michel paints the EU as leading the effort to vaccinate the globe. Analysis by the New York Times suggests the EU exported 25 million doses in February, despite production problems in Europe, and that eight million of these were despatched to the UK. Brussels bosses remain deeply frustrated the UK is, as they see it, racing to vaccinate its own citizens before thinking about the wider world. London rejects this. Michel's bitterly disputed ""outright ban"" claim follows Ursula von der Leyen's assertion last month that Britain had a system that effectively blocked the export of vaccines. But the European Commission's chief spokesman said he was aware of no restrictive measures concerning vaccines leaving the UK. Read morehere. Businesses struggling to pay rent as normal due to the pandemic have received a boost in support after the government extended a ban on commercial evictions in England until 30 June. Affected premises, including hospitality venues that cannot trade fully until at least 17 May in England, will be given ""breathing space"" to prepare to reopen, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. Residential tenants facing hardship will see a ban on evictions in England extended until at least 31 May, the housing secretary said as part of the same announcement. Robert Jenrick confirmed a requirement for landlords to provide six-month notice periods to tenants before they are evicted will also be extended until at least 31 May. Residential evictions were banned in most circumstances at the start of the first pandemic lockdown last March until September when courts began to clear a backlog, beginning with the most serious cases. Mr Jenrick called a so-called ""Christmas truce"", meaning bailiffs were not allowed to enforce possession orders between 11 December and 11 January, before a ban was re-introduced for the current lockdown. The number of patients in intensive care has reached a new high in theCzech Republic, asseveral Central European countries struggle with a new waveof the virus. Czech authorities have started to send patients to Poland for treatment, as its facilities struggled to cope. InHungarythe number of cases in the current wave has surpassed the previous peak in December and it has one of the highest recent fatality rates in the world. Cases are also on the rise inPoland, where the government recorded the highest number of daily cases since late November on Wednesday, with 17,260 new infections. The EU has been widely criticised for the slow pace of immunisations, and initial delays were partially blamed on Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca failing to supply doses to member states. Read morehere.  Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has told MPs that 94% of the UK adult population have said they were likely or very likely to take up the coronavirus vaccine. He told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee: ""When I took this job on back in mid-November, I think if you look at the ONS data or other published polls, vaccine positivity was in the high 70s, touching 80%. ""It's now at 94% of the UK adult population saying that they are likely or very likely to take the vaccine. ""I think that is, for your committee, the best measure that the strategy is working, watching that number continue to climb - the highest probably in the world, I think, if I'm not mistaken, in terms of vaccine positivity."" A total of 22,809,829 people have received their first Covid vaccination in the UK, the latestgovernment data shows.,external And 1,254,353 people have received their second dose as well. A further 190 deaths of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days have been recorded in the UK, the government'sdaily figures show.,external This takes the total number of deaths using that measure to 124,987. There were also 5,926 positive cases recorded in the last 24 hours. This is down from last Wednesday when there were 315 deaths and 6,385 positive cases reported. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government's refusal to let pupils have follow-up tests to confirmpositive Covid results is ""ruining"" their return to school, parents say. They are reporting cases of families having to isolate after a child tests positive at school - even when more reliable tests show a negative result. Pupils at secondary schools are being offered three lateral-flow tests following their return to school. But the rapid-testing policy does not allow them to have the more accurate lab-based PCR tests to overrule these in-school tests. Experts say the risk of ""false positives"" among the rapid tests is high, with the Royal Statistical Society believing more positive results could be wrong than right this week. But the situation will change after next week when pupils will be allowed to do tests at home and a positive result will need to be followed up with a PCR test. Any guidance advising people in Wales to ""stay-local"" as lockdown is eased is likely to differ depending on where people live, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething suggested people living in rural areas might be able to travel further to access facilities easily available to people in urban areas. He says there could be a ""few weeks"" of stay-local guidance. Last year,a stay-local rule was in placeas the strict lockdown was eased, with guidance - rather than law - that people should stay within five miles of home. This led to some people arguing it discriminated against people living in rural areas who needed to travel further, for example to see family members. Ministers have previously pointed to an opening of holiday accommodation for the Easter period, which Gething acknowledged would not be feasible if a stay-local policy was in place. Here's more on the stay-local guidance. Mutations that make coronavirus more transmissible and more deadly highlight ""how dangerous this virus could potentially be"" in the future, a leading data scientist has said. Dr Leon Danon told BBC Radio 4's World at One new research suggested the virus variant first found in Kent was up to twice as deadly as the previous variants in circulation (see post at11:44). He cautioned that the overall risk of death for those who catch the virus remains relatively low - perhaps less than half a percent for those with the Kent variant. But he said a central estimate suggested the Kent variant was 64% more deadly when cases were compared like-for-like with another common variant. Danon said the effort now should be on reducing infections to avoid further mutations. ""The only way it is going to be able to mutate is if it is able to go between people,"" he said. ""We really need to be working hard to keep the rate of infections low."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sara Manchipp was stalked for eight months New powers to protect stalking victims are not being used by police, a BBC Wales investigation has found. In January 2020,stalking protection orders were introducedto make it easier for victims to get support. But since then only two full orders have been granted in Wales despite 3,000 stalking offences being reported to police. All four Welsh police forces have been asked to comment on the findings by Eye on Wales. The data also shows all four forces in Wales have made an application for an order to the courts, or currently have a application pending on behalf of victims. What to do if you're being stalked New order for stalker investigations has 'teeth' Funding call for stalking victim support Only one by Dyfed-Powys Police was granted, with an interim order given to North Wales Police, which later became a full order. There are calls for better education and training so officers can recognise when action is needed to apply for an order. Det Ch Insp Richard Yelland, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said there were other options aside from protection orders. This video can not be played Former Miss Wales Sarah Manchipp was stalked for eight months ""There are so many tools in our toolbox now thankfully with other legislation,"" he said. ""In those cases where it's appropriate, we will seek to use a protection order."" Former Miss Wales Sarah Manchipp was stalked for eight months. The perpetrator was caught and has now been jailed. She told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programme it was difficult to talk about what had happened but she wanted to raise awareness. ""It still affects me, but I want to talk about it and by talking about it I hope it gives confidence to other victims to go to the police. ""To begin with I received Facebook messages from this person saying he was going to rape me and kill me, but I have to say the police were great. ""Officers really took me seriously, but I am disappointed to hear they haven't been using these additional powers - more women need to come forward and talk about their experiences."" Bethan - not her real name to protect her identity - is based in Wales and shared her experience of being stalked and reporting it to the police. ""I'd wake up and have 100 missed calls in an hour, floods of text messages. It was persistent,"" she said. ""He'd also be outside and could tell me what I was wearing and who I was with."" Bethan said the long-lasting effects of the stalker's behaviour were devastating. ""I've got complex PTSD because of this; it made me very ill. I'm constantly on edge all the time."" It took Bethan a long time to recognise she was being stalked. However, once she recognised the behaviours, she reported it to the police several times. ""It was termed 'harassment' when I reported it, but nothing was done so I stopped reporting it,"" she said. This was before stalking protection orders were introduced and Bethan feels they could have made a difference in her situation. ""If they were about for me back then, something would have been done - it would have been taken more seriously,"" she said. ""People should speak out about it now there's these new laws and more support. They're more likely to be believed."" Police now have extra powers with stalking protection orders Stalking protection orders were introduced in January 2020 to police forces in Wales and England. They are civil orders which aim to protect victims, and it is a criminal offence to breach the terms of an order. Police apply to magistrates for an order, which usually remains in place for two years. The idea is that it can be used quickly and an interim order provides immediate protection while a decision is being made. When issued, they can include banning an offender contacting a person through social media, through a third party or being within a certain distance of their home or workplace. There are also solution-based requirements, which aim to tackle the obsessive behaviour traits in the perpetrator. This can include mental health programmes, drug and alcohol support or counselling. Criminologist Professor Jane Monckton Smith, of the University of Gloucestershire, has been working with Dyfed-Powys Police to train officers to spot the signs of stalking. ""It seems to be a postcode lottery to how these protection orders are used, but I don't think many of the forces are using them routinely,"" she said. ""It's not necessarily a very simple process but the more police forces use them, the easier that process will be become."" The Suzy Lamplugh Trust is the UK's leading personal safety charity, which also manages the National Stalking Helpline. Chief executive Suky Bhaker said: ""Overall, the introduction of stalking protection orders is proving to be a positive and useful tool for victims of stalking. ""However, there have been a number of cases where clients have not been adequately supported. ""We know that training varies in the police across Wales and England in stalking and what tools are available to help those victims varies as a result."" Katy Bourne, Police and Crime Commissioner for Sussex, is also a victim of stalking Katy Bourne, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Sussex, is the lead for stalking in Wales and England. She is also a victim of stalking and has urged other forces to use the orders to protect victims. ""We've issued about 30 stalking protection orders and we've got several others in the pipeline,"" she said. ""It says to the victim, 'we take you seriously', and that in itself is such a relief that the police are listening to you and believe you."" A Gwent Police spokesperson said: ""Gwent Police employs a range of tactics to tackle this serious offence. ""This includes education and awareness training for our frontline staff, which has resulted in the successful prosecution of suspects responsible for stalking. ""We've also assisted the courts by providing support to survivors of this crime who are protected by restraining orders. ""Gwent Police will not tolerate this form of behaviour.

"Sellafield in Cumbria is the largest industrial site in the UK, employing more than 10,000 staff A ""toxic culture"" of bullying and harassment at Sellafield could let serious safety concerns go unreported, whistleblowers have told the BBC. In a leaked letter, the nuclear site's group for ethnic minority staff described ""shocking stories"" of racial abuse. Other workers said sexist and homophobic bullying had become routine. Sellafield said it was committed to eradicating unacceptable behaviour from the workplace. A BBC investigation found: Multiple claims of serious bullying and sexual harassment among its 10,000-strong workforce Allegations of racial abuse outlined in a leaked letter to senior management Concerns about the working culture at the site and how it could impact nuclear safety ""When I started working there, it quickly became apparent there was rampant bullying in the organisation,"" said Alison McDermott, a senior consultant hired in 2017 to work on Sellafield's equality strategy. She said staff interviews and focus groups revealed serious allegations of sexual harassment at the sprawling site on the Cumbrian coast. Employees are demoralised, bullied and scared to speak out, Alison McDermott says ""Young women were saying they were in tears after work because of the way they were sexually harassed,"" she said. One interviewee said she was asked in graphic terms by a senior manager if she performed sexual favours to win a recent promotion, according to McDermott. In one internal email seen by the BBC, a senior HR manager at the site described how an autistic employee had been called a ""mong"" by her own team leader. ""This is a nuclear site, where many employees are demoralised, bullied and scared to speak out,"" Ms McDermott said. ""You've got toxic materials and a toxic culture, if you put those two together then you've got a recipe for disaster."" Ms McDermott's contract with Sellafield was terminated in October 2018, days after she submitted an internal report critical of the human resources department. She is now taking her case to an employment tribunal alleging she was dismissed for whistleblowing. The nuclear site is contesting her allegations. Sellafield, the largest nuclear site in Western Europe, reprocesses spent nuclear fuel, splitting it into plutonium, uranium and waste. More than 140 tonnes of plutonium are stored in giant hangers, the biggest civil stockpile of the metal in the world. Staff are tasked with decontaminating and dismantling the vast site which has been producing nuclear material since the 1950s. Sellafield is ultimately owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), a non-departmental government body. It employs more than 10,000 staff directly with thousands more working indirectly through contractors. The BBC has also seen a letter sent in September 2020 by Sellafield's network of ethnic minority staff to the firm's board, cataloguing a series of 27 racist incidents. One employee said they were walking through the site when a driver of a passing car shouted ""racist taunts"" before speeding off. ""I reported it but after a cursory investigation I was told nothing could be done to find and deal with the culprit,"" the staff member said. Sellafield is guarded by the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, a specialist police unit The letter contains multiple examples of offensive racial slurs being used openly on the site. One worker said his instructor at a training course told the class the main threat to the site was ""bearded men in flip-flops"". ""He then singled me out and mockingly looked under the table at my shoes to the delight of the class,"" the worker wrote. ""I happen to be a bearded Muslim man. [The instructor] went on to say: 'They [Muslims] come over on boats, we feed them, we clothe them, we house them and all they want to do is blow us up.' None of my colleagues intervened or supported me."" The letter calls on the Sellafield board to accept the organisation has a problem with racism and commit to better education and training. ""We fear that if we complain, we could be branded a troublemaker and mark ourselves out to be got rid of. It is exhausting that we must be wary of those who we spend most of our waking hours with,"" the letter said. Karl Connor, a senior manager at Sellafield for more than 13 years, resigned in January after suffering a breakdown he said was caused, in part, by bullying. ""I think there's a massive problem with bullying at Sellafield and I think there always will be as long as the company isn't prepared to do anything about it,"" he said. He said there were some ""fantastic people"" working on the site but the working culture could be difficult to deal with. ""If you want to earn a good wage and live in that part of the world, then you have to work at Sellafield or in one of the supply chain companies,"" he said. ""The best thing for most people is not to rock the boat, to keep their heads down and just put up with it."" Mr Connor is now in the process of bringing a disability discrimination case against the company. A work environment where staff are treated with dignity and respect is an ""essential trait of a healthy nuclear safety culture"", according to the World Association of Nuclear Operators, an organisation formed in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster - of which Sellafield is a member. An internal staff survey commissioned by the firm in 2018 and seen by the BBC showed 54% of the employees who filled in the poll agreed they ""could speak out about doing the right thing without fear of reprisals"", a fall of 11 percentage points since the previous survey in 2016. Sellafield management said staff surveys ""brought focus"" to concerns about bullying and harassment at the site. ""We did not ignore this, or seek to cover it up,"" said a spokesperson. ""We confronted the issue, proactively shared information with employees, and developed a company-wide improvement programme. This work is continuing."" The BBC has also spoken to a number of former and current members of staff who had concerns about safety at the site. In one case a senior member of the underwater diving unit claimed he was bullied and sidelined after highlighting staffing levels he felt were unsafe. He said after he retired Sellafield did increase the number of people on the team. In an incident from December 2017, a worker was exposed to plutonium after a bag of nuclear waste was opened in a workshop used to repair contaminated machinery. An internal safety report seen by the BBC blamed a ""deficiency in leadership standards"" for the accident, a near repeat of a similar case in 2015 in which no-one was hurt. The report said an alarm meant to measure radioactive contamination levels in the air was triggered, but it had become ""custom and practice"" to consider the alerts a nuisance by staff. The BBC has seen redacted emails released under the freedom of information act, apparently between people involved in the subsequent investigation. A number refer to claims of a cover up and allegations of intimidating and threatening behaviour. ""It was a serious incident and not to be taken lightly,"" said one serving Sellafield employee who is currently responsible for nuclear safety. ""I've seen a steady deterioration in standards in my career. There are things that are not right but if you complain about it, nothing ever happens."" The safety report said new measures were put in place to prevent a similar accident in the future, with staff reminded of the checks they need to make in 'radiologically controlled areas'. The nuclear regulator, the ONR,issued a statement in response,externalin which it said it was concerned to hear claims of bullying at Sellafield and would take ""robust action"" if there was evidence of an impact on safety at the site. ""To date we have found no issues that have resulted in unsafe activities at the site or evidence which identifies that Sellafield is not complying with the laws under our regulatory responsibility,"" said a spokesperson. A Sellafield spokesperson said: ""There is no place for bullying and harassment at Sellafield. We do not tolerate it and where we find it, we take action."" The spokesperson said the company was working to improve its processes so employees can have confidence that when issues are raised, they are dealt with. ""We closely monitor our progress, including seeking the views of our workforce through working groups and surveys,"" he said. ""We accept we have more work to do in this area, but we remain as committed as ever to eradicating unacceptable behaviour from our workplace.""

"Tesco is rolling out collection points for soft plastic packaging like crisp packets, pet food pouches and bread bags at stores in England and Wales. The supermarket chain is aiming to establish a nationwide recycling network for these harder to process plastics. Currently most soft plastic ends up in landfill. The recycled material will be used to package food, household and beauty products, Tesco said. The supermarket said it prioritised reducing the plastic packaging it used, but that the new service would also have ""a real impact"". ""Where plastic serves an important purpose such as reducing food waste, these new recycling points make sure that every piece can be easily recycled,"" said Sarah Bradbury, Tesco's director of quality. What do you do with 86 tonnes of celeriac? Tesco urged by investors to sell more healthy food Lockdown pet boom 'causing food pouch shortages' The roll-out will start with new collection points at 171 stores in the south west of England and in Wales. During a 10-store trial in 2018 Tesco said the most commonly returned packaging was bread bags, fruit and vegetable packaging, crisp packets, salad bags, and baby and pet food pouches. Customers may return packaging bought from other retailers as well as Tesco's own packaging, however they will need to clean items that are heavily soiled and take them back to participating stores, while the rest of their recycling is collected at the kerbside. Tesco said it expected to collect 1,000 tonnes of soft plastic a year. One estimate suggests UK supermarketsproduce 800,000 tonnes of plastic,externalevery year, although they don't make figures publicly available. What do you find hardest to recycle and why? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Packaging food correctly helps to avoid food spoiling and going to waste, causing higher carbon emissions. However campaign groups have urged producers to switch to packaging materials that are easier to recycle and to improve labelling so shoppers know how to dispose of each item. ""Our research has shown that almost half of grocery packaging used by supermarkets is not widely recyclable, so it is good to see Tesco widening its recycling facilities to help consumers dispose of packaging in a more sustainable way,"" said Michael Briggs, Head of Sustainability at consumer group Which?. ""To further reduce the waste that goes to landfill, the government should make recycling labels on food packaging mandatory, simple and clear, enabling shoppers to know exactly how to dispose of packaging on the products they consume."" In 2018 Which? examined the packaging of a typical household shop at eleven UK supermarkets. It found only 52% of the packaging could go into household recycling bins and that 42% of products lacked adequate labelling. Which? pinpointed products like KitKat, Babybel and Pringles, that came in packaging that was particularly challenging to dispose of. Last year, Which? examined the recyclability of 89 branded grocery products sold in UK supermarkets. Only 30 of the 89 items were in fully recyclable packaging. When it grouped the items into categories, it found that some products had packaging that was particularly difficult to recycle. For example, 93% of the packaging generated by the snacks and crisps products could not be recycled, either at the kerbside or at collection points. David Moon, head of business collaboration at Wrap, which campaigns to reduce packaging waste, also welcomed Tesco's move as ""a step in the right direction"". ""We need all supermarkets to collect all plastic films, adopt consistent messaging and share their insights to make this work,"" he added. Wrap said its research showed at least a quarter of people would be wiling to take plastic bags and wrappers back to the supermarket, but that the key was to make sure the services were convenient to use. Many UK brands and retailers have signed up to the UK Plastics Pact, committing them to remove by 2025 all packaging that cannot be recycled. Several have introduced in-store recycling collections. Sainsbury's, the UK's second largest supermarket, collects and recycles carrier bags and some other soft plastic packaging, such as the bags that apples and pears are sold in. Items can be handed to home delivery drivers or taken into stores. Sainsbury's is also trialling the collection in some stores of polypropylene film and plastic, typically used to wrap salad, frozen food and cakes. Waitrose said it also accepted carrier bags and plastic films, during deliveries and in-store and was currently planning a trial to expand the flexible plastics it accepts. Morrisons said it was reducing plastic use overall and already had in-store recycling bins to collect plastic bags, films and wraps. The Co-op has trialled collection at 50 of its stores of a range of plastic types similar to those that Tesco plans to collect. Wrap said that overall, the UK recycled about half of its plastic packaging. What do you do with 86 tonnes of celeriac?

"Criminals target those who are financially stretched Criminals are seizing on young people's Covid-related financial troubles to hire them to unwittingly launder money, experts say. More than four in 10 cases of money mules involved victims aged 21 to 30, with the numbers rising last year, fraud prevention service Cifas said. Banks said criminals posted fake job adverts on social media, targeting ""generation Covid"" struggling for work. It is part of a wider trend of fraudsters exploiting the crisis. Criminals want to move money through accounts to make it look less suspicious to banks. Money mules are given a cut for allowing their account to be used. Often they ask no questions over the source of the money. Most are young men. Those who try to quit may be threatened with violence by the criminals who recruited them. If they are caught, they could face prison, as well as future difficulties with their finances, such as having their bank account closed and finding it difficult to apply for credit in the future, such as mobile phone contract. There were 17,157 cases of suspected money muling activity involving 21 to 30-year-olds in 2020, a 5% increase on the previous year, according to the latest figures from Cifas. Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, which represents banks, said: ""Criminals are cruelly preying on 'generation Covid' and those struggling to find work at this difficult time, by using fake job adverts online to recruit people as money mules. ""We would urge everyone to remain cautious. At the same time, online platforms must take swift action to detect and take down content being used to promote money muling activity."" Social media is used to attract money mules The figures also show that cases among the under 21s had dropped, possibly owing to the fact teenagers have spent less time out and at school, where they could have been recruited. This helped to push down the total number of reported cases slightly compared with 2019. ""Have you ever held Â£2,000 at once in your hand?"" That was the line used to tempt Holly into becoming a money mule. At the age of 17 and still at school, Holly (not her real name) was approached on Instagram, then Snapchat, by a person who promised to pay her a decent sum, if she let him use her bank account to move money. ""I just eventually gave in,"" she said. Read more about Holly's story Other scams seen during the pandemic include impersonation fraud, in which con-artists pretend to be from broadband providers, TV streaming services, or energy suppliers to trick victims into handing over money. Romance scams have exploited the lonely, scam adverts have had a Covid theme, and fraudsters have posed as banks' fraud departments to gather personal details, according to TSB, which has a guarantee to refund blameless victims. ""Throughout the pandemic, we have seen an increase in sophisticated attacks on the public. Banks and other businesses need to step up their efforts to protect their customers and help catch the criminals,"" said Ashley Hart, head of fraud at TSB.

"Melbourne man Richard Pusey has admitted to taunting dying police officers An Australian man has pleaded guilty to filming and mocking police officers as they lay dying at a crash scene. Richard Pusey, 42, admitted to the rare charge of outraging public decency as well as drug and other offences. Pusey was in his car on a Melbourne freeway last year when he was pulled over by four officers for speeding. While the officers were making his arrest, all four were struck by a passing lorry that had veered out of its lane. Senior Constables Lynette Taylor and Kevin King and Constables Glen Humphris and Josh Prestney died at the scene. Pusey had been standing a few metres away and avoided the crash, but afterwards pulled out his phone and began filming for over three minutes. He stood over and taunted Senior Constable Taylor as she remained pinned under the lorry a court previously heard. Experts said she was most likely still alive at the time. ""There you go. Amazing, absolutely amazing,"" he said, according to vision from the constable's body-worn camera which was tendered to a court. ""All I wanted was to go home and have some sushi,"" he added, before using expletives to blame the officers for ruining his Porsche sports car. He fled the scene on Melbourne's Eastern Freeway shortly after. (l-r) Kevin King, Josh Prestney, Lynette Taylor and Glen Humphris The lorry driver, Mohinder Singh Bajwa, has pleaded guilty to four charges of culpable driving causing death and will face another court hearing this week. Pusey, a mortgage broker, was arrested at his home after the crash. He was initially charged with speeding, drug possession and reckless conduct offences. However, police discovered Pusey's video and that he had shared it among friends. His comments in the footage sparked public outrage, with Victoria's police minister condemning them as ""completely sickening"". Local media reported that the offence of outraging public decency was rarely prosecuted in Australia. Prosecutors in the case have referred tothe 2007 case of Anthony Anderson in England,external, who was jailed for three years for urinating on a woman as she lay dying. There is no maximum penalty for the charge in Australian law. Pusey is due to face court again on 31 March.

"This video can not be played Anna Sorokin: ""I never thought I was cheating"" The con woman known as ""the fake heiress"" for posing as a wealthy socialite in New York says she is trying to make the best of her newfound infamy since her release from prison. When asked if crime pays, Anna Sorokin told BBC Newsnight: ""In a way, it did."" Sorokin was paid $320,000 (Â£230,000) by Netflix for her story and says she has been offered other deals. She went to jail after tricking banks, hoteliers and friends out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. The story of her exploits - under the pseudonym Anna Delvey - went viral in New York Magazine in 2018, sparking instant interest from TV producers. ""I never asked for Netflix to buy my story, it just happened,"" says Sorokin, who was released on parole in February after more than three years behind bars. ""And everything else, it just spun out of my control. It's not like I orchestrated anything."" Sorokin was not able to keep all the Netflix money, owing toa New York law that prevents criminals from profiting from their notoriety. The company fully complied with the law and the authorities froze Sorokin's bank account, allowing her victims to make claims to it first. At least $170,000 was used to pay back banks. Who is Anna Sorokin? Racing to screen the âfake heiressâ story Sorokin turned 30 in prison, but she was in her mid-twenties when she spent time in New York City, telling people she had a $60m trust fund and an ambitious project to create an eponymous arts foundation. She was, in fact, a recent magazine intern, who came from an ordinary family of Russian immigrants living in Germany. By staying in expensive hotels and presenting a jetset life on Instagram, she managed to trick others into believing her fantasy and picking up her bills. Using fake documents, she even convinced a bank to give her a $100,000 overdraft, before the police finally tracked her down. Sorokin now claims the prosecution played a major role in creating her media persona during her high-profile trial. ""The prosecution totally misrepresented my motives. They said I paraded around New York, posing as an heiress. What happened was strictly between me and financial institutions, it was none of their business. They portrayed me as a wannabe socialite party girl and that was never my goal,"" she says. Anna Sorokin was sentenced in May 2019 Though Sorokin did enjoy champagne lunches and luxury holidays, she primarily had her sights set on creating her arts foundation and she fraudulently sought a $22m loan to try to get it off the ground. She even produced a high-end brochure (but never paid the designer) and claimed to have the backing of celebrity artists, such as the late Cristo, for the launch party. (Before the artist died last year, his publicist told the BBC the claim was pure fabrication.) Sorokin's defence was also built around a ""fake it until you make it"" narrative.Her lawyer told The Cut he enlisted a stylist,externalso she could keep up appearances in the courtroom. Asked now when Anna Sorokin started to become Anna Delvey, she says: ""I always was Anna Delvey."" ""[Others] portrayed me as someone very manipulative, which I don't think I am,"" she says. ""I was never too nice of a person. I was never trying to talk my way into anything. I just told people what I wanted and they gave it to me, or I would move on."" Sorokin was found guilty of four counts of theft of services, three counts of grand larceny and one count of attempted grand larceny in April 2019. She was acquitted of two other charges. Since her release from prison, she says she has been inundated with media requests and she has hired her own filmmaker to take control of her narrative. ""I am writing my book, I have my NFT [non-fungible tokens] project, and my merch, and [I am working on] prison reform,"" she says. ""I am trying to turn the attention I am getting into something positive."" Actress Julia Garner - who has the lead role in Netflix's Inventing Anna, out later this year - visited Sorokin in prison She insists she does not consider being a convicted con artist as a badge of honour. On social media, however, she is not shying away from this reputation. Earlier this week, she tweeted an image of a stack of books themed on money and trickery, including Den of Thieves and The Biggest Bluff. My strange encounters with a fake heiress Why are we fascinated by con artists? Though she has previously spoken of regret, she now says that is not the right word, because that implies sadness and she is not sad about what she did, even though she wouldn't do it again. Her lawyer, Todd Spodek, told the BBC that she is working on an appeal and he anticipates that she will be deported back to Germany in due course. Sorokin says she will try to stay in the US. This story is based on Anna Sorokin's interview with Emily Maitlis for BBC Newsnight.

The writers were Alice Evans, Doug Faulkner, George Bowden and Jennifer Meierhans. The page was edited by Lauren Turner and Alex Therrien. We will soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day, but before we do here's a look at some of the stories we've been talking about: A restaurant chain which asked furloughed staff to loan it 10% of their wages, amid claims of potential sackings, has paid the money back. Tomahawk Steakhouse borrowed money from 500 workers to cover pension and national insurance contributions. The firm denied that it had warned staff they might lose their jobs if they refused to lend the money. It said all staff have now had their money returned with 20% extra as a ""thank you"". The GMB union said the return of the cash was a ""massive win"" for workers. In a letter to staff seen by the BBC, Tomahawk, which has restaurants in York, Middlesbrough, Beverley, Newcastle, Durham and Hoxton, east London, said it had a ""short-term cash flow issue and it requires your help and support"". At the time of the company's request the GMB claimed staff who refused were told their ""suitability for the role will have to be reviewed"". Read the full story here. Two Dracula fans who made a pit stop at the port where their fictional hero arrived in England have been fined for breaching Covid-19 rules. The pair were on a 350-mile trip from Edinburgh to Cambridge at the weekend when they decided to take a detour to Whitby Abbey, police said. The abbey features in Bram Stoker's 1897 Gothic horror novel and Dracula's first victim is in Whitby. Police warned they would be on the lookout for other would-be visitors Supt Mike Walker, North Yorkshire Police's lead officer for Covid response, said the couple were not the only people to opt to visit Whitby in recent days. He said four more people had been found making a 140-mile (225km) round trip to visit the attraction. Readmore on this story here. Extra testing will be carried out in parts of Wandsworth, south-west London, after cases of a coronavirus variant of concern were identified. The variant first identified in South Africa - like the one found in Brazil - is not considered to be more dangerous than other strains. However, there are concerns it could spread more easily and be more resistant to the vaccine.  Additional testing and genomic sequencing is being deployed within the SW11 and SW15 postcodes to help stop the spread of cases of the South Africa variant, the Department of Health said. Enhanced contact tracing will be used for anyone who is found to have the variant. Everyone living in the targeted areas are being strongly encouraged to take a Covid test when offered, whether or not they are showing symptoms. Surge testing for the South African variantwas first rolled out at the beginning of February, after cases with no links to travel were detected. At that stage, about 80,000 people in parts of Surrey, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Southport and Walsall were asked to take tests, regardless of symptoms. Although our explainer doesn't reflect the latest news on Wandsworth, it does show you the other areas in the UK that are getting surge testing at the moment, and why. Read more here. People quarantining at home after travelling into the UK could face daily calls to check they are following the rules, MPs were told. They're currently phoned up to three times over a three-day period until they answer the phone and confirm they understand the 10-day isolation rules and are abiding by them. Sitel UK carries out the checks on those isolating at home, not those in hotel quarantine after visiting from a ""red list"" country. The company's director of businesses development, Ian Conduit, told the Commons Home Affairs Committee he was in discussions with the government ""about contacting everybody for every day of their isolation and we are just waiting for that policy to be defined so, effectively, if it is agreed, (we can) roll that out"". Conduit says the firm deals on average with up to 20,000 contacts a day and this could be expanded if needed. If someone fails to answer after three attempts, or there is concern they may not be sticking to the rules, the details are passed to Public Health England and the Home Office for further investigation, while cases are ""immediately escalated"" if someone says they are not following the rules. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says claims that coronavirus vaccines affect fertility are ""completely untrue, but incredibly dangerous and potent"". He says the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had raised no concerns about any of the vaccines and fertility. Asked what action the government was taking to counteract disinformation on this issue, he told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee:""We stood up a unit across government back in March last year, a Covid disinformation unit, that works with the social networks to highlight to them any misinformation, disinformation, around issues like this. ""In terms of fertility, the non-clinical evidence around all the vaccines, whether it's Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, have been reviewed by our regulator - it's a world-class regulator, the MHRA - [and] has raised no concerns about safety in pregnancy. ""What we are trying to do is do two things - one, obviously highlight any disinformation and deal with that, but also get the message out from trusted voices."" Read more:Claims vaccinations harm fertility unfounded As we mentioned earlier, a further 231 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test and 5,766 new infections have been recorded, according to the latest daily figures. Here's a closer look at the situation in the UK, in charts. Team leader Jeremy Moss carries out a swab test on himself A passenger train has been converted into a rapid lateral flow Covid-19 testing station for railway staff. The Southern Class 313 Coastway train stationed at platform 8 of Brighton station will be used with two other bases to test up to 1,250 workers for Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which operates Southern, Thameslink, Great Northern and Gatwick Express. Mark Whitley, GTR head of safety and health, says: ""It will help prevent workplace outbreaks and, along with regular sanitising, give our staff and passengers added reassurance."" Brad Lade, an onboard supervisor with Southern who has volunteered as one of the team of 15 testers, says: ""I wanted to do something which will benefit people, to give them and my family peace of mind that my colleagues and I are Covid-free."" Brad Lade has volunteered to test colleagues Smitha MundasadHealth reporter Scientists are concerned that Brazil has almost become a ""natural laboratory"" - where people can see what happens when coronavirus goes relatively unchecked. Some warn the country is now a breeding ground for new variants of the virus, unhindered by effective social distancing and fuelled by vaccine shortages. That's because the longer a virus circulates in a country, the more chances it has to mutate - in this case giving rise to the P1 variant. Scientists say it is partly the spread of P1 around Brazil that is behind the current devastating upsurge in infections. Read morehere. A minister joined a coronavirus vaccine trial after seeing misinformation about jabs being tested on ethnic minorities. Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said having a different perspective from colleagues helped identify ""early warning signals"" ahead of the vaccine roll out. She told a committee of MPs: ""You will remember back in 2020 we didn't even know if we were going to have a vaccine and the emphasis was actually on trials. ""We could see the misinformation around the vaccine being tested on ethnic minorities and things like that. ""That was one of the reasons why very early on I decided to go on vaccine trials and encouraged others to do so, Nadhim [Zahawi, the vaccines minister] did the same thing. ""All of that was trying to build the confidence in people that this is something that is safe, this is something that we want to encourage as many people as possible to get involved in, and improve their understanding of what trials means."" Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent After heavy criticism over their handling of the procurement and delivery of vaccines, EU leaders are trying to point to the bigger picture. Charles Michel paints the EU as leading the effort to vaccinate the globe. Analysis by the New York Times suggests the EU exported 25 million doses in February, despite production problems in Europe, and that eight million of these were despatched to the UK. Brussels bosses remain deeply frustrated the UK is, as they see it, racing to vaccinate its own citizens before thinking about the wider world. London rejects this. Michel's bitterly disputed ""outright ban"" claim follows Ursula von der Leyen's assertion last month that Britain had a system that effectively blocked the export of vaccines. But the European Commission's chief spokesman said he was aware of no restrictive measures concerning vaccines leaving the UK. Read morehere. Businesses struggling to pay rent as normal due to the pandemic have received a boost in support after the government extended a ban on commercial evictions in England until 30 June. Affected premises, including hospitality venues that cannot trade fully until at least 17 May in England, will be given ""breathing space"" to prepare to reopen, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said. Residential tenants facing hardship will see a ban on evictions in England extended until at least 31 May, the housing secretary said as part of the same announcement. Robert Jenrick confirmed a requirement for landlords to provide six-month notice periods to tenants before they are evicted will also be extended until at least 31 May. Residential evictions were banned in most circumstances at the start of the first pandemic lockdown last March until September when courts began to clear a backlog, beginning with the most serious cases. Mr Jenrick called a so-called ""Christmas truce"", meaning bailiffs were not allowed to enforce possession orders between 11 December and 11 January, before a ban was re-introduced for the current lockdown. The number of patients in intensive care has reached a new high in theCzech Republic, asseveral Central European countries struggle with a new waveof the virus. Czech authorities have started to send patients to Poland for treatment, as its facilities struggled to cope. InHungarythe number of cases in the current wave has surpassed the previous peak in December and it has one of the highest recent fatality rates in the world. Cases are also on the rise inPoland, where the government recorded the highest number of daily cases since late November on Wednesday, with 17,260 new infections. The EU has been widely criticised for the slow pace of immunisations, and initial delays were partially blamed on Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca failing to supply doses to member states. Read morehere.  Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has told MPs that 94% of the UK adult population have said they were likely or very likely to take up the coronavirus vaccine. He told the Commons Women and Equalities Committee: ""When I took this job on back in mid-November, I think if you look at the ONS data or other published polls, vaccine positivity was in the high 70s, touching 80%. ""It's now at 94% of the UK adult population saying that they are likely or very likely to take the vaccine. ""I think that is, for your committee, the best measure that the strategy is working, watching that number continue to climb - the highest probably in the world, I think, if I'm not mistaken, in terms of vaccine positivity."" A total of 22,809,829 people have received their first Covid vaccination in the UK, the latestgovernment data shows.,external And 1,254,353 people have received their second dose as well. A further 190 deaths of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days have been recorded in the UK, the government'sdaily figures show.,external This takes the total number of deaths using that measure to 124,987. There were also 5,926 positive cases recorded in the last 24 hours. This is down from last Wednesday when there were 315 deaths and 6,385 positive cases reported. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The government's refusal to let pupils have follow-up tests to confirmpositive Covid results is ""ruining"" their return to school, parents say. They are reporting cases of families having to isolate after a child tests positive at school - even when more reliable tests show a negative result. Pupils at secondary schools are being offered three lateral-flow tests following their return to school. But the rapid-testing policy does not allow them to have the more accurate lab-based PCR tests to overrule these in-school tests. Experts say the risk of ""false positives"" among the rapid tests is high, with the Royal Statistical Society believing more positive results could be wrong than right this week. But the situation will change after next week when pupils will be allowed to do tests at home and a positive result will need to be followed up with a PCR test. Any guidance advising people in Wales to ""stay-local"" as lockdown is eased is likely to differ depending on where people live, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething suggested people living in rural areas might be able to travel further to access facilities easily available to people in urban areas. He says there could be a ""few weeks"" of stay-local guidance. Last year,a stay-local rule was in placeas the strict lockdown was eased, with guidance - rather than law - that people should stay within five miles of home. This led to some people arguing it discriminated against people living in rural areas who needed to travel further, for example to see family members. Ministers have previously pointed to an opening of holiday accommodation for the Easter period, which Gething acknowledged would not be feasible if a stay-local policy was in place. Here's more on the stay-local guidance. Mutations that make coronavirus more transmissible and more deadly highlight ""how dangerous this virus could potentially be"" in the future, a leading data scientist has said. Dr Leon Danon told BBC Radio 4's World at One new research suggested the virus variant first found in Kent was up to twice as deadly as the previous variants in circulation (see post at11:44). He cautioned that the overall risk of death for those who catch the virus remains relatively low - perhaps less than half a percent for those with the Kent variant. But he said a central estimate suggested the Kent variant was 64% more deadly when cases were compared like-for-like with another common variant. Danon said the effort now should be on reducing infections to avoid further mutations. ""The only way it is going to be able to mutate is if it is able to go between people,"" he said. ""We really need to be working hard to keep the rate of infections low."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson has said he wants to cut air passenger duty on domestic flights in a bid to boost travel connections across the UK. A consultation will examine options including creating a new lower domestic rate or exempting return flights. The move is likely to be welcomed by struggling airline operators hit by Covid, but worry environmental groups. The PM has also committed Â£20m for rail and road links and a review of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Mr Johnson has pledged new funding to upgrade road, rail and sea connections across the UK in an effort to reduce delays and bottlenecks and stimulate economic growth. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Johnson said a lack of a UK-wide transport strategy had led to ""inadequate connections"" between the four UK nations. ""For far too long, we have tended to carve up the country through a devolve and forget approach,"" he wrote. Could we build a Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge? What is air passenger duty? NI-to-Scotland bridge link set for official study Mr Johnson has championed the idea of connecting Northern Ireland with the British mainland via a bridge, despite scepticism from the Northern Irish and Scottish governments. Two routes, between Portpatrick and Larne and Campbeltown and the Antrim coast, have been proposed. Announcing the findings of aninterim report,externalinto transport connectivity by Sir Peter Hendy, the PM confirmed a separate feasibility study into the idea. Two engineering professors will assess an outline cost and timescale and the associated works needed. Architect Prof Alan Dunlop, who has long backed the idea of a bridge from Northern Ireland and Scotland, said he was confident the project was feasible. ""There are geological and infrastructural challenges, I don't deny that,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""But I'm absolutely convinced - and I've been looking at this now, researching it quite solidly, for three years - that the UK has both the engineering and architectural talent."" Larne in Northern Ireland has been suggested as the location for one end of the bridge Key arteries earmarked for investment include rail routes between the North coast of Wales and England, enhancements to the West Coast Mainline and the dualling of much of the A75 in south-west Scotland. Critics say billions of funding is needed to make up for a decade of under-investment in regional transport links in the north of England and that cash has been swallowed up by the multi-billion pound HS2 high-speed rail link. Mr Johnson said Sir Peter's review, which is due to issue its final report in the summer, ""gives us the tools we need to deliver on our ambitions for a UK-wide transport network"". ""I also want to cut passenger duty on domestic flights so we can support connectivity across the country,"" he said. In his Telegraph article, he added: ""It seems wrong that someone flying from Belfast to London and back pays more UK tax than someone flying from Dublin to London and back."" The environmental case over air passenger duty (APD) is not clear-cut. Environmentalists say the government shouldn't be cutting any taxes on polluting activities, especially because it's hosting a vital UN climate summit in November and it's trying to set an example. But ministers are promising to balance out any cut in APD for domestic flights with a linked increase in APD on foreign flights. If ministers make the APD switch, it will iron out what many people consider a tax anomaly. At the moment, if you take a return flight from one UK airport to another, you pay the APD on both legs. If you fly abroad you pay APD on just one leg. So you pay more tax flying from London to Belfast than from London to Dublin. The government believes that's unfair and creates a bias against travel within the UK. Either way, environmentalists argue that aviation is still under-taxed. Airlines have been lobbying for a reduction in air passenger duty, whose standard rate for UK flights will rise to Â£26 per customer per flight next month, long before the Covid-19 pandemic brought the industry to its knees. But environmental groups say reducing the cost of flying will make it difficult, if not impossible, for the UK to meet its target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 as aviation is the single largest source of emissions. The review will also look at the case for increasing the number of international distance bands. Currently, duty is charged on each passenger at the rate for the place where their journey ends. Since 2015, there have only been two bands, one covering flights of up to 2,000 miles and the other those in excess of that. Further plans to decarbonise aviation will also be examined, including mandating the use of sustainable aviation fuels across the industry.

"Piers Morgan has presented Good Morning Britain since 2015 Piers Morgan has left ITV's Good Morning Britain following a row over comments he made about the Duchess of Sussex. It brings the controversial host's time on the show to an end after six years. ITV announced the decision after Ofcom said it was investigating his comments after receiving 41,000 complaints. On Monday's show, Morgan said he ""didn't believe a word"" the duchess had told Oprah Winfrey about her mental health in an interview. Piers Morgan: From being 'ghosted' by Meghan to GMB exit An ITV spokesperson said: ""Following discussions with ITV, Piers Morgan has decided now is the time to leave Good Morning Britain. ITV has accepted this decision and has nothing further to add."" The channel confirmed to the BBC that his departure from the breakfast news show will take effect immediately but declined to say who would be replacing him on Wednesday. In atweet on Wednesday morning,externalMorgan said that he had reflected on his opinion on the Oprah interview and still did not believe Meghan, adding that ""freedom of speech is a hill I'm happy to die on"". ""Thanks for all the love, and hate. I'm off to spend more time with my opinions,"" he said. He hosted the daily breakfast programme with Susanna Reid Morgan's departure followed an on-air clash with weather presenter Alex Beresford, who criticised his colleague on Tuesday for ""continuing to trash"" the duchess, prompting Morgan to walk off set. He returned within 10 minutes. Also on Tuesday,ITV chief executive Dame Carolyn McCall said,externalshe ""completely believed what [the duchess] says"", adding that ITV is ""totally committed to"" mental health. Mental health charity Mind, which is a partner with ITV on its Britain Get Talking campaign, also criticised Morgan, saying it was ""disappointed"" by the presenter's comments. On Monday's programme, Morgan picked up on the duchess's claim that her request to senior Buckingham Palace officials for help was rejected, after she told Oprah she had had suicidal thoughts. ""Who did you go to?"" he said. ""What did they say to you? I'm sorry, I don't believe a word she said, Meghan Markle. I wouldn't believe it if she read me a weather report. ""The fact that she's fired up this onslaught against our Royal Family I think is contemptible."" He also referred to the duchess as the ""Pinocchio Princess"" in a tweet later that morning. Following an outcry, he said on Tuesday's episode that ""I still have serious concerns about the veracity of a lot of what"" Meghan said, but that it was ""not for me to question if she felt suicidal"". He added: ""My real concern was a disbelief frankly... that she went to a senior member of the Royal household and told them she was suicidal and was told she could not have any help because it would be a bad look for the family."" A total of 41,015 complaints were made to media watchdog Ofcom by 14:00 GMT on Tuesday. That is the second highest number of complaints in Ofcom's 17-year history, behind the 44,500 submitted over several days about the racism row involving Jade Goody and Shilpa Shetty on Celebrity Big Brother in 2007. ""We have launched an investigation into Monday's episode of Good Morning Britain under our harm and offence rules,"" a spokesperson for the regulator said. Meanwhile, on Monday evening Mindtweeted,external: ""We were disappointed and concerned to see Piers Morgan's comments on not believing Meghan's experiences about suicidal thoughts today. ""It's vital that when people reach out for support or share their experiences of ill mental health that they are treated with dignity, respect and empathy. We are in conversations with ITV about this at the moment."" There is a culture war going on, and Piers Morgan's job on Good Morning Britain has fallen victim to it. That's different from saying Morgan himself is a victim of it; in some ways he has been a beneficiary. But when the public position of a star presenter and a broadcaster's CEO are in sharp contrast, about such a sensitive subject, at a time of such heightened tensions, something has to give. Tonight, it did. This morning Carolyn McCall made it very clear that she believed Meghan Markle's central claim about her mental health. She went further: ITV takes mental health very seriously. It follows that the company must have expected Morgan to recant publicly, or apologise. He is unlikely to have been willing to do that. Therefore this was the moment to leave GMB. Read more on Amol's blog: Why Piers Morgan left Good Morning Britain Morgan has always divided opinion - and some people on social media were glad to see the back of him, while others offered their support.

ActressJameela Jamil reacted by revealing,externalthat Morgan's ""relentless campaign of lies and hatred against me"" had led her to contemplate suicide. TV critic Scott Bryant told BBC Radio 5 Live that the announcement had come as ""a big shock"". ""The big question people are asking is, did he decide to willingly leave the programme or was he pushed out of it?"" he said. Media commentator Alex DeGroote told 5 Live: ""Has he walked? Has be been pushed? Who knows. But it's a stunning development."" His departure ""will be a blow for Good Morning Britain because he is very much the public face of that show"", he said, adding: ""I suspect ITV have decided that their public brand and their public responsibility comes ahead of Piers Morgan. ""They have to be conscious of the fallout in terms of the damage to their own brand, and ultimately nobody is bigger than the station itself."" Morgan is not likely to struggle to find a new outlet, he said. ""He won't be short of offers, and he has a big social following, and those people will follow him to a new platform, so this is definitely not the last of Piers Morgan."" Born in 1965 in an East Sussex village, Piers Stefan Pughe-Morgan was youngest of four children and the son of a meat distribution executive. After leaving school he studied journalism - working his way up through local papers before moving the Sun, where he was given his own showbiz column, Bizarre, by then-editor Kelvin MacKenzie. From there his career in media progressed rapidly. Morgan was just 28 when he became editor of the News of the World in January 1994. By November of the following year he'd joined the Mirror to become the youngest ever editor of a national daily newspaper. The paper's reputation grew under his stewardship but the success came to an abrupt end, when in 2004, he was sacked over approving the frontpage publication of falsified photographs allegedly showing British soldiers humiliating Iraqi prisoners of war. Morgan later told the Times the dismissal ""liberated"" him. A move into TV then followed. His ITV show Life Stories saw him interview prominent celebrity figures, while he also took up a judging role on Britain's Got Talent before landing a leading role on US broadcaster CNN in 2010. But the show was axed in March 2014 due to falling ratings, as Morgan's campaigning and combative stance toward the US gun lobby cemented his controversialist streak. However, as with his departure from the Mirror, he was not down for long. In 2015 he joined the presenting team on ITV's Good Morning Britain - bringing his street-fighting social media presence to breakfast TV every morning alongside Susanna Reid. The pair built up a strong partnership, with Morgan acting as the pantomime villain, outspoken and perfectly suited to the Twitter age.

"This video can not be played Anna Sorokin: ""I never thought I was cheating"" The con woman known as ""the fake heiress"" for posing as a wealthy socialite in New York says she is trying to make the best of her newfound infamy since her release from prison. When asked if crime pays, Anna Sorokin told BBC Newsnight: ""In a way, it did."" Sorokin was paid $320,000 (Â£230,000) by Netflix for her story and says she has been offered other deals. She went to jail after tricking banks, hoteliers and friends out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. The story of her exploits - under the pseudonym Anna Delvey - went viral in New York Magazine in 2018, sparking instant interest from TV producers. ""I never asked for Netflix to buy my story, it just happened,"" says Sorokin, who was released on parole in February after more than three years behind bars. ""And everything else, it just spun out of my control. It's not like I orchestrated anything."" Sorokin was not able to keep all the Netflix money, owing toa New York law that prevents criminals from profiting from their notoriety. The company fully complied with the law and the authorities froze Sorokin's bank account, allowing her victims to make claims to it first. At least $170,000 was used to pay back banks. Who is Anna Sorokin? Racing to screen the âfake heiressâ story Sorokin turned 30 in prison, but she was in her mid-twenties when she spent time in New York City, telling people she had a $60m trust fund and an ambitious project to create an eponymous arts foundation. She was, in fact, a recent magazine intern, who came from an ordinary family of Russian immigrants living in Germany. By staying in expensive hotels and presenting a jetset life on Instagram, she managed to trick others into believing her fantasy and picking up her bills. Using fake documents, she even convinced a bank to give her a $100,000 overdraft, before the police finally tracked her down. Sorokin now claims the prosecution played a major role in creating her media persona during her high-profile trial. ""The prosecution totally misrepresented my motives. They said I paraded around New York, posing as an heiress. What happened was strictly between me and financial institutions, it was none of their business. They portrayed me as a wannabe socialite party girl and that was never my goal,"" she says. Anna Sorokin was sentenced in May 2019 Though Sorokin did enjoy champagne lunches and luxury holidays, she primarily had her sights set on creating her arts foundation and she fraudulently sought a $22m loan to try to get it off the ground. She even produced a high-end brochure (but never paid the designer) and claimed to have the backing of celebrity artists, such as the late Cristo, for the launch party. (Before the artist died last year, his publicist told the BBC the claim was pure fabrication.) Sorokin's defence was also built around a ""fake it until you make it"" narrative.Her lawyer told The Cut he enlisted a stylist,externalso she could keep up appearances in the courtroom. Asked now when Anna Sorokin started to become Anna Delvey, she says: ""I always was Anna Delvey."" ""[Others] portrayed me as someone very manipulative, which I don't think I am,"" she says. ""I was never too nice of a person. I was never trying to talk my way into anything. I just told people what I wanted and they gave it to me, or I would move on."" Sorokin was found guilty of four counts of theft of services, three counts of grand larceny and one count of attempted grand larceny in April 2019. She was acquitted of two other charges. Since her release from prison, she says she has been inundated with media requests and she has hired her own filmmaker to take control of her narrative. ""I am writing my book, I have my NFT [non-fungible tokens] project, and my merch, and [I am working on] prison reform,"" she says. ""I am trying to turn the attention I am getting into something positive."" Actress Julia Garner - who has the lead role in Netflix's Inventing Anna, out later this year - visited Sorokin in prison She insists she does not consider being a convicted con artist as a badge of honour. On social media, however, she is not shying away from this reputation. Earlier this week, she tweeted an image of a stack of books themed on money and trickery, including Den of Thieves and The Biggest Bluff. My strange encounters with a fake heiress Why are we fascinated by con artists? Though she has previously spoken of regret, she now says that is not the right word, because that implies sadness and she is not sad about what she did, even though she wouldn't do it again. Her lawyer, Todd Spodek, told the BBC that she is working on an appeal and he anticipates that she will be deported back to Germany in due course. Sorokin says she will try to stay in the US.

The 33-year-old was last seen in Clapham, south London, on 3 March. The policeman and a woman were arrested at a house in Kent on Tuesday. Searches are being carried out at a building in Deal as well as on land near Ashford. The Met said it was ""shocking and deeply disturbing"" that the arrested man was a serving officer.

Officers have also been carrying out searches on land near to Great Chart Golf and Leisure in Ashford. Retired farmer Derek Batt, 72, of nearby Fridd Farm, said officers visited his property late on Tuesday. He said: ""They said they were investigating a missing person. I said 'is it Sarah that I have seen on TV?' and she (the officer) said 'yes'."" Mr Batt said he had not seen any suspicious activity in the area. Fridd Farm is located almost three miles away from Great Chart Golf and Leisure complex In a statement, the Met Police said the man and the woman had both been taken into custody at a London police station. Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said the arrests were ""a serious and significant development"". ""We will continue to work with all speed on this investigation but the fact that the arrested man is a serving Metropolitan Police officer is both shocking and deeply disturbing."" During a later statement, he added the officer ""was not on duty at the time"" when Ms Everard went missing and would only confirm he had been arrested ""in connection"" with her disappearance. He also would not say if the officer was known to the 33-year-old.
