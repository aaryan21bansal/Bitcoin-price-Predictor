"Yann Kermorgant is Reading's top scorer this season A Yann Kermorgant penalty was enough for Reading to edge out Fulham and reach the Championship play-off final. The French forward fired the Royals into the Wembley final on Monday, 29 May for a shot at promotion to the Premier League just after half-time. The only goal of the second leg came after Fulham centre-back Tomas Kalas was penalised for handball. Fulham were denied a leveller by a string of excellent saves from Ali Al Habsi in the Reading goal. The Royals, who finished third in manager Jaap Stam's first season in charge, will play either Huddersfield or Sheffield Wednesday in the final. Shortly after full-time, Reading also announced thatChinese brother and sister Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Lihad become the majority shareholders of the club. RELIVE: How Reading reached the Championship play-off final READ MORE: Dai Yongge and Dai Xiu Li complete Reading takeover The two sides were level at 1-1 from Saturday's first leg at Craven Cottage and an opening half an hour of great intensity saw both goalkeepers make fine saves to keep the scores tied. Goalscorer Kermorgant was denied an earlier opener by Marcus Bettinelli's fine right-hand stop after his low shot on the turn, before Al Habsi denied Fulham's Tom Cairney at the other end. After the break, it was a lapse in concentration from Fulham centre-back Kalas that was to prove the decisive moment. Kermorgant chased a ball over the top into the Fulham area and put pressure on Kalas, who was penalised by referee Martin Atkinson as the ball rolled up his left arm. The 35-year-old striker converted the spot kick low to Bettinelli's right for his 19th goal of the Championship campaign. Reading's progression to the final against a free-flowing and attacking Fulham owed much to their player of the season Al Habsi. The Oman international, 35, was imperious throughout and kept his side in the game in the first half with a fine double save, first from Cairney's curling free-kick and then Sone Aluko's rebound. Those quick reflexes came after he parried a Ryan Fredericks shot on to the base of the post. In the second half, and with his side leading, he then tipped over a Kevin McDonald strike after Aluko had cut Reading open with some sublime skill down the right wing. He still had time to deny substitute Chris Martin what looked like a simple finish as he dived to smother the ball at the striker's feet on the edge of the six-yard box. Reading return to Wembley in a Championship play-off final for the first time since 2011, when they were beaten 4-2 by Swansea. Fulham are yet to progress beyond the semi-finals of the format in the second flight. George Evans was in fine form for Reading Fulham had finished sixth in the Championship table Reading manager Jaap Stam: ""It was a tough game. We knew it would be from the start. ""In the first half we played well in how we got in behind and threatened, we tried to manage the space well and in the first half, we played very well and we were aggressive in how we pressed them. ""We spoke at half-time about how we could make it more difficult for them. We got a great start after the break, but then it was about us keeping on pressing them. ""We fought with everything we had. We've done that so many times this season and if you hold on like that, you will force mistakes out of people. On reaching a Wembley final:""We worked so hard to get there. It's not all about football, sometimes it's all about results. ""We're proud in the achievement that we've done. It's great to be there to play in the final, I've been there in my playing career. ""There's a lot at stake and a great prize potentially for the club. It'll be tough against either Huddersfield or Sheffield Wednesday. ""It could be a game of great nerves, a great occasion, but we'll have to manage it properly."" On Ali Al Habsi's performance:""We know he's a great keeper, it's not just about today, he's been superb all season. ""It was a terrific performance. That's why he's paid to be in goal and be our last line of defence."" Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic: ""I believe we played the better football, we were the better team, but we're not off to the final. ""Reading scored two goals in this tie after complicated decisions. ""These situations exist and the push in the box on Lucas Piazon for us didn't get the same treatment as his decision earlier at the opposite end of the pitch. ""But, Martin Atkinson is the best English referee, an international referee and I can't complain. ""We're really disappointed as we've lost the chance to play in the final after these kind of decisions. ""We weren't clinical enough tonight. On one side I'm disappointed but on the other, I'm proud of my team and how they play throughout the season.""

"Former detective Margaret Oliver is played by Lesley Sharp in the drama Three Girls Child sexual abuse has never been a higher police priority. But too many rapists avoid justice, argues former detective Margaret Oliver. As her role in prosecuting the Rochdale grooming gang is marked in a new TV drama, she says police must do more to win the trust of victims I'll never forget the day I arrested Shabir. The light had begun to fade as we knocked on the door of his terraced house in Oldham one early evening back in 2011. As the safety chain rattled and the door opened, the man standing before us seemed anything but the evil predator leading a Rochdale grooming gang he was about to be exposed as. He came quietly as we arrested him and there was no sign of the defiance and abusive outbursts that would later be seen in court. He still had the look of someone who thought he was going to get away with it. And well he might, as many rapists like Shabir had been getting away with it for years. I'd worked with too many young victims of horrific rapes and seen cases go nowhere - even when there was solid evidence. I'd lost count of the times I had to look in the eyes of broken teenagers and explain that there was nothing I could do. The rapists who'd destroyed their lives were about to get off scot-free. But not this time. Actors depict victims of grooming and sexual abuse in Rochdale Getting Shabir off the street was a big breakthrough and I was convinced he was going to be the first of many. We were close to uncovering an epidemic of child sexual abuse and there were scores of men we knew had been violently raping underage girls that were in our sights. That we'd come this far owed a lot to the huge resources now being allocated to tackling grooming gangs (Operation Span was the biggest inquiry Greater Manchester Police were running). But, more importantly, it was down to the hard-won trust we'd managed to establish with the girls these vile rapists were targeting. Without that trust, it didn't matter if 10,000 officers were assigned to the case. We had to get girls to give evidence in court and I knew only too well that Greater Manchester Police did not have a particularly sophisticated approach to winning vulnerable hearts and minds when trying to prosecute rapists. Even though an awareness of child grooming was starting to sweep through the country, the police were still relying on an outdated, approach that didn't work. Joining the police as a mum of four in 1997, I'd spent years learning how to build trust as a detective and family liaison officer working on major murders. I knew that good policing could not function without it. But the hard work of building up trust wasn't especially valued by the top brass. I wasn't breaking down doors or wrestling violent drug dealers to the ground. I was going to a cemetery to help a mother pick a plot to bury her son and supporting people who were prepared to give up everything and go on to the witness protection programme to put away murderers. Maggie Oliver when she was a serving officer with Greater Manchester Police It wasn't long before I was working on rapes, domestic abuse and child protection jobs - the kind of cases that other officers working in Moss Side generally didn't want to do. And I was good at them. But if you won the trust of vulnerable girls who'd been through hell, you had to deliver - and that was heavily dependent on the appetite of people at the top to investigate these crimes. Years before I worked on a scoping exercise - a full-blown major incident team investigation which had identified considerable numbers of child abusers in south Manchester. I'd listened to girls who had been drugged so they couldn't move before they were violently raped - but the investigation was closed down. A few people were warned under the Child Abduction Act but no-one was charged. I was sickened then and still feel angry now when I think back to that case. Vulnerable people were reaching out, desperate to secure justice, and we were letting them down. I'd sworn an oath to uphold the law and ensure ""equal respect to all people"" when I joined the police. Those words seemed meaningless now. Unless we started showing respect to young girls from poorer areas, we were never going to win their trust. When Greater Manchester Police's failings in dealing with child abuse were later laid bare in a series of damning reports, one police officer gave a radio interview in which he admitted that officers referred to the girls as ""scrubbers"" and child prostitutes. That was putting it lightly. I'd heard worse from other officers. There was no real effort to win their trust and a staggering lack of empathy. Some police officers wouldn't even come into the houses where the girls lived. They'd sit in the car eating sandwiches waiting for me to come back. When we drove girls to the station and they asked to put Radio 1 on, officers would switch to Radio 4. There was no attempt to make them feel comfortable. But it's these little things that often count, and which help to build bridges. I saw myself as a person first and police officer second, but many of my colleagues could only see themselves as police officers first and foremost. Empathy had been trained out of them. The pressures of modern policing and a target-driven culture was driving humanity out of our profession. I couldn't do the job if I didn't care, but to show a human face was a sign of weakness to some. ""You've become emotionally involved,"" they'd say. We had to maintain too big a distance from everyone. As a result, there were many estates where the police were hated. The people who lived there suffered disproportionately from crime, but had given up on the police. They didn't trust us because we showed them no respect. It's this failure to win the trust of victims of appalling crimes that's at the heart of the BBC drama about the Rochdale grooming scandal. It shows a desperately real side of policing that's rarely ever dramatised and the general public know little about. In the end Shabir and 11 other men were convicted for child abuse in 2012. But this was just the tip of the iceberg. There were many, many more who got away with it and I was left with the sense that this was a box the police didn't really want to open. But they couldn't keep the lid down for long and now the secret is out. A crime that had been contained and swept under the carpet for years can no longer be ignored. For me, the end of the road was when they betrayed the trust I'd earned from a key witness and I couldn't get assurances on how vulnerable witnesses would be treated in the future. I knew men who'd violently abused girls were still walking the streets and we had the power to stop them. I couldn't do a job I loved as long as I knew rapists were getting away with it because police viewed the girls they preyed upon as unreliable witnesses. The criminals knew this and they were emboldened by it. ""No one will believe you,"" they'd laugh at sobbing girls, as they left them crushed in a heap on the floor. Maxine Peake - who plays local sexual health worker Sara Rowbotham - with Lesley Sharp Barely a week goes by these days without a headline referring to a crisis in the police. But the crisis no-one's talking about is the crisis of trust, particularly where young people are concerned. A few years ago, an all-party group of MPs found that a significant proportion of children and young people have a profound lack of trust in the police. It should have acted as a wake-up call, but I don't believe things are getting any better. When the human side of the police is shown, we always break down barriers and there are plenty of shining examples of brilliant police officers who do this week in week out. But we need more and we need leaders who set a culture in place who insist the values of empathy, honesty and integrity are always upheld in our dealings with vulnerable victims. If we can't reach out to vulnerable witnesses, all the announcements from Westminster won't mean a thing. Criminals will keep getting away with it.

"Few killers achieved the notoriety or attracted as much public loathing as the so-called ""Moors Murderer"", Ian Brady, who has died at the age of 79. Over a period of 18 months in the 1960s, Brady and his accomplice, Myra Hindley, kidnapped and murdered five children in north-west England. The bodies of three of their victims were later found buried on Saddleworth Moor near the town of Oldham. The details of the crime shocked the nation, not least because Brady's accomplice was a woman, and also because of the complete lack of remorse either showed during the subsequent trial. Brady was born Ian Stewart on 2 January 1938, the illegitimate son of a Scottish waitress. His violent personality was shaped by an unstable background. His mother neglected him and he was raised by foster parents in the Gorbals, Glasgow's toughest slum. After a spree of petty crime as a teenager the courts sent him to Manchester to live with his mother and her new husband, Patrick Brady. Brady met Myra Hindley at a company where they both worked He assumed his stepfather's name, continued his criminal activities and developed into a fully-fledged teenage alcoholic. By now he had acquired new interests, building up a library of books on Nazi Germany, sadism and sexual perversion. He first met Hindley when she worked as a secretary at the company where they were both employed. For Hindley it was love at first sight. Brady impressed her by reading Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf in the original German. As their relationship developed, they began taking obscene photographs of each other before turning their attention to kidnapping, child molestation and murder. Between July 1963 and December 1964, 16-year-old Pauline Reade, 12-year-old John Kilbride and Keith Bennett, also 12, were reported missing, all in the Manchester area. Another victim - Lesley Ann Downey, 10 - disappeared on 26 December 1964. John Kilbride was the second child to disappear Authorities were baffled by what they referred to as the ""unrelated"" cases, and were left without a single piece of solid evidence. In the meantime, Brady and Hindley were intent on a campaign to corrupt Hindley's brother-in-law, David Smith, and recruit him into their circle. A petty criminal with convictions of his own, Smith was amused when the conversation turned to murder; he questioned Brady's ability to follow it through. On 6 October 1965, Brady offered a practical demonstration with Edward Evans, 17, striking him 14 times with a hatchet before strangling him. Horrified, Smith phoned the police the next morning, directing them to Brady's address. The officers caught Brady and Hindley at home, retrieving a fresh corpse from the bedroom, along with the bloody hatchet and Brady's library of volumes on perversion and sadism. A 12-year-old neighbour recalled several trips she had made with the couple to Saddleworth Moor, and the police launched a search which uncovered the body of Leslie Ann Downey on 16 October. The body of Keith Bennett has never been found, despite appeals to Brady for help Four days later, another search of Brady's flat turned up two left luggage tickets for Manchester Central Station, leading police to a pair of hidden suitcases. Inside, they found nude photographs of the girl, along with tape recordings of her final tortured moments, pleading for her life as she was sexually abused. A series of seemingly innocent snapshots depicted portions of Saddleworth Moor, and detectives paid another visit to the desolate region on 21 October, unearthing the body of John Kilbride. Police announced they were opening their files on eight people who had disappeared over the previous four years, but no new charges had been added by the time the couple went on trial. Jurors were stunned by the Downey tape, and by Brady's bland description of the recording as ""unusual"". On 6 May 1966, both defendants were convicted of killing Edward Evans and Leslie Ann Downey. Brady was also found guilty of murdering John Kilbride, while Hindley was convicted as an accessory after the fact. Brady photographed Myra Hindley on Saddleworth Moor Brady was sentenced to concurrent life terms on each count, while Hindley received two life terms plus seven years in the Kilbride case. Nineteen years later, in November 1985, Brady was transferred from prison to a maximum-security hospital after being diagnosed a psychopath. There, in an interview with newspaper reporters, he confessed to the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett. Another year passed before searchers returned to the moors, with Hindley joining them for an abortive outing in December 1986, and Brady doing the same in 1987. The remains of Pauline Reade were uncovered on 30 June 1987, nearly a quarter of a century after her disappearance. It took pathologists a month to decide she had been sexually assaulted, her throat slashed from behind. In August 1987, Brady posted a letter to the BBC containing sketchy information on five ""new"" murders he said he had committed. Lesley Anne Downey was the first victim whose body was found Five months later the Director of Public Prosecutions announced that, in the public interest, there would be no prosecution of the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett. Brady accepted from the start that he would never be released, unlike Hindley who, in trying to secure parole, claimed Brady had forced her into killing by abusing and torturing her into submission. But Brady reacted to her allegation by claiming: ""For 20 years I continued to ratify the cover I had given her at the trial whilst, in contrast, she systematically began to fabricate upon it to my detriment."" Myra Hindley died in 2002. Ian Brady, who had been on hunger strike, and force-fed daily, declared he would rather die quickly than rot slowly in jail. His attempts to force the authorities to let him starve himself to death failed. In March 2000 a judge described his hunger strike as part of his ""obsessive need to exercise control"". A year later Brady's book - The Gates of Janus, an analysis of serial murders - was released by an American firm, Feral House. The decision to publish caused an outcry in the British press and resulted in hate mail being sent to the publisher, Adam Parfrey. In 2012 Brady asked to be returned to prison so he could starve himself to death without the force-feeding permitted in mental institutions. Brady was arrested after the killing of Edward Evans A tribunal ruled it was appropriate that he continue to be treated in a mental hospital. In the same year Keith Bennett's mother, Winnie Johnson, who had fought for four decades to have the two killers prosecuted for her son's murder, died of cancer. Her overriding wish, to find Keith's remains and give him a Christian burial, was never fulfilled. John Kilbride's brother Danny, who had campaigned against any suggestion the two should ever be released, died a year earlier. Chris Cowley, a forensic psychologist who had spent six years in dialogues with Brady, had earlier concluded he was a sociopath with few redeeming features, showing no compassion or feeling for anyone other than himself. ""His only thought for the victims or their families is what he can get out of it,"" Dr Cowley told the Sunday Telegraph in 2011. ""He would kill again without a thought for anyone who gets in his way.""

"After suffering a crushing defeat in the first round of the French presidential election, can the party of Francois Mitterrand survive? Socialists are romantics. They love their icons and their rituals. They get attached to history. They believe in the continuity of the fight. They see themselves carrying a torch lit first by the heroes of the past, in their beards and their bowlers. For Socialists, the party has a meaning that goes beyond the ups and downs of electoral fortune. It structures their thoughts, and it conditions their friendships. In a way that transcends mere politics, it plays a real part in their lives. To live in a world where the party no longer mattered - that would be a truncated, an empty form of existence. And yet in France today - if you believe some of the commentators - it is the very survival of the Socialist Party (PS) that is now at stake. And the faithful are bereft. The signs of mortality are certainly strong. In the presidential election, the Socialist candidate, Benoit Hamon, was knocked out in round one, with just 6.36% of the vote. The score was the lowest achieved by a Socialist candidate since Gaston Defferre's 5.1% in 1969. The PS's Benoit Hamon received less than 7% of the vote in the first round of the election Worse, Mr Hamon was not just overtaken, he was trounced by another candidate of the left, Jean-Luc Melenchon, of the radical La France Insoumise (France Unbowed). Mr Melenchon got 19.6% and more than seven million votes - three times the PS score. Today, he enjoys a popularity nationwide that far exceeds that of any Socialist leader. And on the party's other flank, there is another danger: the new presidency of Emmanuel Macron. Mr Macron may not look like a Socialist, but the left is where his political feelings lie. That is why he chose to work under Francois Hollande, a Socialist president. The maps that show how France voted and why French ex-PM Manuel Valls wants to be Macron MP BBC Newsday: Socialists say how they got it wrong Now that Emmanuel Macron has his own party up and running - La Republique en Marche (REM) - there is suddenly another powerful rival vying for votes. The PS finds itself caught in a classic casse-noisette (nutcracker). On both sides are powerful new ""movements"" set up in deliberate counterpoint to the old party system. At the forthcoming parliamentary elections, if voters want social-radical, they'll pick Mr Melenchon. If they want social-liberal, they'll pick Mr Macron. The space in the middle is shrinking to insignificance. All of which would be more easily surmountable, if the Socialist Party itself was in any shape to mount a comeback. But the PS is torn between factions that themselves reflect the changing outward perspective. The far right Marine Le Pen beat the Socialist and radical left candidates On the one hand, there are those figures willing to work in alliance with Mr Macron's REM. The most extreme example is former Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who has described the PS as ""dead"" and more or less torn up his party card. At the other end are leaders - such as the ex-candidate Benoit Hamon - who dream of forming a new left-wing opposition to the Macron presidency, in alliance with ecologists and Mr Melenchon's radicals. And in the middle are people who argue for a watching brief, supporting or opposing Mr Macron according to the issue. The point is that no clear line is emerging from the top, so the PS is going into the legislatives not just demoralised but also leaderless and incoherent. Small wonder the party fears a wipeout. For some analysts, what is happening is the end of a historical cycle that goes back nearly 50 years - to the 1969 annihilation, in fact, of Gaston Defferre and the regenerative shock that gave to the French left. In 1969, the Socialist Party in France did not exist. Instead, there was the French Section of the Workers International (SFIO), which was Mr Defferre's party, plus smaller parties linked to Francois Mitterrand and Michel Rocard. And of course, the biggest party of the left - the Communists. But the 1969 result triggered a series of changes, culminating in the much-mythologised Congress of Epinay two years later, in which Mr Mitterrand engineered a union of the disparate groups and founded the modern-day PS. By entering a strategic agreement with the Communists - and introducing them to his government in 1981 - he then succeeded in emasculating the far left. And the course of French socialist history was set for a generation. Socialist Francois Mitterrand won the presidency in 1981 and 1988 But at the heart of the Mitterrand legacy was a contradiction - between dogma and reality, utopia and the free market. Mr Mitterrand, with his imposing personality and cynical use of the powers vested in him as president, was able to surmount that gap. But no-one since has lived up to his example. All that successive leaders could do was paper over the cracks. Mr Hollande was a master of this art of political ""synthesis"". As long as a form of words could be adduced, then all sides were satisfied and the grail of Socialist unity was assured. Till now. So is this historic phase now drawing to a close? One argument says yes. The old party system is already breaking down. Social media and post-modern politics are changing the relationship between voter and candidate. Party structures are cumbersome and unreactive. Other parties in history have disappeared. Once upon a time there was a French Radical Party that was one of the most powerful in the land. Now, it barely registers. Ditto the SFIO. The PS could similarly shut down, many argue, and the world of political ideas would be none the poorer. But let us not be hasty. New politics may be all the rage today, but who knows what lies ahead? Sentiment and tradition still count for something - and the rose and the fist was a mighty icon. The PS is not dead yet.

"Candidates: Clockwise from top left: Lawyer Alice Fisher, New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia, Republican Senator John Cornyn and Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe US President Donald Trump has said he could announce a replacement for former FBI director James Comey as early as this week, and former Senator Joe Lieberman was among his top choices. Mr Trump told reporters on Thursday his pick would be announced ""very soon"". The position requires Senate confirmation. The White House was engulfed in turmoil after Mr Trump fired Mr Comey, citing his handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while at the State Department. Critics have accused the White House of trying to thwart Mr Comey's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the US election and any Moscow ties to Trump associates. There were reportedly at least 14 candidates in the frame, but Trey Gowdy and John Cornyn have ruled themselves out. Earlier this week, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer added three more names to the list. Joe Lieberman:The former Connecticut senator, 75, is a Democrat-turned-Independent who endorsed John McCain in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. He was the Democratic vice-presidential candidate on the 2000 ticket with Al Gore. Mr Lieberman lost the Democratic primary in 2006 but kept his seat as an ""independent Democrat"" in the general election. He was Connecticut's attorney general before he was elected to the Senate in 1988. He retired from Congress in 2012. Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe:The former FBI deputy director became second in command in January 2016. Before joining the FBI, he interned with the Department of Justice's criminal division while in law school and later worked at a Philadelphia law firm. Mr McCabe's wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat in Virginia for a state Senate seat in 2016 and received political donations from some Clinton allies. He appeared to contradict the White House during testimony last week, telling a congressional panel the FBI investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election was ""a highly significant investigation"". He also said Mr Comey ""enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does to this day"", casting doubt on Mr Trump's claim that the former FBI chief had lost the confidence of his staff. Frank Keating:The former Oklahoma Republican governor worked as an FBI special agent before becoming a politician. He pennedan op-ed in the Tulsa World,externallast April entitled: ""Anyone but Trump"". But his brother, Dan Keating, served as the Oklahoma state co-chair for Mr Trump's campaign. The governor toldMSNBC at the Republican National Convention,externalthat he voted for Ohio Governor John Kasich in the Republican primary election, but conceded ""Trump's our guy"" and there was no other alternative. Richard McFeely:Retired from the FBI in 2014 after more than two decades with the agency. He was a top official who oversaw about 60% of FBI operations, including the Cyber Division, which included an upwards of a thousand agents, analysts, forensic specialists and computer scientists, according toa 2013 New Yorker piece,external. Mike Rogers:The former Michigan congressman was endorsed by the FBI Agents Association, which represents thousands of current and former FBI agents. The former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is also an ex-FBI special agent and a veteran of the armed forces. The association described Mr Rogers as ""someone capable of confronting the wide array of challenges facing our help ensure that the bureau remains the world's premiere law enforcement agency"". The row explained Could Trump be guilty of obstruction of justice? Is Trump's thin skin to blame? Three takeaways from Trump NBC interview Alice Fisher:The defence lawyer was the first candidate interviewed at the justice department, according to US media reports. She ran the justice department's criminal division as an assistant attorney general under former president George W Bush and is currently a partner at a Washington law firm. Ms Fisher would be the first woman to lead the agency if selected. Judge Michael Garcia:The former federal prosecutor serves as an associate judge on New York's highest state court. As a US attorney, he oversaw an investigation into a prostitution ring that prompted the resignation of then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. He also led an investigation into alleged corruption in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. His inquiry also aided a criminal investigation of Fifa, the world governing body of soccer, by US and Switzerland. The Latino judge was appointed to the court by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2016. He also was appointed as assistant secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by former President Bush in 2002. Are Democrats being hypocrites? Trump quietly mulled over FBI bombshell Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake Henry E Hudson:The US district judge in Virginia was appointed by former President Bush. He is best known for striking down a key provision of former President Barack Obama's healthcare law in 2010. The conservative judge also sentenced football star Michael Vick to nearly two years in federal prison for running a dog-fighting operation in Virginia in 2007. Frances Townsend:Ms Townsend served as a security and counterterrorism adviser to the Bush administration. She was reportedlyspotted at the White House,externalon Monday afternoon before Mr Comey was fired and met Mr Trump last year at Trump Tower in New York when she was under consideration for a top administration role.  The former federal prosecutor in New York climbed the ranks to become a senior intelligence official at the justice department and US Coast Guard in Washington. She would become the first female to lead the agency. However, she was one of dozens of national security veterans to sign an open letter calling Mr Trump a ""fundamentally dishonest"" candidate during the election campaign. Adam Lee:The head of the FBI's office in Richmond, Virginia, returned to the justice department for a second interview on Saturday, according to US media. William Evanina:He is the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Paul Abbate:He currently serves as the executive assistant director for the FBI's Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. He previously oversaw FBI field offices in Washington and Detroit and has been at the agency for more than 20 years. Michael Anderson:The FBI special agent heads the agency's Chicago office. Judge Michael Luttig:He is a former justice department lawyer who was appointed by President George HW Bush. He left the bench in 2006 to join Boeing, where he serves as general counsel. He was considered for two US Supreme Court vacancies, which were instead given to Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito. Larry Thompson:He served as a deputy attorney general under the Bush administration from 2001 to 2003. He also was a federal prosecutor in Georgia and has held several senior roles at PepsiCo. Ray Kelly:The former police commissioner led the New York Police Department (NYPD) for more than a decade. He created the first counterterrorism bureau in any police department in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and oversaw a marked drop in New York's crime. But under his leadership, the NYPD was scrutinised for its use of aggressive force and stop-and-frisk programme, which critics say disproportionately affected non-white residents. John Suthers:The mayor of Colorado Springs was formerly the state's attorney general from 2005 to 2015. As a prosecutor he was one of several to sue the Obama administration during the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and he signed on to a legal challenge to defend the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which barred gay marriage.

"After a cyber-attack disrupted IT services across the globe, many people have written to the BBC with questions about why it happened, how you can protect your computers and smartphones, and if the attackers will be caught. BBC Technology reporter Chris Foxx and security expert Prof Alan Woodward provide some answers. WannaCry ransomware cyber-attacks slow but fears remain ""Practically speaking, it's not possible to completely isolate the NHS network,"" said cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward. ""The NHS sends emails to patients who have email addresses outside of the NHS network. ""People in the NHS also use the internet heavily for research, just like academics."" Even a private network can be compromised, especially in an organisation with thousands of people using it daily. ""Once [a virus] has managed to enter the larger network, it can then use vulnerabilities to spread,"" said Prof Woodward. Since serving customers online is now part of banks' bread and butter, you would expect cyber-security to be at the very top of their priorities. Cyber-security is a game of cat and mouse, with criminals always thinking of new ways to attack systems, so no organisation is totally impenetrable. This ransomware outbreak is mostly likely to affect your finances if you get infected and pay the ransom, which security experts say you should not do. There is absolutely no guarantee the criminals would give your files back. If you run a business, there is detailed guidance on theNational Cyber Security Centre website,externalyou can follow to make sure your company is protected. How the cyber-attack can be traced to the US Should you pay the WannaCry ransom? Is my computer at risk? Microsoft has already identified the way this specific strain of ransomware spread from device to device, and has issued aissued a fix,external. As long as your operating system is up-to-date, you should be protected from this strain of ransomware. Always make sure you are running the latest version of your operating system with the latest security fixes installed - and run up-to-date anti-virus software from a trusted company. Although this strain of ransomware was not spread by email, always beware suspicious emails asking you to click links or download attachments. Criminals will often use a widely publicised virus outbreak to send scam emails, pretending to offer help. To prevent heartbreak, if the worst comes to the worst you should keep a backup copy of important files, photos and videos on an external hard drive. Make sure to disconnect the drive from your computer after making your backup, so ransomware can't access it if your computer is infected. ""The bottom line is that all you can really do is keep your software, including your virus checker, up to date. Ideally have updates set to automatic,"" said Prof Woodward. The purpose of a ransomware attack is to extort money from victims. It is a powerful attack because people may fear losing their documents and photographs and so may be more likely to pay. When it hits businesses and hospitals, there is extra pressure to get rid of the ransomware quickly. The government has said the ransomware outbreak at the NHS was not a targeted attack on the UK's health service. It may be that the attackers created their virus without knowing exactly how far it would spread. No. This strain of ransomware was spread from device to device by taking advantage of an old security hole in some versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system. The hole is fixed in the latest versions of Windows. However, ransomware can be spread in rogue email attachments, so do not click links or open attachments in unsolicited emails. ""Practice ABC - assume nothing, believe no-one, check everything,"" says Prof Woodward. Yes, every operating system could theoretically be attacked. Criminals tend to target systems such as Windows or the Android mobile operating system, because they are more widely used, increasing the chance of people falling victim. In the same way that a burglar breaking into a home can cover their tracks, cyber-criminals can go to great lengths to hide their identity. However, many cyber-criminals have been caught and brought to justice - and the UK's National Crime Agency, Europol and the FBI are already investigating.

"Mandy Mayer, 56, thinks DNA-testing has helped her drop a dress size The latest health and fitness trend involves taking a DNA test to find out more about how our bodies respond to different types of food and exercise. But how accurate and effective are these kits? Fitness fanatic Mandy Mayer, 56, exercised several times a week but felt like she'd hit a plateau. Her personal trainer suggested she try a DNAFit test, which tests the body's genetic response to key foods and exercise. ""I jumped at the chance,"" she says. ""I thought I'd love to have that kind of knowledge."" After sending off a swab of her saliva, she received a report on her fitness and diet in January. She was impressed. ""I was like 'wow'. They told me I don't tolerate caffeine and refined foods very well, and I respond better to endurance training than anything else."" Three months later and she has dropped from a size 12 to a size 10 and lost several kilos. She attributes her leaner figure to understanding more about her genetic code. ""Without a shadow of a doubt it was down to the test,"" says Mandy, who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire. ""It's made me follow the right training and make little changes to my diet."" A growing number of start-ups, such as 23andMe, FitnessGenes, UBiome, DNAFit, Orig3n and Habit, are moving into this space, promising that mail-order genetic tests can change your life for the better. Orig3n is one of a growing number of start-ups entering the DNA-testing market Some researchers believe the global market for such kits could be worth more than $10bn (Â£7.7bn) by 2022. But how do they work and how reliable are they? Avi Lasarow, chief executive of DNAFit, explains that everything about who we are is the unique combination of what we are born with - our genetics - and how we live - our environment. ""The biggest 'environment' factor that we can control in our day-to-day lives is our diet,"" he says, ""so by understanding more about the static part, the genetics, we can better tweak the bit in our control."" He gives the example of the CYP1A2 gene, which controls around 95% of caffeine metabolism. ""Some people are fast metabolisers, some are slow, depending on their variants of this gene. Once you know this, however, you can make a better informed decision on your caffeine intake than you could without your genetic data."" Robin Smith, chief executive of Orig3n, which offers a range of health and wellness DNA tests costing from $29 to $149, says the results can help people make educated choices about what works for their bodies. ""If a person's DNA suggests that she is more likely to be deficient in B vitamins, she can pay attention to that in her daily life. ""Knowing what your DNA says about your body's food sensitivities, food breakdown, hunger, weight, vitamins, allows you to become a more informed consumer. DNAFit says its kits can tell us what type of exercise we should be doing ""You can become smarter about what you choose to eat, and smarter about what supplements you choose to buy, saving you time, energy, and money while getting the results you want faster."" So much for the sales pitch, but some genetic experts are concerned that the efficacy of such kits may be overhyped. ""I'm not against people being able to access genetic information about themselves if they wish to do so, provided the test results and limitations are clearly explained,"" says Dr Jess Buxton, a geneticist at University College London. ""However, I do think that the amount of useful information that personalised health tests can offer is very limited at present because we still know very little about the effect of most SNPs [genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms] and other types of genetic variation on a person's health."" While there are a few conditions, such as lactose intolerance, for which the genetic variations are very clear and well understood, the same cannot be said for most other conditions, she says. ""These [genetic variations] interact with each other and with non-genetic factors in ways that we don't fully understand, so it's impossible to make accurate predictions based on information about just a few of the gene variants involved, as many of these tests do."" That said, some studies do suggest that this kind of analysis might work. For example, the University of Trieste and the IRCCS Burlo Garofolo Institute for Maternal and Child Health in Italy found that those following diet based on genetic analysis lost 33% more weight than a controlled group. Some start-ups are not just relying on a person's genetic make-up to make their diet and exercise recommendations. San Francisco-based Habit's home kit includes a series of DNA samples, blood tests and a shake to drink so that the company can measure how your body metabolises fats, carbohydrates and proteins. ""Unlike other at-home tests that measure DNA alone, Habit looks at how the entire body works together,"" explains founder and chief executive Neil Grimmer. Thierry Attias found out that he needed to eat far more vegetables to lose weight Habit, he says, measures more than 60 nutrition-related blood and genetic biomarkers, biometrics and lifestyle choices, to make personalised nutrition recommendations for each individual. ""Personalised recommendations should be based on your entire biology, not just your DNA,"" says Mr Grimmer. One early adopter is Thierry Attias, president of Momentum Sports Group, a firm managing the UnitedHealthcare Pro Cycling team. ""Even though I cycle a few times a week, I carry an extra couple of pounds and I was curious to learn more about myself,"" says Mr Attias, who lives in Oakland, California. He discovered that he's caffeine sensitive, his diet needs to include more plant-based food, and his body is slow at processing fats. While Habit was still in testing phase, he opted to receive personalised ready-to-eat meals from the company for three days. ""An interesting thing happened,"" he enthuses. ""I lost 4lbs (1.8kg) in a few days. I learnt portion size and how much more veg I needed in a serving."" In two months he has lost about 11lbs, he says. But do we really need a testing kit to tell us to eat more vegetables and fewer fats as part of a healthy balanced diet - advice that has been around for decades? You decide.

"A coded tweet from a Google researcher first raised suspicions of a North Korea link Who was behind the huge global cyber-attack? One prominent theory right now is North Korea - but what we know is far from conclusive. You may not have heard of the Lazarus Group, but you may be aware of its work. The devastatinghack on Sony Pictures in 2014, and another on aBangladeshi bank in 2016, have both been attributed to the highly sophisticated group. It is widely believed that the Lazarus Group worked out of China, but on behalf of the North Koreans. Security experts are now cautiously linking the Lazarus Group to this latest attack after a discovery by Google security researcherNeel Mehta,external. He found similarities between code found within WannaCry - the software used in the hack - and other tools believed to have been created by the Lazarus Group in the past. It's a mere sliver of evidence, but there are other clues to consider too. Cyber-attack: Your questions answered Should you pay the WannaCry ransom? Cyber-attack: Is my computer at risk? Global manhunt for WannaCry creators Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert, pointed out to me that the text demanding the ransom uses what reads like machine-translated English, with a Chinese segment apparently written by a native speaker. ""As you can see it's pretty thin and all circumstantial,"" Prof Woodward said. ""However, it's worth further investigation."" The WannaCry malware threatens to delete users' data unless they pay a ransom ""Neel Mehtaâs discovery is the most significant clue to date regarding the origins of WannaCry,â said Russian security firmKaspersky,external, but noted a lot more information is needed about earlier versions of WannaCry before any firm conclusion can be reached. ""We believe itâs important that other researchers around the world investigate these similarities and attempt to discover more facts about the origin of WannaCry,â the company added. ""Looking back to the Bangladesh attack, in the early days, there were very few facts linking them to the Lazarus Group. ""In time, more evidence appeared and allowed us, and others, to link them together with high confidence. Further research can be crucial to connecting the dots."" Attributing cyber-attacks can be notoriously difficult - often relying on consensus rather than confirmation. For example, North Korea has never admitted any involvement in the Sony Pictures hack - and while security researchers, and the US government, have confidence in the theory, neither can rule out the possibility of a false flag. Skilled hackers may have simply made it look like it had origins in North Korea by using similar techniques. 'Wouldnât stand up in court' In the case of WannaCry, it is possible that hackers simply copied code from earlier attacks by the Lazarus Group. This video can not be played How to protect yourself online But Kaspersky said false flags within WannaCry were ""possible"" but ""improbable"", as the shared code was removed from later versions. ""There's a lot of ifs in there,"" added Prof Woodward. ""It wouldn't stand up in court as it is. But it's worth looking deeper, being conscious of confirmation bias now that North Korea has been identified as a possibility."" Itâs the strongest theory yet as to the origin of WannaCry, but there are also details that arguably point away from it being the work of North Korea. Few could have suspected a Seth Rogen-directed film would have such global political repercussions First, China was among the countries worst hit, and not accidentally - the hackers made sure there was a version of the ransom note written in Chinese. It seems unlikely North Korea would want to antagonise its strongest ally. Russia too was badly affected. Second, North Korean cyber-attacks have typically been far more targeted, often with a political goal in mind. In the case of Sony Pictures, hackers sought to prevent the release of The Interview, a film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. WannaCry, in contrast, was wildly indiscriminate - it would infect anything and everything it could. Finally, if the plan was simply to make money, itâs been pretty unsuccessful on that front too - only around $60,000 (Â£46,500) has been paid in ransoms, according to analysis of Bitcoin accounts being used by the criminals. With more than 200,000 machines infected, it's a terrible return. But then of course, maybe the ransom was a distraction for some other political goal not yet clear. Another possibility is that the Lazarus Group worked alone, without instruction from North Korea. Indeed, it could be that the Lazarus Group isnât even linked to North Korea.

"Mandy Mayer, 56, thinks DNA-testing has helped her drop a dress size The latest health and fitness trend involves taking a DNA test to find out more about how our bodies respond to different types of food and exercise. But how accurate and effective are these kits? Fitness fanatic Mandy Mayer, 56, exercised several times a week but felt like she'd hit a plateau. Her personal trainer suggested she try a DNAFit test, which tests the body's genetic response to key foods and exercise. ""I jumped at the chance,"" she says. ""I thought I'd love to have that kind of knowledge."" After sending off a swab of her saliva, she received a report on her fitness and diet in January. She was impressed. ""I was like 'wow'. They told me I don't tolerate caffeine and refined foods very well, and I respond better to endurance training than anything else."" Three months later and she has dropped from a size 12 to a size 10 and lost several kilos. She attributes her leaner figure to understanding more about her genetic code. ""Without a shadow of a doubt it was down to the test,"" says Mandy, who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire. ""It's made me follow the right training and make little changes to my diet."" A growing number of start-ups, such as 23andMe, FitnessGenes, UBiome, DNAFit, Orig3n and Habit, are moving into this space, promising that mail-order genetic tests can change your life for the better. Orig3n is one of a growing number of start-ups entering the DNA-testing market Some researchers believe the global market for such kits could be worth more than $10bn (Â£7.7bn) by 2022. But how do they work and how reliable are they? Avi Lasarow, chief executive of DNAFit, explains that everything about who we are is the unique combination of what we are born with - our genetics - and how we live - our environment. ""The biggest 'environment' factor that we can control in our day-to-day lives is our diet,"" he says, ""so by understanding more about the static part, the genetics, we can better tweak the bit in our control."" He gives the example of the CYP1A2 gene, which controls around 95% of caffeine metabolism. ""Some people are fast metabolisers, some are slow, depending on their variants of this gene. Once you know this, however, you can make a better informed decision on your caffeine intake than you could without your genetic data."" Robin Smith, chief executive of Orig3n, which offers a range of health and wellness DNA tests costing from $29 to $149, says the results can help people make educated choices about what works for their bodies. ""If a person's DNA suggests that she is more likely to be deficient in B vitamins, she can pay attention to that in her daily life. ""Knowing what your DNA says about your body's food sensitivities, food breakdown, hunger, weight, vitamins, allows you to become a more informed consumer. DNAFit says its kits can tell us what type of exercise we should be doing ""You can become smarter about what you choose to eat, and smarter about what supplements you choose to buy, saving you time, energy, and money while getting the results you want faster."" So much for the sales pitch, but some genetic experts are concerned that the efficacy of such kits may be overhyped. ""I'm not against people being able to access genetic information about themselves if they wish to do so, provided the test results and limitations are clearly explained,"" says Dr Jess Buxton, a geneticist at University College London. ""However, I do think that the amount of useful information that personalised health tests can offer is very limited at present because we still know very little about the effect of most SNPs [genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms] and other types of genetic variation on a person's health."" While there are a few conditions, such as lactose intolerance, for which the genetic variations are very clear and well understood, the same cannot be said for most other conditions, she says. ""These [genetic variations] interact with each other and with non-genetic factors in ways that we don't fully understand, so it's impossible to make accurate predictions based on information about just a few of the gene variants involved, as many of these tests do."" That said, some studies do suggest that this kind of analysis might work. For example, the University of Trieste and the IRCCS Burlo Garofolo Institute for Maternal and Child Health in Italy found that those following diet based on genetic analysis lost 33% more weight than a controlled group. Some start-ups are not just relying on a person's genetic make-up to make their diet and exercise recommendations. San Francisco-based Habit's home kit includes a series of DNA samples, blood tests and a shake to drink so that the company can measure how your body metabolises fats, carbohydrates and proteins. ""Unlike other at-home tests that measure DNA alone, Habit looks at how the entire body works together,"" explains founder and chief executive Neil Grimmer. Thierry Attias found out that he needed to eat far more vegetables to lose weight Habit, he says, measures more than 60 nutrition-related blood and genetic biomarkers, biometrics and lifestyle choices, to make personalised nutrition recommendations for each individual. ""Personalised recommendations should be based on your entire biology, not just your DNA,"" says Mr Grimmer. One early adopter is Thierry Attias, president of Momentum Sports Group, a firm managing the UnitedHealthcare Pro Cycling team. ""Even though I cycle a few times a week, I carry an extra couple of pounds and I was curious to learn more about myself,"" says Mr Attias, who lives in Oakland, California. He discovered that he's caffeine sensitive, his diet needs to include more plant-based food, and his body is slow at processing fats. While Habit was still in testing phase, he opted to receive personalised ready-to-eat meals from the company for three days. ""An interesting thing happened,"" he enthuses. ""I lost 4lbs (1.8kg) in a few days. I learnt portion size and how much more veg I needed in a serving."" In two months he has lost about 11lbs, he says. But do we really need a testing kit to tell us to eat more vegetables and fewer fats as part of a healthy balanced diet - advice that has been around for decades? You decide.

"Few killers achieved the notoriety or attracted as much public loathing as the so-called ""Moors Murderer"", Ian Brady, who has died at the age of 79. Over a period of 18 months in the 1960s, Brady and his accomplice, Myra Hindley, kidnapped and murdered five children in north-west England. The bodies of three of their victims were later found buried on Saddleworth Moor near the town of Oldham. The details of the crime shocked the nation, not least because Brady's accomplice was a woman, and also because of the complete lack of remorse either showed during the subsequent trial. Brady was born Ian Stewart on 2 January 1938, the illegitimate son of a Scottish waitress. His violent personality was shaped by an unstable background. His mother neglected him and he was raised by foster parents in the Gorbals, Glasgow's toughest slum. After a spree of petty crime as a teenager the courts sent him to Manchester to live with his mother and her new husband, Patrick Brady. Brady met Myra Hindley at a company where they both worked He assumed his stepfather's name, continued his criminal activities and developed into a fully-fledged teenage alcoholic. By now he had acquired new interests, building up a library of books on Nazi Germany, sadism and sexual perversion. He first met Hindley when she worked as a secretary at the company where they were both employed. For Hindley it was love at first sight. Brady impressed her by reading Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf in the original German. As their relationship developed, they began taking obscene photographs of each other before turning their attention to kidnapping, child molestation and murder. Between July 1963 and December 1964, 16-year-old Pauline Reade, 12-year-old John Kilbride and Keith Bennett, also 12, were reported missing, all in the Manchester area. Another victim - Lesley Ann Downey, 10 - disappeared on 26 December 1964. John Kilbride was the second child to disappear Authorities were baffled by what they referred to as the ""unrelated"" cases, and were left without a single piece of solid evidence. In the meantime, Brady and Hindley were intent on a campaign to corrupt Hindley's brother-in-law, David Smith, and recruit him into their circle. A petty criminal with convictions of his own, Smith was amused when the conversation turned to murder; he questioned Brady's ability to follow it through. On 6 October 1965, Brady offered a practical demonstration with Edward Evans, 17, striking him 14 times with a hatchet before strangling him. Horrified, Smith phoned the police the next morning, directing them to Brady's address. The officers caught Brady and Hindley at home, retrieving a fresh corpse from the bedroom, along with the bloody hatchet and Brady's library of volumes on perversion and sadism. A 12-year-old neighbour recalled several trips she had made with the couple to Saddleworth Moor, and the police launched a search which uncovered the body of Leslie Ann Downey on 16 October. The body of Keith Bennett has never been found, despite appeals to Brady for help Four days later, another search of Brady's flat turned up two left luggage tickets for Manchester Central Station, leading police to a pair of hidden suitcases. Inside, they found nude photographs of the girl, along with tape recordings of her final tortured moments, pleading for her life as she was sexually abused. A series of seemingly innocent snapshots depicted portions of Saddleworth Moor, and detectives paid another visit to the desolate region on 21 October, unearthing the body of John Kilbride. Police announced they were opening their files on eight people who had disappeared over the previous four years, but no new charges had been added by the time the couple went on trial. Jurors were stunned by the Downey tape, and by Brady's bland description of the recording as ""unusual"". On 6 May 1966, both defendants were convicted of killing Edward Evans and Leslie Ann Downey. Brady was also found guilty of murdering John Kilbride, while Hindley was convicted as an accessory after the fact. Brady photographed Myra Hindley on Saddleworth Moor Brady was sentenced to concurrent life terms on each count, while Hindley received two life terms plus seven years in the Kilbride case. Nineteen years later, in November 1985, Brady was transferred from prison to a maximum-security hospital after being diagnosed a psychopath. There, in an interview with newspaper reporters, he confessed to the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett. Another year passed before searchers returned to the moors, with Hindley joining them for an abortive outing in December 1986, and Brady doing the same in 1987. The remains of Pauline Reade were uncovered on 30 June 1987, nearly a quarter of a century after her disappearance. It took pathologists a month to decide she had been sexually assaulted, her throat slashed from behind. In August 1987, Brady posted a letter to the BBC containing sketchy information on five ""new"" murders he said he had committed. Lesley Anne Downey was the first victim whose body was found Five months later the Director of Public Prosecutions announced that, in the public interest, there would be no prosecution of the murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett. Brady accepted from the start that he would never be released, unlike Hindley who, in trying to secure parole, claimed Brady had forced her into killing by abusing and torturing her into submission. But Brady reacted to her allegation by claiming: ""For 20 years I continued to ratify the cover I had given her at the trial whilst, in contrast, she systematically began to fabricate upon it to my detriment."" Myra Hindley died in 2002. Ian Brady, who had been on hunger strike, and force-fed daily, declared he would rather die quickly than rot slowly in jail. His attempts to force the authorities to let him starve himself to death failed. In March 2000 a judge described his hunger strike as part of his ""obsessive need to exercise control"". A year later Brady's book - The Gates of Janus, an analysis of serial murders - was released by an American firm, Feral House. The decision to publish caused an outcry in the British press and resulted in hate mail being sent to the publisher, Adam Parfrey. In 2012 Brady asked to be returned to prison so he could starve himself to death without the force-feeding permitted in mental institutions. Brady was arrested after the killing of Edward Evans A tribunal ruled it was appropriate that he continue to be treated in a mental hospital. In the same year Keith Bennett's mother, Winnie Johnson, who had fought for four decades to have the two killers prosecuted for her son's murder, died of cancer. Her overriding wish, to find Keith's remains and give him a Christian burial, was never fulfilled. John Kilbride's brother Danny, who had campaigned against any suggestion the two should ever be released, died a year earlier. Chris Cowley, a forensic psychologist who had spent six years in dialogues with Brady, had earlier concluded he was a sociopath with few redeeming features, showing no compassion or feeling for anyone other than himself. ""His only thought for the victims or their families is what he can get out of it,"" Dr Cowley told the Sunday Telegraph in 2011. ""He would kill again without a thought for anyone who gets in his way.""

"Former detective Margaret Oliver is played by Lesley Sharp in the drama Three Girls Child sexual abuse has never been a higher police priority. But too many rapists avoid justice, argues former detective Margaret Oliver. As her role in prosecuting the Rochdale grooming gang is marked in a new TV drama, she says police must do more to win the trust of victims I'll never forget the day I arrested Shabir. The light had begun to fade as we knocked on the door of his terraced house in Oldham one early evening back in 2011. As the safety chain rattled and the door opened, the man standing before us seemed anything but the evil predator leading a Rochdale grooming gang he was about to be exposed as. He came quietly as we arrested him and there was no sign of the defiance and abusive outbursts that would later be seen in court. He still had the look of someone who thought he was going to get away with it. And well he might, as many rapists like Shabir had been getting away with it for years. I'd worked with too many young victims of horrific rapes and seen cases go nowhere - even when there was solid evidence. I'd lost count of the times I had to look in the eyes of broken teenagers and explain that there was nothing I could do. The rapists who'd destroyed their lives were about to get off scot-free. But not this time. Actors depict victims of grooming and sexual abuse in Rochdale Getting Shabir off the street was a big breakthrough and I was convinced he was going to be the first of many. We were close to uncovering an epidemic of child sexual abuse and there were scores of men we knew had been violently raping underage girls that were in our sights. That we'd come this far owed a lot to the huge resources now being allocated to tackling grooming gangs (Operation Span was the biggest inquiry Greater Manchester Police were running). But, more importantly, it was down to the hard-won trust we'd managed to establish with the girls these vile rapists were targeting. Without that trust, it didn't matter if 10,000 officers were assigned to the case. We had to get girls to give evidence in court and I knew only too well that Greater Manchester Police did not have a particularly sophisticated approach to winning vulnerable hearts and minds when trying to prosecute rapists. Even though an awareness of child grooming was starting to sweep through the country, the police were still relying on an outdated, approach that didn't work. Joining the police as a mum of four in 1997, I'd spent years learning how to build trust as a detective and family liaison officer working on major murders. I knew that good policing could not function without it. But the hard work of building up trust wasn't especially valued by the top brass. I wasn't breaking down doors or wrestling violent drug dealers to the ground. I was going to a cemetery to help a mother pick a plot to bury her son and supporting people who were prepared to give up everything and go on to the witness protection programme to put away murderers. Maggie Oliver when she was a serving officer with Greater Manchester Police It wasn't long before I was working on rapes, domestic abuse and child protection jobs - the kind of cases that other officers working in Moss Side generally didn't want to do. And I was good at them. But if you won the trust of vulnerable girls who'd been through hell, you had to deliver - and that was heavily dependent on the appetite of people at the top to investigate these crimes. Years before I worked on a scoping exercise - a full-blown major incident team investigation which had identified considerable numbers of child abusers in south Manchester. I'd listened to girls who had been drugged so they couldn't move before they were violently raped - but the investigation was closed down. A few people were warned under the Child Abduction Act but no-one was charged. I was sickened then and still feel angry now when I think back to that case. Vulnerable people were reaching out, desperate to secure justice, and we were letting them down. I'd sworn an oath to uphold the law and ensure ""equal respect to all people"" when I joined the police. Those words seemed meaningless now. Unless we started showing respect to young girls from poorer areas, we were never going to win their trust. When Greater Manchester Police's failings in dealing with child abuse were later laid bare in a series of damning reports, one police officer gave a radio interview in which he admitted that officers referred to the girls as ""scrubbers"" and child prostitutes. That was putting it lightly. I'd heard worse from other officers. There was no real effort to win their trust and a staggering lack of empathy. Some police officers wouldn't even come into the houses where the girls lived. They'd sit in the car eating sandwiches waiting for me to come back. When we drove girls to the station and they asked to put Radio 1 on, officers would switch to Radio 4. There was no attempt to make them feel comfortable. But it's these little things that often count, and which help to build bridges. I saw myself as a person first and police officer second, but many of my colleagues could only see themselves as police officers first and foremost. Empathy had been trained out of them. The pressures of modern policing and a target-driven culture was driving humanity out of our profession. I couldn't do the job if I didn't care, but to show a human face was a sign of weakness to some. ""You've become emotionally involved,"" they'd say. We had to maintain too big a distance from everyone. As a result, there were many estates where the police were hated. The people who lived there suffered disproportionately from crime, but had given up on the police. They didn't trust us because we showed them no respect. It's this failure to win the trust of victims of appalling crimes that's at the heart of the BBC drama about the Rochdale grooming scandal. It shows a desperately real side of policing that's rarely ever dramatised and the general public know little about. In the end Shabir and 11 other men were convicted for child abuse in 2012. But this was just the tip of the iceberg. There were many, many more who got away with it and I was left with the sense that this was a box the police didn't really want to open. But they couldn't keep the lid down for long and now the secret is out. A crime that had been contained and swept under the carpet for years can no longer be ignored. For me, the end of the road was when they betrayed the trust I'd earned from a key witness and I couldn't get assurances on how vulnerable witnesses would be treated in the future. I knew men who'd violently abused girls were still walking the streets and we had the power to stop them. I couldn't do a job I loved as long as I knew rapists were getting away with it because police viewed the girls they preyed upon as unreliable witnesses. The criminals knew this and they were emboldened by it. ""No one will believe you,"" they'd laugh at sobbing girls, as they left them crushed in a heap on the floor. Maxine Peake - who plays local sexual health worker Sara Rowbotham - with Lesley Sharp Barely a week goes by these days without a headline referring to a crisis in the police. But the crisis no-one's talking about is the crisis of trust, particularly where young people are concerned. A few years ago, an all-party group of MPs found that a significant proportion of children and young people have a profound lack of trust in the police. It should have acted as a wake-up call, but I don't believe things are getting any better. When the human side of the police is shown, we always break down barriers and there are plenty of shining examples of brilliant police officers who do this week in week out. But we need more and we need leaders who set a culture in place who insist the values of empathy, honesty and integrity are always upheld in our dealings with vulnerable victims. If we can't reach out to vulnerable witnesses, all the announcements from Westminster won't mean a thing. Criminals will keep getting away with it.

"Candidates: Clockwise from top left: Lawyer Alice Fisher, New York Appeals Court Judge Michael Garcia, Republican Senator John Cornyn and Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe US President Donald Trump has said he could announce a replacement for former FBI director James Comey as early as this week, and former Senator Joe Lieberman was among his top choices. Mr Trump told reporters on Thursday his pick would be announced ""very soon"". The position requires Senate confirmation. The White House was engulfed in turmoil after Mr Trump fired Mr Comey, citing his handling of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while at the State Department. Critics have accused the White House of trying to thwart Mr Comey's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the US election and any Moscow ties to Trump associates. There were reportedly at least 14 candidates in the frame, but Trey Gowdy and John Cornyn have ruled themselves out. Earlier this week, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer added three more names to the list. Joe Lieberman:The former Connecticut senator, 75, is a Democrat-turned-Independent who endorsed John McCain in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. He was the Democratic vice-presidential candidate on the 2000 ticket with Al Gore. Mr Lieberman lost the Democratic primary in 2006 but kept his seat as an ""independent Democrat"" in the general election. He was Connecticut's attorney general before he was elected to the Senate in 1988. He retired from Congress in 2012. Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe:The former FBI deputy director became second in command in January 2016. Before joining the FBI, he interned with the Department of Justice's criminal division while in law school and later worked at a Philadelphia law firm. Mr McCabe's wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat in Virginia for a state Senate seat in 2016 and received political donations from some Clinton allies. He appeared to contradict the White House during testimony last week, telling a congressional panel the FBI investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election was ""a highly significant investigation"". He also said Mr Comey ""enjoyed broad support within the FBI and still does to this day"", casting doubt on Mr Trump's claim that the former FBI chief had lost the confidence of his staff. Frank Keating:The former Oklahoma Republican governor worked as an FBI special agent before becoming a politician. He pennedan op-ed in the Tulsa World,externallast April entitled: ""Anyone but Trump"". But his brother, Dan Keating, served as the Oklahoma state co-chair for Mr Trump's campaign. The governor toldMSNBC at the Republican National Convention,externalthat he voted for Ohio Governor John Kasich in the Republican primary election, but conceded ""Trump's our guy"" and there was no other alternative. Richard McFeely:Retired from the FBI in 2014 after more than two decades with the agency. He was a top official who oversaw about 60% of FBI operations, including the Cyber Division, which included an upwards of a thousand agents, analysts, forensic specialists and computer scientists, according toa 2013 New Yorker piece,external. Mike Rogers:The former Michigan congressman was endorsed by the FBI Agents Association, which represents thousands of current and former FBI agents. The former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is also an ex-FBI special agent and a veteran of the armed forces. The association described Mr Rogers as ""someone capable of confronting the wide array of challenges facing our help ensure that the bureau remains the world's premiere law enforcement agency"". The row explained Could Trump be guilty of obstruction of justice? Is Trump's thin skin to blame? Three takeaways from Trump NBC interview Alice Fisher:The defence lawyer was the first candidate interviewed at the justice department, according to US media reports. She ran the justice department's criminal division as an assistant attorney general under former president George W Bush and is currently a partner at a Washington law firm. Ms Fisher would be the first woman to lead the agency if selected. Judge Michael Garcia:The former federal prosecutor serves as an associate judge on New York's highest state court. As a US attorney, he oversaw an investigation into a prostitution ring that prompted the resignation of then-New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. He also led an investigation into alleged corruption in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. His inquiry also aided a criminal investigation of Fifa, the world governing body of soccer, by US and Switzerland. The Latino judge was appointed to the court by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2016. He also was appointed as assistant secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) by former President Bush in 2002. Are Democrats being hypocrites? Trump quietly mulled over FBI bombshell Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake Henry E Hudson:The US district judge in Virginia was appointed by former President Bush. He is best known for striking down a key provision of former President Barack Obama's healthcare law in 2010. The conservative judge also sentenced football star Michael Vick to nearly two years in federal prison for running a dog-fighting operation in Virginia in 2007. Frances Townsend:Ms Townsend served as a security and counterterrorism adviser to the Bush administration. She was reportedlyspotted at the White House,externalon Monday afternoon before Mr Comey was fired and met Mr Trump last year at Trump Tower in New York when she was under consideration for a top administration role.  The former federal prosecutor in New York climbed the ranks to become a senior intelligence official at the justice department and US Coast Guard in Washington. She would become the first female to lead the agency. However, she was one of dozens of national security veterans to sign an open letter calling Mr Trump a ""fundamentally dishonest"" candidate during the election campaign. Adam Lee:The head of the FBI's office in Richmond, Virginia, returned to the justice department for a second interview on Saturday, according to US media. William Evanina:He is the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Paul Abbate:He currently serves as the executive assistant director for the FBI's Criminal, Cyber, Response and Services Branch. He previously oversaw FBI field offices in Washington and Detroit and has been at the agency for more than 20 years. Michael Anderson:The FBI special agent heads the agency's Chicago office. Judge Michael Luttig:He is a former justice department lawyer who was appointed by President George HW Bush. He left the bench in 2006 to join Boeing, where he serves as general counsel. He was considered for two US Supreme Court vacancies, which were instead given to Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito. Larry Thompson:He served as a deputy attorney general under the Bush administration from 2001 to 2003. He also was a federal prosecutor in Georgia and has held several senior roles at PepsiCo. Ray Kelly:The former police commissioner led the New York Police Department (NYPD) for more than a decade. He created the first counterterrorism bureau in any police department in the wake of the 9/11 attacks and oversaw a marked drop in New York's crime. But under his leadership, the NYPD was scrutinised for its use of aggressive force and stop-and-frisk programme, which critics say disproportionately affected non-white residents. John Suthers:The mayor of Colorado Springs was formerly the state's attorney general from 2005 to 2015. As a prosecutor he was one of several to sue the Obama administration during the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and he signed on to a legal challenge to defend the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which barred gay marriage.

"Ian Poulter believes he has put behind him the toughest spell of his career, which he admits has been ""miserable"". The 41-year-old Englishman climbed more than 100 places in the world rankings by finishing tied for second with Louis Oosthuizen, three shots behind Kim Si-woo, at last week'sPlayers Championship. Though Poulter was not able to end a winless run that stretches back to 2012, he showed his famed competitive fire still burns bright despite a string of setbacks. A foot injurycost him the biggest four months of the 2016 season and he was unable to retain his place in the European Ryder Cup team. His golf clothing business collapsed and he was forced to play under a medical exemption when he finally returned to the PGA Tour. ""It's been the toughest stretch of my career,"" Poulter told BBC Sport. Poulter accepts European Tour's Wentworth invitation Kim Si-woo wins Players Championship How Kim held off Poulter to win Players title It was further complicated by the Tour's failure to properly calculate whether he had done enough to keep his card. Poulter fell just short of the total earnings he thought he would need to extend his playing privileges when he missed the cut in San Antonio last month. Fellow pro Brian Gay was in a similar position, and it took his forensic analysis of the minutiae of the PGA Tour's rules to reveal an error had been made. Unexpectedly, Poulterwas reinstatedand that is how he gained his place in the Players Championship field. ""It's been miserable,"" he said. ""There's no other way to explain it. ""When you are taking a break for several months, when your world ranking plummets, when you miss Ryder Cups, when you find yourself in a position chasing down what you think is your Tour card. ""And some other nonsense was going on which we're still working through. It's been miserable."" Poulter did not elaborate on the ""other nonsense"" but he has contended with the closure of online sales for his IJP Design company. He announced in March that he had ""been unable to justify its continuation after many years of investing in the business and a number of attempts to reshape it against an ever increasingly competitive landscape"". At least, though, he has been able to put his golf game back together. Poulter's bogey-free 71 on Saturday, compiled in fierce winds, was a round of the highest quality. ""It's been really hard and we are slowly getting there,"" he said. ""This obviously is a big week for me to cement some stuff moving forward where I can enjoy this summer. ""I can now plan a very long schedule and work out exactly what I'm doing and I'll have a nice summer with the kids in the UK."" There was criticism for Poulter though - and respected Golf Channel pundit Brandel Chamblee blamed the Englishman for a conservative approach over the closing holes. ""He clearly did not play to win and he didn't,"" Chamblee said. Poulter fired back on Twitter in typically pugnacious manner. He wrote: ""Sorry to disappoint, I can only dream of being as good as Brandel"" - adding it was ""clearly very easy"" for those sitting watching. Chamblee responded by blocking the Englishman's Twitter account. Two-times Players champion Steve Elkington was also critical of Poulter's failure to go for the green with his second shot at the par-five 16th. But neither critic seemed to take due account of the fine margins and difficulty of that closing stretch. ""I was trying to press and it is hard,"" Poulter told me. ""With the wind off the left-hand side on 16 it is difficult to hit that tee shot round the corner and I made a mistake missing the fairway slightly right. ""Seventeen was not a good wind for that pin location, so you suck it up and try to hit a tee shot to about 20ft and try to make two down that ridge if you can."" Poulter recorded pars at both holes and, while he failed to exert pressure that might have forced a Kim error, he made sure he did not play himself out of the championship. No-one should blame the former Ryder Cup hero for playing the percentages. Ultimately it took a miraculous escape from the trees after Poulter shanked his second shot to the final hole to ensure a share of the runner-up spoils. The result moves him up to 80th in the world. It frees up his schedule and puts on hold the humiliating process of writing begging letters for sponsor invitations to PGA Tour events. With his American card secure, it also means Poulter can plan a schedule to include return visits to Europe - perhaps as soon as next week's BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. Having seen him play with such character at Sawgrass, fans would need no second invitation to rally behind one of the most popular British players of recent times.
