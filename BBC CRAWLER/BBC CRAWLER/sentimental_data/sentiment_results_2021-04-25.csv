"This video can not be played Extra costs of refurbishing Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat will be met by the prime minister, Liz Truss says Boris Johnson covered the renovation costs for his Downing Street flat ""from his own pocket"", one of his ministers has said. Trade Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC the work is being ""fully declared"". But she did not answer repeated questions on whether a Tory party donor initially provided the money to him. It comes after the PM's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, claimed Mr Johnson had a ""possibly illegal"" plan for donors to pay the refurbishment. Labour said questions remained, as details over how the work was paid for had yet to be made public. The government is supposed to publish the list of minister's interests twice a year, but the last one showing money donated to them was released in July 2020. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson should come in front of MPs on Monday to answer questions and publish the list ""as the public deserves [to see] it"". 'PM's flat refurbishment: What is the row about? Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Explain PM flat funding to MPs, says Labour Mr Johnson lives in the flat above 11 Downing Street with his fiancee Carrie Symonds - a move echoing a number of his predecessors as it is bigger than the accommodation above No 10. In March,Downing Street dismissed as ""speculation""suggestions that refurbishments on the flat last year would be paid for by Tory donors through a charity set up for this purpose, amid reports that the costs had spiralled out of control. But on Friday, Mr Cummingslaunched a blistering attack on his former boss via his blog,external, claiming he advised the PM the renovation plans were ""unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended"". A No 10 spokesperson said: ""At all times, the government and ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law."" And Cabinet Office Minister Lord True told the House of Lords on Friday that ""any costs of wider refurbishment in this year have been met by the prime minister personally"". Donations and loans to political parties of more than Â£7,500 must be reported to the Electoral Commission, which said it was having ""discussions with the Conservative Party"", but had not yet launched an investigation. The controversy also comes amid an ongoing row over lobbying in Westminster, after revelationsformer prime minister David Cameron had texted ministersabout the financial firm he was working for and businessman Sir James Dyson haddirectly contacted Mr Johnson over tax issueswhen working on ventilators during the pandemic. By Damian Grammaticas, BBC political correspondent The reason this issue is so difficult for Boris Johnson is it comes down to something simple - money. How a job was paid for is a far more straightforward issue for people to form an opinion about than other recent questions about government conduct. That swirl of revelation and allegation has dealt with the more intangible currency of politics, access, influence and favours. This is about cash. Tens of thousands potentially. The cost of a home makeover, and the as-yet-unanswered question, did Mr Johnson get help? And if he did, what about the implications for how that benefit should be declared - whether for electoral or tax reasons. Simple really. Also talking to Marr, Ms Truss defended Mr Johnson, saying: ""My understanding is the costs have been covered by the prime minister and everything has been fully declared by the rules."" But asked five times whether the money was put up by a party donor first, she would not answer. Instead, she told the programme: ""What I know is the prime minister has personally met the costs of the flat refurbishment and that is what people in Britain want to know and that is what has happened."" When asked why the list of minister's interests had yet to be published, Ms Truss replied: ""I'm sure it will be published in line with the rules."" And questioned about rumours of leaks out of No 10 - also addressed by Mr Cummings in his blog - the minister urged Mr Johnson to ""carry on"" doing ""an excellent job"" rather than ""listening to these noises off"". She added: ""I think this a complete load of Westminster tittle tattle that people simply don't care about."" But Ms Rayner said there was a ""real stench"" around the government and the ""serious allegations"" it faces. This video can not be played Labour's Angela Rayner: ""Tell us about where you're getting this money from, Boris, to do up your flat"" Ms Rayner told Marr: ""The issues that we have seen with ministers over the last couple of months has really undermined the institution of government and there are serious questions now the Conservatives need to answer. ""These are serious allegations and we think the prime minister should come to the House of Commons on Monday and should declare the ministers register of interests, which is eight months in delay. ""The problem is the government is hiding."" Sleaze accusers out of their minds, says PM Plan to fund Downing Street makeover 'speculation' The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, backed the call for the prime minister to answer questions in Parliament. He said: ""The longer Boris Johnson stays in hiding and dodges accountability, the more overpowering the stench of sleaze surrounding him and his government becomes. ""Rather than hiding behind Tory ministers, Boris Johnson must now come before Parliament and answer these very serious questions for himself.""

"This video can not be played Pubs and restaurants reopen for the first time in four months Shops, gyms, swimming pools, pubs, restaurants and cafes in Scotland have reopened after a four month-long winter lockdown. Early morning queues formed at fashion retailers in Glasgow and Edinburgh as shoppers waited for doors opening. Travel restrictions have also been eased, allowing trips to other parts of the UK for non-essential reasons. Ministers say restrictions can be eased as the most vulnerable people have been offered their first vaccine dose. Scotland has been in level four lockdown since 26 December, with all non-essential shops, leisure facilities, and hospitality venues closed. New draft hospitality Covid guidance a 'bombshell' How many people are not taking the Covid vaccine? Driving lessons and tests can resume, while nail salons, museums and holiday accommodation can also reopen. As the mainland moves into level three restrictions many businesses will still be subject to strict rules on capacity and social distancing. Unlike England, pubs and restaurants will be able open indoors until 20:00 - but they will only be able to serve alcohol to customers seated outside. Queues formed on Glasgow's Argyle Street early on Monday ahead of the shops reopening A number of shops across Scotland opened early to mark the easing of restrictions with queues outside many larger retailers. Braehead Shopping Centre near Glasgow opened at 07:00, with some customers outside for an hour beforehand. Katie Moody, of the city's Princes Square shopping centre, said: ""People do seem a bit more comfortable about coming out this time. ""Glaswegians love to shop, we have seen queues in the city and I think there are just some things you want to experience in person and we are giving them that back."" In Inverness, restaurateur Norman MacDonald MBE opened his Cafe 1 restaurant for the first time since Christmas Eve. He said: ""It is great we are open, and the team is back in and champing at the bit to look after their customers."" Lush on Edinburgh's Princes Street had a small queue waiting. Manager Alan Brown said: ""We're just really excited to be speaking to people again after such a long time."" Liz Cameron from the Scottish Chamber of Commerce said the excitement was ""fantastic"" for businesses. She added: ""We must remember it's been a long time, and we have a lot of costs we have to be able to recoup and it will not happen in a day or a week. ""It's the start of our journey but let's remember this is about trying to save as many jobs as possible. "" Friends enjoyed the chance to meet up over a pint outside the Three Sisters in Edinburgh Small groups of people, some with blankets over their laps, gathered for post-work drinks on Edinburgh's George Street Early pub customers enjoy an outside drink in Glasgow city centre Public Health expert Prof Devi Sridhar said infection numbers were low enough to support the opening up of a large part of society. She told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland: ""The end is in sight within weeks. We can see the full adult population getting vaccines by the summer."" She said Covid testing would also make a difference. ""I would really encourage people to get tested both the PCR and at home lateral flow testing,"" she added. ""The safest way to keep bars and pubs and indoor hospitality open is to make sure that nobody inside is infectious."" Up to six people from two households can socialise indoors in a public place such as a cafÃ© or restaurant Unrestricted travel within Scotland, England and Wales (subject to other local restrictions in place) All shops and close contact services (like nail salons and tattoo parlours) can open Hospitality venues like cafes, pubs and restaurants can open until 20:00 indoors (no alcohol) They can serve alcohol outdoors according to local licensing laws Non-essential childcare permitted Non-essential in-house work (like painter and decorators) permitted Tourist accommodation to reopen (self-catering accommodation to be restricted in line with rules on indoor gathering) Driving lessons and tests can take place Funerals and weddings including wakes and receptions can take place with up to 50 people (alcohol permitted) Gyms and swimming pools can reopen for individual exercise Indoor attractions and public buildings such as galleries, museums and libraries can open Takeaway food can be collected indoors Rapid testing kits are being madeavailable to everyone in the country.The lateral flow tests can be picked up without an appointment from walk-in or drive through test sites from 15:30 every day. And the Scottish government is launching a new app - Check In Scotland - making it easier for businesses to collect contact tracing details. Among those reopening their business is Barry Cowan from The Walled Garden Touring Park, near Maybole in Ayrshire. He had to open his gates four hours earlier than usual to meet demand. He said the caravan park would be operating at half capacity so holiday-makers have more space.  But with restrictions on foreign travel still in place, Mr Cowan is booked into August and September. ""We can't wait, we're really, really excited and we're sure we're going to have a good season,"" he said. Kurt McGonigle is excited about reopening his tattoo studio Hepcat Tattoos in Glasgow is one of the ""close contact businesses"" that will be open for the first time in four months. Pent-up demand means most of Kurt McGonigle's tattooists are booked up for months to come. ""We were closed for four months so most of our income stopped, so we're all really excited to be going back to work and get back to normal,"" Mr McGonigle said. Steven Annand wants to see people able to enjoy alcohol inside pubs and restaurants Steve Annand, of drinks wholesaler Inverarity Morton, said the lifting of lockdown was ""a bit of light at the end of the tunnel - but there's still a good way to travel before we're back to normal levels"". Permitting bars and restaurants to serve drinks indoors will be the key to rebuilding after a ""really difficult"" few months. ""I think we need to get back to enjoying alcohol inside, in an indoor environment, in bars and restaurants,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Scottish election 2021: Sturgeon faces questions over 'hard border' Nicola Sturgeon says she wants to keep trade flowing across an England-Scotland border if an independent Scotland re-joined the European Union. Speaking on theBBC's Andrew Marr programme, the SNP leader accepted there would have to be a border if an independent Scotland was in the EU. But she said Scotland would try to negotiate arrangements to ""keep trade flowing freely"". Opponents say a hard border with England would be ""dreadful for trade"". The SNP want to hold a referendum on Scottish independence if they win a majority in the Scottish Parliament elections on 6 May. SIGN UP FOR SCOTLAND ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Ms Sturgeon was questioned on the practical details of an independent Scotland re-joining the EU. ""Of course we want to keep trade flowing across the England-Scotland border, that would be in the interests of Scotland as well and we would work to make sure that happened,"" she said. ""We will keep trade flowing freely, we will comply with all of the requirements of EU membership."" EU regulations set out that 30% of poultry, eggs, milk and fish, as well as 100% of live animals, need to be inspected when entering the single market. Asked how she would police such a border, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I am not denying what the EU regulations say. I am not denying because of the absurdity of Brexit that all sorts of issues are raised for Scotland completely against our democratic will. ""We would work as a country to make sure that for our businesses, there is no difficulties in terms of their day to day experiences in trading."" Ms Sturgeon was pressed further on whether she had modelled the impact of Scottish independence on people's incomes. She responded: ""If I was do to all of that modelling now we'd have to redo it when we were asking people to make that choice. I believe it's right to only ask people to make a choice of that magnitude on the basis of quality up to date information."" Scottish election 2021: Who should I vote for?

""This week has not only exposed the SNP as desperately confused over the economics of independence but revealed that they are contemplating a hard border with England,"" she added. ""This would not only be dreadful for trade but throw up barriers between friends and families."" Willie Rennie was on the campaign trail at a dry ski slope On the election campaign trail, the Liberal Democrats have been highlighting mental health support for police officers.

What powers do they have?MSPs pass laws on aspects of life in Scotland such as health, education and transport - and have some powers over tax and welfare benefits. Scottish Labour it was ""reckless beyond imagining"" for the SNP to call for a referendum during the recovery from the pandemic, while economists warned Scotland was headed for a jobs crisis. Commenting on Ms Sturgeon's Andrew Marr interview, the party's Scotland spokesman Ian Murray said: ""Hearing the casual way with which Nicola Sturgeon dismisses those independent experts that she is so fond of quoting when they agree with her and her failure to answer any of the tough questions on separation - from effects on income to the border - is playing fast and loose with people's futures. ""Scotland deserves better than this. Scottish Labour is opposed to independence and a second referendum."" On the campaign trail in Fife, party leader Anas Sarwar said only Labour could hold the SNP to account and ensure that the next parliament was focused on the ""national recovery"". Anas Sarwar was on the campaign trail in Dunfermline Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Ms Sturgeon's plans for a ""post-referendum border"" with England would be a ""hammer-blow"" for Scottish businesses. ""By Nicola Sturgeon's own admission, the SNP are clueless about the economic impact of independence. They've done no analysis on how many jobs it would put at risk or how much damage would be done to Scotland's economy,"" he said. ""She floundered and didn't have a single convincing answer to dispel the overwhelming evidence that separating Scotland from the rest of the UK would be devastating for jobs and businesses.""

"The former chief executive of the Post Office has quit her roles on the boards of Morrisons and Dunelm following the IT scandal which led to the wrongful convictions of former postmasters. Morrisons announced Paula Vennells would leave after serving as a non-executive director since 2016. She is relinquishing her non-executive position at home furnishing retailer Dunelm with immediate effect. She is also stopping her duties as an ordained Church of England minister. Ms Vennells said: ""It is obvious that my involvement with the Post Office has become a distraction from the good work undertaken by the boards I serve. ""I have therefore stepped down with immediate effect from all of my board positions."" Ms Vennells was chief executive of the Post Office between 2012 and 2019. On Friday, 39 former Post Office workers saw their criminal convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? The convictions had been based on the flawed software system Horizon, which showed shortfalls in the sub-postmasters' accounts where they did not exist. The IT system was installed in 1999 under former chief executive John Roberts. Other appeals are expected to follow in what is the most widespread miscarriage of justice in the UK's history. The government has launched an inquiryinto the prosecution of the former Post Office workers. Ms Vennells said: ""I am truly sorry for the suffering caused to the 39 sub-postmasters as a result of their convictions which were overturned last week."" This video can not be played ""How do you die knowing that you've done nothing wrong?"" Ms Vennells said she now intended ""to focus fully on working with the ongoing government inquiry to ensure the affected sub-postmasters and wider public get the answers they deserve"". Dunelm's chairman Andy Harrison said: ""We respect Paula's decision to step down from the board and I would like to thank her for the positive contribution she has made to the business since her appointment in September 2019."" The chairman of Morrisons, Andrew Higginson, said: ""Paula has been an insightful, effective and hardworking non-executive director, and, on behalf of the Board, I want to thank her for her significant contribution over the last five years."" More than 700 people were wrongly convicted of offences of theft, fraud and false accounting, in prosecutions between 2000 and 2014, and some of them were imprisoned. Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared 'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won' Questions had been raised about the behaviour of Post Office directors during this time, and Ms Vennells, 62, faced calls to have her bonuses clawed back and be stripped of her CBE title, which had been given for ""services to the Post Office and to charity"". Jo Hamilton, one of the 39 former Post Office workers whose convictions were quashed on Friday, said Ms Vennells' role at Morrisons and Dunelm was ""untenable and I don't think she could stay"". Jo Hamilton saw her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal last week She added that she would now consider shopping at the retailers after boycotting both when Ms Vennells joined their boards. Even during the pandemic when many supermarket online delivery slots were booked up, Ms Hamilton said ""I'd rather starve to death"" than shop at Morrisons. In a statement issued on Sunday evening, Ms Vennells, an associate Anglican minister in Bromham, Oakley and Stagsden, Bedfordshire,said she would be stepping back from her ""regular parochial duties"",external. Ms Vennells said: ""It is obvious that my involvement with the Post Office has become a distraction from the good work undertaken in the Diocese of St Albans and in the parishes I serve. ""I have therefore stepped back with immediate effect from regular parish ministry."" For the sub-postmasters and postmistresses who faced prison, criminal convictions and financial ruin after being wrongly pursued by the Post Office, one of the hardest elements has been confronting a faceless institution. But the name that has been repeated to me again and again by victims I've spoken to is that of Paula Vennells. Although the computer problems began before her tenure as chief executive, under her leadership, the glitches within the system became widely reported on. But she insisted the system was ""robust"", defending the technology and her organisation's actions to a committee of MPs. As chief executive, she chose to fight lengthy and expensive legal battles against sub-postmasters seeking redress. When more than 500 sub-postmasters won a civil court case against the Post Office in December 2020, the judge said that under her leadership the actions of the Post Office had been ""both cruel and incompetent"". She received a CBE for ""services to the Post Office"" in 2019. Since Ms Vennells stepped down as boss, there has been a dramatic shift in tone from the Post Office. It did not contest the vast majority of individuals who managed to overturn their convictions in the Court of Appeal last week. It has issued an apology and is already mentioning compensation. The Bishop of St Albans, the Right Reverend Dr Alan Smith, said that his father had been a sub-postmaster, adding: "" I express my distress at the miscarriage of justice that so many sub-postmasters have suffered."" He said: ""I am aware that there are still legal processes and inquiries to take place during which it is right that Ms Vennells stands back from public ministry."" Following the legal decision on Friday, Ms Vennells said she was ""deeply saddened"" by the sub-postmasters' accounts. She said she would cooperate with the government inquiry ""as I did with last year's select committee inquiry"". Tom Hedges (centre) was one 39 former postmasters celebrating as their convictions were quashed on Friday The Horizon IT system, installed by the Post Office in branches across the UK, was flawed from the start. At the Court of Appeal on Friday, Lord Justice Holroyde said the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"". But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"" and ""effectively steamrolled over any sub-postmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"". Those affected have long called for a judge-led, full, public inquiry, rather than the government's own inquiry which is set to report in the summer. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, is reviewing another 22 cases. There were more than 700 prosecutions based on Horizon evidence. The commission and the Post Office are asking anyone else who believes their conviction to be unsafe to come forward. Why were hundreds of Post Office workers wrongly prosecuted?

"A number of emergency contracts were awarded in the height of the pandemic to cover PPE and other items Labour is calling for ministers to publish all contacts and links they have with firms awarded government contracts during the Covid crisis. In March 2020, emergency measures let the government speed up buying things like PPE and ventilators by directly awarding contracts rather than tenders. But since then, ministers have faced accusations of offering a ""VIP fast-track"" to the contracts for friends. The government said ""due diligence is carried out on every contract"". The call comes as a lobbying row continues to surround Westminster, following revelations thatformer prime minister David Cameron texted ministerson behalf of a firm he worked for - Greensill Capital - during the crisis. Last week, the BBC also revealed thatbusinessman Sir James Dyson directly texted Boris Johnsonabout tax issues during the pandemic, which the PM then said he would ""fix"".

A brief guide In the months following coronavirus hitting the UK in 2020, the government awarded thousands of contracts to private companies, spending billions of pounds of public money in the process. They covered everything from masks, gowns and gloves, to services such as researching public opinion about the government's Covid measures. But rather than going through the usual competitive tendering process for such contracts - which can take months or even years - the government was allowed to go directly to a preferred supplier without any competition, speeding up the process. Since then, questions have arisen over the decisions made by government, with accusations from Labour of ""cronyism"" andinvestigations by the BBC and others showing links between some of the firms and Whitehall. A case is also going through the High Court- brought forward by the Good Law Project - arguing that several of these deals were handled as part of a so-called VIP lane, reserved for leads endorsed by government officials or politicians. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""We have been dealing with an unprecedented global pandemic and our approach throughout has been to act quickly to save lives, and we make no apology for that."" While the government had to award contracts at speed, ""due diligence is carried out on every contract"" and ""ministers have no role in awarding them"", the spokesman said. Number 10 said it is committed to transparency in procurement and notices of contracts awarded are published online. Labour is now calling for all ministers to publish any communications they had with their business contacts or links who were awarded contracts over the pandemic under the emergency rules - as well as details of any firms who were part of the ""VIP fast track"". Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Rachel Reeves, has written to her government counterpart, Michael Gove, saying there is ""a growing impression that there is one set of rules for ministers and their close friends, and another for the rest of the British public"". As well as details on ministers and their contacts, she asked Mr Gove when the prime minister would share his own messages with Mr Dyson and other business leaders -which he pledged to do last week- and when a new independent advisor for ministerial standards would be appointed,following the resignation of Sir Alex Allan in November 2020. In a statement, Ms Reeves added that there was an ""increasing spread of Tory sleaze"" creating ""increasingly serious questions for government"". Why have Covid contracts been challenged?

"This video can not be played 'A person cannot even die peacefully in Delhi' As hospitals in Delhi and many other cities run out of beds, people have been forced to find ways to get treatment for sick patients at home. Many have turned to the black market, where prices of essential medicines, oxygen cylinders and concentrators have skyrocketed and questionable drugs are now proliferating. On Monday, India recorded a new global high for daily coronavirus cases for a fifth straight day at 352, 991. Anshu Priya could not get a hospital bed in Delhi or its suburb of Noida for her father-in-law and as his condition continued to deteriorate. She spent most of Sunday looking for an oxygen cylinder but her search was futile. So she finally turned to the black market. She paid a hefty amount - 50,000 rupees ($670; Â£480) - to procure a cylinder that normally costs 6,000 rupees. With her mother-in-law also struggling to breathe, Anshu knew she may not be able to find or afford another cylinder on the black market. This is a familiar story not just in Delhi but also in Noida, Lucknow, Allahabad, Indore and so many other cities where families are desperately cobbling together makeshift arrangements at home. But most of India's population cannot afford to do this. There are already several reports of people dying at the doorsteps of hospitals because they couldn't afford to buy essential drugs and oxygen on the black market. The BBC called several oxygen cylinder suppliers and most of them asked for at least 10 times more than the normal price. The situation is particularly dire in Delhi where there are no ICU beds left. Families of those who can afford it are hiring nurses and consulting doctors remotely to keep their loved ones breathing. Countries send urgent aid to Covid-stricken India Patients die without oxygen amid Delhi Covid surge Why India is running out of oxygen again How have you been affected by coronavirus in India? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. But the struggles are huge from getting blood tests done to getting a CT scan or x-ray. Labs are overrun and it's taking up to three days for test results to come back. This is making it harder for treating doctors to assess the progression of the disease. CT scans are also used by doctors to asses the condition of the patient but it's taking days to get an appointment. Doctors say that these delays are putting many patients at risk.  RT-PCR tests are also taking days. I know several sick patients who found a bed but couldn't get admitted as they didn't have a positive Covid report. Anuj Tiwari hired a nurse to assist in the treatment of his brother at home after he was refused admission in many hospitals. Some said they didn't have any free beds and others said they were not taking new patients due to continuing uncertainty over the supply of oxygen. A number of patients have died in Delhidue to a lack of oxygen supply. The city's hospitals are desperate and some have been issuing daily warnings, saying they are left with just a few hours of oxygen. Then the government swings into action and tankers are sent, which is often enough to run the hospital for a day. A doctor in Delhi said that was how hospitals were working and ""there are real fears now that a big tragedy may happen"". Given the scenario at hospitals, Mr Tiwari paid a hefty amount to procure a concentrator  - which can extract oxygen from the air - keep his brother breathing. The doctor also asked him to arrange the anti-viral drug remdesivir, which has been given emergency-use approval in India and is being prescribed widely by doctors. The benefits of the drug - which was originally developed to treat Ebola - are still being debated across the world. Mr Tiwari couldn't find the drug in any medicine shop and eventually turned to the black market. His brother's condition continues to be critical and the treating doctor says he may soon need a hospital where remdesvir could be administered. Indians are waiting for hours to cremate the deceased as cases surge ""There are no beds. What will I do? I can't even take him anywhere else as I have already spent so much money and don't have much left,"" he said. He added that ""the desperate battle to save Covid patients has shifted from hospitals to home"", and even that is proving to be a daunting task as ""we don't have easy access to oxygen"". Remdesivir is in such short supply that families of the patients who are being treated at home are rushing to procure it. They want to have the drug in case the patient is required to go to hospital and may need the drug. The BBC spoke to several dealers on the black market who said the supply was tight and that was why they were charging such high prices. The government has allowed seven firms to manufacture remdesvir in India and they have been told to ramp up production. But several promises of adequate supply from the government have failed to show any result on the ground. Epidemiologist Dr Lalit Kant says the decision to ramp up production was taken too late and the government should have been prepared for the second wave. ""But somehow the drug is available in the black market, so there is some leakage in the supply system which the regulators haven't been able to plug,"" he says. ""We learnt nothing from the first wave."" Another drug that is in huge demand is tocilizumab. It is normally used to treat arthritis but studies have shown thatit can reduce the chances of a very sick patient needing to go on a ventilator. Doctors are prescribing the drug mostly to patients who are severely sick. But it has disappeared from the market. Cipla, the Indian company that imports and sells the drug, has been struggling to meet the rising demand. It usually costs around 32,480 rupees for a vial of 400mg. But Kamal Kumar paid 250,000 rupees to buy one dose for his father. He said the price was ""mind boggling"" but he had no other option but to pay. Public health expert Anant Bhan says the government should have procured the drug in huge quantities as not many can afford to buy it in the black market. ""This shows that there was no planning. The government failed to anticipate the wave and plan for it,"" he says. ""People have been left to their own fate."" Fake remdesivir has also appeared in the black market. When the BBC questioned a dealer that the drug he was offering seemed fake as the firm manufacturing it wasn't on the list of the companies licensed to produce it in India, he replied that it was ""100% original"". The packaging was also full of spelling errors. But he shrugged and asked me to get it tested in any laboratory. The firm also has no presence on the internet. But such is the desperation that people are willing to buy even questionable drugs. And some have been cheated as well. People are constantly sharing phone numbers of suppliers who can provide anything from oxygen to medicines. But not all of these numbers are verified. An IT worker, who did not want to be named, said that he desperately needed to buy an oxygen cylinder and remdesivir, and he got a lead from Twitter. When he contacted the person, he was told to deposit 10,000 rupees as advance payment. ""The moment I sent the money, the person blocked my number,"" he said. Desperation is driving people to trust anything in the hour of need and that seems to be fuelling the black market. Several state governments have promised to crack down on black marketing of remdesivir and some arrests have also been made. But the black market seems unfazed. Mr Tiwari says people like him don't have any choice but to pay more. ""It seems you can't get treated in hospitals, and now you can't save your loved ones even at home.""

"This video can not be played Extra costs of refurbishing Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat will be met by the prime minister, Liz Truss says Boris Johnson covered the renovation costs for his Downing Street flat ""from his own pocket"", one of his ministers has said. Trade Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC the work is being ""fully declared"". But she did not answer repeated questions on whether a Tory party donor initially provided the money to him. It comes after the PM's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, claimed Mr Johnson had a ""possibly illegal"" plan for donors to pay the refurbishment. Labour said questions remained, as details over how the work was paid for had yet to be made public. The government is supposed to publish the list of minister's interests twice a year, but the last one showing money donated to them was released in July 2020. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson should come in front of MPs on Monday to answer questions and publish the list ""as the public deserves [to see] it"". 'PM's flat refurbishment: What is the row about? Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Explain PM flat funding to MPs, says Labour Mr Johnson lives in the flat above 11 Downing Street with his fiancee Carrie Symonds - a move echoing a number of his predecessors as it is bigger than the accommodation above No 10. In March,Downing Street dismissed as ""speculation""suggestions that refurbishments on the flat last year would be paid for by Tory donors through a charity set up for this purpose, amid reports that the costs had spiralled out of control. But on Friday, Mr Cummingslaunched a blistering attack on his former boss via his blog,external, claiming he advised the PM the renovation plans were ""unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended"". A No 10 spokesperson said: ""At all times, the government and ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law."" And Cabinet Office Minister Lord True told the House of Lords on Friday that ""any costs of wider refurbishment in this year have been met by the prime minister personally"". Donations and loans to political parties of more than Â£7,500 must be reported to the Electoral Commission, which said it was having ""discussions with the Conservative Party"", but had not yet launched an investigation. The controversy also comes amid an ongoing row over lobbying in Westminster, after revelationsformer prime minister David Cameron had texted ministersabout the financial firm he was working for and businessman Sir James Dyson haddirectly contacted Mr Johnson over tax issueswhen working on ventilators during the pandemic. By Damian Grammaticas, BBC political correspondent The reason this issue is so difficult for Boris Johnson is it comes down to something simple - money. How a job was paid for is a far more straightforward issue for people to form an opinion about than other recent questions about government conduct. That swirl of revelation and allegation has dealt with the more intangible currency of politics, access, influence and favours. This is about cash. Tens of thousands potentially. The cost of a home makeover, and the as-yet-unanswered question, did Mr Johnson get help? And if he did, what about the implications for how that benefit should be declared - whether for electoral or tax reasons. Simple really. Also talking to Marr, Ms Truss defended Mr Johnson, saying: ""My understanding is the costs have been covered by the prime minister and everything has been fully declared by the rules."" But asked five times whether the money was put up by a party donor first, she would not answer. Instead, she told the programme: ""What I know is the prime minister has personally met the costs of the flat refurbishment and that is what people in Britain want to know and that is what has happened."" When asked why the list of minister's interests had yet to be published, Ms Truss replied: ""I'm sure it will be published in line with the rules."" And questioned about rumours of leaks out of No 10 - also addressed by Mr Cummings in his blog - the minister urged Mr Johnson to ""carry on"" doing ""an excellent job"" rather than ""listening to these noises off"". She added: ""I think this a complete load of Westminster tittle tattle that people simply don't care about."" But Ms Rayner said there was a ""real stench"" around the government and the ""serious allegations"" it faces. This video can not be played Labour's Angela Rayner: ""Tell us about where you're getting this money from, Boris, to do up your flat"" Ms Rayner told Marr: ""The issues that we have seen with ministers over the last couple of months has really undermined the institution of government and there are serious questions now the Conservatives need to answer. ""These are serious allegations and we think the prime minister should come to the House of Commons on Monday and should declare the ministers register of interests, which is eight months in delay. ""The problem is the government is hiding."" Sleaze accusers out of their minds, says PM Plan to fund Downing Street makeover 'speculation' The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, backed the call for the prime minister to answer questions in Parliament. He said: ""The longer Boris Johnson stays in hiding and dodges accountability, the more overpowering the stench of sleaze surrounding him and his government becomes. ""Rather than hiding behind Tory ministers, Boris Johnson must now come before Parliament and answer these very serious questions for himself.""

"The former chief executive of the Post Office has quit her roles on the boards of Morrisons and Dunelm following the IT scandal which led to the wrongful convictions of former postmasters. Morrisons announced Paula Vennells would leave after serving as a non-executive director since 2016. She is relinquishing her non-executive position at home furnishing retailer Dunelm with immediate effect. She is also stopping her duties as an ordained Church of England minister. Ms Vennells said: ""It is obvious that my involvement with the Post Office has become a distraction from the good work undertaken by the boards I serve. ""I have therefore stepped down with immediate effect from all of my board positions."" Ms Vennells was chief executive of the Post Office between 2012 and 2019. On Friday, 39 former Post Office workers saw their criminal convictions overturned by the Court of Appeal. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? The convictions had been based on the flawed software system Horizon, which showed shortfalls in the sub-postmasters' accounts where they did not exist. The IT system was installed in 1999 under former chief executive John Roberts. Other appeals are expected to follow in what is the most widespread miscarriage of justice in the UK's history. The government has launched an inquiryinto the prosecution of the former Post Office workers. Ms Vennells said: ""I am truly sorry for the suffering caused to the 39 sub-postmasters as a result of their convictions which were overturned last week."" This video can not be played ""How do you die knowing that you've done nothing wrong?"" Ms Vennells said she now intended ""to focus fully on working with the ongoing government inquiry to ensure the affected sub-postmasters and wider public get the answers they deserve"". Dunelm's chairman Andy Harrison said: ""We respect Paula's decision to step down from the board and I would like to thank her for the positive contribution she has made to the business since her appointment in September 2019."" The chairman of Morrisons, Andrew Higginson, said: ""Paula has been an insightful, effective and hardworking non-executive director, and, on behalf of the Board, I want to thank her for her significant contribution over the last five years."" More than 700 people were wrongly convicted of offences of theft, fraud and false accounting, in prosecutions between 2000 and 2014, and some of them were imprisoned. Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared 'Post Office took us to hell and back but we won' Questions had been raised about the behaviour of Post Office directors during this time, and Ms Vennells, 62, faced calls to have her bonuses clawed back and be stripped of her CBE title, which had been given for ""services to the Post Office and to charity"". Jo Hamilton, one of the 39 former Post Office workers whose convictions were quashed on Friday, said Ms Vennells' role at Morrisons and Dunelm was ""untenable and I don't think she could stay"". Jo Hamilton saw her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal last week She added that she would now consider shopping at the retailers after boycotting both when Ms Vennells joined their boards. Even during the pandemic when many supermarket online delivery slots were booked up, Ms Hamilton said ""I'd rather starve to death"" than shop at Morrisons. In a statement issued on Sunday evening, Ms Vennells, an associate Anglican minister in Bromham, Oakley and Stagsden, Bedfordshire,said she would be stepping back from her ""regular parochial duties"",external. Ms Vennells said: ""It is obvious that my involvement with the Post Office has become a distraction from the good work undertaken in the Diocese of St Albans and in the parishes I serve. ""I have therefore stepped back with immediate effect from regular parish ministry."" For the sub-postmasters and postmistresses who faced prison, criminal convictions and financial ruin after being wrongly pursued by the Post Office, one of the hardest elements has been confronting a faceless institution. But the name that has been repeated to me again and again by victims I've spoken to is that of Paula Vennells. Although the computer problems began before her tenure as chief executive, under her leadership, the glitches within the system became widely reported on. But she insisted the system was ""robust"", defending the technology and her organisation's actions to a committee of MPs. As chief executive, she chose to fight lengthy and expensive legal battles against sub-postmasters seeking redress. When more than 500 sub-postmasters won a civil court case against the Post Office in December 2020, the judge said that under her leadership the actions of the Post Office had been ""both cruel and incompetent"". She received a CBE for ""services to the Post Office"" in 2019. Since Ms Vennells stepped down as boss, there has been a dramatic shift in tone from the Post Office. It did not contest the vast majority of individuals who managed to overturn their convictions in the Court of Appeal last week. It has issued an apology and is already mentioning compensation. The Bishop of St Albans, the Right Reverend Dr Alan Smith, said that his father had been a sub-postmaster, adding: "" I express my distress at the miscarriage of justice that so many sub-postmasters have suffered."" He said: ""I am aware that there are still legal processes and inquiries to take place during which it is right that Ms Vennells stands back from public ministry."" Following the legal decision on Friday, Ms Vennells said she was ""deeply saddened"" by the sub-postmasters' accounts. She said she would cooperate with the government inquiry ""as I did with last year's select committee inquiry"". Tom Hedges (centre) was one 39 former postmasters celebrating as their convictions were quashed on Friday The Horizon IT system, installed by the Post Office in branches across the UK, was flawed from the start. At the Court of Appeal on Friday, Lord Justice Holroyde said the Post Office ""knew there were serious issues"" and had a ""clear duty to investigate"". But the Post Office ""consistently asserted that Horizon was robust and reliable"" and ""effectively steamrolled over any sub-postmaster who sought to challenge its accuracy"". Those affected have long called for a judge-led, full, public inquiry, rather than the government's own inquiry which is set to report in the summer. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates potential miscarriages of justice, is reviewing another 22 cases. There were more than 700 prosecutions based on Horizon evidence.

"Vanessa Bampton is one of thousands of mortgage prisoners MPs are challenging the government to live up to a promise to help homeowners trapped paying high interest rates because the Treasury sold their mortgages to unregulated firms. Since they cannot switch to a better deal, an estimated 250,000 homeowners are forced to pay standard variable interest rates. These are well above what a competitive mortgage would charge. But moves to ease their plight are being blocked, MPs say. The House of Lords has passed an amendment to the Financial Services Act to cap rates for borrowers in that position, known as ""mortgage prisoners"". But government whips are instructing Conservative MPs to vote against the amendment in the House of Commons on Monday. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has promised to look at ""workable solutions"" for the homeowners. But the Treasury claims the SVR cap would be ""unfair"" on other borrowers. Since the financial crash, tougher affordability checks have made it hard to change lenders if your mortgage is large compared to your house price - or if you're close to retirement or have bad credit. But most mortgage borrowers can still switch to a cheaper mortgage deal on lower interest rates with their existing lender. Mortgage prisoners facing 'financial nightmare' However, an estimated 250,000 borrowers - such as mother-of-two Vanessa Bampton - have seen their home loans sold by the Treasury to unregulated firms that do not offer new mortgage deals. As a result, they are trapped by their mortgages, forced when their initial deal ends on to high standard variable interest rates - where their payments can be double or treble what they would pay in a competitive mortgage. Vanessa and her husband purchased their Bournemouth home in 2006 with a mortgage with Northern Rock. At the time, it was a market-leading loan approved and regulated by the Financial Services Authority. However, in 2008, after Northern Rock had been nationalised, their interest rate jumped as they went on to the lender's standard variable rate. But because they had borrowed a large sum compared to the price of their home, known as a high ""loan-to-value"", they could not switch lenders. ""Our mortgage went up overnight and literally almost doubled. Our disposable income was zilch,"" said Vanessa. ""And when we moved into this house, we had some work done to it. We had to put a boiler in the new kitchen and so we took out a small loan for that. So we couldn't cover all of our outgoings. ""I've suffered depression over it. I've had two or three jobs over the period since then and my husband was trying to study and it's been so, so difficult. I can't express how hard it's been for us as a family."" In 2009, Vanessa's mortgage was moved, with hundreds of thousands of others, to Northern Rock Asset Management (NRAM), which had been separated from the retail arm of Northern Rock, later sold to Virgin Money. The same year, the Treasury, then under Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling, helda consultation on the mortgage market,external. It warned that distressed mortgage lenders were selling books of mortgages to unregulated hedge funds and private equity firms ""attracted by the possibility of purchasing assets at a discount"", that were were unregulated and therefore not bound by the regulator's requirement to treat customers fairly. ""Non-regulated owners of regulated mortgage contracts may seek to maximise margins by raising interest rates and charges, potentially to levels that are unaffordable to borrowers,"" the Treasury consultation said. ""In some cases, the lack of regulation and the possibility of acting in this way to extract profit may be a contributing factor to firms' desire to purchase these mortgages. ""Such activity clearly has the potential to cause severe harm to borrowers,"" it added. ""The onward sale of regulated mortgage contracts may also be seen as unfair, as it leads to a reduction in protections for some consumers, both in absolute terms and relative to other borrowers who have purchased similar financial services."" However, under the Coalition government of 2010-15, Chancellor George Osborne was keen to re-privatise assets nationalised in the 2008 crisis. In 2014, the Treasury cast aside those concerns and sold a book of 270,000 Northern Rock mortgages in NRAM, amounting to Â£13.5bn of outstanding home loans, to US private equity firm Cerberus, a sprawling guns-to-finance conglomerate owned by Trump-supporting billionaire Steve Feinberg. It was the biggest privatisation in UK history. The taxpayer received just Â£5.5bn in cash. BecauseCerberus did not offer new loans, borrowers such as Vanessa, who could not switch lenders, also could not access cheaper deals with their existing lender. As a consequence, they had no choice but to pay standard variable interest rates costing substantially more than the market rate. Because many mortgage prisoners have now been paying those elevated rates for more than a decade, the additional cost runs into tens of thousand of pounds. A mortgage prisoner with an average mortgage of Â£165,000 has overpaid in interest between Â£25,000 and Â£45,000 over the past decade, according toa report by the UK Mortgage Prisoners action group,external. In a House of Commons debate on Monday, MPs will press the government to support the reform, which imposes a cap on standard variable rates charged by firms in ""closed books"" (meaning the firm that owns them does not offer new mortgage deals), such that their interest rates were no more than 2% above the Bank of England's base rate. After the last Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak promised to look for ""workable solutions"" to help mortgage prisoners. But in spite of the chancellor's promise, the Treasury has been lobbying MPs hard not to support the Lords amendment. Seema Malhotra, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on mortgage prisoners, said: ""We need to do something to protect these consumers, we need to do something to bring back some sort of level playing field for people who are in this situation through no fault of their own they took out their mortgages in good faith with regulated fully regulated High Street lenders. ""It's through the government selling off these mortgages without adequate protection to these mortgage loan sharks that has led to this situation. A targeted intervention for these for this specific circumstance is what's needed and it's needed now."" In a statement to the BBC, the Treasury said: ""We know that being unable to switch your mortgage can be incredibly difficult. But an interest rate cap would have serious market implications and be unfair to other borrowers. ""Many borrowers could now find it easier to switch to an active lender or continue interest-only payments, thanks to recent rule changes by the Financial Conduct Authority. ""We're committed to finding practical and proportionate options to address this issue and will set out further steps shortly."" Many of the trapped borrowers took out high loan-to-value mortgages before the 2008 financial crash -something the government is again encouragingin Budget measures introduced last week designed to support mortgages worth 95% of the value of the property they are used to purchase.

"Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds moved into No 11 Downing Street in July 2019 Further questions have been asked about the funding of home improvements at the prime minister's Downing Street flat, following the release of an exchange of letters with his standards adviser. Lord Geidt complained about not having been shown WhatsApp messages between Boris Johnson and Tory donor Lord Brownlow, which talked about the refurbishment. Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds had work carried out on their private residence, the flat above 11 Downing Street. The prime minister receives an annual public grant of Â£30,000 to spend on his living quarters. But the work cost considerably more than that - at least Â£112,000 based on the amount we know Lord Brownlow contributed. The work was initially paid for by the Cabinet Office, but Â£52,000 was given to the Conservative Party by Lord Brownlow to cover the bills. Mr Johnson says he has now covered all the costs out of his own pocket. The Conservative Partywas fined Â£17,800after the Electoral Commission found it had failed to accurately declare all of Lord Brownlow's donations towards the renovation. Lord Brownlow was asked in May 2020 to set up a Downing Street trust that would fund renovations to the flat above 11 Downing Street, but that trust was never established. In November 2020, the prime minister approached Lord Brownlow by WhatsApp message to approve payments to the interior designer carrying out the work. The Electoral Commission found in December 2021 that the subsequent Â£52,000 payment from Huntswood Associates Ltd, whose director is Lord Brownlow, had not been properly recorded and that it should not have been described as a loan or as part of a trust. But it said that separate payments of almost Â£60,000 for the refurbishments made by Lord Brownlow directly to suppliers, did not need to be declared. TheElectoral Commission report,externalled to further controversy because it referred to an exchange of WhatsApp messages between the prime minister and Lord Brownlow, which had not been seen by the adviser on standards, Lord Geidt, when he had reported on the case earlier in the year. The prime minister lives in a flat above 11 Downing Street Lord Geidt's report in May hadconcluded,externalthat Mr Johnson did not break the ministerial code over the funding of the renovations. But he said: ""The prime minister - unwisely, in my view - allowed the refurbishment of the apartment at No 11 Downing Street to proceed without more rigorous regard for how this would be funded."" Lord Geidt added: ""The record shows no evidence that the prime minister had been informed"" about the payments. His report says that when he found out in February 2021, Mr Johnson ""settled the full amount himself"". But when Lord Geidt found out about the messages to Lord Brownlow, hewrote to the prime minister,externalsaying that while his overall conclusions about the ministerial code were unchanged, had he seen the messages, ""I doubt whether I would have concluded, without qualification... that 'at the point when the prime minister became aware, he took steps to make the relevant declaration and to seek advice'."" Mr Johnson replied, offering a ""humble and sincere apology"" for not giving him the messages, blaming security issues which had forced him to change his phone. If a politician accepts money from a donor - either as a gift or as a loan - they are expected to make that information public, normally within 28 days. The concern is that if a financial gift is kept secret, it might be used to gain favours or political influence. This is the exchange of messages between Mr Johnson and Lord Brownlow: At the end of his message, Mr Johnson refers to the ""great exhibition plan"", which was a proposal for a cultural festival, which Lord Brownlow was involved with as a trustee of London's Albert Hall. Lord Brownlow met Oliver Dowden, who was then culture secretary, to discuss the event six weeks after the text exchange with the prime minister, according tothe meeting log,external. In the end, the exhibition did not happen, but Labour says Lord Brownlow's November 2020 text exchanges with the PM are still important. ""Lord Brownlow appears to have access to the prime minister because he was paying for the flat renovations. If that is the case, that is corruption,"" the party said. The BBC has approached Lord Brownlow for comment but he has not yet responded. Business Minister Paul Scully denied that the prime minister was linking support for a Great Exhibition with financial support for flat renovations in his messages. He said the Great Exhibition plan was passed to ""the right channels"" at the culture department and that Mr Johnson ""had no idea"" who would be paying for the flat refurbishments, believing the funding would come through a blind trust. Like several of his recent predecessors, Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds are living at No 11 because the four-bedroom flat there is much larger than the one above No 10. Tony Blair was the first prime minister to live at No 11 - he and his wife Cherie turned the space into a family home. The Grade 1-listed flatwas then extensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameron in 2011at a cost of Â£30,000. Michelle Obama and Samantha Cameron pictured in the flat at 11 Downing St The latest upgrade for the flat was carried out by interior designer Lulu Lytle.

"While No 10 is the PM's official residence, he and his fiancee Carrie Symonds live next door at No 11 No 10 has refused to comment on reports Boris Johnson is considering setting up a charity to pay for refurbishments to his official Downing Street residence. The Daily Mail reported that a revamp of the flat,externallived in by the PM and his fiancee Carrie Symonds could be funded by wealthy Conservative benefactors. A spokeswoman said Downing Street was a Grade One listed building which had been periodically improved in the past. Labour said the public had a right to know the cost and who would be paying. And the SNP said greater clarity was needed over any move to set up a new Downing Street fund. Like several of his recent predecessors, Mr Johnson is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, the chancellor of the exchequer's official residence. The four-bedroom flat, which is much larger than the flat above No 10 once occupied by Margaret Thatcher, wasextensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameronin 2011 at a cost of Â£30,000. Call for inquiry into Symonds' influence in No 10 Publicly-funded pics of Boris Johnson's dog defended The couple spent the maximum Â£30,000 public grant available to prime ministers each year for the upkeep of their accommodation. Michelle Obama and Samantha Cameron in the Downing Street flat in 2011 Tony Blair and Cherie Blair also spent thousands on turning the space into a family home when they lived there. Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds moved into No 11 in July 2019. Their son Wilfred was born in April 2020. There have been unconfirmed reports that the couple are undertaking extensive refurbishment work on the flat and considering options for how any expenditure over the Â£30,000 annual limit would be covered. No 10 said suggestions some of the work could be funded by Tory supporters via a charity set up for the purpose of preserving Downing Street's heritage were ""speculation"". In the US, a scheme of this kind pays for restoration work in the White House. No 10 said details of any work carried out on the property would be published in the normal way later this year. ""Matters concerning any work on Downing Street, including the residences, are covered in the Cabinet Office annual report and accounts,"" a spokeswoman said. ""That is where we set out the details of what has happened. ""Downing Street is a working building, as has been the case under successive administrations, refurbishment and maintenance are made periodically."" But opposition parties are questioning whether it is appropriate for ""significant"" sums of public money to spent on the flat when millions of people are facing financial hardship due to Covid. Labour MP Sarah Owen has written to the PM asking him for details of taxpayers' contribution and to consider whether involving private Conservative donors in funding the project could lead to conflicts of interest. ""The British public rightly expect probity, integrity and transparency when it comes to spending public money,"" she said. The SNP said the move would be ""grossly inappropriate"", suggesting the PM - who is paid a salary of Â£150,000 a year - should fund the improvements out of his own pocket. ""It reeks of secrecy and, unless all the accounts are fully published, suspicion will linger about where the money is coming from and whether anything has been offered in return,"" said the party's Pete Wishart. In 2011, the Cabinet Officewas forced to reveal details of the scale of the work undertaken by the Camerons after a ruling by the then Information Commissioner Christopher Graham. It revealed that much of the expenditure had gone on a new kitchen, while the flat had been almost completely re-wired, re-plumbed and re-decorated. The couple covered the cost of furniture, fittings and accessories themselves. Their sleek, modern kitchen was much commented on after it served as a backdrop to a famous picture of Samantha Cameron entertaining First Lady Michelle Obama in Downing Street during the 2011 US state visit. The 2011 accounts also showed more than Â£650,000 had been spent on external and internal renovation of the offices and reception rooms in No 10, including cabling, plumbing and energy efficiency improvements.

We'll be back on Monday morning. The writers today were Katie Wright, Victoria Lindrea and Hugo Bachega. The page was edited by Alex Therrien. We're soon going to be bringing our live page to a pause. But before we do, here is a round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories on Sunday.  As we have been reporting, the UK government has said it willsend medical equipment to India, which is facing a surge in coronavirus infections and a shortage of oxygen. Labour has urged the government to extend its offer of help to  include support with genome sequencing and epidemiology. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Defeating this virus anywhere means defeating it everywhere. ""We have seen how quickly Covid-19 variants that have been identified in one country are able to spread rapidly across the globe. ""The UK can offer expertise and capacity in crucial areas like genome sequencing and epidemiology that have already proven vital in mapping and restricting the spread of coronavirus."" Earlier we told you about the UK government's plans to send medical equipment to India - with the first supplies of ventilators and oxygen concentrators due to arrive in the Indian capital early on Tuesday. Now, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tweeted that the UK stands ""side by side with India in the shared fight against Covid-19"". He wrote that ""vital"" equipment was on its way ""to help stop the tragic loss of life from the virus"" and vowed the UK would ""continue to work closely with the Indian government during this difficult time"". It comes as a further 2,767 coronavirus deaths were recorded in India over the past 24 hours. The country has so far confirmed more than 186,000 deaths and 16 million cases - three million have been added in just the last two weeks.  Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the first tranche of supplies ""is on its way"" and would arrive in Delhi early on Tuesday. He said the UK stood ""side by side with India as a friend and partner"". It comes asthe number of new coronavirus infections in India reached another record high for the fourth day in a row. The assistance package, funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, includes ventilators and oxygen concentrators from surplus stocks after consultation between the government, the NHS and UK suppliers and manufacturers. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""hugely grateful to those who have worked hard to make this initial delivery"". ""We are determined to support the people of India through this very difficult time,"" he added. The UK is working closely with the government of India to work out what further assistance it can provide in the coming days, the government said. âWe have all got to work together to tackle Covid-19,"" said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.  The daily figures also show more than 12.5m people in the UK have now received both doses of the vaccine. Some 12,587,116 have received two doses while 33,666,638 have received a first dose. In England those aged 45 or over are already being invited to book an appointment, while in Scotland this applies to those aged 50 or over. Northern Ireland has now opened bookings for the 35 to 39 age group - and one health board in Wales is offering the vaccine to those aged 30 to 39 - although most are still vaccinating people in their 40s and 50s.   A further 11 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were also 1,712 new cases registered. This compares to 32 deaths and 2.061 cases on Saturday. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, has tweeted that the bloc is ""ready to support"" India as the country battles a surge in coronavirus infections. Just under 350,000 new cases were reported in India in the past 24 hours. Many hospitals are full and are refusing new admissions because of uncertainty over oxygen supplies. ""We stand in full solidarity with the Indian people,"" wrote von der Leyen. Janez Lenarcic, European Commissioner for crisis management, tweeted that the EU's emergency response coordination centre is ""ready to provide urgently needed oxygen and medicine"". There have also been offers of support from countries including the UK and the US.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rallies such as the anti-lockdown protest in London on Saturday are ""at the very least a potential risk"" to the spread of coronavirus, a scientist advising the government has warned. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of the government's scientific advisory panel on behaviour, said there was evidence that counties in the US which held rallies for former President Donald Trump during the presidential election last year saw bigger spikes in infection than those who did not. ""Moreover, the mass election rallies in India and the permission to bring huge religious festivals forward... is one explanation for the huge rise of cases in India,"" he said. ""Much depends on how people behave at these events. ""If they maintain distance and wear masks, there is little danger. If they explicitly ignore restrictions, if they reject masks, stand close together, touch, shout and sing, then - going back to first principles - there is likely to be a risk. ""Given that the anti-lockdown protests do all of these things, they are at the very least a potential risk,"" he added. A police leader has said officers deserve greater protection after eight of them were injured during an anti-lockdown protest in central London on Saturday. Demonstrators hurled bottles as police attempted to disperse the crowds in Hyde Park following a march and rally. The Met said two officers were taken to hospital, although their injuries are not believed to be serious. Home Secretary Priti Patel condemned the ""senseless violence"" and wished the injured officers ""a speedy recovery"". Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said ""the safety of our police officers should be top of the agenda"". ""Police officers are human beings who go out every day to keep people safe. ""Many people seem to have forgotten that right now, but we will keep reminding them."" Five people were arrested for offences, including assault on police and public order offences. ""Peaceful protest may well be the cornerstone of democracy - and police officers have a role in facilitating that - but the scenes we saw in Hyde Park yesterday of a thin blue line of brave and sadly bloodied police officers coming under attack from thugs were anything but peaceful,"" said Marsh.

Documentary photographers and filmmakers set out across the UK in February and March to capture the immunisation programme in action. Among the people they photographed was Dr Gavin Chestnutt, a GP who took his vaccine supplies on the ferry to Rathlin Island - Northern Ireland's most northerly point - to immunise the community there and ensure the elderly population did not have to travel in bad weather. Dr Gavin Chestnutt, who is also a part-time farmer, was photographed vaccinating a 92-year-old man in his back garden Dozens of sites across the country have been used as vaccine centres, including Salisbury Cathedral Newbury Racecourse is among the sporting venues to host a vaccine centre Major shops will remain closed as part of the new measures A third coronavirus state of emergency has come into effect in the Japanese capital, Tokyo, and three other areas, just three months ahead of the scheduled start of the Olympic Games. Under the curbs, set to last for about two weeks, major commercial facilities like department stores will close, as well as restaurants, bars, and karaoke parlours serving alcohol. Restaurants that do not serve alcohol are being told to close early and companies are being asked to make arrangements for people to work remotely. Schools will remain open. The measures also apply to Kyoto, Hyogo and Osaka. They were brought in to battle a surge in infections driven by Covid-19 variants, but there are doubts it will be sufficient. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has come under fire for the slow pace of the vaccination programme - just over 1% of Japan's population has received a first dose. Despite the surge in infections, the government has insisted that the delayed 2020 Olympics will go ahead in July. A woman in England has been fined Â£10,000 afterpolice broke up a 30th birthday party of more than 50 people inside a marquee. Police received reports of the party in Nottingham, at about 20:30 BST on Friday night. Officers found the marquee set up at the back of the property ""and a large gathering was taking place inside"". Nottinghamshire Police said it ""had no choice"" but to hand the organiser the large fine.

And unlike recent awards ceremonies held during the pandemic, such as the Golden Globes, Baftas and Emmys, nominees have been told to try to avoid appearing via virtual platforms such as Zoom and to attend one of the locations in person. Yes, there will be multiple locations for the ceremony. The main elements of the ceremony will come from Los Angeles, as usual. The event will be split across two venues in the city - the Dolby Theatre and Union Station. There will be international locations too. London's BFI will serve as the UK's hub for British nominees, and another studio will be set up in Paris for French nominees. The show's producers said they had gone to ""great lengths to provide a safe and enjoyable evening"" for attendees in person. The 93d Academy Awards begin at 17:00 PT, which is 01:00 BST on Monday morning for those in the UK.Find out everything you need to know before the ceremony here. Janhavee MooleBBC Marathi Relatives of Covid patients have been queuing up in cities to refill cylindera For anyone who has watched the pandemic unfold here - from doctors to officials to journalists - this feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu. Seven months ago, the country had grappled with a similaroxygen shortage amid a rapid surge in case numbers. But this time, it's much worse. Typically, healthcare facilities consume about 15% of oxygen supply, leaving the rest for industrial use. But amid India's second wave nearly 90% of the country's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes daily - is being diverted for medical use, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. That's nearly three times higher than was consumed every day at the peak of the first wave in mid-September last year. Then, India was adding about 90,000 cases daily. Just two weeks ago, in early April, the single-day spike was around 144,000. Now, the daily caseload has more than doubled to well more than 300,000. Doctors and epidemiologists believe the deluge of cases is delaying tests and consultation, leading to many people being admitted to hospital when their condition is severe. So the demand for high-flow oxygen - and therefore more oxygen - is higher than it was during the last wave. Read the full story here. More than 20 anti-lockdown scientists and academics have written an open letter calling for face masks and social distancing to end in June. The letter,published in full on the Daily Express website,,externalsays more weight should be given to the success of the vaccines and less to what it calls the ""theoretical"" risk of new variants or a new surge in infections. It also urges the government to scrap plans for vaccine passports, along with mass community testing, in favour of a more targeted approach. The government has already announced it hopes to end all legal limits on social contact in England on 21 June at the earliest and the prime minister has said there is nothing in the data to suggest this will not be the case. But somescientists have suggestedpeople could still be asked to wear face coverings and socially distance for several years as other countries are yet to complete their vaccination programmes. BBC health correspondent Katharine Da Costa says many of the signatories to the letter had previously called for lockdowns to be abolished in favour of shielding the vulnerable, a strategy strongly criticised by the wider scientific community. The UK, the US and other developed countries will start
to have excess vaccines in ""the next three or four months"" which they
can then share with the developing world, according to Billionaire philanthropist
Bill Gates. Speaking earlier to Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, he said: ""Over the balance of the year, the US, the UK and others will be able to make sure that the vaccines are now going to the developing countries."" He added: ""The other good news is that the actual death rate from this epidemic in the poorest countries has actually been quite low."" He said that it was a
""good thing"" that rich countries had been able to vaccinate their
elderly populations as they had generally been harder hit than developing
countries. ""The fact that now we're vaccinating 30-year-olds
in the UK and the US and we don't have all the 60-year-olds in Brazil and South
Africa (vaccinated), that's not fair, but within three or four months the
vaccine allocation will be getting to all the countries that have the very
severe epidemic.""  Some 8,000 spectators will be at Wembley this afternoon forthe Carabao Cupfinal between Manchester City and Tottenham - the biggest attendance at an outdoor sports event in the UK since the first lockdown in March last year. The match, which kicks off at 16:30 BST, is part of the official test programme to work out the best way for big crowds to return to venues. The final was rescheduled from February with the objective of having ""as many supporters in attendance as possible"". A proportion of the tickets have been given to both clubs for the game, while the rest have gone to local residents in Brent and NHS staff. The match is one of nine events across sports and the arts which are being used to provide ""key scientific data and research"" into how events can safely re-open to fans in line with the roadmap out of lockdown. Researchers at the events will ""gather evidence associated with different settings and approaches to managing and mitigating transmission risk"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK stands ""side by side"" with India and would send vital medical equipment Supplies include oxygen concentrators and ventilators, with the EU and US also pledging to help It comes as India set another world record for daily infections for a fourth day running There were a further 349,691 cases in the 24 hours to Sunday morning, with another 2,767 lives lost A campaign is being launched to encourage younger people in the UK to get vaccinated when their turn comes More than half of the UK's population have now received a first vaccine dose At least 82 people have been killed in a fire at a hospital treating coronavirus patients in the capital of Iraq, Baghdad More than 100 were injured in the blaze, which erupted at the Ibn Khatib hospital on Saturday night The UK reported 11 deaths and 1,712 cases on Sunday Some 8,000 spectators are attending the Carabao Cup final between Manchester City and Tottenham as part of the official test programme A man has been arrested in Spain on suspicion of assault after allegedly infecting 22 people with Covid Edited by Alex Therrien That's it from the coronavirus live page for today - thanks for joining us. We'll be back on Monday morning. The writers today were Katie Wright, Victoria Lindrea and Hugo Bachega. The page was edited by Alex Therrien. We're soon going to be bringing our live page to a pause. But before we do, here is a round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories on Sunday.  As we have been reporting, the UK government has said it willsend medical equipment to India, which is facing a surge in coronavirus infections and a shortage of oxygen. Labour has urged the government to extend its offer of help to  include support with genome sequencing and epidemiology. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Defeating this virus anywhere means defeating it everywhere. ""We have seen how quickly Covid-19 variants that have been identified in one country are able to spread rapidly across the globe. ""The UK can offer expertise and capacity in crucial areas like genome sequencing and epidemiology that have already proven vital in mapping and restricting the spread of coronavirus."" Earlier we told you about the UK government's plans to send medical equipment to India - with the first supplies of ventilators and oxygen concentrators due to arrive in the Indian capital early on Tuesday. Now, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tweeted that the UK stands ""side by side with India in the shared fight against Covid-19"". He wrote that ""vital"" equipment was on its way ""to help stop the tragic loss of life from the virus"" and vowed the UK would ""continue to work closely with the Indian government during this difficult time"". It comes as a further 2,767 coronavirus deaths were recorded in India over the past 24 hours. The country has so far confirmed more than 186,000 deaths and 16 million cases - three million have been added in just the last two weeks.  Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played India coronavirus: âA Covid tsunami we had never seen beforeâ The UK is to send medical equipment, including 495 oxygen concentrators, 120 non-invasive ventilators and 20 manual ventilators, to India this week, the government has said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the first tranche of supplies ""is on its way"" and would arrive in Delhi early on Tuesday. He said the UK stood ""side by side with India as a friend and partner"". It comes asthe number of new coronavirus infections in India reached another record high for the fourth day in a row. The assistance package, funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, includes ventilators and oxygen concentrators from surplus stocks after consultation between the government, the NHS and UK suppliers and manufacturers. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""hugely grateful to those who have worked hard to make this initial delivery"". ""We are determined to support the people of India through this very difficult time,"" he added. The UK is working closely with the government of India to work out what further assistance it can provide in the coming days, the government said. âWe have all got to work together to tackle Covid-19,"" said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.  The daily figures also show more than 12.5m people in the UK have now received both doses of the vaccine. Some 12,587,116 have received two doses while 33,666,638 have received a first dose. In England those aged 45 or over are already being invited to book an appointment, while in Scotland this applies to those aged 50 or over. Northern Ireland has now opened bookings for the 35 to 39 age group - and one health board in Wales is offering the vaccine to those aged 30 to 39 - although most are still vaccinating people in their 40s and 50s.   A further 11 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were also 1,712 new cases registered. This compares to 32 deaths and 2.061 cases on Saturday. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, has tweeted that the bloc is ""ready to support"" India as the country battles a surge in coronavirus infections. Just under 350,000 new cases were reported in India in the past 24 hours. Many hospitals are full and are refusing new admissions because of uncertainty over oxygen supplies. ""We stand in full solidarity with the Indian people,"" wrote von der Leyen. Janez Lenarcic, European Commissioner for crisis management, tweeted that the EU's emergency response coordination centre is ""ready to provide urgently needed oxygen and medicine"". There have also been offers of support from countries including the UK and the US.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rallies such as the anti-lockdown protest in London on Saturday are ""at the very least a potential risk"" to the spread of coronavirus, a scientist advising the government has warned. Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of the government's scientific advisory panel on behaviour, said there was evidence that counties in the US which held rallies for former President Donald Trump during the presidential election last year saw bigger spikes in infection than those who did not. ""Moreover, the mass election rallies in India and the permission to bring huge religious festivals forward... is one explanation for the huge rise of cases in India,"" he said. ""Much depends on how people behave at these events. ""If they maintain distance and wear masks, there is little danger. If they explicitly ignore restrictions, if they reject masks, stand close together, touch, shout and sing, then - going back to first principles - there is likely to be a risk. ""Given that the anti-lockdown protests do all of these things, they are at the very least a potential risk,"" he added. A police leader has said officers deserve greater protection after eight of them were injured during an anti-lockdown protest in central London on Saturday. Demonstrators hurled bottles as police attempted to disperse the crowds in Hyde Park following a march and rally. The Met said two officers were taken to hospital, although their injuries are not believed to be serious. Home Secretary Priti Patel condemned the ""senseless violence"" and wished the injured officers ""a speedy recovery"". Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said ""the safety of our police officers should be top of the agenda"". ""Police officers are human beings who go out every day to keep people safe. ""Many people seem to have forgotten that right now, but we will keep reminding them."" Five people were arrested for offences, including assault on police and public order offences. ""Peaceful protest may well be the cornerstone of democracy - and police officers have a role in facilitating that - but the scenes we saw in Hyde Park yesterday of a thin blue line of brave and sadly bloodied police officers coming under attack from thugs were anything but peaceful,"" said Marsh. Read more  The Department of Health has releaseda series of photos documenting the NHS's largest-ever vaccination programme. Documentary photographers and filmmakers set out across the UK in February and March to capture the immunisation programme in action. Among the people they photographed was Dr Gavin Chestnutt, a GP who took his vaccine supplies on the ferry to Rathlin Island - Northern Ireland's most northerly point - to immunise the community there and ensure the elderly population did not have to travel in bad weather. Dr Gavin Chestnutt, who is also a part-time farmer, was photographed vaccinating a 92-year-old man in his back garden Dozens of sites across the country have been used as vaccine centres, including Salisbury Cathedral Newbury Racecourse is among the sporting venues to host a vaccine centre Major shops will remain closed as part of the new measures A third coronavirus state of emergency has come into effect in the Japanese capital, Tokyo, and three other areas, just three months ahead of the scheduled start of the Olympic Games. Under the curbs, set to last for about two weeks, major commercial facilities like department stores will close, as well as restaurants, bars, and karaoke parlours serving alcohol. Restaurants that do not serve alcohol are being told to close early and companies are being asked to make arrangements for people to work remotely. Schools will remain open. The measures also apply to Kyoto, Hyogo and Osaka. They were brought in to battle a surge in infections driven by Covid-19 variants, but there are doubts it will be sufficient. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has come under fire for the slow pace of the vaccination programme - just over 1% of Japan's population has received a first dose. Despite the surge in infections, the government has insisted that the delayed 2020 Olympics will go ahead in July. A woman in England has been fined Â£10,000 afterpolice broke up a 30th birthday party of more than 50 people inside a marquee. Police received reports of the party in Nottingham, at about 20:30 BST on Friday night. Officers found the marquee set up at the back of the property ""and a large gathering was taking place inside"". Nottinghamshire Police said it ""had no choice"" but to hand the organiser the large fine. Under the government's current guidelines in England,two households or groups of up to six people are allowed to socialise in parks and private gardens.

""Moreover, the mass election rallies in India and the permission to bring huge religious festivals forward... is one explanation for the huge rise of cases in India,"" he said. ""Much depends on how people behave at these events. ""If they maintain distance and wear masks, there is little danger. If they explicitly ignore restrictions, if they reject masks, stand close together, touch, shout and sing, then - going back to first principles - there is likely to be a risk. ""Given that the anti-lockdown protests do all of these things, they are at the very least a potential risk,"" he added. A police leader has said officers deserve greater protection after eight of them were injured during an anti-lockdown protest in central London on Saturday. Demonstrators hurled bottles as police attempted to disperse the crowds in Hyde Park following a march and rally. The Met said two officers were taken to hospital, although their injuries are not believed to be serious. Home Secretary Priti Patel condemned the ""senseless violence"" and wished the injured officers ""a speedy recovery"". Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said ""the safety of our police officers should be top of the agenda"". ""Police officers are human beings who go out every day to keep people safe. ""Many people seem to have forgotten that right now, but we will keep reminding them."" Five people were arrested for offences, including assault on police and public order offences. ""Peaceful protest may well be the cornerstone of democracy - and police officers have a role in facilitating that - but the scenes we saw in Hyde Park yesterday of a thin blue line of brave and sadly bloodied police officers coming under attack from thugs were anything but peaceful,"" said Marsh.

Documentary photographers and filmmakers set out across the UK in February and March to capture the immunisation programme in action. Among the people they photographed was Dr Gavin Chestnutt, a GP who took his vaccine supplies on the ferry to Rathlin Island - Northern Ireland's most northerly point - to immunise the community there and ensure the elderly population did not have to travel in bad weather. Dr Gavin Chestnutt, who is also a part-time farmer, was photographed vaccinating a 92-year-old man in his back garden Dozens of sites across the country have been used as vaccine centres, including Salisbury Cathedral Newbury Racecourse is among the sporting venues to host a vaccine centre Major shops will remain closed as part of the new measures A third coronavirus state of emergency has come into effect in the Japanese capital, Tokyo, and three other areas, just three months ahead of the scheduled start of the Olympic Games. Under the curbs, set to last for about two weeks, major commercial facilities like department stores will close, as well as restaurants, bars, and karaoke parlours serving alcohol. Restaurants that do not serve alcohol are being told to close early and companies are being asked to make arrangements for people to work remotely. Schools will remain open. The measures also apply to Kyoto, Hyogo and Osaka. They were brought in to battle a surge in infections driven by Covid-19 variants, but there are doubts it will be sufficient. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has come under fire for the slow pace of the vaccination programme - just over 1% of Japan's population has received a first dose. Despite the surge in infections, the government has insisted that the delayed 2020 Olympics will go ahead in July. A woman in England has been fined Â£10,000 afterpolice broke up a 30th birthday party of more than 50 people inside a marquee. Police received reports of the party in Nottingham, at about 20:30 BST on Friday night. Officers found the marquee set up at the back of the property ""and a large gathering was taking place inside"". Nottinghamshire Police said it ""had no choice"" but to hand the organiser the large fine. Under the government's current guidelines in England,two households or groups of up to six people are allowed to socialise in parks and private gardens. The Shah family handed over the devices to the hospital on Friday. The family of a man who died with Covid-19 hasexpressed their gratitude to the hospital that cared for him with a donation of iPads. Bharatkumar Shah, 68, spent 16 days in intensive care at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, in January. During this time his family was unable to visit but said daily video calls with him were ""a lifeline"". Since his death on 1 February, the family has raised Â£5,000 to buy tablets and stereos for the hospital. ""The only communication we had with our dad for the days he was in hospital was through an iPad,"" said his daughter, Beena Shah. The family said their father had always ""loved to help others"" so raising the money after his death had helped them ""cope better"".

And unlike recent awards ceremonies held during the pandemic, such as the Golden Globes, Baftas and Emmys, nominees have been told to try to avoid appearing via virtual platforms such as Zoom and to attend one of the locations in person. Yes, there will be multiple locations for the ceremony. The main elements of the ceremony will come from Los Angeles, as usual. The event will be split across two venues in the city - the Dolby Theatre and Union Station. There will be international locations too. London's BFI will serve as the UK's hub for British nominees, and another studio will be set up in Paris for French nominees. The show's producers said they had gone to ""great lengths to provide a safe and enjoyable evening"" for attendees in person.

Janhavee MooleBBC Marathi Relatives of Covid patients have been queuing up in cities to refill cylindera For anyone who has watched the pandemic unfold here - from doctors to officials to journalists - this feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu. Seven months ago, the country had grappled with a similaroxygen shortage amid a rapid surge in case numbers. But this time, it's much worse. Typically, healthcare facilities consume about 15% of oxygen supply, leaving the rest for industrial use. But amid India's second wave nearly 90% of the country's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes daily - is being diverted for medical use, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. That's nearly three times higher than was consumed every day at the peak of the first wave in mid-September last year. Then, India was adding about 90,000 cases daily. Just two weeks ago, in early April, the single-day spike was around 144,000. Now, the daily caseload has more than doubled to well more than 300,000. Doctors and epidemiologists believe the deluge of cases is delaying tests and consultation, leading to many people being admitted to hospital when their condition is severe. So the demand for high-flow oxygen - and therefore more oxygen - is higher than it was during the last wave. Read the full story here. More than 20 anti-lockdown scientists and academics have written an open letter calling for face masks and social distancing to end in June. The letter,published in full on the Daily Express website,,externalsays more weight should be given to the success of the vaccines and less to what it calls the ""theoretical"" risk of new variants or a new surge in infections. It also urges the government to scrap plans for vaccine passports, along with mass community testing, in favour of a more targeted approach. The government has already announced it hopes to end all legal limits on social contact in England on 21 June at the earliest and the prime minister has said there is nothing in the data to suggest this will not be the case. But somescientists have suggestedpeople could still be asked to wear face coverings and socially distance for several years as other countries are yet to complete their vaccination programmes. BBC health correspondent Katharine Da Costa says many of the signatories to the letter had previously called for lockdowns to be abolished in favour of shielding the vulnerable, a strategy strongly criticised by the wider scientific community. The UK, the US and other developed countries will start
to have excess vaccines in ""the next three or four months"" which they
can then share with the developing world, according to Billionaire philanthropist
Bill Gates. Speaking earlier to Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, he said: ""Over the balance of the year, the US, the UK and others will be able to make sure that the vaccines are now going to the developing countries."" He added: ""The other good news is that the actual death rate from this epidemic in the poorest countries has actually been quite low."" He said that it was a
""good thing"" that rich countries had been able to vaccinate their
elderly populations as they had generally been harder hit than developing
countries. ""The fact that now we're vaccinating 30-year-olds
in the UK and the US and we don't have all the 60-year-olds in Brazil and South
Africa (vaccinated), that's not fair, but within three or four months the
vaccine allocation will be getting to all the countries that have the very
severe epidemic.""  Some 8,000 spectators will be at Wembley this afternoon forthe Carabao Cupfinal between Manchester City and Tottenham - the biggest attendance at an outdoor sports event in the UK since the first lockdown in March last year. The match, which kicks off at 16:30 BST, is part of the official test programme to work out the best way for big crowds to return to venues. The final was rescheduled from February with the objective of having ""as many supporters in attendance as possible"". A proportion of the tickets have been given to both clubs for the game, while the rest have gone to local residents in Brent and NHS staff. The match is one of nine events across sports and the arts which are being used to provide ""key scientific data and research"" into how events can safely re-open to fans in line with the roadmap out of lockdown. Researchers at the events will ""gather evidence associated with different settings and approaches to managing and mitigating transmission risk"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Extra costs of refurbishing Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat will be met by the prime minister, Liz Truss says Boris Johnson covered the renovation costs for his Downing Street flat ""from his own pocket"", one of his ministers has said. Trade Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC the work is being ""fully declared"". But she did not answer repeated questions on whether a Tory party donor initially provided the money to him. It comes after the PM's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, claimed Mr Johnson had a ""possibly illegal"" plan for donors to pay the refurbishment. Labour said questions remained, as details over how the work was paid for had yet to be made public. The government is supposed to publish the list of minister's interests twice a year, but the last one showing money donated to them was released in July 2020. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said Mr Johnson should come in front of MPs on Monday to answer questions and publish the list ""as the public deserves [to see] it"". 'PM's flat refurbishment: What is the row about? Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Explain PM flat funding to MPs, says Labour Mr Johnson lives in the flat above 11 Downing Street with his fiancee Carrie Symonds - a move echoing a number of his predecessors as it is bigger than the accommodation above No 10. In March,Downing Street dismissed as ""speculation""suggestions that refurbishments on the flat last year would be paid for by Tory donors through a charity set up for this purpose, amid reports that the costs had spiralled out of control. But on Friday, Mr Cummingslaunched a blistering attack on his former boss via his blog,external, claiming he advised the PM the renovation plans were ""unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations if conducted in the way he intended"". A No 10 spokesperson said: ""At all times, the government and ministers have acted in accordance with the appropriate codes of conduct and electoral law."" And Cabinet Office Minister Lord True told the House of Lords on Friday that ""any costs of wider refurbishment in this year have been met by the prime minister personally"". Donations and loans to political parties of more than Â£7,500 must be reported to the Electoral Commission, which said it was having ""discussions with the Conservative Party"", but had not yet launched an investigation. The controversy also comes amid an ongoing row over lobbying in Westminster, after revelationsformer prime minister David Cameron had texted ministersabout the financial firm he was working for and businessman Sir James Dyson haddirectly contacted Mr Johnson over tax issueswhen working on ventilators during the pandemic. By Damian Grammaticas, BBC political correspondent The reason this issue is so difficult for Boris Johnson is it comes down to something simple - money. How a job was paid for is a far more straightforward issue for people to form an opinion about than other recent questions about government conduct. That swirl of revelation and allegation has dealt with the more intangible currency of politics, access, influence and favours. This is about cash. Tens of thousands potentially. The cost of a home makeover, and the as-yet-unanswered question, did Mr Johnson get help? And if he did, what about the implications for how that benefit should be declared - whether for electoral or tax reasons. Simple really. Also talking to Marr, Ms Truss defended Mr Johnson, saying: ""My understanding is the costs have been covered by the prime minister and everything has been fully declared by the rules."" But asked five times whether the money was put up by a party donor first, she would not answer. Instead, she told the programme: ""What I know is the prime minister has personally met the costs of the flat refurbishment and that is what people in Britain want to know and that is what has happened."" When asked why the list of minister's interests had yet to be published, Ms Truss replied: ""I'm sure it will be published in line with the rules."" And questioned about rumours of leaks out of No 10 - also addressed by Mr Cummings in his blog - the minister urged Mr Johnson to ""carry on"" doing ""an excellent job"" rather than ""listening to these noises off"". She added: ""I think this a complete load of Westminster tittle tattle that people simply don't care about."" But Ms Rayner said there was a ""real stench"" around the government and the ""serious allegations"" it faces. This video can not be played Labour's Angela Rayner: ""Tell us about where you're getting this money from, Boris, to do up your flat"" Ms Rayner told Marr: ""The issues that we have seen with ministers over the last couple of months has really undermined the institution of government and there are serious questions now the Conservatives need to answer. ""These are serious allegations and we think the prime minister should come to the House of Commons on Monday and should declare the ministers register of interests, which is eight months in delay. ""The problem is the government is hiding."" Sleaze accusers out of their minds, says PM Plan to fund Downing Street makeover 'speculation' The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, backed the call for the prime minister to answer questions in Parliament. He said: ""The longer Boris Johnson stays in hiding and dodges accountability, the more overpowering the stench of sleaze surrounding him and his government becomes. ""Rather than hiding behind Tory ministers, Boris Johnson must now come before Parliament and answer these very serious questions for himself.""

"While No 10 is the PM's official residence, he and his fiancee Carrie Symonds live next door at No 11 No 10 has refused to comment on reports Boris Johnson is considering setting up a charity to pay for refurbishments to his official Downing Street residence. The Daily Mail reported that a revamp of the flat,externallived in by the PM and his fiancee Carrie Symonds could be funded by wealthy Conservative benefactors. A spokeswoman said Downing Street was a Grade One listed building which had been periodically improved in the past. Labour said the public had a right to know the cost and who would be paying. And the SNP said greater clarity was needed over any move to set up a new Downing Street fund. Like several of his recent predecessors, Mr Johnson is living in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, the chancellor of the exchequer's official residence. The four-bedroom flat, which is much larger than the flat above No 10 once occupied by Margaret Thatcher, wasextensively refurbished by David and Samantha Cameronin 2011 at a cost of Â£30,000. Call for inquiry into Symonds' influence in No 10 Publicly-funded pics of Boris Johnson's dog defended The couple spent the maximum Â£30,000 public grant available to prime ministers each year for the upkeep of their accommodation. Michelle Obama and Samantha Cameron in the Downing Street flat in 2011 Tony Blair and Cherie Blair also spent thousands on turning the space into a family home when they lived there. Mr Johnson and Ms Symonds moved into No 11 in July 2019. Their son Wilfred was born in April 2020. There have been unconfirmed reports that the couple are undertaking extensive refurbishment work on the flat and considering options for how any expenditure over the Â£30,000 annual limit would be covered. No 10 said suggestions some of the work could be funded by Tory supporters via a charity set up for the purpose of preserving Downing Street's heritage were ""speculation"". In the US, a scheme of this kind pays for restoration work in the White House. No 10 said details of any work carried out on the property would be published in the normal way later this year. ""Matters concerning any work on Downing Street, including the residences, are covered in the Cabinet Office annual report and accounts,"" a spokeswoman said. ""That is where we set out the details of what has happened. ""Downing Street is a working building, as has been the case under successive administrations, refurbishment and maintenance are made periodically."" But opposition parties are questioning whether it is appropriate for ""significant"" sums of public money to spent on the flat when millions of people are facing financial hardship due to Covid. Labour MP Sarah Owen has written to the PM asking him for details of taxpayers' contribution and to consider whether involving private Conservative donors in funding the project could lead to conflicts of interest. ""The British public rightly expect probity, integrity and transparency when it comes to spending public money,"" she said. The SNP said the move would be ""grossly inappropriate"", suggesting the PM - who is paid a salary of Â£150,000 a year - should fund the improvements out of his own pocket. ""It reeks of secrecy and, unless all the accounts are fully published, suspicion will linger about where the money is coming from and whether anything has been offered in return,"" said the party's Pete Wishart. In 2011, the Cabinet Officewas forced to reveal details of the scale of the work undertaken by the Camerons after a ruling by the then Information Commissioner Christopher Graham. It revealed that much of the expenditure had gone on a new kitchen, while the flat had been almost completely re-wired, re-plumbed and re-decorated. The couple covered the cost of furniture, fittings and accessories themselves. Their sleek, modern kitchen was much commented on after it served as a backdrop to a famous picture of Samantha Cameron entertaining First Lady Michelle Obama in Downing Street during the 2011 US state visit. The 2011 accounts also showed more than Â£650,000 had been spent on external and internal renovation of the offices and reception rooms in No 10, including cabling, plumbing and energy efficiency improvements.

We'll be back on Monday morning. The writers today were Katie Wright, Victoria Lindrea and Hugo Bachega. The page was edited by Alex Therrien. We're soon going to be bringing our live page to a pause. But before we do, here is a round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories on Sunday.  As we have been reporting, the UK government has said it willsend medical equipment to India, which is facing a surge in coronavirus infections and a shortage of oxygen. Labour has urged the government to extend its offer of help to  include support with genome sequencing and epidemiology. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Defeating this virus anywhere means defeating it everywhere. ""We have seen how quickly Covid-19 variants that have been identified in one country are able to spread rapidly across the globe. ""The UK can offer expertise and capacity in crucial areas like genome sequencing and epidemiology that have already proven vital in mapping and restricting the spread of coronavirus."" Earlier we told you about the UK government's plans to send medical equipment to India - with the first supplies of ventilators and oxygen concentrators due to arrive in the Indian capital early on Tuesday. Now, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has tweeted that the UK stands ""side by side with India in the shared fight against Covid-19"". He wrote that ""vital"" equipment was on its way ""to help stop the tragic loss of life from the virus"" and vowed the UK would ""continue to work closely with the Indian government during this difficult time"". It comes as a further 2,767 coronavirus deaths were recorded in India over the past 24 hours. The country has so far confirmed more than 186,000 deaths and 16 million cases - three million have been added in just the last two weeks.  Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the first tranche of supplies ""is on its way"" and would arrive in Delhi early on Tuesday. He said the UK stood ""side by side with India as a friend and partner"". It comes asthe number of new coronavirus infections in India reached another record high for the fourth day in a row. The assistance package, funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, includes ventilators and oxygen concentrators from surplus stocks after consultation between the government, the NHS and UK suppliers and manufacturers. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""hugely grateful to those who have worked hard to make this initial delivery"". ""We are determined to support the people of India through this very difficult time,"" he added. The UK is working closely with the government of India to work out what further assistance it can provide in the coming days, the government said. âWe have all got to work together to tackle Covid-19,"" said Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.  The daily figures also show more than 12.5m people in the UK have now received both doses of the vaccine. Some 12,587,116 have received two doses while 33,666,638 have received a first dose. In England those aged 45 or over are already being invited to book an appointment, while in Scotland this applies to those aged 50 or over. Northern Ireland has now opened bookings for the 35 to 39 age group - and one health board in Wales is offering the vaccine to those aged 30 to 39 - although most are still vaccinating people in their 40s and 50s.   A further 11 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus, according to thelatest government figures,external. There were also 1,712 new cases registered. This compares to 32 deaths and 2.061 cases on Saturday. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission, has tweeted that the bloc is ""ready to support"" India as the country battles a surge in coronavirus infections. Just under 350,000 new cases were reported in India in the past 24 hours. Many hospitals are full and are refusing new admissions because of uncertainty over oxygen supplies. ""We stand in full solidarity with the Indian people,"" wrote von der Leyen. Janez Lenarcic, European Commissioner for crisis management, tweeted that the EU's emergency response coordination centre is ""ready to provide urgently needed oxygen and medicine"". There have also been offers of support from countries including the UK and the US.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Janhavee MooleBBC Marathi Relatives of Covid patients have been queuing up in cities to refill cylindera For anyone who has watched the pandemic unfold here - from doctors to officials to journalists - this feels like dÃ©jÃ  vu. Seven months ago, the country had grappled with a similaroxygen shortage amid a rapid surge in case numbers. But this time, it's much worse. Typically, healthcare facilities consume about 15% of oxygen supply, leaving the rest for industrial use. But amid India's second wave nearly 90% of the country's oxygen supply - 7,500 metric tonnes daily - is being diverted for medical use, according to Rajesh Bhushan, a senior health official. That's nearly three times higher than was consumed every day at the peak of the first wave in mid-September last year. Then, India was adding about 90,000 cases daily. Just two weeks ago, in early April, the single-day spike was around 144,000. Now, the daily caseload has more than doubled to well more than 300,000. Doctors and epidemiologists believe the deluge of cases is delaying tests and consultation, leading to many people being admitted to hospital when their condition is severe. So the demand for high-flow oxygen - and therefore more oxygen - is higher than it was during the last wave. Read the full story here. More than 20 anti-lockdown scientists and academics have written an open letter calling for face masks and social distancing to end in June. The letter,published in full on the Daily Express website,,externalsays more weight should be given to the success of the vaccines and less to what it calls the ""theoretical"" risk of new variants or a new surge in infections. It also urges the government to scrap plans for vaccine passports, along with mass community testing, in favour of a more targeted approach. The government has already announced it hopes to end all legal limits on social contact in England on 21 June at the earliest and the prime minister has said there is nothing in the data to suggest this will not be the case. But somescientists have suggestedpeople could still be asked to wear face coverings and socially distance for several years as other countries are yet to complete their vaccination programmes. BBC health correspondent Katharine Da Costa says many of the signatories to the letter had previously called for lockdowns to be abolished in favour of shielding the vulnerable, a strategy strongly criticised by the wider scientific community. The UK, the US and other developed countries will start
to have excess vaccines in ""the next three or four months"" which they
can then share with the developing world, according to Billionaire philanthropist
Bill Gates. Speaking earlier to Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, he said: ""Over the balance of the year, the US, the UK and others will be able to make sure that the vaccines are now going to the developing countries."" He added: ""The other good news is that the actual death rate from this epidemic in the poorest countries has actually been quite low."" He said that it was a
""good thing"" that rich countries had been able to vaccinate their
elderly populations as they had generally been harder hit than developing
countries. ""The fact that now we're vaccinating 30-year-olds
in the UK and the US and we don't have all the 60-year-olds in Brazil and South
Africa (vaccinated), that's not fair, but within three or four months the
vaccine allocation will be getting to all the countries that have the very
severe epidemic.""  Some 8,000 spectators will be at Wembley this afternoon forthe Carabao Cupfinal between Manchester City and Tottenham - the biggest attendance at an outdoor sports event in the UK since the first lockdown in March last year. The match, which kicks off at 16:30 BST, is part of the official test programme to work out the best way for big crowds to return to venues. The final was rescheduled from February with the objective of having ""as many supporters in attendance as possible"". A proportion of the tickets have been given to both clubs for the game, while the rest have gone to local residents in Brent and NHS staff. The match is one of nine events across sports and the arts which are being used to provide ""key scientific data and research"" into how events can safely re-open to fans in line with the roadmap out of lockdown. Researchers at the events will ""gather evidence associated with different settings and approaches to managing and mitigating transmission risk"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Extra costs of refurbishing Boris Johnson's Downing Street flat will be met by the prime minister, Liz Truss says Boris Johnson covered the renovation costs for his Downing Street flat ""from his own pocket"", one of his ministers has said. Trade Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC the work is being ""fully declared"". But she did not answer repeated questions on whether a Tory party donor initially provided the money to him. It comes after the PM's former chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, claimed Mr Johnson had a ""possibly illegal"" plan for donors to pay the refurbishment. Labour said questions remained, as details over how the work was paid for had yet to be made public. The government is supposed to publish the list of minister's interests twice a year, but the last one showing money donated to them was released in July 2020.
