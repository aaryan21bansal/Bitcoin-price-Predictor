"Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie died after the incident The initial police response to the incident at a County Tyrone hotel in which three teenagers died is to be investigated by the Police Ombudsman. It has been revealed that the first officers who arrived at the scene of the tragedy withdrew to await support. Morgan Barnard, 17, Lauren Bullock, 17, and Connor Currie, 16,died after a crush at the Greenvale Hotelin Cookstown on 17 March. Hundreds of young people were queuing to get into the St Patrick's Day disco. In pictures: Cookstown victims laid to rest Much loved teens remembered The first police officers arrived at the hotel grounds shortly after receiving a 999 call. ""Following their initial assessment they made attempts to establish more detail and information about what was happening and subsequently withdrew to await further police support,"" said Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin. ""When the first ambulance arrived police moved forward in support of them. It happened at the Greenvale Hotel on St Patrick's Day ""The timing and nature of police actions during this period require further investigation to fully establish the facts. ""The chief constable has therefore decided that the initial police response should be subject to independent scrutiny and it is in the public interest to refer the circumstances and the nature of the actions of the first officers arriving at the scene to the Police Ombudsman."" Thefunerals of the three teenagers were held in Cookstownon Friday. Two men, including the hotel owner Michael McElhatton, were arrested last week on suspicion of manslaughter. Both have since been released on bail. ""The confidence of the families and the confidence of the communities we serve are at the forefront of our minds in our decision to refer this matter to the Police Ombudsman,"" Dep Ch Con Martin said. ""We will work with the ombudsman to support whatever action he undertakes and would ask that people do not speculate or prejudge the outcome of the ombudsman's investigation.""

"Rebecca Kenna is ranked third in the World Women's Snooker rankings A snooker player says she has been forced to turn her back on her local league after being barred from matches because she is a woman.

"A tweet by Ryanair provoked many responses on Twitter A Ryanair attempt to make fun of British Airways on Twitter after a flight mistakenly went to Edinburgh instead of DÃ¼sseldorf has backfired. Ryanair'sofficial Twitter account said,externalit had a ""present"" for BA - a copy of Geography for Dummies. But Twitter users made a number of suggestions of books Ryanair could read, including ""Customer Service for Dummies"". In January Ryanair wasagain named the UK's least-liked short-haul airline. On Monday, a British Airways flight that wassupposed to go to Germanyended up in Scotland after the wrong flight plan was used. Ryanair trolled BA in a tweet that afternoon with the suggested reading material. BA replied to the tweet saying: ""No-one is perfect"". But Twitter users quickly came back with book suggestions lampooning the low-cost airline, including ""Employment Law for Dummies"". In 2018 Ryanair was forced to cancel hundreds of flights after strike action by pilots and staff who were complaining about conditions. The strikescaused disruption for tens of thousands of passengers. In December 2018 the Civil Aviation Authority began legal action against Ryanair after itrefused to pay compensation to passengersover the cancelled and delayed flights. The BA plane went to Edinburgh rather than DÃ¼sseldorf Another commentator, Richard Spaven, referenced a story that first appeared in the Independent on 6 January about aRyanair flight bound for Thessaloniki,externalin Greece. The flight was diverted more than 500 miles away to Timisoara in northwest Romania. Passengers were then offered transport on an ""old bus"" to complete the journey, which many refused, the Independent reported. Eventually the Greek government sent an aircraft to fly the remaining passengers in. Many Twitter users poked fun at Ryanair over its practice of flying to airports that are some way from the supposed destination, for example, flying to Beauvais, which is more than 50 miles north of Paris, instead of an airport closer to the French capital. Twitter user Wayne Kavanagh asked Ryanair how much it was charging BA for the book ""because you not giving it away for free"", a reference to Ryanair's habit of charging customers extra, for example, to print boarding passes. A number of the comments focused on Ryanair's practice of charging customers extra fees In January Ryanair was named the UK's least-liked short-haul airline for the sixth year running after a survey by consumer group Which?. Passengers were not impressed by industrial action, boarding processes, seat comfort, food and drink, and cabin environment, the consumer group said. At the time, Ryanair said passenger numbers had grown 80% in the previous six years, and that reflected what people want ""much more than an unrepresentative survey of just 8,000 people."" British Airways declined to comment for this story. Ryanair would not comment.

"The government has officially responded to the record-breaking petition calling for Brexit to be cancelled, which will be debated by MPs next week. The petition, which haspassed more than 5.75m signatures,has been scheduled for debate on Monday, 1 April along with two other Brexit petitions. Responding, the government said it ""acknowledges the considerable number of people"" who have signed it. But revoking Article 50 would ""break the promises"" made to voters, it said. The petition on the UK Parliament's website - started by retired lecturer Margaret Georgiadou - calls on the government to revoke Article 50, the two-year process which is triggered when a country wants to leave the EU. It is the most-signed petition ever to be submitted on the website. Mrs Georgiadou, 77, responded to a date being set for the debate by calling for more signatures, adding: ""The battle draws nigh again."" Brexit debate: Do petitions ever work? Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Stop Brexit petition tops 5.7m signatures Death threats for Brexit petition woman Any petition which gathers 100,000 signatures or more will be debated by MPs. On Tuesday, the Petitions Committee - which is in charge of considering the petitions submitted - announced that it has been scheduled to be debated in Westminster Hall at 16:30 GMT on Monday. Debates will also take place on two other petitions: One, which has passed 120,000 signatures, calling to hold another EU referendum Another, which has passed 140,000 signatures, calls for the UK to leave the EU with or without a deal on the original Brexit date of 29 March The committee said it decided to combine the three petitions into one single debate to ensure they were debated as soon as possible, ""so they would be less likely to be overtaken by events"". It comes as MPs in the House of Commonsprepare to start voting on alternative Brexit planson Wednesday. Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: What could happen next? The UK had been due to leave the EU on Friday, but both sides have agreed to postpone Brexit until a later date to give the UK more time to either approve Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal deal or decide its next steps. Mrs May's deal - which she negotiated with the EU - has been rejected twice by Parliament. She is considering asking MPs to vote on it for a third time, in the hope that enough of them have changed their minds to get it passed. If MPs pass it, the UK will leave the EU on 22 May with a deal. If it is not passed the government has until 12 April to propose a different way forward to the EU. This video can not be played Hundreds of thousands of people marched in London calling for another EU referendum In its response to the petition, the government's Department for Exiting the European Union said: ""This government will not revoke Article 50. ""We will honour the result of the 2016 referendum and work with Parliament to deliver a deal that ensures we leave the European Union."" The statement said cancelling Brexit and staying in the EU would ""undermine both our democracy and the trust that millions of voters have placed in government. ""The government acknowledges the considerable number of people who have signed this petition. ""However, close to three quarters of the electorate took part in the 2016 referendum, trusting that the result would be respected... 17.4 million people then voted to leave the European Union, providing the biggest democratic mandate for any course of action ever directed at UK Government."" It added: ""Revoking Article 50 would break the promises made by government to the British people, disrespect the clear instruction from a democratic vote, and in turn, reduce confidence in our democracy."" Mrs Georgiadou, whopreviously saidshe had received death threats for creating the petition, tweeted: ""Show your mettle and go garner more votes!"" Allow Twitter content?

"Police said Callin Wilson showed an ""abhorrent lack of respect for the life of another human being"" A 20-year-old man has been told he will spend at least nine years in prison for killing a Syrian man in Belfast. Callin Wilson, of no fixed abode, was 18 when he murdered Hazem Ahmed Ghreir, 30, in the city centre in 2017. Police said they believed the ""public-spirited Syrian man was trying to prevent a crime from taking place"". Mr Ghreir was stabbed in the heart after approaching Wilson who appeared to be tampering with a bicycle, Belfast Crown Court heard. Det Ch Insp Pete Montgomery said Wilson showed an ""abhorrent lack of respect for the life of another human being"". ""As Hazem lay on the ground dying, Callin Wilson then rifled through his pockets and stole his mobile phone before fleeing the scene,"" he said. This video can not be played CCTV footage of Wilson walking into shop minutes after killing ""To stab someone in the chest for no obvious reason and then steal their belongings as they lie dying in the street is something that most of us will find hard to comprehend."" Sentencing Wilson, who had pleaded guilty to the murder in January, Judge Smyth said Mr Ghreir had ""sought to intervene"" in a ""public-spirited way"". The judge told Laganside Court on Tuesday that Wilson had shown signs of a serious mental disorder. She said Wilson had an infatuation with knives and strangled a teacher with a wire while at school. Hazem Ahmed Ghreir came to Northern Ireland to escape war in his native Syria The judge asked how Wilson could have slipped through the net, for his own safety and that of others. He was also sentenced to 12 months after admitting 20 counts of charges relating to indecent images of children. This will run concurrently as part of his prison sentence. He will spend at least nine years in jail before being considered for release. Mr Ghreir had moved to Northern Ireland and was living with his brother in Carrickfergus when he was killed. He was working as a delivery driver for a fast-food restaurant when he disturbed Wilson near Belfast's Dublin Road on 4 June 2017. Police said Wilson was arrested a short distance way in a shop, only a few minutes after he had fatally stabbed Mr Ghreir. Det Ch Insp Montgomery said: ""Hazem's brave actions have tragically cost him his life. ""He was originally from Syria and he moved to Northern Ireland hoping for a better life where he could feel safe. ""Sadly, it was in Northern Ireland that his life was cruelly cut short by a single stab wound to the heart."" Rami Ghreir said he missed his brother every day Speaking after the sentencing, Mr Ghreir's brother, Rami Ghreir, said ""people were drawn to him like a magnet"". ""He was a good person, hard working, and when he came here he was very happy,"" he said. ""After running from my country and that war, he thought we would have a good life here. ""I lost him and I miss him every day."" Rami Ghreir said his youngest brother had been keen to make something of his life. ""Before the accident happened, about 20 minutes before, he spoke with my mum and told her 'I got a job and I start working'... or any time he did something, he would call our father and tell him 'Dad, I got my driver's licence, Dad I passed the English class'.""

"This video can not be played How US university admissions are broken Yale University has revoked the admission of a student whose family is accused of spending $1.2m (Â£907,000) in a bribery scheme to ensure admittance. An ex-football coach allegedly accepted a $400,000 bribe to fraudulently mark the non-athletic student as a recruit. The case is linked to the same cheating scandal that snared celebrity parents Lori Laughlin and Felicity Huffman earlier this month. The elite college in Connecticut said it was investigating the matter. Women's football coach Rudy Meredith, who resigned last November, was one of 50 individuals charged in the alleged college admissions scam. Theuniversity's website states,externalthat Mr Meredith is believed to have ""provided fraudulent athletic endorsements to two applicants only; one was denied admission despite the endorsement, and the other was admitted"". Yale will not name the student whose admission has been rescinded, but the university confirmed the case on Monday. Dr Dre removes university boast post The Ivy League university, along with other top schools like the University of Southern California, Stanford and Georgetown, were targeted in the scam allegedly organised by mastermind Rick Singer. The alleged scheme involved helping students cheat on entrance exams, as well as getting non-athletic students admitted on fake athletic scholarships. Mr Singer was reportedly paid $1.2m by the Yale student's family to facilitate the bribe to Mr Meredith in 2017. The two had been working together on bribery scams since around 2015,according to court documents,external. Mr Singer sent Mr Meredith a copy of the student's CV around November 2017, noting he would ""revise"" the applicant's art portfolio to ""soccer"". FBI uncovers celebrity exam cheat plot Celebrity parents and the bizarre 'cheating' scandal US actresses sued in college cheating scam Mr Meredith would later mark the applicant as a recruit for his team, ""despite the fact that, as he knew at the time, [the student] did not play competitive soccer"". Once the student was admitted in 2018, Mr Meredith received the $400,000 cheque from Mr Singer, prosecutors say. Last year, Mr Meredith was caught by the FBI reportedly demanding another bribe, of $450,000, to designate an applicant as an athletic recruit for Yale. He is expected to appear in court later this week. The celebrities involved in Mr Singer's scheme, as well as the targeted schools,are now facing lawsuits from parents and students.

"There are winners (left - ashy mining bee) and losers (right - red-shanked carder bee) A third of British wild bees and hoverflies are in decline, according to a new study. If current trends continue, some species will be lost from Britain altogether, the scientists say. The study found ""winners"" and ""losers"" among hundreds of wild bees and hoverflies, which pollinate food crops and other plants. Common species are winning out at the expense of rarer ones, with an overall picture of biodiversity being lost. Scientists warn that the loss of nature could create problems in years to come, including the ability to grow food crops. World's biggest bee found alive Five key things about the extinction crisis Winner: Lobe-spurred furrow bee. Once a rare species, the data suggests a five-fold increase since 1980 Winner: Tree bumblebee. Colonised mainland Britain in 2001. Since then it has been spreading rapidly The study looked at trends in 353 wild bees and hoverflies in Scotland, England and Wales over 33 years from 1980. A third of species experienced declines in terms of areas where they were found, while about 10% became more abundant, including bees that pollinate flowering crops, such as oil seed rape. While some pollination is carried out by honeybees in hives, much of the pollination of food crops and wild plants is carried out by their wild relatives and other insects, especially hoverflies. Dr Gary Powney of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, said while the increase in key crop pollinators is ""good news"", species have declined overall. ""It would be risky to rely on this group to support the long-term food security for our country,"" he said. ""If anything happens to them in the future, there will be fewer other species to step up and fulfil the essential role of crop pollination."" The losses were concentrated among the rarer, specialised species. Dr Nick Isaac, also of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, said this was ""particularly bad news if you're interested in wildlife and in conservation"". The ""losers"" include solitary bees, which live in burrows in the ground, and upland bees, living on mountains and moorlands. Among the ""winners"" are 22 of the most important crop pollinators. Loser: Smooth-gastered furrow bee. Found in southern areas, visiting blackthorn flowers in spring. Figures suggest a decline of 40% Loser: Large shaggy bee. Found in coastal regions of Southern England and Wales, the species has declined by more than 54% Experts say the increase in some common species is set against a background of an overall loss of diversity. ""Every square kilometre in the UK has lost an average of 11 species of bee and hoverfly, between 1980 and 2013, according to the new analysis,"" said Dr Lynn Dicks of the University of East Anglia. She said the pattern of biodiversity loss is happening everywhere we look. ""It's a process of homogenisation and leaves us with a natural world that is far poorer and less resilient to change."" New order of insects sets up home in UK Cricket's summer song making a comeback 100 new insect species discovered Matt Shardlow, chief executive of the charity Buglife, said the new paper provides further evidence that our pollinators are in trouble and that the health of our environment and food supply cannot be taken for granted. ""Solitary bees, rare bees and bees and hoverflies that live in the uplands are in particular trouble and need urgent help,"" he said. The research is based on analysis of more than 700,000 records from volunteers recording the presence or absence of insects in their area. This gives a measure of whether the ranges of insect pollinators are getting smaller or larger, however it does not look at drivers for this change. The scientists think habitat loss is likely key. Other possible factors include climate change - which could be having an impact on upland and northern species. They say the relative success of some species could be due to environmental measures put in place by farmers, such as sowing wildflower strips. Or this might be because much more oilseed rape is grown now than in 1980. Another factor is the use of insecticides. The scientists said it remained to be seen how pollinators might have been affected by restrictions introduced since the study was carried out. In 2013, the European Union introduced a temporary ban on the widespread use of insecticides known as neonicotinoids in light of evidence suggesting they harmed bees. Last year, the ban on three of the main neonicotinoid types was made permanent, andwas widenedto cover all crops grown outdoors. The researchers say actions such as wildlife-friendly farming and gardening can have a positive impact on pollinators in both towns and the countryside. They echoed previous calls for gardeners to encourage pollinating insects by growing patches of wild plants and weeds. The loss of insects has far-reaching consequences for entire ecosystems. Insects provide a food source for many birds, amphibians, bats and reptiles, while plants rely on insects for pollination. A recentscientific reviewof insect numbers around the world suggested that 40% of species were undergoing ""dramatic rates of decline"", with bees, ants and beetles disappearing eight times faster than mammals, birds or reptiles. Previous studies have found losses of butterflies, moths, beetles, bees and hoverflies across the UK. The study is published in the journalNature Communications,external.

"A judge in Londonderry said he believed groups of professional beggars were flying into NI on a shift basis A district judge in Londonderry has warned professional street beggars are taking advantage of the ""generous and good nature of the local people in this community"". Barney McElholm made the comments on Monday when sentencing Florica Crina Ispas from Romania. The 30 year old was jailed for two months for stealing a bottle of vodka. Judge McElholm said he believed she was part of a group who flew into Northern Ireland every six weeks. He said he did not believe she was a genuine indigent street beggar, as she had claimed following her arrest. Instead, he said he believed the defendant was ""a member of a professional gang of street beggars who could afford to fly into and out of Northern Ireland every six weeks, on a shift basis, to beg."" Judge McElholm said: ""I don't believe a single word of what she has said and I am going to take a tough line in such cases in future."" He went on: ""I know what help is offered to genuine homeless people. They have been offered accommodation, they have been advised as to what benefits they may be entitled to and if they are truly indigent they would receive offers of support. ""These people are doing a great disservice to people who are genuinely homeless. ""They are simply a professional group coming here to street beg and to take advantage of the generous and good nature of the local people in this community."" Judge Barney McElholm told Londonderry Magistrates' Court he would ""take a tough line in such cases in future"" Judge McElholm said he had met police and Derry's City Centre Initiative recently to discuss the issue of street begging. PSNI Chief Inspector Johnny Hunter said street begging was among a number of issues discussed by civic stakeholders at that meeting. ""Issues such as public alcohol consumption and begging are dealt with on a daily basis in co-operation with our partners,"" he said. ""Where those people we find on the street are vulnerable and in need of help, we will work with our partner agencies to keep them safe."" He said local officers also worked closely with colleagues in the Modern Slavery Human Trafficking Unit. ""Where there is evidence of exploitation or of other offences we will take the necessary appropriate action,"" he said. Ch Insp Hunter said street begging ""is dealt with in a sensitive and proactive manner by police and the appropriate agencies.""

"Ms Dugdale said she had often encountered homophobia as a gay politician A tweet sent by pro-independence blogger Stuart Campbell was homophobic because it ""considers gay people to be lesser"", former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has told a court. Mr Campbell is suing Ms Dugdale for defamation after her newspaper column described the tweet as homophobic. Ms Dugdale said she had a responsibility as a gay politician to ""call out"" homophobia. And she said it remains her ""honest view"" that the tweet was homophobic. Ms Dugdale was giving evidence during the second day of a hearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. BBC Scotland's Phil Sim has been live tweeting from the court,external Kezia Dugdale's homophobia claim 'absurd' The case centres on a tweet posted by Mr Campbell, who blogs as Wings Over Scotland, during the Scottish Conservative conference on 3 March 2017. Mr Campbell, who is seeking Â£25,000 in damages, wrote that Conservative MSP Oliver Mundell ""is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner"". Mr Mundell's father, Scottish Secretary David Mundell, had announced in January of the previous year that he was gay. Mr Campbell is Scotland's most prominent pro-independence blogger In a subsequent Daily Record column, Ms Dugdale said she was ""shocked and appalled"" by the ""homophobic tweets"" from Mr Campbell, who she said ""spouts hatred and homophobia towards others"" from his Twitter account. She later raised the issue at First Minister's Questions in the Scottish Parliament, where she said her column had ""called out Mr Campbell for his homophobic comments"" and urged SNP MSPs to shun him. In her evidence to the court, Ms Dugdale said that a ""healthy democracy"" should have a range of views, but that Mr Campbell's tweet crossed the line into discrimination as it ""considered gay people to be lesser because they can't have children"" - something which she said was not the case.

She added that she had, as a gay woman, encountered homophobia in a number of forms, and that it remains her ""honest"" view that Mr Campbell's tweet was homophobic. And she said ""people are entitled to their view of what is homophobic"", and that as a gay woman she has the right to hold a view on whether something is homophobic. Ms Dugdale also insisted that it was only Mr Campbell's tweet that she had described as homophobic, and that ""I've never called him a homophobe"". The Labour MSP was the only witness to give evidence on Tuesday, but the case will call again on Wednesday morning for further legal submissions to be made. David Mundell had been expected to appear as a witness, but was excused by the court after he said he could not attend ""due to Brexit"". Paul Kavanagh - who blogs as Wee Ginger Dug - said the tweet was crass and tasteless, but not homophobic On Monday, Mr Campbell told the court that he had been ""absolutely horrified"" to have been accused of homophobia by Ms Dugdale. He said the tweet was intended as ""satirical criticism"" of Scottish Conservative MSP Oliver Mundell's public speaking skills, and that anyone who considered it to be homophobic was either ""dishonest or stupid"". Mr Campbell, who lives in Bath in Somerset, said: ""I don't believe any intelligent person could honestly interpret that tweet as homophobic, given what it said."" He added that he was a ""firm advocate of equal rights for gay people"", and that anyone who had read his Twitter feed or website would find it ""ludicrous"" to think he was homophobic. His position was backed by fellow pro-independence blogger Paul Kavanagh, who blogs as Wee Ginger Dug and came out as gay in the 1980s. Mr Kavanagh said: ""(The tweet) was crass, it was tasteless, it was insulting. It was meant to be all those things. ""It didn't contain the sentiment that lesbian and gay people are less entitled to equality and that's why I believe it wasn't homophobic."" Mr Kavanagh also said that unionist politicians view Mr Campbell as ""Satan"", and said being regarded as homophobic would ""destroy your credibility"" as a blogger. But another witness, Stonewall Scotland director Colin Macfarlane, told the court he agreed with Ms Dugdale that Mr Campbell's tweet was homophobic. He said: ""I think it was wholly unnecessary to reference David Mundell's sexual orientation when the tweet was purported to be about Oliver Mundell's public speaking abilities."" Mr Macfarlane said the tweet used ""sexual orientation as the punchline"", which showed a negative attitude towards gay people.

"Lights went out and mobile phone and television services were disrupted in Caracas Venezuela's government has told workers and students to stay at home as the country faces a second day without electricity. Hospitals, public transport, water and other services have been affected. The capital, Caracas, was first plunged into darkness on Monday. Power was restored four hours later, before a second blackout struck. A days-longnationwide power cut earlier this month prompted lootingand desperation in parts of the country. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government blames the power cuts on an ""attack"" by the opposition, led by Juan GuaidÃ³. The opposition cites two decades of underinvestment and corruption by the socialist government as the cause of the power outage. ""Nothing is working,"" Yendresca Munoz, a 34-year-old bank analyst living in Caracas told Reuters news agency. ""During blackout days you can't do anything at all. There's no internet, no access to cash."" Other big cities, including Barquisimeto, Maracaibo in the west of the country, have also been reportedly affected. Why Venezuela's military is backing Maduro Venezuela's political crisis explained Will the US target Venezuelan oil? On Twitter, Mr GuaidÃ³ said: ""When our people need certainty in the middle of another unsettling blackout, how can they go on repeating excuses of an 'electricity war' and sabotage?"" Since January, the opposition leader has been locked in a power struggle with Mr Maduro's government, which is grappling with a severe economic crisis. Last week, Mr GuaidÃ³'s chief of staff was arrested on terrorism charges in another escalation of the political crisis. Power first went down in Caracas around 13:20 (17:20 GMT) on Monday, causing chaos in the city's public transport system as the metro shut down and many thousands of people had to stream home on foot or by bus. The metro closure in Caracas forced people to take crowded buses Electricity was restored about four hours later but cut out again at 21:50, Information Minister Jorge RodrÃ­guez was quoted as saying by Efe news agency. He had gone on state TV earlier to repeat the now-familiar assertion that opposition sabotage rather than a lack of maintenance had caused the afternoon blackout, saying hackers had attacked computers at the country's main hydroelectric dam. The minister boasted that the first power cut had been fixed in ""record time"". Since the second outage, power has still not been restored. Because of the problems with the power supply, TV viewers could only see a garbled picture when Mr RodrÃ­guez went live on air, a correspondent for the UK's Guardian newspaper tweeted from Caracas.

Meanwhile, Brazil's mines and energy minister Bento Albuquerque said that since 7 March, Venezuela has failed to fulfil its contract to supply electricity to the northern Brazilian state of Roraima. He said Brazil was working to start building a transmission line to connect Roraima to the rest of the Brazilian power grid in the second half of the year for completion in 2021, so that it was not reliant on Venezuela. He added that Brazil would also seek public contracts for renewable energy, such as wind and solar, as another alternative to Venezuela's supply.

"There is a very strange mood around the place in Westminster, ahead of what could be a very messy and tricky day tomorrow. MPs will spend much of Wednesday voting on different versions of Brexit. But the government is even at odds with itself over whether they should be given free rein to do so. One source told me 19 ministers are ready to quit if they aren't allowed to have their say which could, of course hypothetically at least, collapse the government itself. Alistair Burt, who quit his ministerial post last night,said on the record this afternoonthat there were ""enough"" colleagues still with their bums on government seats who might act if the prime minister was pushed to again consider no deal by the Brexiteer wing of the party. MPs set out plan to test Brexit options But one member of the cabinet said this afternoon that the government would have to whip the votes tomorrow, even if they were only an indication of a way forward. The thinking being if you don't, you make it even harder to gather up all the different factions for another run at the meaningful vote - the thumbs up or thumbs down to the prime minister's deal that she wants to bring back to Parliament as soon as possible, maybe this Thursday. It seems right now there is disagreement in the political machine over just about every single issue, making government seem like a never-ending series of question marks. Ministers are even wondering aloud that ""no one seems to be doing anything"", frustrated that Theresa May is keeping the circle around her tighter than ever before, and that's saying something. Expectation is building that the prime minister could announce a date for her departure in a meeting with her MPs tomorrow - a final throw of the dice to try to get her deal over the line. But one MP who has discussed it with a member of the inner circle suggests there is just no way she'll do that. It is also still possible the prime minister will have a third go at getting her deal through the Commons this week, maybe even grabbing an unlikely victory from the jaws of defeat. Just at a time when the country might want our politicians to be acting together, the different tribes in Westminster don't seem like they're part of the same conversation. With the prime minister strangely seeming apart from it all. This afternoon I asked one of her close aides what she might do next - they replied ""why don't you ask Oliver Letwin, he seems to have all the bright ideas"". The next 72 hours could be the moment when suddenly a conclusion snaps together. But anyone being able to pull any of this all together seems a tall order indeed.

"'No meme is illegal': Protests were held against the copyright law changes Copyright laws which critics say could change the internet have been voted in by the European Parliament. The new rules, including the controversial Article 13, will hold tech firms responsible for material posted without copyright permission. Sharing memes and GIFs will still be allowed under the new laws. Many musicians and creators say the legislation will compensate artists fairly - but others argue that they will destroy user-generated content. Copyright is the legal right that allows an artist to protect how their original work is used. Tech companies have argued that artists are already paid fairly under the current system. Google said it would ""harm Europe's creative and digital industries"". What is the controversial Article 13? Why Europe's original copyright plan was so controversial High-profile figures who have campaigned against the EU Copyright Directive include Wyclef Jean and web inventor Sir Tim Berners Lee, while Debbie Harry and Sir Paul McCartney have been among its supporters. Web pioneer Sir Tim Berners-Lee has warned about the possible consequences of copyright changes It has taken several revisions for the current legislation, which was was backed by 348 MEPs, with 274 against, to reach its final form. It is now up to member states to approve the decision. If they do, they will have two years to implement it once it is officially published. The two clauses causing the most controversy are known as Article 11 and Article 13. Article 11 states that search engines and news aggregate platforms should pay to use links from news websites. Article 13 holds larger technology companies responsible for material posted without a copyright licence. Tech companies already remove music and videos which are copyrighted, but under the new laws they will be more liable for any copyrighted content. It means they would need to apply filters to content before it is uploaded. Article 13 does not include cloud storage services and there are already existing exemptions, including parody, which, for example, includes memes. It was Article 13 which prompted fears over the future of memes and GIFs - stills, animated or short video clips that go viral -  since they mainly rely on copyrighted scenes from TV and film. Critics claimed Article 13 would have made it nearly impossible to upload even the tiniest part of a copyrighted work to Facebook, YouTube, or any other site. However, specific tweaks to the law made earlier this year made memes safe ""for purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody and pastiche"". The European Parliament said that memes would be ""specifically excluded"" from the directive, although it was unclear how tech firms would be able to enforce that rule with a blanket filter. This Getty stock image became the ""distracted boyfriend"" meme MEP for London Mary Honeyball said: ""There's no problem with memes at all. This directive was never intended to stop memes and mashups. ""I think that's doom-mongering. People who carry out their business properly have nothing to worry about at all."" Robert Ashcroft, chief executive of PRS for Music, which collects royalties for music artists, welcomed the directive as ""a massive step forward"" for consumers and creatives. ""It's about making sure that ordinary people can upload videos and music to platforms like YouTube without being held liable for copyright - that responsibility will henceforth be transferred to the platforms,"" he said. However the campaign group Open Knowledge International described it as ""a massive blow"" for the internet. ""We now risk the creation of a more closed society at the very time we should be using digital advances to build a more open world where knowledge creates power for the many, not the few,"" said chief executive Catherine Stihler.

Google said that while the latest version of the directive was improved, there remained ""legal uncertainty"". ""The details matter and we look forward to working with policy-makers, publishers, creators and rights holders, as EU member states move to implement these new rules,"" it said. Kathy Berry, senior lawyer at Linklaters, said more detail was required about how Article 13 would be enforced. ""While Article 13 may have noble aims, in its current form it functions as little more than a set of ideals, with very little guidance on exactly which service providers will be caught by it or what steps will be sufficient to comply,"" she said. European Parliament Rapporteur Axel Voss said the legislation was designed to protect people's livelihoods. ""This directive is an important step towards correcting a situation which has allowed a few companies to earn huge sums of money without properly remunerating the thousands of creatives and journalists whose work they depend on,"" he said. ""It helps make the internet ready for the future, a space which benefits everyone, not only a powerful few."" What is the controversial Article 13?

"Studies suggest that biorhythms are disrupted by changing the clocks The European Parliament has backed a proposal to stop the obligatory one-hour clock change which extends daylight hours in summer EU-wide. The proposal requires states to stop the twice-yearly clock change,externalfrom 2021, and choose either permanent summer time or winter time. Ministers will also have a say on this. Under an EU directive, all 28 states currently switch to summer time on the last Sunday of March and back to winter time on the last Sunday of October. The European Commission - in charge of drafting EU legislation - made the proposal last year, after a public consultation which showed 84% of respondents wanting to scrap the biannual clock changes. There were 4.6 million replies in that consultation, 70% of which were from Germans. But MEPs and the Commission stress that states must co-ordinate their choices, to minimise the risk of economic disruption from a patchwork of different time systems. Daylight saving time (DST) - so-called summer time - has been compulsory in the EU since 2001, aimed at making the EU internal market work more smoothly and reducing energy costs. Fewer time differences, it was argued, would facilitate cross-border trade and travel in the EU. The extra daylight hours in summer could reduce spending on artificial lighting and help outdoor leisure activities. But the energy savings from DST have proven to be quite marginal. And some of the EU's major trading partners - among them China, Russia and Turkey - do not operate under DST. The consultation and scientific studies suggested that the clock changes were having negative effects on people's health. The EU Commission says studies suggest ""the effect on the human biorhythm may be more severe than previously thought"". Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said ""there is no applause when EU law dictates that Europeans have to change the clocks twice a year. ""Clock-changing must stop. Member states should themselves decide whether their citizens live in summer or winter time."" Under the new legislation, governments opting to make summer time permanent would adjust their clocks for the last time on the last Sunday in March 2021. For those choosing permanent standard time - also called winter time - the final clock change would be on the last Sunday of October 2021. Changing clocks: a waste of time? How time zones confused the world How do countries swap time zones? Why daylight saving time riles the US Finland called for daylight saving to be abolished EU-wide, after a petition gathered more than 70,000 signatures from citizens calling for such a change. Opposition to the clock changes tends to be greater in northern countries, where seasonal differences in daylight hours are greater than in the south. In June, Finland has 18.5 hours of daylight, but in December only 5.5 hours. The corresponding figures for Greece are 14.5 hours and 9.3 hours. Yet both countries are in the same standard time zone - Eastern European Time (GMT+2). During the winter, spring and autumn, when DST is not applied, there are three standard time zones: Three states apply GMT (the UK, Ireland and Portugal) 17 have Central European Time, which is GMT+1 Eight have Eastern European Time, which is GMT+2.

"This video can not be played The two sides in the Jussie Smollett case Prosecutors have dropped all charges against US actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly staging a racist and homophobic attack. The Empire star attended a court hearing in Chicago on Tuesday, where a judge sealed the case. Mr Smollett, 36, pleaded not guilty this month to 16 counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly lying to police. The city's mayor denounced the prosecutors' decision to drop the charges as a ""whitewash of justice"". Mr Smollett told reporters after his court appearance: ""I have been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one. ""I would not be my mother's son if I was capable of one drop of what I've been accused of."" Jussie Smollett: A complete timeline 'Pain and anger' over Jussie Smollett The office of Cook County State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx said in a statement: ""After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr Smollett's volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case."" It remains unclear why prosecutors dropped the charges against Mr Smollett. Chicago police Supt Eddie Johnson said he was not briefed on the decision to drop the charges. Though police provide the state's attorney office with evidence, it is ultimately up to prosecutors whether to pursue a case. Mr Smollett voluntarily agreed to give up his $10,000 (Â£7,500) bail money, his lawyer said, emphasising there had been no deal with state prosecutors. This video can not be played Jussie Smollett: What Chicago Police say happened Supt Johnson said in a news conference on Tuesday that he felt justice had not been served and ""the city is still owed an apology"". ""If someone falsely accused me I would never hide behind a brokered deal and secrecy,"" he told reporters. ""At the end of the day it was Mr Smollett who committed this hoax. Period."" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel accused Mr Smollett of fabricating a hate crime ""all in the name of self-promotion"", adding that he took ""no sense of ownership of what he's done"". The mayor added the case would cast a shadow over genuine hate crimes as they decide whether to come forward. The murder that changed America Mr Smollett's attorneys, Tina Glandian and Patricia Brown Holmes, said in a statement their client's record ""has been wiped clean"". ""He was a victim who was vilified and made to appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks made to the public causing an inappropriate rush to judgement,"" the lawyers said. ""Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted actions. The entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion."" This video can not be played Jussie Smollett: ""I have been truthful since day one"" Mr Smollett's family said in a statement to US media on Tuesday that the actor had suffered a ""heartbreaking"" ordeal. ""Jussie is a son, a brother, a partner, a champion for human rights, and a genuine soul who would never be capable of what he was falsely accused of,"" said their statement. ""He was the victim of an assault and then falsely blamed for his own attack. This morning truth has prevailed and he has been vindicated."" Mr Smollett stars as a gay musician on Fox's drama series Empire, which follows the ups and downs of a family-owned hip-hop label. The verified Twitter account of the writers' team on Empire posted a celebratory tweet after Mr Smollett's court appearance. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Smollett said he was attacked in the early hours on 29 January in downtown Chicago outside a sandwich shop by two masked men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs, poured bleach on him and put a rope round his neck. He claimed they shouted: ""This is Maga country"", a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" campaign slogan, and that at least one of the assailants was white. But Chicago police said Mr Smollett had paid two brothers, both of whom are black, $3,500 to stage the attack because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"" on the TV show. Jussie Smollett: 'I'm the gay Tupac' His lawyer maintained outside court on Tuesday that the cheque was for nutrition and physical training. Ms Holmes also alleged that brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, who apologised for ""their involvement in this situation"" earlier this month, were Mr Smollett's attackers. ""We already know who attacked him,"" the lawyer told reporters. ""The two brothers have said that they attacked him."" Authorities had also accused Mr Smollett of sending a racist and homophobic letter to himself at a Fox studio beforehand. The US president lashed out last month at the actor on Twitter for his ""racist and dangerous comments"".

"Rebecca Kenna is ranked third in the World Women's Snooker rankings A snooker player says she has been forced to turn her back on her local league after being barred from matches because she is a woman. Rebecca Kenna felt ""abandoned"" after being stopped from playing in two fixtures due to some clubs in Keighley operating a ""men-only"" policy. Mrs Kenna, 30, who is ranked third in the World Women's Snooker rankings, wants to see the rule scrapped. The league said ""there's nothing we can do to overturn the decisions"". Mrs Kenna,who spoke to the BBC's One Show, said: ""To be told you can't play the sport you love because of your gender is ridiculous and it's quite upsetting. ""When we were playing [these teams] I would just have to stay at home."" Latest news and stories from across Yorkshire She said she had approached the organising committee of the Crosshills And District Snooker League asking it to step in. ""I think we should make it so these 'men-only' clubs are not allowed into the league if they are not going to let women play,"" she added. Both Rebecca Kenna (left) and Reanne Evans said they had been barred from matches for being female Mrs Kenna said Keighley was not the only place in the UK where women struggle to compete equally. Reanne Evans, 11-times women's world snooker champion,told BBC Radio 4 in February she had previously been refused entry to a snooker hall for the same reason. ""There are others on the women's tour who are not even allowed in to their local league,"" Mrs Kenna said. ""Others have said this was what happened in the 80s and 90s but not any more. I think it's time Keighley moved with the times.""

"Amanda Cunningham, who lives near Burnley, says she's lost her life savings ""Basically it will mean that my son will not have money for his future"". The depressing reality for Amanda Cunningham, and thousands of others, is that a lifetime of savings have been mostly wiped out, almost overnight. She is one of 11,605 people who invested a total of Â£236m with London Capital and Finance PLC (LCF). It collapsed into administration in January following an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) into misleading advertising. ""He [her son] suffers with autism, I don't even know if he'll be able to hold down a job. That money was there to give him the life he should have,"" Amanda says. ""I can't afford to keep him forever and if anything happens to me that money was there for his future"". She had spent decades saving up thousands of pounds. ""That money to me is lost, I can never see me being able to save that amount of money in my lifetime again. ""I won't be able to afford the extra help for my son. ""If anything happens to me and he has to go into assisted living then there's no money for that now."" LCF promised returns of 8% for people investing for more than three years The FCA, the UK's financial regulator, first raised questions about LCF's advertising, much of it done online and via social media, in December 2018. LCF was offering rates of around 8% on three year mini-bonds, which are high-risk investments. But investors say they believed they were putting their money into safe, secure fixed-rate ISAs, so the FCA ordered LCF to withdraw its marketing. Following further investigation the FCA then froze LCF's assets later that month, then in late January the company collapsed into administration. Many people who put money in to LCF were first-time investors - inheritance recipients, small business owners or newly retired. The company's administrators, Smith and Williamson, has now published its proposals about what it thinks is the best way for investors to get as much of their money back as possible. Finbarr O'Connell, one of the administrators, told BBC Radio 4's Money Box that he hopes to recover about 20% of the Â£236m that people had invested with the firm. However, he added that it would probably take at least two years before people saw any of that money. ""They [investors] thought this was a safe option, they were comfortable their capital was safe and they thought they would get a good rate of interest so they're completely devastated,"" he says. Administrator Finbarr O'Connell says he's hoping to be able to recover about 20% of investors' money ""We have some real, but complex assets, to realise. They could take up to two years to turn into cash. ""The plan is that we continue in hot pursuit of the money and of the assets."" The Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which is also investigating LCF, says it has arrested four people, who have all been released pending further investigation. The names of the people arrested have not been confirmed yet, which is standard practice for the SFO. Questions are being asked in Parliament too about what the FCA knew - and when - about possible misleading marketing. Nicky Morgan MP, chair of Parliament's Treasury Committee, has written to the FCA's chief executive asking what it knew about possible concerns over LCF's advertising and, crucially, when. Several independent financial advisers have said they warned the FCA, some as far back as 2015, about what they felt were ""misleading, inaccurate and not clear"" adverts, often promoted on social media. For its part the FCA has released a statement saying its immediate priority is to ""investigate and assist in the recovery of any assets. We will then be looking into this matter carefully and will consider what lessons can be learned"". Andy Thomson, the chief executive of LCF, has not responded to requests for comment.

"There are winners (left - ashy mining bee) and losers (right - red-shanked carder bee) A third of British wild bees and hoverflies are in decline, according to a new study. If current trends continue, some species will be lost from Britain altogether, the scientists say. The study found ""winners"" and ""losers"" among hundreds of wild bees and hoverflies, which pollinate food crops and other plants. Common species are winning out at the expense of rarer ones, with an overall picture of biodiversity being lost. Scientists warn that the loss of nature could create problems in years to come, including the ability to grow food crops. World's biggest bee found alive Five key things about the extinction crisis Winner: Lobe-spurred furrow bee. Once a rare species, the data suggests a five-fold increase since 1980 Winner: Tree bumblebee. Colonised mainland Britain in 2001. Since then it has been spreading rapidly The study looked at trends in 353 wild bees and hoverflies in Scotland, England and Wales over 33 years from 1980. A third of species experienced declines in terms of areas where they were found, while about 10% became more abundant, including bees that pollinate flowering crops, such as oil seed rape. While some pollination is carried out by honeybees in hives, much of the pollination of food crops and wild plants is carried out by their wild relatives and other insects, especially hoverflies. Dr Gary Powney of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, said while the increase in key crop pollinators is ""good news"", species have declined overall. ""It would be risky to rely on this group to support the long-term food security for our country,"" he said. ""If anything happens to them in the future, there will be fewer other species to step up and fulfil the essential role of crop pollination."" The losses were concentrated among the rarer, specialised species. Dr Nick Isaac, also of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, said this was ""particularly bad news if you're interested in wildlife and in conservation"". The ""losers"" include solitary bees, which live in burrows in the ground, and upland bees, living on mountains and moorlands. Among the ""winners"" are 22 of the most important crop pollinators. Loser: Smooth-gastered furrow bee. Found in southern areas, visiting blackthorn flowers in spring. Figures suggest a decline of 40% Loser: Large shaggy bee. Found in coastal regions of Southern England and Wales, the species has declined by more than 54% Experts say the increase in some common species is set against a background of an overall loss of diversity. ""Every square kilometre in the UK has lost an average of 11 species of bee and hoverfly, between 1980 and 2013, according to the new analysis,"" said Dr Lynn Dicks of the University of East Anglia. She said the pattern of biodiversity loss is happening everywhere we look. ""It's a process of homogenisation and leaves us with a natural world that is far poorer and less resilient to change."" New order of insects sets up home in UK Cricket's summer song making a comeback 100 new insect species discovered Matt Shardlow, chief executive of the charity Buglife, said the new paper provides further evidence that our pollinators are in trouble and that the health of our environment and food supply cannot be taken for granted. ""Solitary bees, rare bees and bees and hoverflies that live in the uplands are in particular trouble and need urgent help,"" he said. The research is based on analysis of more than 700,000 records from volunteers recording the presence or absence of insects in their area. This gives a measure of whether the ranges of insect pollinators are getting smaller or larger, however it does not look at drivers for this change. The scientists think habitat loss is likely key. Other possible factors include climate change - which could be having an impact on upland and northern species. They say the relative success of some species could be due to environmental measures put in place by farmers, such as sowing wildflower strips. Or this might be because much more oilseed rape is grown now than in 1980. Another factor is the use of insecticides. The scientists said it remained to be seen how pollinators might have been affected by restrictions introduced since the study was carried out. In 2013, the European Union introduced a temporary ban on the widespread use of insecticides known as neonicotinoids in light of evidence suggesting they harmed bees. Last year, the ban on three of the main neonicotinoid types was made permanent, andwas widenedto cover all crops grown outdoors. The researchers say actions such as wildlife-friendly farming and gardening can have a positive impact on pollinators in both towns and the countryside. They echoed previous calls for gardeners to encourage pollinating insects by growing patches of wild plants and weeds. The loss of insects has far-reaching consequences for entire ecosystems. Insects provide a food source for many birds, amphibians, bats and reptiles, while plants rely on insects for pollination. A recentscientific reviewof insect numbers around the world suggested that 40% of species were undergoing ""dramatic rates of decline"", with bees, ants and beetles disappearing eight times faster than mammals, birds or reptiles. Previous studies have found losses of butterflies, moths, beetles, bees and hoverflies across the UK. The study is published in the journalNature Communications,external.

"This video can not be played Potholes: NI motorists receive over Â£1m since 2016 Compensation paid to drivers in Northern Ireland whose vehicles were damaged by potholes and other road defects has more than doubled in the last two years. The amount of compensation rose from Â£321,849 in 2016 to Â£751,926 in 2018. The figures were obtained by BBC News NI under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. It comes as a public spending watchdog warned it would cost more than Â£1bn to deal with structural maintenance. A public spending watchdog has raised concerns about the impact of funding shortfalls on Northern Ireland's roads The Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO) has published a report highlighting how a lack of investment is having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Ireland's road network. Â£495k compensation payments over potholes Is our pothole problem getting worse? Pothole photos: Your pictures of crumbling roads The Department for Infrastructure said the audit office report highlighted that funding for road maintenance has been below the level required for a number of years. A spokesperson said it identified the need for ""planned, timely, targeted intervention"". In its report, the audit office estimates it will take Â£1.2bn to clear the backlog of structural maintenance across Northern Ireland. Auditor general Kieran Donnelly said: ""We're about Â£50m short every year. ""We're spending in Northern Ireland about Â£90m on average a year on road maintenance, we would need to spend on average about Â£140m just to stay level, to keep the roads from deteriorating."" He added: ""It's not just damage to vehicles, it's also personal injury claims as well and they're running around Â£4m per year at present. ""The short-term approach is to do a bit of patching, whereas more preventative maintenance is a better job in the long-run and provide better value for money ""The experts say that the actual patching reactive maintenance should only be about 10% of the budget, but in Northern Ireland it's been consistently a lot more than that, more like 30%."" Mr Donnelly said that 4,000 claims for vehicle defects were made in 2017/18. in Northern Ireland between 2016 and 2018 Â£1.2mpaid out for vehicle damage compensation 311,124road defects recorded across Northern Ireland The FOI statistics on the number of road defects across Northern Ireland were released to BBC News NI by the Department of Infrastructure. Road defects include cracks and potholes recorded on carriageways, hard shoulders and lay-by surfaces. The data shows that in 2018, there were 127,173 road defects recorded across Northern Ireland, an increase of 60,000 on the previous year. It also confirmed that the number of successful vehicle damage claims rose from 1,590 in 2016 to 3,533 in 2018. The road with the largest number of defects (162) in 2018 was the Ballyfannahan Road in County Armagh. This was followed by the Hillhead road in Ballyclare (147) and the Upper Dromore Road in Warrenpoint (145). Darkley Road in Keady in County Armagh ""Road maintenance is rarely a vote winner when compared to high-profile bypasses and dual-carriageways,"" said roads expert Wesley Johnston. ""Yet, today's pothole figures illustrate what happens when not enough is spent fixing our roads."" Maintenance of NI's road network 25,714 kmlength of road network Â£1.2bnexpenditure needed to clear structural maintenance backlog Â£92maverage annual funding spent on structural maintenance The audit office report published on Tuesday found that reduced funding for Northern Ireland's road network had led to a significant reduction in the number of potholes which are recorded and approved for repair. Mr Johnston believes additional funding is the only way to address the problem. ""Unless maintenance funding is increased, this problem is only going to get worse. But the money has to come from somewhere, so it could mean fewer badly-needed road upgrades are provided,"" he said.

"Purdue Pharma, the drug-maker owned by the billionaire Sackler family, has reached a $270m settlement in a lawsuit which claimed its opioids contributed to the deaths of thousands of people. As part of the deal, the US firm will fund a new centre to study addiction. Purdue is one of several firms named in the claim which alleged they used deceptive practices to sell opioids. The deal is the first Purdue has struck amid some 2,000 other lawsuits linked to its painkiller OxyContin. The lawsuit filed by Oklahoma,externalclaimed that in order to persuade doctors to prescribe their painkillers, Purdue, and other companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical, allegedly decided to ""falsely downplay the risk of opioid addiction"" and ""overstate"" the benefits of their drugs to treat a wide range of conditions. The companies deny the claims. Is this America's most hated family? What are opioids and what are the risks? US schools prepare for student overdoses On average, 130 Americans die from an opioid overdose every day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2017, of the 70,200 people who died from overdose, 68% involved a prescription or illegal opioid. Purdue said that the settlement with Oklahoma ""resolves all of the state's claims against"" against the company. This video can not be played On America's trail of destruction The family, who were not named in this lawsuit, said: ""The agreement reached today will provide assistance to individuals nationwide who desperately need these services - rather than squandering resources on protracted litigation."" The Sackler family, who are worth $13bn, according to Forbes magazine, also said: ""We have profound compassion for those affected by addiction."" Under the settlement, Purdue will pay $102.5m towards the creation of a National Centre for Addiction Studies and Treatment at Oklahoma State University. The Sacklers themselves said that they will contribute $75m over five years to the centre. The dynasty has increasingly been under the spotlight because of the wave of legal action the company and individual family members are facing. The V&A in London is a recipient of millions of dollars from the Sackler family They are prolific philanthropists, having contributed millions of dollars to the arts. However, a number of major galleries recently announced that they would not accept donations from the family, including the Tate in the UK and the Guggenheim in New York. A lawsuit filed by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey,externalrecently released a number of potentially damning documents, including some that present former Purdue boss Richard Sackler as someone who does not view OxyContin as contributing to opioid addiction but instead blames the individuals themselves. He wrote in an email: ""We have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible. They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals."" Commenting on the settlement, Purdue's chief executive Craig Landau said: ""Purdue has a long history of working to address the problem of prescription opioid abuse and diversion. ""We see this agreement with Oklahoma as an extension of our commitment to help drive solutions to the opioid addiction crisis."" Alexandra Lahav, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, told Reuters it was likely that Purdue was in talks to settle other lawsuits. ""This may be the start of the dominoes falling for Purdue,"" she said. But the Sackler family said that the agreement with Oklahoma ""is not a financial model for future settlement discussions"". Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical had attempted to delay a trial over the claims made by Oklahoma state which is seeking $20bn in damages. However, on Monday the Oklahoma Supreme Court refused and the trial against the other defendants will go ahead on 28 May. Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, said: ""The addiction crisis facing our state and nation is a clear and present danger."" He said one of the goals of the state's legal action was to ensure ""a dramatic abatement of the sale of pharmaceutical opioids"". He added that as part of the settlement with Purdue, Oklahoma has put an injunction in place to stop the company marketing analgesic opioids within the state.

"MPs vote by 286 to 344 to reject the governmentâs withdrawal agreement - on the day the UK was due to leave the EU The Commons has been debating a motion on the terms of the UK's exit The political declaration, which sets out the future relationship, was not considered The vote - the third time the government had been defeated over its deal - throws the UKâs plans into more confusion Theresa May says the result will have ""grave"" implications and the ""legal default"" was that the UK would leave the EU on 12 April Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn urges the PM to call an election Thousands of Leave supporters gather outside Parliament to protest against Brexit delay Joseph Lee, Katie Wright, Francesca Gillett and Sarah Collerton On the day that the UK was due to leave the EU, there has instead been more delay and continued division over Brexit. Here's what today has meant for the Brexit process:  BBC News Channel BBC political correspondent Chris Mason says there is lots more talk in Westminster tonight about a possible general election. ""Thereâs a recognition that thereâs a lot of weariness about
the potential trip to a polling station,"" he says. But he says that ""Parliament is running out of road â the prime minister used
language to that effect today"". Some MPs have suggested that the prime minister should consider her position. But Mr Mason says: ""Her character would suggest that she would want to see this
through to some conclusion."" While it might be a ""tall order"" for her to get her deal through now, she may wait until ""the point where she has self-evidently failed to do that and the UK ends up committed to a long delay"" after 12 April.

Followingthe government's latest setback, it is no clearer when Brexit will happen. The UK faces a deadline of 12 April to come up with a way forward. By that point, the UK must have approved any deal or decided whether it wants to leave without a deal, which Parliament has said no to, or is prepared to delay Brexit by a much longer period, potentially into next year. The EU is planning an emergency summit on 10 April to discuss its next move. So where does the process go from here? Read more here Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor If we know one thing about the prime minister it is that she does not give up, even when it seems that seems the obvious or rational choice. Parliament has rejected her deal three times now - a reality that would have finished off many previous administrations and leaders. Whether that is foolhardy and stubborn, or admirably resilient, it is highly likely that at least for another couple of weeks, Theresa May will look through every nook and cranny in Parliament to see if there is a way for her deal to pass through - somehow. But that's a decision taken in the bunker, and the walls are closing in. Read the full story Katya AdlerEurope Editor The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says today's vote is ""no great surprise"" to European leaders. She says the mood in Brussels is of ""resignation"" and ""defensiveness"", with ""the EU wanting to protect itself
from any future Brexit fallout"". The UK leaving without a deal is seen as an ""increasingly likely prospect"" by leaders such as Emmanuel Macron. ""Thatâs why he and other European leaders are questioning
whether it makes sense to delay Brexit for that much longer. They look at all
the divisions in Parliament, in government, in cabinet, and they wonder if the UK
will ever unite around Brexit,"" Adler says. She says that doesn't mean they would say no, but there would be ""very heated discussion among EU
leaders as to whether to extend, what for and for how long"". One thing they are certain about is that the UK would need to take part in EU elections for a longer extension, she says. That's because the UK would remain an EU member, and the European Parliament's legality could be questioned if all members are not represented.

Vote Leave was fined Â£61,000and referred to the police after an Electoral Commission probe said it broke electoral law. The watchdog said it exceeded its Â£7m spending limit by funnelling Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. Vote Leave previously said the ""wholly inaccurate"" report was politically motivated. Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent There's a bad moon rising over Westminster. Friday's latest government defeat on Brexit may have been by a lower margin than the earlier thrashings, but the convincing 58-vote majority against the EU withdrawal agreement, in the teeth of an all-out whipping operation, hardly suggests that one more heave will see it home. The result looks set to trigger a political chain reaction. And with the prime minister having signalled her departure, albeit making contingent on getting her deal passed, a variety of parliamentary events will become auditions for the contenders for her job. Sajid Javid has Home Office questions on Monday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is up on Tuesday and Andrea Leadsom has her weekly Business Questions outing on Thursday. Other parliamentary events, not least around Brexit, will provide plenty of opportunities for other contenders. Here's Mark's rundown of the week ahead. Former Labour MP Chris Leslie, who is part of the Independent Group, says he supports calls for another public vote - but not a general election. He tells the BBC News Channel: ""If you think that Brexit is complicated, just throw a general election in here to completely throw everything into chaos.  Let's get a grip of this situation. ""There is a route out of it.  The prime minister's deal could go back to the public. ""We could put a customs union, single market back to the public. Ultimately we have to give people the chance to look at this and say do we want to proceed or think again?"" Continuing his speech, ex-UKIP leader Mr Farage said: ""This is about our whole system of democracy. ""This is about the bond of trust that needs to exist between the people and those, the governors. ""This is about who we are as a nation. Where our standing is in the world. ""And frankly, I believe that what's happened over there, has not just turned this day that should've been one of great celebration into a day that history will mark as a day of great betrayal, I believe that what's happened over the course of two years is actually one of the saddest and worst chapters in the history of our nation."" He added: ""What they want is for us to go away. Am I downcast, am I disheartened? No. I am more determined."" The crowd broke out in chants of ""Nigel! Nigel! Nigel!"" To music and loud cheers, former UKIP leader and Brexiteer Nigel Farage appeared on stage at the Leave Means Leave rally in Parliament Square. ""It's brave of you to come,"" he told demonstrators. ""Because I sense, being in Westminster, that we are in enemy territory. ""There are hundreds of people just over the street that have treated that referendum and those who voted for it with total and utter contempt of the past three years."" Referring to Theresa May's Brexit deal, Mr Farage called it ""dreadful"" and said he did not spend 25 years campaigning to come out of the EU to see the UK ""signed up to another"" EU treaty. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent The big question everyone is asking is whether the prime
ministerâs deal is dead after this third defeat. Of course, opposition MPs certainly think that it is. But
does she have a plan to bring it back again? There is speculation about maybe some kind of run-off
between her proposal and whatever MPs come up with and coalesce around on
Monday. But weâll have to wait and see. Itâs certainly been an incredibly divisive process - particularly for the Conservative Party. UKIP leader Gerard Batten addressed pro-Brexit supporters on Whitehall after Tommy Robinson. Mr Batten told the crowds: ""As of now we
do not know when we are going to leave the European Union. ""Theresa May has had, for the third
time, her not-really-leaving deal rejected by Parliament."" He added: ""What we do know is that
if we do not leave the EU it will mark the end of democracy in the UK."" Mr Batten also said, to cheers from the crowd, that UKIP was the ""only major political party that actually wants Britain to leave the
EU"". Conservative MP Mark Francois was introduced as a ""massive, massive Brexiteer"" when he took to the stage at the protest organised by campaign group Leave Means Leave. Greeted by a cheering crowd, Mr Francois read out the first part of the poem If by Rudyard Kipling. ""I read it again the other night, and it could have been written for the ERG over the last year,"" he tells the demo, referring to the pro-Brexit European Research Group. ""If you can keep your head when all about youAre losing theirs and blaming it on you, If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,But make allowance for their doubting too."" He added: ""Three times this wretched deal has been voted down by the House of Commons. ""Prime minister, which bit of 'no, no, no' don't you understand?"" Tory MPs tweet... Allow Twitter content?

"'No meme is illegal': Protests were held against the copyright law changes Copyright laws which critics say could change the internet have been voted in by the European Parliament. The new rules, including the controversial Article 13, will hold tech firms responsible for material posted without copyright permission. Sharing memes and GIFs will still be allowed under the new laws. Many musicians and creators say the legislation will compensate artists fairly - but others argue that they will destroy user-generated content. Copyright is the legal right that allows an artist to protect how their original work is used. Tech companies have argued that artists are already paid fairly under the current system. Google said it would ""harm Europe's creative and digital industries"". What is the controversial Article 13? Why Europe's original copyright plan was so controversial High-profile figures who have campaigned against the EU Copyright Directive include Wyclef Jean and web inventor Sir Tim Berners Lee, while Debbie Harry and Sir Paul McCartney have been among its supporters. Web pioneer Sir Tim Berners-Lee has warned about the possible consequences of copyright changes It has taken several revisions for the current legislation, which was was backed by 348 MEPs, with 274 against, to reach its final form. It is now up to member states to approve the decision. If they do, they will have two years to implement it once it is officially published. The two clauses causing the most controversy are known as Article 11 and Article 13. Article 11 states that search engines and news aggregate platforms should pay to use links from news websites. Article 13 holds larger technology companies responsible for material posted without a copyright licence. Tech companies already remove music and videos which are copyrighted, but under the new laws they will be more liable for any copyrighted content. It means they would need to apply filters to content before it is uploaded. Article 13 does not include cloud storage services and there are already existing exemptions, including parody, which, for example, includes memes. It was Article 13 which prompted fears over the future of memes and GIFs - stills, animated or short video clips that go viral -  since they mainly rely on copyrighted scenes from TV and film. Critics claimed Article 13 would have made it nearly impossible to upload even the tiniest part of a copyrighted work to Facebook, YouTube, or any other site. However, specific tweaks to the law made earlier this year made memes safe ""for purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody and pastiche"". The European Parliament said that memes would be ""specifically excluded"" from the directive, although it was unclear how tech firms would be able to enforce that rule with a blanket filter. This Getty stock image became the ""distracted boyfriend"" meme MEP for London Mary Honeyball said: ""There's no problem with memes at all. This directive was never intended to stop memes and mashups. ""I think that's doom-mongering. People who carry out their business properly have nothing to worry about at all."" Robert Ashcroft, chief executive of PRS for Music, which collects royalties for music artists, welcomed the directive as ""a massive step forward"" for consumers and creatives. ""It's about making sure that ordinary people can upload videos and music to platforms like YouTube without being held liable for copyright - that responsibility will henceforth be transferred to the platforms,"" he said. However the campaign group Open Knowledge International described it as ""a massive blow"" for the internet. ""We now risk the creation of a more closed society at the very time we should be using digital advances to build a more open world where knowledge creates power for the many, not the few,"" said chief executive Catherine Stihler.

Google said that while the latest version of the directive was improved, there remained ""legal uncertainty"". ""The details matter and we look forward to working with policy-makers, publishers, creators and rights holders, as EU member states move to implement these new rules,"" it said. Kathy Berry, senior lawyer at Linklaters, said more detail was required about how Article 13 would be enforced. ""While Article 13 may have noble aims, in its current form it functions as little more than a set of ideals, with very little guidance on exactly which service providers will be caught by it or what steps will be sufficient to comply,"" she said. European Parliament Rapporteur Axel Voss said the legislation was designed to protect people's livelihoods. ""This directive is an important step towards correcting a situation which has allowed a few companies to earn huge sums of money without properly remunerating the thousands of creatives and journalists whose work they depend on,"" he said. ""It helps make the internet ready for the future, a space which benefits everyone, not only a powerful few."" What is the controversial Article 13?

"Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie died after the incident The initial police response to the incident at a County Tyrone hotel in which three teenagers died is to be investigated by the Police Ombudsman. It has been revealed that the first officers who arrived at the scene of the tragedy withdrew to await support. Morgan Barnard, 17, Lauren Bullock, 17, and Connor Currie, 16,died after a crush at the Greenvale Hotelin Cookstown on 17 March. Hundreds of young people were queuing to get into the St Patrick's Day disco.

""When the first ambulance arrived police moved forward in support of them. It happened at the Greenvale Hotel on St Patrick's Day ""The timing and nature of police actions during this period require further investigation to fully establish the facts.

"Rebecca Kenna is ranked third in the World Women's Snooker rankings A snooker player says she has been forced to turn her back on her local league after being barred from matches because she is a woman. Rebecca Kenna felt ""abandoned"" after being stopped from playing in two fixtures due to some clubs in Keighley operating a ""men-only"" policy. Mrs Kenna, 30, who is ranked third in the World Women's Snooker rankings, wants to see the rule scrapped. The league said ""there's nothing we can do to overturn the decisions"". Mrs Kenna,who spoke to the BBC's One Show, said: ""To be told you can't play the sport you love because of your gender is ridiculous and it's quite upsetting. ""When we were playing [these teams] I would just have to stay at home."" Latest news and stories from across Yorkshire She said she had approached the organising committee of the Crosshills And District Snooker League asking it to step in. ""I think we should make it so these 'men-only' clubs are not allowed into the league if they are not going to let women play,"" she added. Both Rebecca Kenna (left) and Reanne Evans said they had been barred from matches for being female Mrs Kenna said Keighley was not the only place in the UK where women struggle to compete equally. Reanne Evans, 11-times women's world snooker champion,told BBC Radio 4 in February she had previously been refused entry to a snooker hall for the same reason. ""There are others on the women's tour who are not even allowed in to their local league,"" Mrs Kenna said. ""Others have said this was what happened in the 80s and 90s but not any more. I think it's time Keighley moved with the times."" Snooker league committee member Alan Speak said: ""If we lose two of these clubs [with the men-only policies] we would lose four teams and we can't afford to lose four teams otherwise we would have no league.""

"Kvitova feared her tennis career was over The man who stabbed tennis champion Petra Kvitova in her home in the Czech Republic has been sentenced to eight years in jail. Radim Zondra, 33, went to her flat in 2016 saying he needed to inspect the boiler. He then grabbed Kvitova from behind and held a knife to her throat. She suffered severe wounds to her left hand in the fight to free herself but returned to tennis five months later. Appearing at a regional court in Brno, Zondra denied all charges against him. Zondra, who is currently serving a prison sentence for another crime, was convicted of serious battery and illegal entry into Kvitova's apartment. The 29-year-old player, who is currently the world number two, told the courtlast month there was ""blood all over the place"" after the December 2016 attack. She added that she had offered Zondra money to leave, eventually giving him 10,000 Czech crowns (Â£341; $440). The court has ordered him to pay this back. This video can not be played July 2017: Petra Kvitova ""had flashbacks"" after knife attack In her judgment, Judge Dagmar Bordovska said Kvitova's testimony was credible, while witnesses who testified on behalf of Zondra were unreliable, CTK news agency reports. Although Zondra denied ever being in the tennis star's home, prosecutors argued that DNA evidence and the positive identification from Kvitova meant he was guilty beyond all doubt. Petra Kvitova describes knife attack From 2016: Kvitova moves left hand following surgery The two-time Wimbledon champion suffered damage to ligaments and tendons in her playing hand, and underwent a four-hour surgery. Doctors warned her at the time that her tennis career could be over and that she may even lose her fingers. Kvitova had to have surgery on her playing hand after the attack in December 2016 However she returned to tennis in May 2017, following months of rehabilitation, and continued her successful career. Earlier this year she reached the Australian Open final, and is now in the UScompeting in the Miami Open. She will face Ashleigh Barty in the quarter-finals later on Tuesday.

"Christina Koch (left) will on Friday wear the spacesuit used by Anne McClain (right) during her spacewalk last week Plans for the first all-female spacewalk in history have been scrapped for lack of a second space suit, the US space agency Nasa says. Christina Koch and Anne McClain had been scheduled to step outside the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday to install batteries. But it turned out they both needed a medium-size spacesuit and only one was ready for use. Koch will now exit the ISS with male colleague Nick Hague instead.

"The options for Brexit ""are narrowing"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said, after MPs voted to seize control of the parliamentary timetable. The PM was dealt a fresh blow as the government was defeated by 27 votes on Monday, on a plan designed to find out the kind of deal MPs would support. Thirty Conservative MPs rebelled, including three ministers. Mr Hancock said the government would listen to MPs but ""can't pre-commit to following whatever they vote for"". Live page: Reaction as MPs take control Adler: No EU joy over new Brexit votes What are indicative votes? MPs back votes on Brexit alternatives He told Radio 4's Today programme that the Commons had rejected no deal and a second referendum, and urged MPs to back the PM's Brexit deal. Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the Eurosceptic group of Tory MPs the European Research Group (ERG), is among the group of pro-Brexit MPs who the prime minister has been trying to persuade to back her deal. On his ConservativeHome podcast, he said: ""I have always thought that no deal is better than Mrs May's deal, but Mrs May's deal is better than not leaving at all."" Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  But the Democratic Unionists, whose 10 MPs prop up Mrs May's government, urged Tory Brexiteers to continue to ""stand firm"" in their opposition to the prime minister's deal unless there were ""significant changes"". Their Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson suggested extending negotiations by a year was preferable to accepting the deal on offer as this would allow the UK to ""have a say on the things which affect us during that time"". ""Surely this is a better strategy than volunteering to be locked into the prison of the withdrawal deal with the cell door key in the pocket of Michel Barnier,"" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. On Monday night, MPs voted in favour of Conservative backbencher Sir Oliver Letwin's cross-party amendment, which will allow MPs to put forward motions relating to Brexit - most likely a series of so-calledindicative votes. Because of this, MPs will be able to vote on a number of options on Wednesday - likely to include a ""softer Brexit"", a customs union with the EU and another referendum - designed to test the will of Parliament to see what, if anything, commands a majority. Richard Harrington, Alistair Burt and Steve Brine resigned to join the rebels, with Mr Harrington accusing the government of ""playing roulette with the lives and livelihoods"" of Britons. The prime minister said she was ""sceptical"" about the process - as it was not guaranteed to produce a majority for any one course of action - and she would not commit the government to abiding by the result. ""The votes could lead to an outcome that is un-negotiable with the EU,"" she told MPs. Mr Hancock told Today: ""In the previous votes there have been a multitude of potential different options - the sorts of options, like a second referendum, which I think would be a bad idea, that's been rejected. ""The idea of having a no dealâ¦the Commons is absolutely clear it won't allow and will legislate against it if necessary. That means that the options are narrowing."" Commons Speaker John Bercow said Sir Oliver Letwin will table a business motion at 16:00 GMT and MPs will have until the end of Tuesday to put forward matters for consideration under indicative votes. The exact method of indicative voting will be debated on Wednesday, Mr Bercow said. When asked if the prime minister will abide by the indicative votes, Mr Hancock said it was important for the government to listen to MPs. ""But we can't pre-commit to following whatever they vote for, because they might vote for something that is completely impractical,"" he said. But Labour's Hilary Benn said MPs have to take responsibility for the Brexit process. Mr Benn, chairman of the Commons Exiting the European Union Committee, told the Today programme: ""If the government isn't going to do its job then Parliament is going to have to take responsibility, and that is what we are doing on Wednesday."" So, is the EU jumping up and down with glee at the prospect of indicative votes in Westminster on Wednesday? For months, even years now, Brussels has been urging the UK to ""tell us what you want, want you really, really want!"" And yet there is no sudden outbreak of Brexit joy across the Channel. EU governments know well enough by now that Wednesday's votes may not end up providing a clear picture of Brexit. Even if they did, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker will point out that the EU's only ""interlocutor"" - or opposite number - remains Her Majesty's government, led by Theresa May, and not UK MPs. Would she be willing to shuttle as a go-between on behalf of Parliament, which has chosen to ignore her negotiated Brexit deal? Not likely. Read more from Katya Mr Burt, who resigned as Foreign Office minister on Monday night, said in a statement that he had opted to defy the whip ""for the country's sake"". He said the UK was ""running out of time"" to find an alternative and added that Parliament should seek other options without the instruction of party whips and the government ""should adopt any feasible outcome as its own"". Mr Brine, who quit as a health minister, said he believed the PM's deal was the ""best of the options"" and for those who do not like the deal ""maybe they will realise that the House of Commons is prepared to act and anything from here, as far as they're concerned, gets softer"". Tuesday:Theresa May has a meeting of her cabinet. Tuesday had been considered as a possible day for the so-called third meaningful vote on Mrs May's withdrawal deal. But, on Monday, the PM said the deal did not have enough support to get through the Commons ""as things stand"". Wednesday:This is when indicative votes would be held - we don't know yet whether MPs will be free to vote how they want or be directed along party lines. The prime minister is also due to address the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers. MPs will also vote on changing the Brexit date in UK law from 29 March. Thursday:A possible opportunity for meaningful vote three. The prime minister may hope that Brexiteers will finally decide to throw their weight behind her deal. Friday:This is written into law as the day the UK leaves the EU, although the PM has said she will pass legislation this week to remove it. The earliest Brexit is likely to happen is now 12 April. Read more on the week ahead in Parliament Parliament will also be asked to vote on Wednesday on a law postponing the Brexit date from 29 March. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said the amended legislation would include two potential exit dates - 12 April and 22 May - depending on whether the withdrawal agreement was passed by the end of 29 March. MPs involved in the bid on Monday night say if there is a majority for a plan that's not the prime minister's deal then there would be ""uproar"" if Theresa May tried to ignore it. It is possible, of course, that Brexiteers who have been resisting the prime minister's deal so far take fright at Parliament having more control of the process, and are more likely to come in line. That's because, generally, the make-up of MPs are more likely to back a softer deal than the one on offer. So faced with the choice of Theresa May's compromise this week, or a much longer wrangle to a closer relationship with the EU than the prime minister has negotiated, it is not impossible that the numbers will move in her favour.

"MPs have set out details of their plan to consider other Brexit options, as Theresa May was warned more ministers could quit unless she changes course. The Commons will begin voting on alternatives on Wednesday, in a process likely to continue into next week. MPs will fill out a series of ballots testing support for different ideas. Ex-minister Alistair Burt said the PM must recognise a ""different answer"" was now needed but ex-Brexit secretary David Davis warned of impending chaos. As MPs seek to take the initiative from the government, there are signs that some Tory opponents of Mrs May's deal could be steeling themselves to back it if it returns to the Commons for a third time later this week. Prominent BrexiteerJacob Rees-Mogg indicated,externalthat he could be persuaded, given it now appeared to be a choice between her deal and no Brexit at all. Ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the BBC there was ""no point"" supporting Mrs May's deal ""without any sign the UK is going to change its approach in phase two"" of the negotiations - otherwise he feared the country would be indefinitely tied to the EU's rules. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the not very subtle subtext of Mr Johnson's remarks was ""if the PM promises to go soon, then she might get my vote."" Adler: No EU joy over new Brexit votes What are indicative votes? MPs back votes on Brexit alternatives How the indicative vote process will work MPs took the unprecedented step of voting to seize control of the parliamentary timetable on Monday, in an attempt to end the deadlock over the terms of the UK's exit. Groups are now putting forward a variety of different options for the UK's future relationship with the EU. Several of these are based on the assumption that the existing withdrawal agreement with the EU will be approved, albeit with changes to the controversial Northern Ireland backstop. Others call for a basic free trade agreement with the EU and another referendum on whether Brexit goes ahead. It will be up to Commons Speaker John Bercow to decide what is voted on. Customs union:This calls for the UK to negotiate a new customs union with the EU immediately after it leaves. Common Market 2.0:The UK would remain in the single market by rejoining the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and staying in the European Economic Area (EEA). A ""comprehensive customs partnership"" would replace the Irish border backstop plan. It would accept continued freedom of movement but with conditions. EFTA and EEA:The UK would rejoin EFTA and sign up to existing EEA rules and obligations but make them enforceable through the UK courts. Rejects any customs union with the EU, instead seeking agreement on new arrangements for Northern Ireland. Malthouse compromise plan A:Mrs May's withdrawal deal but without the backstop, which would be replaced by alternative arrangements. Another referendum:The public would vote on any Brexit deal which is passed by Parliament before it is ratified. Revoke Article 50:If the government has not passed its withdrawal deal, MPs would vote on a no-deal Brexit two days before the UK's leaving date. If MPs reject no deal, the prime minister would have to cancel Brexit altogether. According to a copy of a business motionreleased by Labour's Hilary Benn,external, there will be about five hours of debate on different options. Voting by paper ballot will take place at about 19:00 GMT, with the results announced by Mr Bercow later that evening. This video can not be played Burt: ""We will not go down the route of no-deal."" The process is likely to continue on Monday as MPs seek to whittle down options which could command majority support in Parliament. The government has until 12 April to propose a different way forward to the EU if it cannot get the current agreement through Parliament. There is a very strange mood around the place in Westminster, ahead of what could be a very messy and tricky day tomorrow. MPs will spend much of Wednesday voting on different versions of Brexit. But the government is even at odds with itself over whether they should be given free rein to do so. One source told me 19 ministers are ready to quit if they aren't allowed to have their say, which could, hypothetically at least, collapse the government itself. Read more from Laura Mr Burt, one of three ministers who quit on Monday to back the so-called ""indicative votes"" plan, said he still backed the prime minister's deal but she had a duty to look at other options. ""My advice to the prime minister would be to recognise that her duty now is perhaps to find a different answer than the one she has tried to find,"" he told Laura Kuenssberg. But David Davis said the PM's deal was better than the alternatives and had a ""decent chance"" of getting through Parliament if put to the vote again. ""It's not a good deal but the alternative is a complete cascade of chaos,"" he said. ""You are seeing proposals being put up which are all worse than hers."" The PM has signalled she will try to bring her deal, which has been heavily rejected twice, back to the Commons for a third time later this week but only if she believes she can win. The Democratic Unionists, whose 10 MPs prop up Mrs May's government, urged Tory MPs to ""stand firm"" in their opposition unless there were ""significant changes"". Tuesday:Theresa May met her cabinet. Tuesday had been considered as a possible day for the so-called third meaningful vote on Mrs May's withdrawal deal. But, on Monday, the PM said the deal did not have enough support to get through the Commons ""as things stand"". Wednesday:This is when indicative votes will be held - we don't know yet whether MPs will be free to vote how they want or be directed along party lines. The prime minister is also due to address the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers. MPs will also vote on changing the Brexit date in UK law from 29 March. Thursday:A possible opportunity for meaningful vote three. The prime minister may hope that Brexiteers will finally decide to throw their weight behind her deal. Friday:This is written into law as the day the UK leaves the EU, although the PM has said she will pass legislation this week to remove it. The earliest Brexit is likely to happen is now 12 April.

"Theresa May shares a joke with some other PMs at last week's European Council summit So, is the EU jumping up and down with glee at the prospect of indicative votes in Westminster on Wednesday? For months, even years now, Brussels has been urging the UK to ""tell us what you want, what you really, really want!"" And yet there is no sudden outbreak of Brexit joy across the Channel. EU governments know well enough by now that Wednesday's votes may not end up providing a clear picture of Brexit. Even if they did, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker will point out that the EU's only ""interlocutor"" â or opposite number â remains Her Majesty's government, led by Theresa May, and not UK MPs. Would she be willing to shuttle as a go-between on behalf of Parliament, which has chosen to ignore her negotiated Brexit deal? Not likely. So the EU sees yet more uncertainty ahead. And that's bad for business, off-putting for international investors, it costs a fortune in no-deal planning and can affect opinion polls in European countries most affected by Brexit. Which is not to say the EU prioritises certainty enough to pursue a no-deal Brexit. Some in the European Commission may feel that way, along with a number of European diplomats based here in Brussels. Brexit options 'narrowing', says Hancock Live updates as MPs take control of Brexit What are indicative votes? They say they are fed-up with the UK's Brexit chaos infecting the rest of the continent. They speak with yearning of EU life after Brexit, and describe a no-deal scenario as ""damaging"" and ""suboptimal"" â but ultimately something the EU will survive. One of the favourite statistics doing the rounds it that, while the UK relies on the EU for 49% of its trade, only around 10% of EU trade is with the UK. But this ""bring-it-on"" attitude towards no deal is very much absent in European capitals. As we saw at last week's summit, EU leaders believe it in their interest to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Or, at the very least, to avoid being blamed in the worst-case scenario. As one high-level Brussels official put it: ""We want to be seen to have made the maximum effort so that, if the UK doesn't find a Brexit solution, it's not because of us."" It's also a fool's errand to go searching for rifts between EU countries over Brexit at this stage. MEPs are not very relevant here. It's the national leaders of the 27 EU countries that count. And amongst them, as (pretty much) always, it's the net payers into the EU budget that hold most influence. Germany and France above all. Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron also have their domestic audiences in mind when they speak about Brexit. Their parties are contesting fast-approaching elections for the European Parliament too, and their political styles are intentionally very different. At last week's summit, for example, Emmanuel Macron was happy to play ""bad cop"" on Brexit, according to one EU diplomat I spoke to. Angela Merkel generally prefers to appear more conciliatory. Different approaches, but close partners - Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel have been forging closer ties Tempting as it may be to look for clear black and whites in the EU, when UK politics is such a mess, European opinion is nuanced too. But the big players are not pulling in wildly different directions. They are united in preferring to avoid a no-deal Brexit if they can, in wishing that Parliament would pass the prime minister's negotiated Brexit deal - sooner rather than later - and in hoping for a close relationship with the UK on the other side. UK Analysis: May loses more ministers and more control Brexit options 'narrowing' An inconclusive second referendum or general election would be a nightmare for the EU â keeping Brexit looming over EU affairs for the foreseeable future. Revoking Article 50 is described in Brussels as ""the nuclear option"" and is viewed as very unlikely as things stand. For now the EU does as Theresa May does: it takes one Brexit week, one Brexit day at a time. Brussels has told the prime minister if she is unable get her deal passed through parliament by 12 April, she needs to give them several days' warning as to what her Plan B might be. Few in the EU think she has one. EU leaders are pencilling in a possible Brexit summit around that time, in order for the prime minister to request a longer Brexit delay â or another short one until 22 May, to get the deal passed or to make last-minute preparations for a no-deal Brexit. Ask EU diplomats and officials about their plans beyond that and they start to go a bit cross-eyed.

"Some foreign families living in Northern Ireland have been the target of racist attacks in recent years There have been at least 320 hate crimes against people from a Muslim background in Belfast alone over the past five years. That is one of the findings of detailed research into the experiences of people from the Muslim community in the city. However, the researchers said that most hate incidents involving Muslims were not reported to the PSNI. The Institute for Conflict Research (ICR) carried out the study, which was commissioned by Belfast City Council. There are thought to be around 6,000 Muslims in NI - less than half a per cent of the population. That's according to a previous report by the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), published in 2018. The ICR research took place during summer 2018 and a report was delivered to the council's good relations unit in early 2019. BBC News NI understands that a final version of the report has not yet been approved by Belfast City Council. However, members of the shared city partnership and a council committee have been briefed on the main findings. The report said that the PSNI did not publish specific data on the number of hate crimes experienced by people from a Muslim background. However a briefing note on the report prepared for councillors said that the researchers had been able to estimate a figure. ""An analysis for this study reveals that there have been at least 320 recorded hate crimes committed against people from a Muslim background over the past five years,"" it said. ""Most of these involved attacks on the person or criminal damage to property while the largest number took place in the south Belfast policing district."" However, the report said that most hate crime incidents were not reported to the PSNI, ""in part due to a lack of trust, a belief that nothing can or will be done or a sense that such incidents were normal."" The researchers found that many people from a Muslim background had suffered verbal abuse. ""Women, particularly those wearing forms of dress that identified them as Muslim, were often an easy target for expressions of verbal hostility,"" the report said. ""On occasion this might extend to physical contact with head coverings being removed."" The report also said that stereotypes were ""transmitted via the media and social media, associating Muslims with terrorism"". ""Some perceive these newly arrived as a security threat. ""Many of those interviewed felt that Belfast (and Northern Ireland more generally) was struggling to adapt to growing diversity."" BBC News NI understands that a wide range of organisations and individuals were interviewed for the research, and many identified problems with political leadership. Pastor James McConnell made his remarks at Belfast's Whitewell Metropolitan Tabernacle Church ""There was unanimity among interviewees that generous political signals were needed from the highest level to engender tolerance on the street,"" the report said. ""Several interviewees referred to the documented comments about Islam and Muslims in 2014 by a pastor within Belfast and the former first minister."" The former first minister Peter Robinson apologised in 2014 for comments he had made about Muslims in support of Belfast pastor James McConnell. The report also sets out a number of recommendations including: Belfast City Council taking the lead in monitoring and reporting online hate abuse The council running programmes to build the confidence of bystanders to report hate crimes More detailed hate crime figures be published by the PSNI, including figures for sub-groups and nationalities The PSNI to re-run Islamic awareness courses for police officers.

"Purdue Pharma, the drug-maker owned by the billionaire Sackler family, has reached a $270m settlement in a lawsuit which claimed its opioids contributed to the deaths of thousands of people. As part of the deal, the US firm will fund a new centre to study addiction. Purdue is one of several firms named in the claim which alleged they used deceptive practices to sell opioids. The deal is the first Purdue has struck amid some 2,000 other lawsuits linked to its painkiller OxyContin. The lawsuit filed by Oklahoma,externalclaimed that in order to persuade doctors to prescribe their painkillers, Purdue, and other companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical, allegedly decided to ""falsely downplay the risk of opioid addiction"" and ""overstate"" the benefits of their drugs to treat a wide range of conditions. The companies deny the claims. Is this America's most hated family? What are opioids and what are the risks? US schools prepare for student overdoses On average, 130 Americans die from an opioid overdose every day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2017, of the 70,200 people who died from overdose, 68% involved a prescription or illegal opioid. Purdue said that the settlement with Oklahoma ""resolves all of the state's claims against"" against the company. This video can not be played On America's trail of destruction The family, who were not named in this lawsuit, said: ""The agreement reached today will provide assistance to individuals nationwide who desperately need these services - rather than squandering resources on protracted litigation."" The Sackler family, who are worth $13bn, according to Forbes magazine, also said: ""We have profound compassion for those affected by addiction."" Under the settlement, Purdue will pay $102.5m towards the creation of a National Centre for Addiction Studies and Treatment at Oklahoma State University. The Sacklers themselves said that they will contribute $75m over five years to the centre. The dynasty has increasingly been under the spotlight because of the wave of legal action the company and individual family members are facing. The V&A in London is a recipient of millions of dollars from the Sackler family They are prolific philanthropists, having contributed millions of dollars to the arts. However, a number of major galleries recently announced that they would not accept donations from the family, including the Tate in the UK and the Guggenheim in New York. A lawsuit filed by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey,externalrecently released a number of potentially damning documents, including some that present former Purdue boss Richard Sackler as someone who does not view OxyContin as contributing to opioid addiction but instead blames the individuals themselves. He wrote in an email: ""We have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible. They are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals."" Commenting on the settlement, Purdue's chief executive Craig Landau said: ""Purdue has a long history of working to address the problem of prescription opioid abuse and diversion. ""We see this agreement with Oklahoma as an extension of our commitment to help drive solutions to the opioid addiction crisis."" Alexandra Lahav, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, told Reuters it was likely that Purdue was in talks to settle other lawsuits. ""This may be the start of the dominoes falling for Purdue,"" she said. But the Sackler family said that the agreement with Oklahoma ""is not a financial model for future settlement discussions"". Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceutical had attempted to delay a trial over the claims made by Oklahoma state which is seeking $20bn in damages. However, on Monday the Oklahoma Supreme Court refused and the trial against the other defendants will go ahead on 28 May. Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, said: ""The addiction crisis facing our state and nation is a clear and present danger."" He said one of the goals of the state's legal action was to ensure ""a dramatic abatement of the sale of pharmaceutical opioids"". He added that as part of the settlement with Purdue, Oklahoma has put an injunction in place to stop the company marketing analgesic opioids within the state.

"Prosecutors argued there was nothing to prevent Jack Shepherd being extradited from Georgia Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd is to be sent back to the UK after agreeing to his extradition from Georgia. The 31-year-old went on the run before his trial where he was found guilty of manslaughter following a speedboat crash on the River Thames which killed Charlotte Brown. After months in hiding in the capital, Tbilisi, hehanded himself into policeand was jailed for three months. Shepherd has been granted the right to appeal against his UK conviction. Judge Arsen Kalatozishvili agreed to the extradition going ahead, following a hearing at Tbilisi City Court. The court heard Shepherd'sextradition orderwas based on both the manslaughter offence and a separate assault charge. The second charge relates to an incident - shortly before Shepherd fled to Tbilisi - inMoretonhampstead, Devon, on 16 March 2018. Shepherd is accused of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. This video can not be played Jack Shepherd's cell in Tbilisi Defence lawyers said Shepherd had agreed to be extradited, but only if his safety was taken into consideration by the judge. Speaking before the hearing, his lawyer Mariam Kublashvili told Rustavi-2 TV Shepherd feared for his safety in the UK. She said: ""Because of the attitude of the British media and public he truly does not feel himself to be human."" Shepherd's boat was found to have several defects Outlining the extradition case, prosecutor Naniko Zazunashvili argued there was nothing to prevent Shepherd being sent back to the UK. Ms Zazunashvili said: ""He knew the boat was not in good working order and knew Charlotte Brown had no skills to control the boat - and he let her control the boat. ""While being on board the boat Jack Shepherd took obligation to take care of Charlotte Brown, but this obligation was violated. ""He knew boat was in poor working order. We are sure that if he is extradited there will be no threat to his life."" MP James Brokenshire said Charlotte Brown's family ""clearly welcome the news"" that Shepherd agreed to be extradited. ""It is their wish that he now accepts responsibility and atones for his actions, also that he drops the appeal against his conviction which can only cause more pain and anguish,"" he added. Steve Rosenberg, BBC News Moscow correspondent, Tbilisi Jack Shepherd gave himself up in the former Soviet state in January after months on the run In Courtroom Number 3, Jack Shepherd sat impassively while his fate was being decided. After the prosecution had set out the case for extradition, Shepherd's defence team dismissed the arguments as ""groundless"". But Shepherd had already decided to return to Britain. ""He agrees to extradition,"" announced one of the defence lawyers. When the judge invited him to speak, Shepherd confirmed the decision. He was ready to return to the UK, he said, because he wanted to take part in his Appeal Court hearing. Two months after he handed himself in to Georgian police, the legal process in Georgia appears to be nearing its conclusion. The extradition order will need to be approved by the Georgian Justice Minister, before Shepherd can leave Georgia. One of Shepherd's lawyers in Georgia, Tariel Kakabadze, said he could return to the UK within two weeks. Shepherd met Ms Brown online and they went on a date on 8 December. He invited her to go on a speedboat ride. They were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge at about midnight. Ms Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, was found in the water unconscious and unresponsive. Shepherd was clinging to the upturned boat. Shepherd made his first appearance at the Old Bailey on 26 January 2018, when he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was released on unconditional bail by Judge Richard Marks QC, but failed to show up for his trial and was later sentenced in his absence to six years in jail. What we know about the Jack Shepherd case The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Despite being on the run, Shepherdwon the right to appeal against his conviction.

"This video can not be played 'Simone' explains how her mum ironed her breasts aged 13 Breast ironing awareness should be made part of the mandatory school curriculum to protect young girls from abuse, the National Education Union has said. The practice involves ironing a girl's chest with hot objects to delay breasts from growing, so she does not attract male attention. Conservative MP Nicky Morgan said teachers must also be educated, as they have a ""very important role to play"". The Home Office said teachers have a duty to report concerns. ""Kinaya"" - whose name we have changed - lives in the UK. Her family descends from west Africa - where breast ironing originates - and she was subjected to it aged 10. She said her mother told her that ""if I don't iron them, men will start coming to you, to have sex with you"". It is often the child's mother who will undertake the breast ironing, which usually involves heating a stone or spoon on a flame then pressing, massaging or flattening the breast. This can go on for months. ""Time does not erase that kind of pain,"" Kinaya explained. ""You're not even allowed to cry out. If you do, you [are said to] have brought shame to your family, you are not a 'strong girl'."" ""Kinaya"" and her daughter Kinaya is now an adult with daughters of her own. When her eldest turned 10, her mother proposed that she be breast ironed. ""I said, 'No, no, no, none of my children are going to go through what I went through, as I still live with the trauma."" She has since moved away from her family, believing there was a real risk they would have performed breast ironing on her daughters without her consent. Some girls are also made to wear an extremely tight strap around their chest It is thought that around 1,000 girls in the UK have been affected by breast ironing. But while awareness is growing around female genital mutilation (FGM), there are fears that few people know about breast ironing. One woman told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she only realised breast ironing was not normal when she discovered her body looked different to her classmates during a PE class at her UK school, which led her to become distressed. Her sister had breast ironed her from age eight, but her teachers failed to notice when she became withdrawn and stopped wanting to take part in PE lessons. ""If my PE teacher had known, if they were trained, I could have had the help I needed growing up,"" she said. Kiri Tunks, joint president of the National Education Union, is now calling for school staff - and in particular PE teachers - to be taught how to notice the signs. She also wants it to be covered in schools in the same way asFGM will be from 2020,as part of compulsory relationships and sex education classes in secondary schools. Ms Morgan said issues such as breast ironing should be ""tackled, addressed, talked about and stopped"". She added that the curriculum should be kept ""under review as different areas of practice, custom or abuse come to light"". Those working with girls and young women should also be taught to recognise that breast ironing is taking place in the UK, she continued, and to be able to ""advise the young person on what action they need to take"". A heated stone is often used in breast ironing One woman, ""Simone"", told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was breast ironed aged 13 when her mum found out that she was gay. ""According to her, maybe I was attractive because of my breasts, so if she can iron them and I'm flat, then maybe I'll be ugly and no-one will admire me."" In her case, the breast ironing went on for months. Like many young girls, she was also made to wear an extremely tight strap around her chest to suppress them even more - which caused her difficulty breathing. A few years later, when she had a baby to the man she was forced to marry, the long-term damage became apparent. ""When it comes to breast feeding, it's so strenuous, like there's a knot inside,"" she explained. ""It seemed like maybe some of the nerves were destroyed."" There is no specific offence for breast ironing, but the Home Office described it as a form of child abuse and said it should be prosecuted under general assault laws. Angie Marriott, a former gynaecological nurse who now works as a safeguarding lecturer for Cheshire Police, said that the true scale of breast ironing in the UK was being obscured because of under-reporting. She described it as a ""sensitive, hidden crime"", with women afraid to speak out for fear of being ""ousted from their communities"". ""I know this is happening because people have divulged it to me,"" she said. ""And they've said it's the first time openly that they've ever spoken about what's happened to them, and they felt ashamed."" Angie Marriott says many women are too scared to report they have had their breasts ironed Simone still bears the scars from the abuse she endured, and wants to raise awareness of the crime. ""To say the least, it's an abuse. It hurts, it dehumanises you,"" she said. ""You are not a human being.""

"Almost three years ago the UK voted in favour of leaving the EU. Yet the original departure date of 29 March has been delayed and the government is searching for a way forward. So, what do the majority of the UK's voters now think about Brexit? Theresa May argues that her deal is the best way of fulfilling the instruction to leave given by voters in the EU referendum. Trouble is, voters themselves - including not least those who voted Leave - have become deeply critical of how the UK government has handled Brexit negotiations. This is seen indata from a newly published survey from NatCen Social Research,external, conducted between 24 January and 17 February. Two years ago, those who voted Leave were inclined to give the government the benefit of the doubt. However, as many as 80% of Leave voters now say that it has handled Brexit negotiations badly. That figure is almost as high as it is among Remain voters (85%), who had previously been more critical of the government's approach. Remarkably, Leave voters are now just as critical of the UK government's role as they are of the EU's: 79% of Leave supporters say the EU has handled Brexit badly. Meanwhile, the longer negotiations have continued, the more pessimistic voters have become about how good a deal the UK will secure. Two years ago, there were almost as many who thought that the UK would obtain a good deal (33%) as thought it would find itself with a bad one (37%). However, that mood soon changed and by last summer as many as 57% reckoned the UK would emerge with a bad deal. Now that the first phase of the Brexit negotiations has been concluded - though, as yet at least, not approved by MPs - the proportion who think the UK is heading for a bad deal is, at 63%, even higher. Here too, Remain and Leave voters are now largely in agreement. This is despite Leave voters initially being much more positive. As many as 66% of Leave supporters now believe that the UK is faced with a bad deal - even more than the 64% of Remain voters who express that view. It seems that the prime minister's deal has failed to satisfy many of the very voters whose wishes the deal is intended to fulfil. But does this negative reaction to the deal mean voters have changed their minds about leaving the EU in the first place? In truth, a moving average of the six most recent polls, has been indicating for some time that slightly more people now say they would vote Remain than Leave in another ballot. At present, the average level of support for the two options (after Don't Knows are excluded) is Remain 54%, Leave 46%. In part, this is because Leave voters are a little less likely to say they would vote the same way again (82%), than Remain voters are (86%). But the swing to Remain, such as it is, is also down to those who did not vote in 2016. Of this group, 43% say they would vote Remain, whereas 19% say they would back Leave. In truth, the polls are too close for opponents of Brexit to assume that a second ballot would produce a different result. But, equally, supporters of Brexit cannot say with confidence that the balance of opinion remains as it was in June 2016. More like this Brexit: What voters want MPs to do next Do petitions ever work? What kind of Brexit do voters want? How young and old would vote on Brexit now So, do the UK's voters want another referendum? That depends on how they are asked. Some polls introduce the idea of another ballot as a ""people's vote"", or a ""public vote"" and do not make it clear that remaining in the EU would be an option. When put to the public in this way, the polls suggest on average that supporters of a second referendum outnumber opponents by 12 points. However, the average level of support and opposition changes when people are asked if there should be another referendum with Remain as an option on the ballot paper. Asked in this way, opponents outnumber supporters by nine points. But perhaps what is more important is thatRemain voters are much keener on this idea than Leave supporters,external. That suggests the proposal is not yet a way out of the Brexit impasse that is backed by both sides in the Brexit debate. Remain and Leave voters may agree that they do not like Mrs May's deal, but that does not mean that they agree on what should happen instead.

Becoming, first published just five months ago, has already sold more than 10 million copies, Bertelsmann said. ""We believe that these memoirs could well become the most successful memoir ever,"" said Thomas Rabe, chief executive of the German firm. The firm paid $60m (Â£48m) in 2017for the rights to the book alongside that of former US President Barack Obama. Mr Obama's book is yet to be published.

A Child Called It, by Dave Pelzer is the top selling autobiography in the UK. The book has sold 1.1 million copies, compared to 618,000 in the UK so far for Becoming.

In it, she reveals difficulties in her marriage with Barack, disclosing details of how the couple suffered a miscarriage and later used in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to conceive both children, Malia and Sasha. The 54-year-old also criticises the current US President, Donald Trump, writing that she can ""never forgive"" him for ""putting my family's safety at risk"" over his championing of the ""birther"" theory that her husband was not born in the US and thus was not a legitimate president of the US.

"Fences already run along stretches of the US-Mexico border The Pentagon has authorised the transfer of $1bn (Â£758m) to army engineers for new wall construction along the US-Mexico border. The funds are the first under the national emergency declared by President Donald Trump to bypass Congress and build the barrier he pledged during his election campaign. Democrats have protested against the move. The funds will be used to build about 57 miles (91km) of fencing. President Trump has called the situation at the southern border a ""crisis"" and insists a physical barrier is needed to stop criminals crossing into the US. His critics say he has manufactured the border emergency. A Pentagon statement said acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan had ""authorised the commander of the US Army Corps of Engineers to begin planning and executing up to $1bn in support to the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol"". Trump's wall - all you need to know in seven charts Trump faces anger over wall emergency plan A major land grab by Trump The statement cited a federal law,externalthat ""gives the Department of Defence the authority to construct roads and fences and to install lighting to block drug-smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States in support of counter-narcotic activities of federal law enforcement agencies"". As well the 18ft-high (5m) ""pedestrian fencing"", the funds will cover road improvements and new lights. House Armed Services Chair Adam Smith sent a letter on Tuesday rejecting the Pentagon's transfer, saying the committee would not approve the use of defence funds ""to construct additional physical barriers and roads or install lighting in the vicinity of the United States border"". This contention between the Pentagon and lawmakers could set up a legal challenge about which area of the government has control over re-allocating such funds, US media say. Thousands of people cross the border every year seeking a new life in the US Democratic senators also complained that the Pentagon had not sought permission from the appropriate committees before notifying Congress of the funds transfer. ""We strongly object to both the substance of the funding transfer, and to the department implementing the transfer without seeking the approval of the congressional defence committees and in violation of provisions in the defence appropriation itself,"" the senators wrote in a letter to Mr Shanahan, CNN reported. Mr Trump declared the emergency on 15 February after Congress refused his requests for $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) to construct the wall. By declaring an emergency he sought to bypass Congress and build the wall with military funding. Democrats branded the declaration unconstitutional. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a resolution to overturn the emergency last month, and 12 Republicans later sided with Democratic Senators to get it through the Senate. This video can not be played Trump issues first veto of his presidency However, Mr Trump vetoed the resolution earlier this month. Congress failed to obtain the requisite two-thirds majority to override the veto on Tuesday, with a vote of 248-181 that saw only 14 Republicans voting with Democrats.

"The conquistador HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s (centre left) and the Aztec emperor Montezuma II Mexico's president has sent a letter to Spain's King Felipe VI and Pope Francis urging them to apologise for human rights abuses committed during the conquest of the region 500 years ago. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said the indigenous peoples of Mexico had been the victims of massacres. Speaking in the ruins of an ancient city, he called for a full account of the abuses. Spain rejected his call and called for a ""constructive perspective"" instead. The territory which now makes up Mexico was under Spanish rule for some 300 years before gaining independence in the early 19th Century. At the time of the conquest, Spain was a fiercely Roman Catholic country and saw as its mission the spread of Christianity to regions such as the Americas. The man who became Mexico's first leftist president in seven decades has been pursuing a radical agenda since being sworn in in December, promising to tackle corruption, reduce inequality and lift millions of Mexicans out of poverty. On Monday, he tweeted a video address from an archaeological site in Comacalco, Tabasco, where he is shown speaking alongside the First Lady, Beatriz Gutierrez. Allow Twitter content?

""I have sent a letter to the Spanish king [Felipe VI] and another letter to the Pope so that the abuses can be acknowledged and an apology can be made to the indigenous peoples for the violations of what we now call human rights,"" Mr LÃ³pez Obrador says. ""There were massacres... The so-called conquest was done with the sword and the cross. They raised churches on top of temples."" President Lopez Obrador welcomed Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez to Mexico in January ""The time has come to reconcile but first they should ask forgiveness,"" the president says. Mexico has the world's second biggest Roman Catholic population, after Brazil. Just over a fifth of Mexicans consider themselves to be indigenous but studies suggest many more have some pre-Hispanic ancestry. When Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez visited Mexico in January he presented President LÃ³pez Obrador with his grandfather JosÃ© Obrador's Spanish birth certificate, from 1893, AFP news agency reports. The Mexican leader's relations with Spain's centre-left ruling party have been friendly but the government in Madrid promptly rejected his request for an apology. Mexico country profile Pope apologises to indigenous Mexicans ""The arrival, 500 years ago, of Spaniards to present Mexican territory cannot be judged in the light of contemporary considerations,"" the government said in a statement. ""Our two brother nations have always known how to read our shared past without anger and with a constructive perspective."" There was no immediate comment from the Vatican but three years ago, on a visit to Mexico, Pope Francis asked indigenous people for forgiveness over the way they had been excluded from society. During a visit to Mexico in 2016, Pope Francis said the indigenous peoples had suffered centuries of discrimination ""Some have considered your values, culture and traditions to be inferior. Others, intoxicated by power, money and market trends, have stolen your lands or contaminated them. How sad this is,"" he said. ""How worthwhile it would be for each of us to examine our conscience and learn to say, 'Forgive me!'"" It started with an expedition led by Christopher Columbus in 1492. The conquest of Mexico began in 1519 when a small army led by HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s landed in the modern-day state of Veracruz. Aztec relics could lead to royal tomb Within two years, the Spanish had overcome the powerful Aztec Empire. Their victory was attributed to the skilled leadership of CortÃ©s, who made local allies for his campaign against the Aztecs, as well as their superior weapons. Large numbers of indigenous people died in battle or in massacres such as that at Cholula, while diseases the Spanish inadvertently brought with them accounted for massive loss of life.

"The MAIB has issued a safety warning following the incident in December last year A safety warning has been issued aftera number of lorries crashed on to their sides during a ferry sailing from Northern Ireland to Scotland. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) has highlighted the dangers of drivers remaining in their cabs during a crossing. It found at least six stayed in their vehicles during the incident between Larne and Cairnryan in December 2018. It warned a ferry's roll-on roll-off deck was a ""hazardous"" environment. This video can not be played Footage filmed inside the ferry at the time showed several lorries had toppled An investigation is ongoing into the incident on board P&O's European Causeway ferry  during ""strong winds and very rough seas"" on 18 December with a full report expected in due course. However, the MAIB has published a safety bulletin flagging up key issues raised by the events. It concluded: while a ferry is at sea the roll-on roll-off decks should only be occupied by ""trained professional seafarers"" drivers remaining on the vehicle deck ""pose a danger to themselves"" and can cause a delay in emergency response drivers staying in their cabs could be at danger of asphyxiation by fire or from fire suppression systems It said the crew on the European Causeway had instructed drivers to vacate the deck after parking their vehicles but a number had stayed in their cabs. Drivers have been urged not to stay in their cabs during a crossing Four drivers were found in vehicles that had toppled over and one had to be freed by emergency services in Cairnryan. ""Fortunately nobody was hurt during the accident,"" said the MAIB safety bulletin. It added that P&O Ferries had contacted other operators to look at ways to tackle concerns about drivers staying in their cabs. The MAIB urged all ferry companies to ""engage positively"" to help address the ""urgent safety issue"". It also recommended that the Road Haulage Association distribute the bulletin to members and encouraged them to take ""robust action"" to help stop drivers staying in their cabs. A spokesman for P&O Ferries said: ""Working closely with the MAIB, P&O Ferries has contacted ferry operators in the United Kingdom who may be affected by the issue of drivers remaining in vehicle cabs on ro-ro decks.

"Christina Koch (left) will on Friday wear the spacesuit used by Anne McClain (right) during her spacewalk last week Plans for the first all-female spacewalk in history have been scrapped for lack of a second space suit, the US space agency Nasa says. Christina Koch and Anne McClain had been scheduled to step outside the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday to install batteries. But it turned out they both needed a medium-size spacesuit and only one was ready for use. Koch will now exit the ISS with male colleague Nick Hague instead.

"Christina Koch (left) will on Friday wear the spacesuit used by Anne McClain (right) during her spacewalk last week Plans for the first all-female spacewalk in history have been scrapped for lack of a second space suit, the US space agency Nasa says. Christina Koch and Anne McClain had been scheduled to step outside the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday to install batteries. But it turned out they both needed a medium-size spacesuit and only one was ready for use. Koch will now exit the ISS with male colleague Nick Hague instead. She will wear the medium-size suit used by McClain on a spacewalk with Hague last week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

McClain trained in both medium- and large-size spacesuits,externalbut only realised after her actual spacewalk that the medium-size suit fitted her best, Nasa said. She is scheduled to perform her next spacewalk, on 8 April, with another male astronaut, David Saint-Jacques. This video can not be played Christina Koch arrived on the ISS earlier this month The issue relates to the spacesuit's hard upper torso or ""shirt"". Nasa has two medium-size hard upper torsos on the ISS but only one of them has been properly configured for a spacewalk. To get the other ready would have taken hours and Nasa decided it would be easier and safer to change the astronauts. What's life like on the ISS? Brandi Dean, a spokeswoman for the Johnson Space Center in Houston, explained that size requirements could change once astronauts were in space. ""Individuals' sizing needs may change when they are [in] orbit, in response to the changes living in microgravity can bring about in a body,"" she was quoted as saying by AFP news agency.

"Drugs company Sanofi has plans to fly supplies of flu vaccine into the UK if other transport routes are disrupted after the country leaves the EU. Hugo Fry, the managing director of its UK arm, toldBBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Moneythat the flu vaccine was one it was not possible to stockpile. ""We prepare in different ways and have prepared many different routes into the UK,"" he said. ""If we have to in the end, we will airlift it in."" He added: ""We are eating the cost of that but patients and citizens are our primary concern, so we're quite happy to take that cost and make that planning."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Those sorts of medicines can be flown in and we have plans for that. I pay tribute to Sanofi and other pharmaceutical companies - they have done an enormous amount of work to make sure people will be safe and medicines can flow. ""In the health department we don't use the word guarantee, as this is a complex system and there are lots of levers beyond our control such as how the French government responds on the Dover/Calais border. ""However, Sanofi have done a tremendous amount of work to ensure people can get their drugs unhindered and if necessary we'll fly them in."" Drug makers Sanofi and Novartis stockpiling for Brexit Brexit food stockpiling loan ad banned Warehouses thriving from Brexit stockpiling Sanofi says it is the second biggest of three suppliers of flu vaccines in the UK - behind Seqirus and ahead of Mylan. While Sanofi has plans to keep stockpiles of insulin and vaccines in place for 12 months, Mr Fry said this was not possible with the flu vaccine. ""You can't stockpile it because it's made at a particular time of the year and it's only available to import in the month at the end of August/beginning of September,"" he said. Last August, Sanofi said it was increasing its stocks by four weeks to give it a 14-week supply of medicines. Most of the French company's supplies enter the UK through the Channel Tunnel and disruption to that route in 2005, when there were strikes in France, led to around four weeks of disruption. Mr Fry added: ""We're doing everything possible to make sure that everyone will get their medicines and vaccines so that they can be reassured and they don't have to worry about it. He added that the day after Brexit happens, patients would be able to get their hands on all drugs that it was possible to stockpile. For the current flu season, Sanofi provided more than seven million vaccines to the UK. There are different vaccines for people aged under 65 in at risk groups and for people who are older than 65. Sanofi and Seqirus supply both age groups, while Mylan have vaccines only for the younger of the two age groups. There is a tender process to decide which company provides vaccines in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while in England and Wales, GPs decide who will supply the vaccines. The tenders for the 2019-20 flu season have already come out, while doctors are currently in the process of deciding who they want to be their supplier.

"A landmark clock which featured in the 1981 romantic Scottish comedy Gregory's Girl is at the centre of a debate over its true home. But how did this striking piece wind up in a Lanarkshire shopping arcade - and will it remain there? It's perhaps unusual for a prominent landmark to go through something of an identity crisis - but then, the St Enoch Station Clock is not your average timepiece. The clock, which famously appeared in the film Gregory's Girl, was suspended from the roof of the old Glasgow station until its closure in 1966. It was distinctly Victorian, embroidered with an ornate frill as it ticked out the minutes and hours on Roman numerals. Even now, it is still fondly remembered as the place where young lovers would often meet before a night on the town. But just in the way that Glasgow residents were absorbed into Cumbernauld due to an overspill in population, so was the famous clock when it was gifted to the town by businessman Raymond Gillies in the 1970s. In recent years a debate has arisen over the clock's true home, fuelled by a number of bids to bring it back to Glasgow - most recently from Network Rail who want to install it in the revamped Queen Street Station. The tug of war over ownership is living proof that the clock's links with both regions are alive and well, according to Cumbernauld community councillor, and author of Cumbernauld Through Time, Adam Smith. He said: ""I know people in Cumbernauld who have strong memories in St Enoch station, including someone who regularly met his now wife for dates under that clock. For him, the clock kept that association and link with Glasgow. ""This debate has been going on for a while. I'm aware that within the last few years there has been a few approaches from Network Rail and others to secure the clock. ""The argument is that, though St Enoch Station is long gone, it should be returned to Glasgow. ""But the clock actually went to auction. Glasgow or the relevant train operator decided they didn't want it, and so it was bought by a private businessman and gifted to Cumbernauld for our 21st birthday. A lot of it was circumstance."" Be it a stroke of fate or not, Cumbernauld embraced the clock with open arms more than four decades ago. It was installed at a key pedestrian thoroughfare - an atrium between the town centre and the main supermarket Woolco, which is now Asda. The Queen unveiled the clock in 1977. Allow Twitter content?

Once again it was passed every day by thousands of commuters, and was even featured in Bill Forsyth's 1981 film Gregory's Girl - appropriately during the scene when Gregory waits for his date Dorothy. Eventually the walkway was redeveloped and the clock, now known to many as the Cumbernauld clock, was placed into storage. By 2005 it had been out of the public eye for roughly a decade, a move that incensed locals who regarded the piece as a cinematic treasure. Clare Grogan and John Gordon Sinclair were a massive success in the 1981 film Gregory's Girl Eventually it was hung in the newly built Antonine Shopping Centre, which opened in 2007 - and interest in its welfare was far from waning. Mr Smith said: ""Cumbernauld does get quite a lot of tourists. ""People come from all over the world to view it - it does have that legendary status. ""Architectural students ask about it, also people who have the connection with the clock. They want to see it and make sure it's in good working order."" Until last week, the area surrounding the clock was sealed off from the public amid developments at the shopping centre. It is now back on display, but questions have been raised over its future after Network Rail recently indicated their interest. The clock on display at the Antonine Shopping Centre The company hoped to acquire the clock as part of a Â£100m upgrade to Queen Street Station, which isdue for completion in 2019. A spokesperson said: ""We have committed to exploring the possibility of returning the former St Enoch station clock to a railway setting in the redeveloped Queen Street, but any decision on its future would be for the current owners to make."" Councillor Allan Graham, who is chair of Campsies Centre Ltd, maintained the clock is an ""important artefact in the town's history"". Plans are in motion to find the clock a new home, but whether that home will be in Cumbernauld is unclear. Mr Smith said: ""The problem is, the clock is very large and heavy. ""The problem is finding somewhere structurally able to cope. The idea is it goes somewhere visible and accessible to as many people as possible. ""Campsies Centre Ltd have kind of been custodians investigating various options - chances are it'll need to be a purpose built area to accommodate it.""

"Banks across Scotland, including in Beauly, Stonehaven and Dalbeattie have closed A third of banks in Scotland have closed since 2010, new analysis has found - raising fresh concerns about people's access to cash. Consumer group Which? found 610 banks and building societies closed between 2010 and 2018, with the total number dropping from 1,625 to 1,015. The watchdog said ""urgent regulatory action"" was needed. It came as MPs on the Scottish Affairs Committee met in Westminster on Tuesday to discuss access to cash. They were due to hear from Which?, Citizens Advice and Scottish Rural Action on the impact the branch closures are having on communities and businesses across Scotland. Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, said: ""These ongoing closures could have a huge impact on communities across Scotland, stripping millions of people reliant on cash of their ability to go about their daily lives. ""Cash is also a vital backup when digital systems fail - so the UK government must appoint a regulator to oversee these changes and ensure no-one is shut out from paying for local goods and services."" Banks 'failed to engage' over closures Santander to shut 15 Scottish branches RBS to close more than a third of branches The research found Edinburgh south-west had the most bank closures, cutting the network by 135 branches down to a total of 30. Glasgow Central came second, having lost 70, while Edinburgh North and Leith lost 65 and Edinburgh East lost 45. Angus, Dundee West, Falkirk and Paisley and Renfrewshire North all lost 15 branches. Since 2015 RBS has closed the most branches, shutting 158 of the 399 banks that have closed in those three years. Bank of Scotland closed 86, Clydesdale closed 59, Santander closed 38 and TSB closed 35. Which? warned that a reduction in banks was made worse by an increase in ATM closures Stuart Mackinnon, external affairs manager for the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, said the Which? research chimed with their own. He added: ""Not only does the closure of a bank branch make it more difficult for businesses to access banking services, it also leaves another ugly gap on a high street or in a town centre. ""For many businesses, as long as a significant share of their customers want to continue to use cash, there needs to be appropriate local financial infrastructure. ""Policymakers need to take action to stop financial institutions removing this infrastructure from our communities."" Philip Grant, chairman of the Scottish executive committee of the Lloyds Banking Group Bonar Bridge in Sutherland lost its bank - a branch of the Bank of Scotland - in 2017. It is now one of more than 100 communities across Scotland serviced by a mobile bank by Lloyds Banking Group, operators of the Bank of Scotland. Philip Grant, chairman of the group's Scottish executive committee, was in Bonar Bridge on Tuesday on one of his regular visits to rural locations the group offers its services to. He told BBC Scotland that technology had changed the way people ""shopped, banked and even just accessed general information"". Mr Grant said: ""We all know there has been a huge behavioural shift in the last few years and it has affected us. ""Fewer of our customers are using branches. Actually 80% of them are using alternative ways to access their banking. ""We are having to respond, adjust, innovate to ensure that we can provide for all our bank customers' needs."" Michael Baird said he had been given assurances of help and advice for residents banking online Bonar bridge resident Michael Baird, who campaigned to save his local branch from closing, met with Mr Grant during his visit. Mr Baird he had been assured that banking through the local Post Office was now easier, and also welcomed an offer of workshops provide advice on how to stay bank online safely. But David Richardson, development manager for the Federation of Small Businesses Highlands and Islands, described the loss of bank branches as ""sad"". He said: ""It has been happening far too much. ""Eight years and 33% of banks closing, it is a sad tale and it has a massive impact on remote and rural areas."" David Richardson said the loss of bank branches was 'sad' Which? also highlighted an increase in the rate of cashpoint closures - 290 in Scotland last year - as it warned of a ""huge impact on communities across Scotland"", particularly in rural areas. The majority of cash machines that were lost were free-to-use. In February, the watchdog urged the UK government to appoint a regulator to protect access to cash. Bank customers hit by dozens of IT shutdowns While digital payments are rising, cash is still a necessity for more than 25 million people across the UK, according to the watchdog. A previous survey by the consumer group found that 75% of people in Scotland use cash frequently, while just 4% said they rarely use this payment method. Brian Sloan, chief executive of Age Scotland, said the ""alarming"" reduction in banks and free ATMs ""disproportionately impacts the lives of older people"" who were less likely to use digital banking. He continued: ""The extraordinary push by the banks to digital services leaves behind the 500,000 people in Scotland over the age of 60 who do not use the internet. ""That's the equivalent of the population of our capital city and is a staggering number of people to disenfranchise. ""What's more, with an ageing population in Scotland and the projected 50% increase in people living with dementia over the next 20 years, older people will find it harder and harder to manage their finances independently if face to face banking options have been eroded to the point of extinction. ""Banks must now properly explore shared banking hubs to serve the communities who have been left with no branch and to sustain a network across the country which is fit for people of all ages."" An HM Treasury spokesman said decisions to open and close branches were commercial decision made by the banks themselves. But he added: ""The government does not intervene in these decisions. But we understand the impact that closures can have on communities and people's jobs. ""Banks must now give customers as much notice as possible when a branch is closing, and ensure they are made aware of the options they have locally to continue to access banking services.""

"Prosecutors argued there was nothing to prevent Jack Shepherd being extradited from Georgia Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd is to be sent back to the UK after agreeing to his extradition from Georgia. The 31-year-old went on the run before his trial where he was found guilty of manslaughter following a speedboat crash on the River Thames which killed Charlotte Brown. After months in hiding in the capital, Tbilisi, hehanded himself into policeand was jailed for three months. Shepherd has been granted the right to appeal against his UK conviction. Judge Arsen Kalatozishvili agreed to the extradition going ahead, following a hearing at Tbilisi City Court. The court heard Shepherd'sextradition orderwas based on both the manslaughter offence and a separate assault charge. The second charge relates to an incident - shortly before Shepherd fled to Tbilisi - inMoretonhampstead, Devon, on 16 March 2018. Shepherd is accused of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. This video can not be played Jack Shepherd's cell in Tbilisi Defence lawyers said Shepherd had agreed to be extradited, but only if his safety was taken into consideration by the judge. Speaking before the hearing, his lawyer Mariam Kublashvili told Rustavi-2 TV Shepherd feared for his safety in the UK. She said: ""Because of the attitude of the British media and public he truly does not feel himself to be human."" Shepherd's boat was found to have several defects Outlining the extradition case, prosecutor Naniko Zazunashvili argued there was nothing to prevent Shepherd being sent back to the UK. Ms Zazunashvili said: ""He knew the boat was not in good working order and knew Charlotte Brown had no skills to control the boat - and he let her control the boat. ""While being on board the boat Jack Shepherd took obligation to take care of Charlotte Brown, but this obligation was violated. ""He knew boat was in poor working order. We are sure that if he is extradited there will be no threat to his life."" MP James Brokenshire said Charlotte Brown's family ""clearly welcome the news"" that Shepherd agreed to be extradited. ""It is their wish that he now accepts responsibility and atones for his actions, also that he drops the appeal against his conviction which can only cause more pain and anguish,"" he added. Steve Rosenberg, BBC News Moscow correspondent, Tbilisi Jack Shepherd gave himself up in the former Soviet state in January after months on the run In Courtroom Number 3, Jack Shepherd sat impassively while his fate was being decided. After the prosecution had set out the case for extradition, Shepherd's defence team dismissed the arguments as ""groundless"". But Shepherd had already decided to return to Britain. ""He agrees to extradition,"" announced one of the defence lawyers. When the judge invited him to speak, Shepherd confirmed the decision. He was ready to return to the UK, he said, because he wanted to take part in his Appeal Court hearing. Two months after he handed himself in to Georgian police, the legal process in Georgia appears to be nearing its conclusion. The extradition order will need to be approved by the Georgian Justice Minister, before Shepherd can leave Georgia. One of Shepherd's lawyers in Georgia, Tariel Kakabadze, said he could return to the UK within two weeks. Shepherd met Ms Brown online and they went on a date on 8 December. He invited her to go on a speedboat ride. They were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge at about midnight. Ms Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, was found in the water unconscious and unresponsive. Shepherd was clinging to the upturned boat. Shepherd made his first appearance at the Old Bailey on 26 January 2018, when he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was released on unconditional bail by Judge Richard Marks QC, but failed to show up for his trial and was later sentenced in his absence to six years in jail. What we know about the Jack Shepherd case The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Despite being on the run, Shepherdwon the right to appeal against his conviction.

"Prosecutors argued there was nothing to prevent Jack Shepherd being extradited from Georgia Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd is to be sent back to the UK after agreeing to his extradition from Georgia. The 31-year-old went on the run before his trial where he was found guilty of manslaughter following a speedboat crash on the River Thames which killed Charlotte Brown. After months in hiding in the capital, Tbilisi, hehanded himself into policeand was jailed for three months. Shepherd has been granted the right to appeal against his UK conviction. Judge Arsen Kalatozishvili agreed to the extradition going ahead, following a hearing at Tbilisi City Court. The court heard Shepherd'sextradition orderwas based on both the manslaughter offence and a separate assault charge. The second charge relates to an incident - shortly before Shepherd fled to Tbilisi - inMoretonhampstead, Devon, on 16 March 2018. Shepherd is accused of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. This video can not be played Jack Shepherd's cell in Tbilisi Defence lawyers said Shepherd had agreed to be extradited, but only if his safety was taken into consideration by the judge. Speaking before the hearing, his lawyer Mariam Kublashvili told Rustavi-2 TV Shepherd feared for his safety in the UK. She said: ""Because of the attitude of the British media and public he truly does not feel himself to be human."" Shepherd's boat was found to have several defects Outlining the extradition case, prosecutor Naniko Zazunashvili argued there was nothing to prevent Shepherd being sent back to the UK. Ms Zazunashvili said: ""He knew the boat was not in good working order and knew Charlotte Brown had no skills to control the boat - and he let her control the boat. ""While being on board the boat Jack Shepherd took obligation to take care of Charlotte Brown, but this obligation was violated. ""He knew boat was in poor working order. We are sure that if he is extradited there will be no threat to his life."" MP James Brokenshire said Charlotte Brown's family ""clearly welcome the news"" that Shepherd agreed to be extradited. ""It is their wish that he now accepts responsibility and atones for his actions, also that he drops the appeal against his conviction which can only cause more pain and anguish,"" he added. Steve Rosenberg, BBC News Moscow correspondent, Tbilisi Jack Shepherd gave himself up in the former Soviet state in January after months on the run In Courtroom Number 3, Jack Shepherd sat impassively while his fate was being decided. After the prosecution had set out the case for extradition, Shepherd's defence team dismissed the arguments as ""groundless"". But Shepherd had already decided to return to Britain. ""He agrees to extradition,"" announced one of the defence lawyers. When the judge invited him to speak, Shepherd confirmed the decision. He was ready to return to the UK, he said, because he wanted to take part in his Appeal Court hearing. Two months after he handed himself in to Georgian police, the legal process in Georgia appears to be nearing its conclusion. The extradition order will need to be approved by the Georgian Justice Minister, before Shepherd can leave Georgia. One of Shepherd's lawyers in Georgia, Tariel Kakabadze, said he could return to the UK within two weeks. Shepherd met Ms Brown online and they went on a date on 8 December. He invited her to go on a speedboat ride. They were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge at about midnight. Ms Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, was found in the water unconscious and unresponsive. Shepherd was clinging to the upturned boat. Shepherd made his first appearance at the Old Bailey on 26 January 2018, when he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was released on unconditional bail by Judge Richard Marks QC, but failed to show up for his trial and was later sentenced in his absence to six years in jail. What we know about the Jack Shepherd case The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Despite being on the run, Shepherdwon the right to appeal against his conviction. However, the Court of Appeal said Shepherd had been refused permission to appeal against his sentence.

"This video can not be played âYou go through labour â but thereâs no baby's cryâ Coroners in England and Wales may be given new powers to investigate stillbirths, so that each baby death is independently assessed. The government isconsulting,externalon the move to help bereaved parents gain answers on what went wrong and why and to help prevent more baby deaths. Nine babies are stillborn every day in the UK. That's one in every 225 births, although rates have been going down. In many cases, doctors are unable to tell parents why their baby died. Currently, coroners can hold inquests only for babies who have shown signs of life after being born. When a pregnancy that appeared to be healthy ends in stillbirth, the hospital caring for the mother will investigate. Asafety investigation body,externalfunded by the Department of Health and Social Care may look into it too. While many parents are satisfied with existing processes, some have raised concerns about the inconsistency of investigations and have called for a more transparent and independent system. Under the proposed new system that ministers are consulting on: Coroners in England and Wales would have powers to investigate all full-term stillbirths, occurring from 37 weeks pregnancy They would not have to gain consent or permission from any third party in exercising this power The coroner would consider whether any lessons could be learned Their investigations would not replace current investigations by the hospital or NHS agencies The joint consultation, from the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Health and Social Care, wants to hear a wide range of views, from bereaved parents and the organisations that support them, as well as health professionals. Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price said: ""We want to do everything we can to make pregnancy safer, by continually learning to improve the care on offer so fewer people have to experience the terrible tragedy of losing a child and those who do get the answers and support they deserve."" Justice Minister Edward Argar said: ""Although we have robust processes in place at the moment to investigate stillbirths, we think we can go further and we should go further. ""The use of coroners to investigate them in an open and transparent way would not only help bring closure to families who have suffered this tragedy but would also help us to learn lessons for the future to help further reduce the number of stillbirths."" The consultation will run for 12 weeks, closing on 18 June 2019.

"The conquistador HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s (centre left) and the Aztec emperor Montezuma II Mexico's president has sent a letter to Spain's King Felipe VI and Pope Francis urging them to apologise for human rights abuses committed during the conquest of the region 500 years ago. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said the indigenous peoples of Mexico had been the victims of massacres. Speaking in the ruins of an ancient city, he called for a full account of the abuses. Spain rejected his call and called for a ""constructive perspective"" instead. The territory which now makes up Mexico was under Spanish rule for some 300 years before gaining independence in the early 19th Century. At the time of the conquest, Spain was a fiercely Roman Catholic country and saw as its mission the spread of Christianity to regions such as the Americas. The man who became Mexico's first leftist president in seven decades has been pursuing a radical agenda since being sworn in in December, promising to tackle corruption, reduce inequality and lift millions of Mexicans out of poverty. On Monday, he tweeted a video address from an archaeological site in Comacalco, Tabasco, where he is shown speaking alongside the First Lady, Beatriz Gutierrez. Allow Twitter content?

""I have sent a letter to the Spanish king [Felipe VI] and another letter to the Pope so that the abuses can be acknowledged and an apology can be made to the indigenous peoples for the violations of what we now call human rights,"" Mr LÃ³pez Obrador says. ""There were massacres... The so-called conquest was done with the sword and the cross. They raised churches on top of temples."" President Lopez Obrador welcomed Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez to Mexico in January ""The time has come to reconcile but first they should ask forgiveness,"" the president says. Mexico has the world's second biggest Roman Catholic population, after Brazil. Just over a fifth of Mexicans consider themselves to be indigenous but studies suggest many more have some pre-Hispanic ancestry. When Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez visited Mexico in January he presented President LÃ³pez Obrador with his grandfather JosÃ© Obrador's Spanish birth certificate, from 1893, AFP news agency reports. The Mexican leader's relations with Spain's centre-left ruling party have been friendly but the government in Madrid promptly rejected his request for an apology. Mexico country profile Pope apologises to indigenous Mexicans ""The arrival, 500 years ago, of Spaniards to present Mexican territory cannot be judged in the light of contemporary considerations,"" the government said in a statement. ""Our two brother nations have always known how to read our shared past without anger and with a constructive perspective."" There was no immediate comment from the Vatican but three years ago, on a visit to Mexico, Pope Francis asked indigenous people for forgiveness over the way they had been excluded from society. During a visit to Mexico in 2016, Pope Francis said the indigenous peoples had suffered centuries of discrimination ""Some have considered your values, culture and traditions to be inferior. Others, intoxicated by power, money and market trends, have stolen your lands or contaminated them. How sad this is,"" he said. ""How worthwhile it would be for each of us to examine our conscience and learn to say, 'Forgive me!'"" It started with an expedition led by Christopher Columbus in 1492. The conquest of Mexico began in 1519 when a small army led by HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s landed in the modern-day state of Veracruz. Aztec relics could lead to royal tomb Within two years, the Spanish had overcome the powerful Aztec Empire. Their victory was attributed to the skilled leadership of CortÃ©s, who made local allies for his campaign against the Aztecs, as well as their superior weapons. Large numbers of indigenous people died in battle or in massacres such as that at Cholula, while diseases the Spanish inadvertently brought with them accounted for massive loss of life.

"MPs have voted to take control of the parliamentary timetable in an unprecedented move to try to find a majority for any Brexit option. The prime minister was dealt a fresh blow as the government was defeated by 329 votes to 302, setting up votes on Wednesday to find out what kind of Brexit has most support among MPs. Theresa May has said there is no guarantee she will abide by their wish. Thirty Tory MPs voted against the government, including three ministers. Richard Harrington, Alistair Burt and Steve Brine resigned to join the rebels, with Mr Harrington accusing the government of ""playing roulette with the lives and livelihoods"" of Britons. Live page: Reaction as MPs take control Analysis: May loses more ministers and control What do voters make of Brexit now? What is Common Market 2.0? Former industry minister Mr Harrington said: ""It's absurd that now we are in a position of political impasse and... Parliament hasn't actually talked about it on the floor of the House of Commons. That's what I call a democratic deficit."" Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Mrs May had tried to head off a defeat by offering MPs a series of votes on Brexit alternatives, organised by the government. She said allowing MPs to take over the Commons agenda would set an ""unwelcome precedent"". But supporters of Conservative backbencher Sir Oliver Letwin's cross-party amendment said they did not trust the government to give MPs a say on the full range of Brexit options. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was among them. He said the government ""must take the process seriously"". He added: ""The government has failed and this House must, and I believe will, succeed."" He said MPs would want to find a consensus on the way forward, including a possible ""confirmatory vote"" on the PM's deal by the public - something Mrs May told MPs earlier she did not want because Remain would be on the ballot paper. MPs involved in the bid on Monday night say if there is a majority for a plan that's not the prime minister's deal then there would be ""uproar"" if Theresa May tried to ignore it. It is possible, of course, that Brexiteers who have been resisting the prime minister's deal so far take fright at Parliament having more control of the process, and are more likely to come in line. That's because, generally, the make-up of MPs are more likely to back a softer deal than the one on offer. So faced with the choice of Theresa May's compromise this week, or a much longer wrangle to a closer relationship with the EU than the prime minister has negotiated, it is not impossible that the numbers will move in her favour. Read Laura's blog Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""Another humiliating defeat for a prime minister who has lost complete control of her party, her cabinet and of the Brexit process. ""Parliament has fought back - and now has the chance to decide what happens next."" Hilary Benn said MPs have to take responsibility for the Brexit process because the government is not doing its job. Mr Benn, chairman of the Commons exiting the European Union committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""If the government isn't going to do its job then Parliament is going to have to take responsibility, and that is what we are doing on Wednesday."" The SNP's Joanna Cherry said: ""It isn't just Wednesday. Now that Parliament has control of the order paper... on Wednesday Parliament could award itself another day and so on and so forth. ""The consensus we are now trying to build is something Theresa May should have reached out to try to build two years ago."" Conservative former Brexit Minister Suella Braverman told the BBC's Newsnight it was ""a Parliamentary massacre"". ""MPs [in the House of Commons] where we know there is a majority against Brexit, who don't want to respect the referendum, who don't want to honour referendum pledges, are seeking to overturn that and it's unacceptable,"" she said. Mr Harrington saidin his resignation letter,externalthat as industry minister, he had been told the government approach was ""resulting in cancelled investment decisions, business being placed abroad and a sense of ridicule for British businesses"". The MP said he thought it unlikely the Commons would back revoking Article 50, but another referendum to see ""where the public are at"" would be ""very legitimate"". In a series of so-calledindicative votes, MPs will be able to vote on a number of options - likely to include a ""softer Brexit"", a customs union with the EU and another referendum - designed to test the will of Parliament to see what, if anything, commands a majority. But the precise format of the votes and how they will work was not set out in the amendment. And the prime minister said she was ""sceptical"" about the process - as it was not guaranteed to produce a majority for any one course of action - and she would not commit the government to abiding by the result. ""The votes could lead to an outcome that is un-negotiable with the EU,"" she told MPs. This video can not be played Political correspondent Nick Eardley with a Brexit update Parliament is expected to pass a law this week postponing the Brexit date from 29 March to at least 12 April. A Department for Exiting the EU spokesman said that when considering Brexit options, MPs should take account of how long negotiating them would take and whether this would require a longer delay and the UK having to take part in European Parliamentary elections. Those elections are taking place between 23 and 26 May. Both the British government and European Commission believe that if the UK has not exited the EU by the end of May it will be legally required to hold elections. Mrs May remains committed to winning over MPs to the withdrawal agreement she negotiated with the EU. She said on Monday it did not have enough support to get through the Commons ""as things stand"", but she still hoped to persuade enough MPs to back it so she could hold another vote on it this week. The deal has already been rejected twice by a large margin - and the PM was forced to ask the EU for Brexit to be delayed. On Monday the government was defeated on its main motion, as amended by Sir Oliver Letwin, by 327 votes to 300, a majority of 27. The government narrowly defeated a bid by Labour's Dame Margaret Beckett to give MPs a vote on asking for another Brexit extension if a deal has not been approved by 5 April. Dame Margaret's amendment was voted down by 314 to 311, a majority of three. Brexit: How did my MP vote on taking control?

"The number of potholes repaired by councils in England and Wales rose by more than one-fifth last year. Some 330,000 more potholes were filled than in 2017/18, with spending on roads maintenance up 20%, a study says. However, the Asphalt Industry Alliance annual survey suggests much of the Â£24.5m was spent on short-term ""patch and mend"" work to 1.86 million holes. Councils would need to spend Â£9.79bn over 10 years to bring all roads up to scratch, the AIA says. The Local Government Association says fixing roads is a priority. ""Faced with severe financial pressures, councils have managed to spend more on road repairs in the past year in order to fix a pothole every 17 seconds,"" said Martin Tett, transport spokesman for the body which represents councils. Department for Transport issues pothole warning Reality Check- Is our pothole problem getting worse Why do we have so many potholes? However, the AIA says the responses of local authorities to its survey revealed a ""big discrepancy"" in spending on roads between different councils. Some local authorities in England received highway maintenance funding equivalent to more than Â£90,000 per mile last year, while others had less than 10% of that, it said. AIA chairman Rick Green said: ""Sustained investment over a longer time frame is needed if we want a local road network that supports enhanced mobility, connectivity and productivity."" AA president Edmund King said the survey suggested the country was ""beginning to find its way out of the rut"". ""Increased funding and a milder winter presents an opportunity to begin to catch up on the backlog - but any slackening off will simply pitch our roads back into a deep hole,"" he said. RAC figures show drivers are two-and-a-half times more likely to suffer a pothole-related breakdown than in 2006. Its patrols received 1,714 call-outs between October and December 2018 for problems usually caused by road defects, such as damaged shock absorbers, broken suspension springs and distorted wheels. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""Potholes are a huge problem for all road users and the government is taking action, providing local authorities with more than Â£6.6bn for roads maintenance and pothole repair in the six years to 2021."" The government is also trialling new technologies to stop potholes from forming and consulting on increasing the standards of roadworks by utility companies to help keep roads pothole-free for longer, he added.

"Drugs company Sanofi has plans to fly supplies of flu vaccine into the UK if other transport routes are disrupted after the country leaves the EU. Hugo Fry, the managing director of its UK arm, toldBBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Moneythat the flu vaccine was one it was not possible to stockpile. ""We prepare in different ways and have prepared many different routes into the UK,"" he said. ""If we have to in the end, we will airlift it in."" He added: ""We are eating the cost of that but patients and citizens are our primary concern, so we're quite happy to take that cost and make that planning."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""Those sorts of medicines can be flown in and we have plans for that. I pay tribute to Sanofi and other pharmaceutical companies - they have done an enormous amount of work to make sure people will be safe and medicines can flow. ""In the health department we don't use the word guarantee, as this is a complex system and there are lots of levers beyond our control such as how the French government responds on the Dover/Calais border. ""However, Sanofi have done a tremendous amount of work to ensure people can get their drugs unhindered and if necessary we'll fly them in."" Drug makers Sanofi and Novartis stockpiling for Brexit Brexit food stockpiling loan ad banned Warehouses thriving from Brexit stockpiling Sanofi says it is the second biggest of three suppliers of flu vaccines in the UK - behind Seqirus and ahead of Mylan. While Sanofi has plans to keep stockpiles of insulin and vaccines in place for 12 months, Mr Fry said this was not possible with the flu vaccine. ""You can't stockpile it because it's made at a particular time of the year and it's only available to import in the month at the end of August/beginning of September,"" he said. Last August, Sanofi said it was increasing its stocks by four weeks to give it a 14-week supply of medicines. Most of the French company's supplies enter the UK through the Channel Tunnel and disruption to that route in 2005, when there were strikes in France, led to around four weeks of disruption. Mr Fry added: ""We're doing everything possible to make sure that everyone will get their medicines and vaccines so that they can be reassured and they don't have to worry about it. He added that the day after Brexit happens, patients would be able to get their hands on all drugs that it was possible to stockpile. For the current flu season, Sanofi provided more than seven million vaccines to the UK. There are different vaccines for people aged under 65 in at risk groups and for people who are older than 65. Sanofi and Seqirus supply both age groups, while Mylan have vaccines only for the younger of the two age groups. There is a tender process to decide which company provides vaccines in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while in England and Wales, GPs decide who will supply the vaccines. The tenders for the 2019-20 flu season have already come out, while doctors are currently in the process of deciding who they want to be their supplier.

The committee has urged ministers to build in guarantees to ensure EU citizens will be entitled to the same rights as now. According to the report, the bill as it stands relies on the home secretary enacting secondary legislation - laws created using powers given to ministers by Parliament - to restore the same rights that people from EU countries have at the moment. The committee adds that it is proposing amendments to the legislation so that current protections and guarantees can be enshrined in law. Its chair, Labour MP Harriet Harman, said: ""We're talking about the rights of people who have resided in the UK for years, decades even, paying into our social security system or even having been born in the UK and lived here their whole lives. ""Promising that everything will be worked out in the future is not good enough, it must be a guarantee."" The committee also highlighted concerns about the settlement scheme for EU nationals, notably around the time limit and the lack of a physical proof of status.

In a separate case, the 48-year-old has been accused of embezzlement. Mr Avenatti has denied attempting to extort Nike.

Mr Avenatti appeared in a New York court on Monday and was released on $300,000 (Â£227,000) bail on condition that he surrender his US and Italian passports. He did not enter a plea. Outside court, he said he was confident he would be ""fully exonerated"".

According to federal prosecutors in New York,external, Mr Avenatti met a lawyer for Nike earlier this month. During their meeting, he allegedly threatened to release damaging information about the company unless it paid him and another, unnamed co-conspirator between $15m (Â£11.4m) and $25m (Â£19m). He also demanded $1.5m (Â£1.13m) for an individual he claimed to represent. Mr Avenatti reportedly threatened to take $10bn (Â£7.56bn) off Nike's market value.

"MPs and peers raised concerns about the UK settlement scheme for EU citizens EU citizens in Britain could be denied access to benefits such as council housing and social security payments after Brexit, a report has warned. MPs are debating ending EU nationals' right to live and work in the UK.

The Home Office says the government has already committed to protecting the rights of EU citizens in the UK.

"This video can not be played Potholes: NI motorists receive over Â£1m since 2016 Compensation paid to drivers in Northern Ireland whose vehicles were damaged by potholes and other road defects has more than doubled in the last two years. The amount of compensation rose from Â£321,849 in 2016 to Â£751,926 in 2018. The figures were obtained by BBC News NI under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. It comes as a public spending watchdog warned it would cost more than Â£1bn to deal with structural maintenance. A public spending watchdog has raised concerns about the impact of funding shortfalls on Northern Ireland's roads The Northern Ireland Audit Office (NIAO) has published a report highlighting how a lack of investment is having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Ireland's road network. Â£495k compensation payments over potholes Is our pothole problem getting worse? Pothole photos: Your pictures of crumbling roads The Department for Infrastructure said the audit office report highlighted that funding for road maintenance has been below the level required for a number of years. A spokesperson said it identified the need for ""planned, timely, targeted intervention"". In its report, the audit office estimates it will take Â£1.2bn to clear the backlog of structural maintenance across Northern Ireland. Auditor general Kieran Donnelly said: ""We're about Â£50m short every year. ""We're spending in Northern Ireland about Â£90m on average a year on road maintenance, we would need to spend on average about Â£140m just to stay level, to keep the roads from deteriorating."" He added: ""It's not just damage to vehicles, it's also personal injury claims as well and they're running around Â£4m per year at present. ""The short-term approach is to do a bit of patching, whereas more preventative maintenance is a better job in the long-run and provide better value for money ""The experts say that the actual patching reactive maintenance should only be about 10% of the budget, but in Northern Ireland it's been consistently a lot more than that, more like 30%."" Mr Donnelly said that 4,000 claims for vehicle defects were made in 2017/18. in Northern Ireland between 2016 and 2018 Â£1.2mpaid out for vehicle damage compensation 311,124road defects recorded across Northern Ireland The FOI statistics on the number of road defects across Northern Ireland were released to BBC News NI by the Department of Infrastructure. Road defects include cracks and potholes recorded on carriageways, hard shoulders and lay-by surfaces. The data shows that in 2018, there were 127,173 road defects recorded across Northern Ireland, an increase of 60,000 on the previous year. It also confirmed that the number of successful vehicle damage claims rose from 1,590 in 2016 to 3,533 in 2018. The road with the largest number of defects (162) in 2018 was the Ballyfannahan Road in County Armagh. This was followed by the Hillhead road in Ballyclare (147) and the Upper Dromore Road in Warrenpoint (145). Darkley Road in Keady in County Armagh ""Road maintenance is rarely a vote winner when compared to high-profile bypasses and dual-carriageways,"" said roads expert Wesley Johnston.

Mr Johnston believes additional funding is the only way to address the problem. ""Unless maintenance funding is increased, this problem is only going to get worse. But the money has to come from somewhere, so it could mean fewer badly-needed road upgrades are provided,"" he said.

"Fences already run along stretches of the US-Mexico border The Pentagon has authorised the transfer of $1bn (Â£758m) to army engineers for new wall construction along the US-Mexico border. The funds are the first under the national emergency declared by President Donald Trump to bypass Congress and build the barrier he pledged during his election campaign. Democrats have protested against the move. The funds will be used to build about 57 miles (91km) of fencing. President Trump has called the situation at the southern border a ""crisis"" and insists a physical barrier is needed to stop criminals crossing into the US. His critics say he has manufactured the border emergency. A Pentagon statement said acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan had ""authorised the commander of the US Army Corps of Engineers to begin planning and executing up to $1bn in support to the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol"". Trump's wall - all you need to know in seven charts Trump faces anger over wall emergency plan A major land grab by Trump The statement cited a federal law,externalthat ""gives the Department of Defence the authority to construct roads and fences and to install lighting to block drug-smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States in support of counter-narcotic activities of federal law enforcement agencies"". As well the 18ft-high (5m) ""pedestrian fencing"", the funds will cover road improvements and new lights. House Armed Services Chair Adam Smith sent a letter on Tuesday rejecting the Pentagon's transfer, saying the committee would not approve the use of defence funds ""to construct additional physical barriers and roads or install lighting in the vicinity of the United States border"". This contention between the Pentagon and lawmakers could set up a legal challenge about which area of the government has control over re-allocating such funds, US media say. Thousands of people cross the border every year seeking a new life in the US Democratic senators also complained that the Pentagon had not sought permission from the appropriate committees before notifying Congress of the funds transfer. ""We strongly object to both the substance of the funding transfer, and to the department implementing the transfer without seeking the approval of the congressional defence committees and in violation of provisions in the defence appropriation itself,"" the senators wrote in a letter to Mr Shanahan, CNN reported. Mr Trump declared the emergency on 15 February after Congress refused his requests for $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) to construct the wall. By declaring an emergency he sought to bypass Congress and build the wall with military funding. Democrats branded the declaration unconstitutional. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a resolution to overturn the emergency last month, and 12 Republicans later sided with Democratic Senators to get it through the Senate. This video can not be played Trump issues first veto of his presidency However, Mr Trump vetoed the resolution earlier this month. Congress failed to obtain the requisite two-thirds majority to override the veto on Tuesday, with a vote of 248-181 that saw only 14 Republicans voting with Democrats.

"Senator Pauline Hanson's chief of staff, James Ashby, was filmed in conversations in Washington DC A right-wing party in Australia discussed softening the nation's strict gun laws as it sought donations from a US lobby group in a bid for greater political power, video recordings show. Representatives from One Nation, an anti-Islam minor party, met with the National Rifle Association last year. Australian PM Scott Morrison saysthe videos, secretly filmed by Al Jazeera,external, showed ""deeply concerning"" discussions. The representatives say they had been drinking when they were recorded. On Tuesday Mr Morrison asserted that Australia's gun laws were the ""world's best"", adding ""we will not be changing them"". It comes in the aftermath of the killings of 50 Muslims in shooting attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern referenced Australia's gun law reforms - swiftly introduced after a 1996 massacre - before announcing her own crackdown last week. New Zealand to ban military style weapons How mass shootings have changed gun laws One Nation, led by Senator Pauline Hanson, won four seats in Australia's 2016 election, but it has since been plagued by defections and infighting. In September 2018, journalist Rodger Muller posed as a pro-gun activist and secretly filmed Ms Hanson's chief-of-staff, James Ashby, and another party figure, Steve Dickson, in Washington DC. Mr Ashby is filmed saying he wants to raise A$20m (Â£11m; $14m). Mr Dickson says: ""If we could get that amount of money, imagine, we could change Australia."" He adds: ""We are pro-guns and pro people in this party owning guns."" One Nation leader Pauline Hanson is yet to comment It is unclear if the officials ultimately received donations. One Nation leader wears burka in parliament 'Blood wiped on door' in senator scuffle Al Jazeera reported the pair had approached the NRA and other conservative groups in the US, such as Koch Industries. Many Australian lawmakers expressed concern on Tuesday and called on Ms Hanson to explain the videos. Mr Morrison tweeted: ""Reports that senior One Nation officials courted foreign political donations from the US gun lobby to influence our elections [and] undermine our gun laws that keep us safe are deeply concerning."" An independent senator, Derryn Hinch, said it was an ""obscene"" attempt to water down Australia's gun laws. Unregistered weapons surrendered during a gun amnesty in Australia in 2017 The government said it also raised questions over whether One Nation may have breached laws which ban political donations from foreign groups. Australia cracks down on foreign interference On Tuesday, One Nation said it ""strongly supports the rights of lawful gun ownership within Australia"". It criticised Al Jazeera as a ""propaganda arm of the Qatari government"", and said it had referred the news organisation to Australian police over ""foreign interference"" concerns.The high-profile media network has defended its editorial independencein the past. In a press conference, Mr Ashby and Mr Dickson, the two representatives recorded, said they had been drinking for ""three or four hours"" when the discussions took place. Mr Ashby said: ""I will be the first to admit, we'd arrived in America, we got on the sauce, we'd had a few drinks and that's where those donations took place - not with any potential donors, no one but Rodger Muller, Steve Dickson and myself."" Mr Dickson said journalist Rodger Muller ""seemed to be a reasonable guy"" and ""wore the akubra hat."" He said: ""I never ever suspected in my wildest dreams that this guy was employed by a Middle Eastern country, by Al Jazeera, as an Australian spy to interfere with Australian politics. ""This is the stuff you see in James Bond movies."" Australia overhauled its gun laws after 35 people were killed in a mass shooting in Tasmania in 1996. The changes banned semi-automatic and self-loading weapons, and introduced tougher requirements on purchasing guns. The revived gun ownership debate in Australia Would Australia's gun laws help the US? Australians hand in 57,000 guns in amnesty Firearms must also be registered, and owners must have a licence. The number of Australia's mass shootings dropped from 11 in the decade before 1996, to two in the years since: the murder-suicide of a family of five in New South Wales in 2014, andthe murder-suicide of a family of seven in Western Australia last year.

"This video can not be played 'Simone' explains how her mum ironed her breasts aged 13 Breast ironing awareness should be made part of the mandatory school curriculum to protect young girls from abuse, the National Education Union has said. The practice involves ironing a girl's chest with hot objects to delay breasts from growing, so she does not attract male attention. Conservative MP Nicky Morgan said teachers must also be educated, as they have a ""very important role to play"". The Home Office said teachers have a duty to report concerns. ""Kinaya"" - whose name we have changed - lives in the UK. Her family descends from west Africa - where breast ironing originates - and she was subjected to it aged 10. She said her mother told her that ""if I don't iron them, men will start coming to you, to have sex with you"". It is often the child's mother who will undertake the breast ironing, which usually involves heating a stone or spoon on a flame then pressing, massaging or flattening the breast. This can go on for months. ""Time does not erase that kind of pain,"" Kinaya explained. ""You're not even allowed to cry out. If you do, you [are said to] have brought shame to your family, you are not a 'strong girl'."" ""Kinaya"" and her daughter Kinaya is now an adult with daughters of her own. When her eldest turned 10, her mother proposed that she be breast ironed. ""I said, 'No, no, no, none of my children are going to go through what I went through, as I still live with the trauma."" She has since moved away from her family, believing there was a real risk they would have performed breast ironing on her daughters without her consent. Some girls are also made to wear an extremely tight strap around their chest It is thought that around 1,000 girls in the UK have been affected by breast ironing. But while awareness is growing around female genital mutilation (FGM), there are fears that few people know about breast ironing. One woman told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she only realised breast ironing was not normal when she discovered her body looked different to her classmates during a PE class at her UK school, which led her to become distressed. Her sister had breast ironed her from age eight, but her teachers failed to notice when she became withdrawn and stopped wanting to take part in PE lessons. ""If my PE teacher had known, if they were trained, I could have had the help I needed growing up,"" she said. Kiri Tunks, joint president of the National Education Union, is now calling for school staff - and in particular PE teachers - to be taught how to notice the signs. She also wants it to be covered in schools in the same way asFGM will be from 2020,as part of compulsory relationships and sex education classes in secondary schools. Ms Morgan said issues such as breast ironing should be ""tackled, addressed, talked about and stopped"". She added that the curriculum should be kept ""under review as different areas of practice, custom or abuse come to light"". Those working with girls and young women should also be taught to recognise that breast ironing is taking place in the UK, she continued, and to be able to ""advise the young person on what action they need to take"". A heated stone is often used in breast ironing One woman, ""Simone"", told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she was breast ironed aged 13 when her mum found out that she was gay. ""According to her, maybe I was attractive because of my breasts, so if she can iron them and I'm flat, then maybe I'll be ugly and no-one will admire me."" In her case, the breast ironing went on for months. Like many young girls, she was also made to wear an extremely tight strap around her chest to suppress them even more - which caused her difficulty breathing. A few years later, when she had a baby to the man she was forced to marry, the long-term damage became apparent. ""When it comes to breast feeding, it's so strenuous, like there's a knot inside,"" she explained. ""It seemed like maybe some of the nerves were destroyed."" There is no specific offence for breast ironing, but the Home Office described it as a form of child abuse and said it should be prosecuted under general assault laws. Angie Marriott, a former gynaecological nurse who now works as a safeguarding lecturer for Cheshire Police, said that the true scale of breast ironing in the UK was being obscured because of under-reporting. She described it as a ""sensitive, hidden crime"", with women afraid to speak out for fear of being ""ousted from their communities"". ""I know this is happening because people have divulged it to me,"" she said. ""And they've said it's the first time openly that they've ever spoken about what's happened to them, and they felt ashamed."" Angie Marriott says many women are too scared to report they have had their breasts ironed Simone still bears the scars from the abuse she endured, and wants to raise awareness of the crime. ""To say the least, it's an abuse. It hurts, it dehumanises you,"" she said. ""You are not a human being.""

"This video can not be played âYou go through labour â but thereâs no baby's cryâ Coroners in England and Wales may be given new powers to investigate stillbirths, so that each baby death is independently assessed. The government isconsulting,externalon the move to help bereaved parents gain answers on what went wrong and why and to help prevent more baby deaths. Nine babies are stillborn every day in the UK. That's one in every 225 births, although rates have been going down. In many cases, doctors are unable to tell parents why their baby died. Currently, coroners can hold inquests only for babies who have shown signs of life after being born. When a pregnancy that appeared to be healthy ends in stillbirth, the hospital caring for the mother will investigate. Asafety investigation body,externalfunded by the Department of Health and Social Care may look into it too. While many parents are satisfied with existing processes, some have raised concerns about the inconsistency of investigations and have called for a more transparent and independent system. Under the proposed new system that ministers are consulting on: Coroners in England and Wales would have powers to investigate all full-term stillbirths, occurring from 37 weeks pregnancy They would not have to gain consent or permission from any third party in exercising this power The coroner would consider whether any lessons could be learned Their investigations would not replace current investigations by the hospital or NHS agencies The joint consultation, from the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Health and Social Care, wants to hear a wide range of views, from bereaved parents and the organisations that support them, as well as health professionals. Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price said: ""We want to do everything we can to make pregnancy safer, by continually learning to improve the care on offer so fewer people have to experience the terrible tragedy of losing a child and those who do get the answers and support they deserve."" Justice Minister Edward Argar said: ""Although we have robust processes in place at the moment to investigate stillbirths, we think we can go further and we should go further. ""The use of coroners to investigate them in an open and transparent way would not only help bring closure to families who have suffered this tragedy but would also help us to learn lessons for the future to help further reduce the number of stillbirths."" The consultation will run for 12 weeks, closing on 18 June 2019.

"The number of potholes repaired by councils in England and Wales rose by more than one-fifth last year. Some 330,000 more potholes were filled than in 2017/18, with spending on roads maintenance up 20%, a study says. However, the Asphalt Industry Alliance annual survey suggests much of the Â£24.5m was spent on short-term ""patch and mend"" work to 1.86 million holes. Councils would need to spend Â£9.79bn over 10 years to bring all roads up to scratch, the AIA says. The Local Government Association says fixing roads is a priority. ""Faced with severe financial pressures, councils have managed to spend more on road repairs in the past year in order to fix a pothole every 17 seconds,"" said Martin Tett, transport spokesman for the body which represents councils. Department for Transport issues pothole warning Reality Check- Is our pothole problem getting worse Why do we have so many potholes? However, the AIA says the responses of local authorities to its survey revealed a ""big discrepancy"" in spending on roads between different councils. Some local authorities in England received highway maintenance funding equivalent to more than Â£90,000 per mile last year, while others had less than 10% of that, it said. AIA chairman Rick Green said: ""Sustained investment over a longer time frame is needed if we want a local road network that supports enhanced mobility, connectivity and productivity."" AA president Edmund King said the survey suggested the country was ""beginning to find its way out of the rut"". ""Increased funding and a milder winter presents an opportunity to begin to catch up on the backlog - but any slackening off will simply pitch our roads back into a deep hole,"" he said. RAC figures show drivers are two-and-a-half times more likely to suffer a pothole-related breakdown than in 2006. Its patrols received 1,714 call-outs between October and December 2018 for problems usually caused by road defects, such as damaged shock absorbers, broken suspension springs and distorted wheels. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""Potholes are a huge problem for all road users and the government is taking action, providing local authorities with more than Â£6.6bn for roads maintenance and pothole repair in the six years to 2021."" The government is also trialling new technologies to stop potholes from forming and consulting on increasing the standards of roadworks by utility companies to help keep roads pothole-free for longer, he added.

"Senator Pauline Hanson's chief of staff, James Ashby, was filmed in conversations in Washington DC A right-wing party in Australia discussed softening the nation's strict gun laws as it sought donations from a US lobby group in a bid for greater political power, video recordings show. Representatives from One Nation, an anti-Islam minor party, met with the National Rifle Association last year. Australian PM Scott Morrison saysthe videos, secretly filmed by Al Jazeera,external, showed ""deeply concerning"" discussions. The representatives say they had been drinking when they were recorded. On Tuesday Mr Morrison asserted that Australia's gun laws were the ""world's best"", adding ""we will not be changing them"". It comes in the aftermath of the killings of 50 Muslims in shooting attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern referenced Australia's gun law reforms - swiftly introduced after a 1996 massacre - before announcing her own crackdown last week. New Zealand to ban military style weapons How mass shootings have changed gun laws One Nation, led by Senator Pauline Hanson, won four seats in Australia's 2016 election, but it has since been plagued by defections and infighting. In September 2018, journalist Rodger Muller posed as a pro-gun activist and secretly filmed Ms Hanson's chief-of-staff, James Ashby, and another party figure, Steve Dickson, in Washington DC. Mr Ashby is filmed saying he wants to raise A$20m (Â£11m; $14m). Mr Dickson says: ""If we could get that amount of money, imagine, we could change Australia."" He adds: ""We are pro-guns and pro people in this party owning guns."" One Nation leader Pauline Hanson is yet to comment It is unclear if the officials ultimately received donations. One Nation leader wears burka in parliament 'Blood wiped on door' in senator scuffle Al Jazeera reported the pair had approached the NRA and other conservative groups in the US, such as Koch Industries. Many Australian lawmakers expressed concern on Tuesday and called on Ms Hanson to explain the videos. Mr Morrison tweeted: ""Reports that senior One Nation officials courted foreign political donations from the US gun lobby to influence our elections [and] undermine our gun laws that keep us safe are deeply concerning."" An independent senator, Derryn Hinch, said it was an ""obscene"" attempt to water down Australia's gun laws. Unregistered weapons surrendered during a gun amnesty in Australia in 2017 The government said it also raised questions over whether One Nation may have breached laws which ban political donations from foreign groups. Australia cracks down on foreign interference On Tuesday, One Nation said it ""strongly supports the rights of lawful gun ownership within Australia"". It criticised Al Jazeera as a ""propaganda arm of the Qatari government"", and said it had referred the news organisation to Australian police over ""foreign interference"" concerns.The high-profile media network has defended its editorial independencein the past. In a press conference, Mr Ashby and Mr Dickson, the two representatives recorded, said they had been drinking for ""three or four hours"" when the discussions took place. Mr Ashby said: ""I will be the first to admit, we'd arrived in America, we got on the sauce, we'd had a few drinks and that's where those donations took place - not with any potential donors, no one but Rodger Muller, Steve Dickson and myself."" Mr Dickson said journalist Rodger Muller ""seemed to be a reasonable guy"" and ""wore the akubra hat."" He said: ""I never ever suspected in my wildest dreams that this guy was employed by a Middle Eastern country, by Al Jazeera, as an Australian spy to interfere with Australian politics. ""This is the stuff you see in James Bond movies."" Australia overhauled its gun laws after 35 people were killed in a mass shooting in Tasmania in 1996. The changes banned semi-automatic and self-loading weapons, and introduced tougher requirements on purchasing guns. The revived gun ownership debate in Australia Would Australia's gun laws help the US? Australians hand in 57,000 guns in amnesty Firearms must also be registered, and owners must have a licence. The number of Australia's mass shootings dropped from 11 in the decade before 1996, to two in the years since: the murder-suicide of a family of five in New South Wales in 2014, andthe murder-suicide of a family of seven in Western Australia last year. Gun control advocates have argued that aspects of Australia's laws,externalhave been eroded in recent years.

"Comedian Joe Lycett has said that the LGBT community has a ""problem"" with the way it communicates online. He's called for people to be ""compassionate"" when dealing with those who are unfamiliar with LGBT concepts. The TV presenter said he felt too many demands were placed on people to understand the different academic views on gender and sexuality. He said the LGBT community should try to help people who want to learn more about these issues. Lycett, whodescribes himself as pansexual,external, said: ""I'm loathe to call it 'my community' but I suppose it is as I am a member of it, can sometimes be guilty of expecting everyone to have done all of the reading and research that members of it have. ""Because lots of LGBTQ people are really smart, and there's so much really interesting reading that can be done, and so much academic writing that's been done about it, people can end up getting quite academic about it."" He said it's sometimes forgotten that people outside the LGBT community ""need to have it explained to them in a way that's compassionate, and is understanding that there's quite a lot to take in"". Joe Lycett can currently be seen presenting The Great British Sewing Bee on BBC Two Lycett said he hoped people would treat others in the way they expected to be treated themselves. ""I did a tweet about LGBTQ+ and someone was saying 'what's the + and what's the Q?' and some people would be like 'you should educate yourself it's disgusting, google it'. ""If I asked the question, they would answer it to me, so just try and treat people in the way I expect to be treated myself. ""So I do think that's been a problem in our community."" Equalities charity Stonewall agreed it was important to have conversations about sexual orientation and gender identity in a ""respectful way to help increase understanding and acceptance for LGBT people in society"". Lycett also presents the BBC One quiz show The Time It Takes In a statement to the BBC, they said: ""It's great that people want to better understand the right language to use when talking about LGBT people and their identities. ""Non-LGBT people who want to better support the community can start by learning about and listening to the experiences of LGBT people and the challenges we face."" The group advised: ""Getting to know more about LGBT people, our history and issues is an empowering step towards becoming an ally. ""Only by working together with allies can we create a world where no one faces violence, harassment and discrimination just because of who they are."" Lycett, who is currently presenting The Great British Sewing Bee, was speaking ahead of the launch of his new Channel 4 show Joe Lycett's Got Your Back, where he helps shoppers who feel they've been ripped off. ""I'm describing it as a 'sexy Watchdog' basically. It is a consumer show with a difference,"" he said.

"Fences already run along stretches of the US-Mexico border The Pentagon has authorised the transfer of $1bn (Â£758m) to army engineers for new wall construction along the US-Mexico border. The funds are the first under the national emergency declared by President Donald Trump to bypass Congress and build the barrier he pledged during his election campaign. Democrats have protested against the move. The funds will be used to build about 57 miles (91km) of fencing. President Trump has called the situation at the southern border a ""crisis"" and insists a physical barrier is needed to stop criminals crossing into the US. His critics say he has manufactured the border emergency. A Pentagon statement said acting US Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan had ""authorised the commander of the US Army Corps of Engineers to begin planning and executing up to $1bn in support to the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol"". Trump's wall - all you need to know in seven charts Trump faces anger over wall emergency plan A major land grab by Trump The statement cited a federal law,externalthat ""gives the Department of Defence the authority to construct roads and fences and to install lighting to block drug-smuggling corridors across international boundaries of the United States in support of counter-narcotic activities of federal law enforcement agencies"". As well the 18ft-high (5m) ""pedestrian fencing"", the funds will cover road improvements and new lights. House Armed Services Chair Adam Smith sent a letter on Tuesday rejecting the Pentagon's transfer, saying the committee would not approve the use of defence funds ""to construct additional physical barriers and roads or install lighting in the vicinity of the United States border"". This contention between the Pentagon and lawmakers could set up a legal challenge about which area of the government has control over re-allocating such funds, US media say. Thousands of people cross the border every year seeking a new life in the US Democratic senators also complained that the Pentagon had not sought permission from the appropriate committees before notifying Congress of the funds transfer. ""We strongly object to both the substance of the funding transfer, and to the department implementing the transfer without seeking the approval of the congressional defence committees and in violation of provisions in the defence appropriation itself,"" the senators wrote in a letter to Mr Shanahan, CNN reported. Mr Trump declared the emergency on 15 February after Congress refused his requests for $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) to construct the wall. By declaring an emergency he sought to bypass Congress and build the wall with military funding. Democrats branded the declaration unconstitutional. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed a resolution to overturn the emergency last month, and 12 Republicans later sided with Democratic Senators to get it through the Senate. This video can not be played Trump issues first veto of his presidency However, Mr Trump vetoed the resolution earlier this month. Congress failed to obtain the requisite two-thirds majority to override the veto on Tuesday, with a vote of 248-181 that saw only 14 Republicans voting with Democrats.

"Companies should link the pay of top bosses to that of the rest of their workforce, a committee of MPs has said. The Business Select Committee said soaring pay had become a symbol of ""corporate greed"" and was undermining the reputation of UK business. It also said that over the last decade, the pay of FTSE 100 bosses had grown four times as much as national average earnings.

Shell chief's pay doubles to Â£17m Investors rebel over bank group's pay Such ""huge differentials"" have become endemic, it said, partly because of over-generous incentive-based pay packages for chief executives. It also blamed firms' own remuneration committees - which set pay - for approving ""ever more complicated and opaque pay packages"".

Some 330,000 more potholes were filled than in 2017/18, with spending on roads maintenance up 20%, a study says. However, the Asphalt Industry Alliance annual survey suggests much of the Â£24.5m was spent on short-term ""patch and mend"" work to 1.86 million holes. Councils would need to spend Â£9.79bn over 10 years to bring all roads up to scratch, the AIA says. The Local Government Association says fixing roads is a priority. ""Faced with severe financial pressures, councils have managed to spend more on road repairs in the past year in order to fix a pothole every 17 seconds,"" said Martin Tett, transport spokesman for the body which represents councils. Department for Transport issues pothole warning Reality Check- Is our pothole problem getting worse Why do we have so many potholes? However, the AIA says the responses of local authorities to its survey revealed a ""big discrepancy"" in spending on roads between different councils. Some local authorities in England received highway maintenance funding equivalent to more than Â£90,000 per mile last year, while others had less than 10% of that, it said. AIA chairman Rick Green said: ""Sustained investment over a longer time frame is needed if we want a local road network that supports enhanced mobility, connectivity and productivity."" AA president Edmund King said the survey suggested the country was ""beginning to find its way out of the rut"". ""Increased funding and a milder winter presents an opportunity to begin to catch up on the backlog - but any slackening off will simply pitch our roads back into a deep hole,"" he said. RAC figures show drivers are two-and-a-half times more likely to suffer a pothole-related breakdown than in 2006. Its patrols received 1,714 call-outs between October and December 2018 for problems usually caused by road defects, such as damaged shock absorbers, broken suspension springs and distorted wheels. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""Potholes are a huge problem for all road users and the government is taking action, providing local authorities with more than Â£6.6bn for roads maintenance and pothole repair in the six years to 2021."" The government is also trialling new technologies to stop potholes from forming and consulting on increasing the standards of roadworks by utility companies to help keep roads pothole-free for longer, he added.

"MPs and peers raised concerns about the UK settlement scheme for EU citizens EU citizens in Britain could be denied access to benefits such as council housing and social security payments after Brexit, a report has warned. MPs are debating ending EU nationals' right to live and work in the UK. But Parliament's human rights committee says new laws could leave EU nationals, including those who have paid UK taxes for years, in a ""precarious"" situation. The Home Office says the government has already committed to protecting the rights of EU citizens in the UK. ""We want them to stay and, whatever the outcome of the ongoing discussions about our exit from the EU, we will protect their rights and ensure they get the UK immigration status they need,"" a spokeswoman said. EU rejects no deal citizens rights call The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Brexit: How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU Theresa May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if Britain leaves the European Union without a formal withdrawal deal. They would also keep their social security rights. EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected. However, MPs and peers on the human rights committee have raised concerns that the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill could leave people in a ""rights limbo"". ""Although the government has said that it is not its intention to strip EU citizens resident in the UK of their rights, that is the effect of this bill as it stands,"" thereport,externalsays. The committee has urged ministers to build in guarantees to ensure EU citizens will be entitled to the same rights as now. According to the report, the bill as it stands relies on the home secretary enacting secondary legislation - laws created using powers given to ministers by Parliament - to restore the same rights that people from EU countries have at the moment. The committee adds that it is proposing amendments to the legislation so that current protections and guarantees can be enshrined in law. Its chair, Labour MP Harriet Harman, said: ""We're talking about the rights of people who have resided in the UK for years, decades even, paying into our social security system or even having been born in the UK and lived here their whole lives. ""Promising that everything will be worked out in the future is not good enough, it must be a guarantee."" The committee also highlighted concerns about the settlement scheme for EU nationals, notably around the time limit and the lack of a physical proof of status. The Home Office spokeswoman said the settlement scheme was designed to be ""as simple and straightforward as possible"" and that the government had launched a nationwide marketing campaign to encourage EU citizens to apply.

"Almost three years ago the UK voted in favour of leaving the EU. Yet the original departure date of 29 March has been delayed and the government is searching for a way forward. So, what do the majority of the UK's voters now think about Brexit? Theresa May argues that her deal is the best way of fulfilling the instruction to leave given by voters in the EU referendum. Trouble is, voters themselves - including not least those who voted Leave - have become deeply critical of how the UK government has handled Brexit negotiations. This is seen indata from a newly published survey from NatCen Social Research,external, conducted between 24 January and 17 February. Two years ago, those who voted Leave were inclined to give the government the benefit of the doubt. However, as many as 80% of Leave voters now say that it has handled Brexit negotiations badly. That figure is almost as high as it is among Remain voters (85%), who had previously been more critical of the government's approach. Remarkably, Leave voters are now just as critical of the UK government's role as they are of the EU's: 79% of Leave supporters say the EU has handled Brexit badly. Meanwhile, the longer negotiations have continued, the more pessimistic voters have become about how good a deal the UK will secure. Two years ago, there were almost as many who thought that the UK would obtain a good deal (33%) as thought it would find itself with a bad one (37%). However, that mood soon changed and by last summer as many as 57% reckoned the UK would emerge with a bad deal. Now that the first phase of the Brexit negotiations has been concluded - though, as yet at least, not approved by MPs - the proportion who think the UK is heading for a bad deal is, at 63%, even higher. Here too, Remain and Leave voters are now largely in agreement. This is despite Leave voters initially being much more positive. As many as 66% of Leave supporters now believe that the UK is faced with a bad deal - even more than the 64% of Remain voters who express that view. It seems that the prime minister's deal has failed to satisfy many of the very voters whose wishes the deal is intended to fulfil. But does this negative reaction to the deal mean voters have changed their minds about leaving the EU in the first place? In truth, a moving average of the six most recent polls, has been indicating for some time that slightly more people now say they would vote Remain than Leave in another ballot. At present, the average level of support for the two options (after Don't Knows are excluded) is Remain 54%, Leave 46%. In part, this is because Leave voters are a little less likely to say they would vote the same way again (82%), than Remain voters are (86%). But the swing to Remain, such as it is, is also down to those who did not vote in 2016. Of this group, 43% say they would vote Remain, whereas 19% say they would back Leave. In truth, the polls are too close for opponents of Brexit to assume that a second ballot would produce a different result. But, equally, supporters of Brexit cannot say with confidence that the balance of opinion remains as it was in June 2016. More like this Brexit: What voters want MPs to do next Do petitions ever work? What kind of Brexit do voters want? How young and old would vote on Brexit now So, do the UK's voters want another referendum? That depends on how they are asked. Some polls introduce the idea of another ballot as a ""people's vote"", or a ""public vote"" and do not make it clear that remaining in the EU would be an option. When put to the public in this way, the polls suggest on average that supporters of a second referendum outnumber opponents by 12 points. However, the average level of support and opposition changes when people are asked if there should be another referendum with Remain as an option on the ballot paper. Asked in this way, opponents outnumber supporters by nine points. But perhaps what is more important is thatRemain voters are much keener on this idea than Leave supporters,external. That suggests the proposal is not yet a way out of the Brexit impasse that is backed by both sides in the Brexit debate. Remain and Leave voters may agree that they do not like Mrs May's deal, but that does not mean that they agree on what should happen instead.

"This video can not be played The woman in charge of the trust running Parkfield school defends its LGBT rights teaching The head of a school trust embroiled in a row over classes about LGBT rights says staff have been left ""distraught"". The No Outsiders programme at Parkfield Community School in Birmingham has been paused after protests by parents. Hazel Pulley, chief executive officer of the trust which runs the school, said some staff had lost weight and were not sleeping. She added the situation had been the most ""challenging"" she has seen in 27 years in education. This video can not be played Parents claimed ""hundreds"" of pupils were kept out of school for a day There have been protests outside the school in Alum Rock over No Outsiders, with some parents claiming the lessons were age-inappropriate and incompatible with Islam. Ms Pulley, of Excelsior Multi-Academy Trust, confirmed its lessons have been temporarily stopped to allow for discussions with parents. The Leigh Trust has also said it would behalting lessons at four of its schoolsuntil reaching an agreement with parents. Latest news from the West Midlands ""The impact on staff has been tremendous,"" Ms Pulley said. ""The reason is because of the breakdown in the relation of trust which we have had for so long."" She said the No Outsiders lessons use a book featuring two mothers and their child, and depicts them doing ""normal things"". The idea is to show children how ""all families are different"". ""We are not teaching children about same sex couples in the sense of sexual relationships, what we do teach our children is that there are different families and that there are families with two mummies, two daddies."" This video can not be played Parents have been calling for No Outsiders to be stopped Ms Pulley said: ""During this period where we said we are putting No Outsiders on stop, we have made sure that in our curriculum and in our assemblies we do not mention the LGBT agenda, because that is the only way we felt parents could come into the room and start talking to us. ""We moved what we thought was the issue to one side but we can only do that for so long or otherwise, quite rightly, we will be seen as being discriminatory to one of the protected characteristics."" She said the programme can sit ""harmoniously"" with Islam, adding: ""In school they need to be educated to the laws of the land and at home they can follow their religion and that is fine; the two sit together."" Ofsted hasdeemed the lessons ""age-appropriate"".

"Comedian Joe Lycett has said that the LGBT community has a ""problem"" with the way it communicates online. He's called for people to be ""compassionate"" when dealing with those who are unfamiliar with LGBT concepts. The TV presenter said he felt too many demands were placed on people to understand the different academic views on gender and sexuality. He said the LGBT community should try to help people who want to learn more about these issues. Lycett, whodescribes himself as pansexual,external, said: ""I'm loathe to call it 'my community' but I suppose it is as I am a member of it, can sometimes be guilty of expecting everyone to have done all of the reading and research that members of it have. ""Because lots of LGBTQ people are really smart, and there's so much really interesting reading that can be done, and so much academic writing that's been done about it, people can end up getting quite academic about it."" He said it's sometimes forgotten that people outside the LGBT community ""need to have it explained to them in a way that's compassionate, and is understanding that there's quite a lot to take in"". Joe Lycett can currently be seen presenting The Great British Sewing Bee on BBC Two Lycett said he hoped people would treat others in the way they expected to be treated themselves. ""I did a tweet about LGBTQ+ and someone was saying 'what's the + and what's the Q?' and some people would be like 'you should educate yourself it's disgusting, google it'. ""If I asked the question, they would answer it to me, so just try and treat people in the way I expect to be treated myself. ""So I do think that's been a problem in our community."" Equalities charity Stonewall agreed it was important to have conversations about sexual orientation and gender identity in a ""respectful way to help increase understanding and acceptance for LGBT people in society"". Lycett also presents the BBC One quiz show The Time It Takes In a statement to the BBC, they said: ""It's great that people want to better understand the right language to use when talking about LGBT people and their identities. ""Non-LGBT people who want to better support the community can start by learning about and listening to the experiences of LGBT people and the challenges we face."" The group advised: ""Getting to know more about LGBT people, our history and issues is an empowering step towards becoming an ally. ""Only by working together with allies can we create a world where no one faces violence, harassment and discrimination just because of who they are."" Lycett, who is currently presenting The Great British Sewing Bee, was speaking ahead of the launch of his new Channel 4 show Joe Lycett's Got Your Back, where he helps shoppers who feel they've been ripped off. ""I'm describing it as a 'sexy Watchdog' basically. It is a consumer show with a difference,"" he said.

""Thereâs a recognition that thereâs a lot of weariness about
the potential trip to a polling station,"" he says. But he says that ""Parliament is running out of road â the prime minister used
language to that effect today"". Some MPs have suggested that the prime minister should consider her position. But Mr Mason says: ""Her character would suggest that she would want to see this
through to some conclusion."" While it might be a ""tall order"" for her to get her deal through now, she may wait until ""the point where she has self-evidently failed to do that and the UK ends up committed to a long delay"" after 12 April. If she does eventually trigger a leadership contest, a new leader ""could seek a new mandate and try to get themselves a majority â and then we would be heading for another general election"".

Followingthe government's latest setback, it is no clearer when Brexit will happen. The UK faces a deadline of 12 April to come up with a way forward. By that point, the UK must have approved any deal or decided whether it wants to leave without a deal, which Parliament has said no to, or is prepared to delay Brexit by a much longer period, potentially into next year. The EU is planning an emergency summit on 10 April to discuss its next move. So where does the process go from here? Read more here Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor If we know one thing about the prime minister it is that she does not give up, even when it seems that seems the obvious or rational choice. Parliament has rejected her deal three times now - a reality that would have finished off many previous administrations and leaders. Whether that is foolhardy and stubborn, or admirably resilient, it is highly likely that at least for another couple of weeks, Theresa May will look through every nook and cranny in Parliament to see if there is a way for her deal to pass through - somehow. But that's a decision taken in the bunker, and the walls are closing in. Read the full story Katya AdlerEurope Editor The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says today's vote is ""no great surprise"" to European leaders. She says the mood in Brussels is of ""resignation"" and ""defensiveness"", with ""the EU wanting to protect itself
from any future Brexit fallout"". The UK leaving without a deal is seen as an ""increasingly likely prospect"" by leaders such as Emmanuel Macron. ""Thatâs why he and other European leaders are questioning
whether it makes sense to delay Brexit for that much longer. They look at all
the divisions in Parliament, in government, in cabinet, and they wonder if the UK
will ever unite around Brexit,"" Adler says. She says that doesn't mean they would say no, but there would be ""very heated discussion among EU
leaders as to whether to extend, what for and for how long"". One thing they are certain about is that the UK would need to take part in EU elections for a longer extension, she says. That's because the UK would remain an EU member, and the European Parliament's legality could be questioned if all members are not represented.

Vote Leave was fined Â£61,000and referred to the police after an Electoral Commission probe said it broke electoral law. The watchdog said it exceeded its Â£7m spending limit by funnelling Â£675,315 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. Vote Leave previously said the ""wholly inaccurate"" report was politically motivated. Mark D'ArcyParliamentary Correspondent There's a bad moon rising over Westminster. Friday's latest government defeat on Brexit may have been by a lower margin than the earlier thrashings, but the convincing 58-vote majority against the EU withdrawal agreement, in the teeth of an all-out whipping operation, hardly suggests that one more heave will see it home. The result looks set to trigger a political chain reaction. And with the prime minister having signalled her departure, albeit making contingent on getting her deal passed, a variety of parliamentary events will become auditions for the contenders for her job. Sajid Javid has Home Office questions on Monday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is up on Tuesday and Andrea Leadsom has her weekly Business Questions outing on Thursday. Other parliamentary events, not least around Brexit, will provide plenty of opportunities for other contenders. Here's Mark's rundown of the week ahead. Former Labour MP Chris Leslie, who is part of the Independent Group, says he supports calls for another public vote - but not a general election. He tells the BBC News Channel: ""If you think that Brexit is complicated, just throw a general election in here to completely throw everything into chaos.  Let's get a grip of this situation. ""There is a route out of it.  The prime minister's deal could go back to the public. ""We could put a customs union, single market back to the public. Ultimately we have to give people the chance to look at this and say do we want to proceed or think again?"" Continuing his speech, ex-UKIP leader Mr Farage said: ""This is about our whole system of democracy. ""This is about the bond of trust that needs to exist between the people and those, the governors. ""This is about who we are as a nation. Where our standing is in the world. ""And frankly, I believe that what's happened over there, has not just turned this day that should've been one of great celebration into a day that history will mark as a day of great betrayal, I believe that what's happened over the course of two years is actually one of the saddest and worst chapters in the history of our nation."" He added: ""What they want is for us to go away. Am I downcast, am I disheartened? No. I am more determined."" The crowd broke out in chants of ""Nigel! Nigel! Nigel!"" To music and loud cheers, former UKIP leader and Brexiteer Nigel Farage appeared on stage at the Leave Means Leave rally in Parliament Square. ""It's brave of you to come,"" he told demonstrators. ""Because I sense, being in Westminster, that we are in enemy territory. ""There are hundreds of people just over the street that have treated that referendum and those who voted for it with total and utter contempt of the past three years."" Referring to Theresa May's Brexit deal, Mr Farage called it ""dreadful"" and said he did not spend 25 years campaigning to come out of the EU to see the UK ""signed up to another"" EU treaty. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent The big question everyone is asking is whether the prime
ministerâs deal is dead after this third defeat. Of course, opposition MPs certainly think that it is. But
does she have a plan to bring it back again? There is speculation about maybe some kind of run-off
between her proposal and whatever MPs come up with and coalesce around on
Monday. But weâll have to wait and see. Itâs certainly been an incredibly divisive process - particularly for the Conservative Party. UKIP leader Gerard Batten addressed pro-Brexit supporters on Whitehall after Tommy Robinson. Mr Batten told the crowds: ""As of now we
do not know when we are going to leave the European Union. ""Theresa May has had, for the third
time, her not-really-leaving deal rejected by Parliament."" He added: ""What we do know is that
if we do not leave the EU it will mark the end of democracy in the UK."" Mr Batten also said, to cheers from the crowd, that UKIP was the ""only major political party that actually wants Britain to leave the
EU"". Conservative MP Mark Francois was introduced as a ""massive, massive Brexiteer"" when he took to the stage at the protest organised by campaign group Leave Means Leave.
