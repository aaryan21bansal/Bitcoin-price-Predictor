"This video can not be played Donald Trump tells ABC News that ""torture works"" President Trump has indicated that he is considering a return to the sort of harsh interrogation techniques of ""enemy combatants"" that have been widely condemned as torture, as well as a return to so-called CIA ""black sites"". In his first interview since becoming US President, Mr Trump said intelligence officials had told him that ""torture absolutely works"", but that he would defer to advice from his new CIA director and his secretary of defence. The latter, retired Marine Corps officer Gen James Mattis, says torture does not work. So what are the global implications if the president goes ahead, asks BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner. There is a South African proverb, dating from the apartheid era, that goes like this: ""How do you catch an elephant? You catch a mouse and keep beating it up until it admits it's really an elephant."" Ridiculous as this may sound, there is an echo of truth here. Torture hurts. That's the whole point of it. So if someone is tortured badly enough they will say anything to make it stop, including making things up that they think their tormentors will want to hear. Prisons in certain Middle Eastern countries, especially Syria, are crammed full of people who are being abused so badly they will eventually sign any ""confession"" to make the treatment stop. In some countries forced confessions remain to this day the primary tool in the prosecutor's armoury. In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in 2001 the US intelligence community, having failed to prevent the worst attack on the US since Pearl Harbor, became convinced that a second catastrophic attack was on its way. As President George W Bush's ""war on terror"" got underway, the normal safeguards of respect for human rights and the rule of law were cast aside in a desperate hunt to find ""the ticking bomb"". Trump insists waterboarding works First 100 days: What executive actions has Trump taken? Top al-Qaeda planners like Ramzi Bin Al-Shibh, Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, all caught in Pakistan, were ""rendered"" (transported) to so-called ""black sites"" for extreme interrogation. These were secret, unacknowledged prisons, run by the CIA and scattered around the globe in Afghanistan, Thailand, Poland, Romania and other countries. There they were subjected to repeated waterboarding, which makes the bound and helpless victim feel like they are drowning. Khaled Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded a staggering number of times, well over 100. And yet years later, when in 2014 the US Senate's Intelligence and Security Select Committee issued its report on the use of torture under the Bush administration it concluded that torture was ""not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees"". CIA lied over 'brutal' interrogations 'CIA tortured' admits former executive On Thursday, the US House Speaker, Paul Ryan, said torture was not legal and that the committee agreed it was not legal. Senator John McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, also opposes it. ""The president can sign whatever executive order he likes,"" he said, ""but the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the USA."" There would be strong resistance too from both America's allies and from within the intelligence community itself. There is a general acceptance now, in most of the world, that those practices carried out in the early years after the 9/11 attacks - extraordinary rendition, detention without trial, enhanced interrogation - were not only morally wrong, they were also counter-productive. They very rarely produced useful, actionable intelligence. They traumatised not only the victims, some of whom were completely innocent, but also those who witnessed the shocking dehumanising of an individual. Undoubtedly this has given the green light to some unscrupulous practices by regimes who see America's earlier use of torture as a license to do what they like to their own citizens. Unthinkable as it sounds now, the US even rendered one ""high value detainee"" to his own country - Syria - for interrogation, knowing that there would be few restraints on his treatment there. This video can not be played John McCain said he'd have Donald Trump in court in 'a New York minute' if he reinstated waterboarding There is also the legal aspect. In 2010 David Cameron, who was then UK prime minister, set up a judge-led, independent inquiry into allegations of complicity by MI5 and MI6 officers in torture. Career intelligence officers who had thought they were doing the right thing at the time - such as, hypothetically, being within earshot of the harsh interrogation of a suspect in a Pakistani jail - found themselves being questioned by detectives from the Metropolitan Police. The inquiry was eventually scrapped but it has at least led to a widespread rethink on respect for human rights inside intelligence agencies on both sides of the Atlantic. Senior intelligence officers who lived through this difficult period are likely to strongly resist turning the clock back and returning to those days. It is also questionable whether the US would find willing partners to host black site prisons amongst those countries only too relieved to have closed that chapter in their national histories.

"As she made her way across the Atlantic, Theresa May joked with the press pack on her flight that ""sometimes opposites attract"". A wisecracking way of trying to cover the question about how she and Donald Trump can work together - the reality TV star billionaire and the self-described hard working vicar's daughter. Voters will decide for themselves how funny they find it. But Number 10 has already invested a lot in the early days of this relationship. Perhaps, that is in part due to the early embarrassment of former UKIP leader Nigel Farage's adventures in Manhattan. However, it is also certainly due to her conviction that whoever the US president is, a British leader needs to, and should, cultivate their friendship. Downing Street sources say they have had more contact with the Trump team since its victory than any other country has - and the conversations between the two leaders have focused on how to develop their personal relationship and the bond between the two countries. But even before the two politicians meet tomorrow in the Oval Office, Mrs May is trying to put forward serious arguments about Britain and America's relationship as the world changes at warp speed around the two countries - making a major foreign policy speech at a gathering of the Republican Party in Philadelphia just hours after she touches down. It is plain to see that while she is deadly serious about creating an extremely close relationship with the new president, she will continue to disagree with him on some issues. When repeatedly questioned about his view that torture works, the prime minister told us: ""We condemn torture, I have been very clear, I'm not going to change my position whether I'm talking to you or talking to the president."" And crucially, she said guidance stating that UK security services cannot share intelligence if it is obtained through torture will not change, telling me: ""Our guidance is very clear about the position that the UK takes, and our position has not changed."" Despite President Trump's very public doubts about Nato, she says he has already assured her on the phone that he is committed to the alliance. A public restatement of that in the next 24 hours would no doubt be a political boon for her. While the prime minister is plainly uncomfortable with some of Mr Trump's positions, she also wants to emphasise some of the areas where they do agree - the ""shared values"" of looking out for ""ordinary working class families"". In her speech to senators and congressmen tonight she will also emphasise how, in her view, Conservative values are Republican values. The Republicans - the Tories' sister political party - are now in charge at all levels on Capitol Hill, as well as inside the White House. For the GOP and Mrs May's Conservative Party, patriotism, flag and family are not values to shy away from. And despite the squeamishness, even in Tory ranks, about her eagerness to be seen alongside the president, the prime minister is unapologetic about her friendly stance. When asked about appearing to be too close to the controversial new president, she said: ""Donald Trump was elected president of the United States of America. ""The UK and the US have shared challenges, shared interests, that we can work together to deal with. We have a special relationship, it's long standing, it's existed through many different prime ministers and presidents."" A more different prime minister and president are hard to conceive. What they make of each other, and the relationship between our two countries, will affect us all.

"There are frequent and regular meetings between British prime ministers and American presidents, but few will have been as significant as the visit to Washington this week by Theresa May. It is not just an occasion for old allies to renew vows of friendship. These two new, uncertain leaders need concrete achievements and not just gestures. The two could not be more different. Mrs May is serious-minded, steely, attentive to her briefing books, insular, dependent on a tightly-wound inner circle. Donald Trump is brash, abrasive, instinctive, revelling in his newly won power to change America. One of them is a vicar's daughter; the other a star of reality TV. Both of them are in office because of a people's revolt. So what will be on Mrs May's agenda as she becomes the first foreign leader to meet the new president? British leaders tend to attach more importance to the special relationship than the US. But with Britain about to divorce from the European Union, the long-standing link with Washington has assumed more importance. It is an anchor in a less certain era. Mrs May will stress that the relationship between the two countries helped forge the ""modern world"" and, by implication, can do so again. The White House has indicated that it would welcome the closeness of the Thatcher/Reagan years. Mrs May will emphasise her belief in the continuing importance of the special relationship President Trump needs to demonstrate that he has the seriousness to be the leader of the West and that he has command of the issues. The American audience will be watching. Theresa May says US and UK can lead world again First meetings: US presidents and UK prime ministers Theresa May 'won't be afraid' to challenge Donald Trump Theresa May needs to tread carefully. There is much she needs from America, not least a trade agreement, but many in the UK would question deepening a ""special"" relationship with a president they intensely distrust. The prime minister has promised to be ""frank"" in her discussions, but Britain outside the EU needs a close ally in Washington and Donald Trump is likely to get his invitation to visit Britain and stay in Buckingham Palace and risk the demonstrations such a visit may spark. For the UK, trade is the centrepiece of the visit. With the UK leaving the EU and its single market, Britain will need new trading relationships. Already trade between Britain and the US is worth Â£150bn ($188bn). What the prime minister is looking for is a ""bold and ambitious free-trade agreement"" with the US. Such a trade deal cannot be concluded while the UK remains part of the EU but preparatory work can begin so that a trade agreement can be in place shortly after the UK leaves the EU in 2019. The prime minister is a strong advocate of free trade versus protectionism There will be discussions about reducing existing tariffs and making it easier for American and British citizens to work in each other's countries. Progress surely will be made but there are deep underlying differences. The president's core policy is ""America First"". Theresa May's slogan is ""Global Britain"". Donald Trump has spent this week signalling he is pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement and bent on re-negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Britain outside the EU, on the other hand, needs an open global trading system. Theresa May has to be an advocate for free trade in the house of a leader determined to protect first and trade second. Downing Street will also know that a deal with the US will strengthen its hand in its negotiations with Brussels. During the election campaign Donald Trump caused consternation in Europe and in the foreign policy establishment in Washington when he declared Nato ""obsolete"". On one level it was an expression of American frustration that its European allies refused to share the burden of defence. Theresa May will surely support the president in calling on Europe to spend 2% of GDP on its military. There are calls for more Nato countries to share the alliance's financial burden But May will be looking for much more. She wants to hear the President commit to Nato's Article Five, that an attack on one member will be treated as an attack on all. For her, Nato is part of the post-war international order. Britain outside the EU needs Nato more than ever. In the future it will be Nato that will be the UK's link to its European neighbours. One of the ironies of the visit is that Theresa May will fight for the EU. It will be a case of a divorcee speaking up for a former partner. Europe has been shocked by Donald Trump's comments about Europe breaking up, about the EU being a ""vehicle for Germany"". For the first time since the Treaty of Rome was signed 50 years ago, Europe does not have a friend in the White House who shares the mission and belief in European integration. So Theresa May has an opportunity to win friends in Europe's capitals by standing up for the EU. It is not in Britain's interest, as she has said, for the European Union to unravel. ""It remains overwhelmingly and compellingly in Britain's national interest that the EU should succeed,"" she believes. Despite Brexit, Mrs May could speak up for the European Union A global Britain needs a strong international order and part of that is Nato, the EU, and open trade. In the past it has been the US underpinning this global order. Theresa May will need to be the great persuader. The UK views Moscow and Putin differently from the new administration in Washington. Donald Trump has signalled that he can open a new era with Russia. The UK remains deeply suspicious of the Kremlin. It is not just a question as to whether sanctions should be retained against Russia for its military actions in Crimea and Ukraine. The UK and US have the strongest intelligence-sharing relationship in the world. The UK will want reassurance that any tilt towards Russia does not compromise its intelligence assets. Regarding the Middle East, Donald Trump has made it clear that Israel will have his full support. Already, Israel has taken heart from its new friend in the White House by announcing the building of new settlements in the West Bank. Donald Trump has suggested he may move the US embassy to Jerusalem. Theresa May's words will be scrutinised closely. In seeking a close relationship with Donald Trump, will there be any change in emphasis in supporting a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians? Downing Street will seek reassurance over the effects of closer ties between the US and Russia The British prime minister will also want to talk about energy and her commitment to the Paris agreement on reducing global warming. In the end it is in both Britain and America's interest to forge a close relationship. Theresa May has spoken of ""renewing our nation's ties"". Outside the EU, the UK needs the American embrace. The Trump administration brings opportunities. Donald Trump remains an enthusiast for Brexit. He wants Brexit to succeed and has promised to give his backing to a trade deal. But many of his policies are opposed by Theresa May and many British voters. She cannot risk getting too close to a man despised by many in the UK. Her priority will be trade but what she wants from the 45th president is a commitment to supporting the post-war international order without pulling away at the threads that bind it. On a personal level they are unlikely allies, but self-interest may yet rekindle the Reagan-Thatcher alliance.

"Tam Dalyell was a political contradiction, an aristocratic Old Etonian who became a socialist politician. It was he who articulated what became known as the West Lothian Question, which festered at the heart of Scotland's relationship with Westminster. A former Conservative activist, he became a thorn in the side of the Thatcher government. But he won admiration from across the political spectrum as an honourable and principled member of parliament. Thomas Dalyell Loch was born in Edinburgh on 9 August 1932. His father Gordon Loch, a civil servant, adopted his wife Nora's maiden name in 1938. It was through his mother that Dalyell later inherited the Dalyell baronetcy, although he never used the title. The Suez crisis made him an opponent of British military intervention He went to Eton before doing his National Service as a trooper with the Royal Scots Greys, having failed his officer training. After he was demobbed, he went to Cambridge where he was chairman of the University Conservative Association. It was while working as a teacher that he experienced a political conversion, brought about by the Suez Crisis in 1956. The debacle, in which Britain, together with Israel and France, unsuccessfully attempted to gain control of the Suez Canal, made a deep impression on him Not only did he join the Labour Party, but the aborted invasion made him a committed opponent of future British military involvement overseas. In 1962, he won the seat of West Lothian in a by-election, fighting off a strong challenge from a future SNP leader, William Wolfe. Less than two years after he entered parliament, Dalyell was appointed parliamentary private secretary to Dick Crossman, then Minister for Local Government. Dalyell (r) arrived at Westminster in 1962 as the newly elected member for West Lothian The position of PPS was seen as the first step to a ministerial career, but Dalyell's independent stance on issues irritated the party establishment. That irritation turned to anger in 1967 when he was heavily censured for leaking minutes of a select committee meeting about the Porton Down biological and chemical warfare establishment to the Observer newspaper. Dalyell claimed he thought the minutes were in the public domain but he did not escape a public dressing-down by the Speaker. In a parliamentary debate on devolution in 1977, Dalyell first proposed what would become known as the West Lothian Question. A vocal opponent of Scottish devolution, Dalyell contrasted the town of Blackburn in his own constituency, and Blackburn in Lancashire. ""For how long,"" he asked, ""will English constituencies and English Honourable Members tolerate at least 119 Honourable Members from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland exercising an important and often decisive effect on English politics?"" It was Enoch Powell who coined the term West Lothian Question, in his response to Dalyell's speech. He fought to uncover the truth about the Lockerbie bombing When Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 she found Dalyell a persistent critic of her policies. He supported the Troops Out movement in Northern Ireland and attacked the prime minister's proposed boycott of the Moscow Olympics. But it was the Falklands War that raised his public profile. He described the conflict as ""like two bald men fighting over a comb,"" quoting the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges. He strongly condemned the decision to sink the Argentine cruiser, General Belgrano, insisting the vessel had been steering away from the conflict when torpedoed by a British submarine. His political opponents called him Daft Tam, ignoring the methodical and painstaking preparation he put into sourcing the facts to back up his arguments. He was no slave to parliamentary protocol and was suspended from the House on numerous occasions, twice for calling Mrs Thatcher ""a liar"" over the Falklands campaign. ""She is a bounder, a liar, a deceiver, a cheat, a crook and a disgrace to the House of Commons,"" was one notable contribution during a 1987 debate. Dalyell made a trip to Iraq, touring the country's marshes However, some felt that his intemperate language did nothing to win him support. Former Conservative MP and later political commentator, Matthew Parris said that ""this element of personal vendetta seriously weakens his case"". Dalyell was persistent in trying to uncover the truth about the Lockerbie bombing and consistently said he did not believe Libyan leader Colonel Gadaffi was responsible for the outrage. He was, predictably, bitterly opposed to the Gulf War, ""Kuwait is the 19th bloody state of Iraq,"" and went to Baghdad in 1994 to negotiate with Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz. The election of a Labour government under Tony Blair in 1997 failed to deter Dalyell from speaking his mind. In 1999, he decided that he would no longer vote at Westminster on purely English issues, defying a number of three-line whips. He was one of 25 MPs who opposed military action in Kosovo. ""I am one of a dwindling number of MPs who have actually worn the Queen's uniform,"" he said. He continued to live in the ancestral home ""Perhaps we are a bit less relaxed about unleashing war than those who have never been in a military situation."" He had little time for the New Labour project, describing Tony Blair as the worst of the eight prime ministers who had held power while he was a parliamentarian. In 2001, he became Father of the House, the longest continuous serving MP, using his position to attack the US led invasion of Iraq. ""These are the thought processes of fantasist Americans who want to control the world,"" he said. ""I am appalled that a British Labour prime minister should have got into bed with a crew which has this moral standing."" Dalyell stood down from the House of Commons in 2005, after serving 43 years as an MP, first for West Lothian, then, from 1983, the redrawn constituency of Linlithgow. Behind Tam Dalyell's somewhat shambling and eccentric demeanour was a keen analytical brain and a passion for meticulous research.

"Don Hale has helped to clear Barry George, Stephen Downing and Ched Evans Fifteen years ago Stephen Downing was acquitted after spending 27 years in prison for murder, overturning one of Britain's most notorious miscarriages of justice and putting into the spotlight the local newspaper editor who helped to bring the police's case tumbling down. Don Hale could hardly have foreseen that by championing the case he would go on to suffer police intimidation and receive death threats - there were even two apparent attempts on his life - forcing him to leave his Derbyshire home. But the Downing case would eventually change the law, win Hale an OBE and make him a go-to journalist to investigate major miscarriages of justice. In the years since the release of Mr Downing, Hale has also helped to free Barry George, the man who spent eight years in jail for the murder of Jill Dando, and to clear the name of footballer, Ched Evans, after a controversial rape retrial. Don Hale was editor of weekly local newspaper, the Matlock Mercury, during his battle to free Stephen Downing For Hale, the brutal trigger for his life of campaigning was the 1973 killing of 32-year-old Wendy Sewell. She was found badly beaten but still alive in a Bakewell graveyard by Mr Downing, a council gardener. He was arrested and questioned without a solicitor for several hours but, aged 17 and with a reading age of 11, officers pressured him into signing a confession to the attack, filled with words he did not understand. When Mrs Sewell died two days later, the charge was upgraded to murder. Mr Downing immediately retracted his confession but was found guilty at a trial at Nottingham Crown Court. Legal secretary Wendy Sewell, dubbed ""the Bakewell Tart"" in the press, was left for dead in the cemetery After their son had spent two decades in prison, Mr Downing's parents approached Hale, editor of the Matlock Mercury, for help. He faced obstacles at every turn, with police telling him all the evidence had been ""burnt, lost and destroyed"". A turning point came when Derby Museum staff informed him that the murder weapon - a pickaxe handle - was on display there. With Hale's help, Mr Downing won Â£13,000 from the Legal Aid Board. This paid for a modern forensic examination of the weapon, crucially revealing Mr Downing's fingerprints were not present - although there was a bloody palm print from an unknown person. The clothes Mr Downing had been wearing, which had been returned to his parents, were flecked with spots of blood which Hale believed were consistent with him having tried to help Wendy Sewell as she lay dying. Twenty years after the murder Hale reshot scene of crime photographs in Bakewell cemetery ""I reported developments through the Matlock Mercury - it became like The Archers, a bit of a saga,"" he joked. But the articles prompted real-life drama in the form of anonymous death threats and what Hale claims was police harassment. ""They made my life absolute hell for five or six years,"" he said. ""I was pulled up for speeding, stopped and searched, victimised."" Letters were sent to his home and a brick was thrown through the newspaper's window. Most seriously, on two occasions a vehicle was driven at him at speed, which he believes were attempts to kill him. Police even gave him a mirror on a stick to check for bombs under his car. Don Hale marching for justice for Stephen Downing ""I was very worried for my family. There weren't threats against other journalists, it was simply against me. It turned into a rollercoaster,"" he said. But all of this merely strengthened his resolve: ""If Downing had done it, why should anyone want to threaten me?"" Mr Downing was ineligible for parole under the law at the time because he had refused to admit his guilt. Hale believed this was unfair and took the matter to the European Court of Human Rights, winning the case in 1996. It was adopted into law that prisoners who maintained their innocence after conviction could apply for parole. Derbyshire Dales MP Patrick McLoughlin became one of the Downing campaign's high-profile supporters By now, the Downing case was attracting attention from far and wide: ""I became a hero in Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Argentina, because I had taken on the British government and won,"" Hale said. Closer to home, Hale said then Prime Minister Tony Blair asked him for help in setting up an independent body to investigate miscarriages of justice, which became the Criminal Case Review Commission (CCRC). Stephen Downing's was one of the first cases to be looked at by the CCRC. It recommended his conviction should be overturned on the basis that the circumstances in which he gave his confession made it unreliable evidence that should not have gone before a jury. The conviction was quashed in 2001 with Mr Downing finally walking free in January 2002. Hale and Stephen Downing on the steps of the Royal Courts of Justice in January, 2002, after his conviction was overturned Hale was pleased but also disappointed: ""He had got off on a technicality,"" he said. ""He didn't get his day in court because police were bang to rights. Somebody should have been called to account."" The legal challenge to Mr Downing's conviction focused on the way detectives had conducted the original investigation in 1973. He had been questioned without a lawyer and there were serious doubts about whether he had been properly advised of his legal rights. These facts were never made known to the jury that convicted him, but they were enough to overturn the conviction. But Mr Downing, for his part, was not angry: ""Who would I feel bitter against? The system? I think I would be punishing myself,"" he said. With much more to say himself, Hale wrote the book, Town Without Pity, which was turned into BBC drama, In Denial of Murder, in 2004. In Denial of Murder starred Stephen Tompkinson as Don Hale and Jason Watkins as Stephen Downing Police reopened their investigation, interviewing 1,600 witnesses, at an estimated cost of Â£500,000, but failed to identify any alternative suspect - although Hale has previously said he believeshe has a ""very good idea"",externalwho killed Wendy Sewell. Mr Downing was later awarded Â£900,000 in compensation. The huge press attention the case attracted finally forced Hale to relocate to north Wales. ""One of the reasons I moved away from Derbyshire was to get relief,"" he said. ""It wasn't fair on my family."" Jill Dando's killer has never been brought to justice But he was soon called on to help with another miscarriage of justice. BBC Crimewatch presenter Jill Dando was shot dead on her fiancÃ©'s west London doorstep in April 1999. A year later, after interviewing over hundreds of people, the Met Police charged 41-year-old Barry George, a self-confessed stalker and loner, with her murder. He was tried, convicted and jailed for life. But there were serious concerns about the police investigation, and in 2004 Hale was asked to get involved. ""Quite quickly, I found a lot of evidence that didn't match up,"" he said. Barry George was ""an oddball but not a killer"", Hale said He went to see Mr George in prison where he was ""like a lion in a cage"", pacing the floor. ""How could he do a clinical murder like that?"" Hale said. ""Everyone that was dealing with him said he's a bit of an oddball but he's not a killer."" Gunpowder residue on Mr George's clothing had played a large part in convicting him. But Hale said there was so little of it that it could have come from weapons armed police were carrying when he was arrested. The CCRC referred Mr George's case to the Court of Appeal and a retrial took place at the Old Bailey in 2008, when he was cleared of murder and released. Ched Evans leaving Cardiff Crown Court with his fiancee Natasha Massey Ched Evans was serving a five-year sentence for rape when his family approached Hale for help. ""I didn't want to touch it because it was so high profile,"" he said. But Mr Evans' mother had serious doubts about the ""rushed"" investigation. The then-Sheffield United striker had been convicted of raping a 19-year-old woman at a Premier Inn in Denbighshire in May 2011. At the same trial, footballer Clayton McDonald was acquitted of the offence. Hale believed the guilty verdict was an ""emotional response"" from the jury, owing to Mr Evans' ""cockiness"". ""He thought he was God's gift to women,"" Hale said. He spent six months working on the case, in which time Mr Evans was released having served half of his sentence. ""My knowledge and experience meant I could cut corners and had an important point that I knew the IPCC would look at."" This video can not be played A timeline of events leading to Ched Evans clearing his name That point was the woman's sexual history and, after the CCRC agreed there was enough evidence to quash the conviction, this evidence controversially formed part of the retrial. Unlike during the original trial, her previous sexual partners gave evidence recounting similar encounters to the one in the hotel room that night. It led to plans to review the law protecting alleged rape victims from disclosing details of their sex lives. Mr Evans was cleared in October 2016 but it left a bitter taste for Hale. ""In this case it was right - you have got to look at each case on its own merit,"" he said. ""But the whole thing was a bit unsavoury and not good for the girl herself."" Hale said at the timehe hoped the case did not deter women from coming forwardto report sexual offences. But, had that evidence been used in the original trial, ""Evans would have been cleared,"" he said. The case took its toll on Hales, now 64, and he has decided not to investigate any more miscarriages of justice, focusing instead on writing books. ""I am proud of what I have done,"" he said. ""If it wasn't for people like me you'd have no-one to say, 'this isn't the way we should interview people, this is not the way we should treat people'."" Yet he still insists modestly that much of the credit for overturning the miscarriages of justice he has worked on belongs to others, seeing himself more as a catalyst for change.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump tells ABC News that ""torture works"" President Trump has indicated that he is considering a return to the sort of harsh interrogation techniques of ""enemy combatants"" that have been widely condemned as torture, as well as a return to so-called CIA ""black sites"". In his first interview since becoming US President, Mr Trump said intelligence officials had told him that ""torture absolutely works"", but that he would defer to advice from his new CIA director and his secretary of defence. The latter, retired Marine Corps officer Gen James Mattis, says torture does not work. So what are the global implications if the president goes ahead, asks BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner. There is a South African proverb, dating from the apartheid era, that goes like this: ""How do you catch an elephant? You catch a mouse and keep beating it up until it admits it's really an elephant."" Ridiculous as this may sound, there is an echo of truth here. Torture hurts. That's the whole point of it. So if someone is tortured badly enough they will say anything to make it stop, including making things up that they think their tormentors will want to hear. Prisons in certain Middle Eastern countries, especially Syria, are crammed full of people who are being abused so badly they will eventually sign any ""confession"" to make the treatment stop. In some countries forced confessions remain to this day the primary tool in the prosecutor's armoury. In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks in 2001 the US intelligence community, having failed to prevent the worst attack on the US since Pearl Harbor, became convinced that a second catastrophic attack was on its way. As President George W Bush's ""war on terror"" got underway, the normal safeguards of respect for human rights and the rule of law were cast aside in a desperate hunt to find ""the ticking bomb"". Trump insists waterboarding works First 100 days: What executive actions has Trump taken? Top al-Qaeda planners like Ramzi Bin Al-Shibh, Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, all caught in Pakistan, were ""rendered"" (transported) to so-called ""black sites"" for extreme interrogation. These were secret, unacknowledged prisons, run by the CIA and scattered around the globe in Afghanistan, Thailand, Poland, Romania and other countries. There they were subjected to repeated waterboarding, which makes the bound and helpless victim feel like they are drowning. Khaled Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded a staggering number of times, well over 100. And yet years later, when in 2014 the US Senate's Intelligence and Security Select Committee issued its report on the use of torture under the Bush administration it concluded that torture was ""not an effective means of acquiring intelligence or gaining cooperation from detainees"". CIA lied over 'brutal' interrogations 'CIA tortured' admits former executive On Thursday, the US House Speaker, Paul Ryan, said torture was not legal and that the committee agreed it was not legal. Senator John McCain, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, also opposes it. ""The president can sign whatever executive order he likes,"" he said, ""but the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the USA."" There would be strong resistance too from both America's allies and from within the intelligence community itself. There is a general acceptance now, in most of the world, that those practices carried out in the early years after the 9/11 attacks - extraordinary rendition, detention without trial, enhanced interrogation - were not only morally wrong, they were also counter-productive. They very rarely produced useful, actionable intelligence. They traumatised not only the victims, some of whom were completely innocent, but also those who witnessed the shocking dehumanising of an individual. Undoubtedly this has given the green light to some unscrupulous practices by regimes who see America's earlier use of torture as a license to do what they like to their own citizens. Unthinkable as it sounds now, the US even rendered one ""high value detainee"" to his own country - Syria - for interrogation, knowing that there would be few restraints on his treatment there. This video can not be played John McCain said he'd have Donald Trump in court in 'a New York minute' if he reinstated waterboarding There is also the legal aspect. In 2010 David Cameron, who was then UK prime minister, set up a judge-led, independent inquiry into allegations of complicity by MI5 and MI6 officers in torture. Career intelligence officers who had thought they were doing the right thing at the time - such as, hypothetically, being within earshot of the harsh interrogation of a suspect in a Pakistani jail - found themselves being questioned by detectives from the Metropolitan Police. The inquiry was eventually scrapped but it has at least led to a widespread rethink on respect for human rights inside intelligence agencies on both sides of the Atlantic. Senior intelligence officers who lived through this difficult period are likely to strongly resist turning the clock back and returning to those days. It is also questionable whether the US would find willing partners to host black site prisons amongst those countries only too relieved to have closed that chapter in their national histories.

"Theresa May is preparing to meet new US President Donald Trump. Here's a look back at some first encounters of UK prime ministers and new US presidents: Gordon Brown andBarackObama - 3 March 2009 This video can not be played Gordon Brown's first meeting with Barack Obama came amid a global economic crisis The election of Barack Obama came at the tail end of the Labour government. Embroiled in both economic and political crisis, Gordon Brown spotted President Obama's election as an opportunity to be touched by the gold dust of the newly elected president. In March 2009, Downing Street proudly boasted that Mr Brown was the first European leader President Obama had met. The first meeting was dominated by the global financial crisis and the upcoming G20 summit in London. However, there was some embarrassment when President Obama gifted a box of US films to Brown - on DVDs that did not work on UK players. This video can not be played The two leaders went on to form a close bond Tony Blair and George W Bush's first summit came at a snowy Camp David - the US president's official retreat - seven months before the 9/11 attacks that would come to define their relationship. The two leaders would eventually form a tight bond, with both countries going to war in Iraq despite the opposition of some European allies. But the Camp David summit is remembered for something rather more trivial. Upon being asked what the two leaders had in common, President Bush replied: ""Well, we both use Colgate toothpaste."" This video can not be played There were trade tensions between Europe and the US when the two leaders met The first encounter between John Major and Bill Clinton was just a month after the president's inauguration. There was a certain degree of nervousness before the meeting. Mr Major had been a ferocious backer of George H W Bush in the 1992 presidential election. And between 1993 and 1997, the relationship between Mr Major and Mr Clinton never really blossomed. They fell out over the US issuing a visa to Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and the brewing conflict in the Balkans. There are shades of the present-day debate in the BBC's Martin Sixmith's report, as he says trade tensions between the European Community and the USA, and accusations of protectionism, are a ""cloud"" over Mr Major's visit. This video can not be played Margaret Thatcher meets incoming president George Bush Margaret Thatcher and president-elect George H W Bush's first official visit took place during her trip to Washington DC in November 1988. The visit was planned before the election to say goodbye to her ally Ronald Reagan, and the BBC report at the time wondered whether her relationship with President Bush could be ""as special"". She spent some time with the incoming president to discuss the end of the Cold War and the tensions in the Gulf. A year after she left Downing Street, President Bush invited Thatcher back to the White House to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United States. This video can not be played Margaret Thatcher had a close relationship with Ronald Reagan When Margaret Thatcher met President Reagan just a month into his presidency, they weren't strangers - their first meeting took place in 1975, when he was the former governor of California and she was leader of the UK opposition. In 1981, the British economy was entering its sixth quarter of recession, and her government seemed on course for electoral defeat. At her lowest point, no-one placed themselves by her side as much as the incoming president of the United States, who made her his administration's first visitor and treated her with a warm welcome, in stark contrast to the frugality of his predecessor, Jimmy Carter. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan became political soulmates and good friends. ""Your problems,"" said the British prime minister, ""will be our problems, and when you look for friends, we shall be there."" This video can not be played James Callaghan flew to Washington to meet new US president Jimmy Carter James Callaghan's arrival in Washington - on Concorde - came amid an ongoing siege nearby, which led to the cancellation of the traditional 19-gun salute in case it alarmed the gunman. But there was still ""a very relaxed feeling"" about the ceremony, the BBC reported. President Jimmy Carter hailed the special relationship between the two nations, while James Callaghan said ""concerted intergovernmental action"" was needed for the global economy to emerge from recession. He promised a ""very warm welcome"" when the US president visited London. This video can not be played Harold Wilson meets new US President Richard Nixon in 1969 The Labour prime minister and the Republican president were poles apart, both politically and in their approach. Richard Nixon recoiled from Harold Wilson's suggestion, made at their first meeting in London in February 1969, that the two men use each other's first names. Another incident had ratcheted up the tension. Before the 1968 election, when Mr Nixon was expected to lose to vice-president Hubert Humphrey, Mr Wilson appointed his old ally John Freeman as ambassador in Washington. Unfortunately, Mr Freeman had once described Mr Nixon as a ""man of no principle"", and the president was not best pleased. Mr Freeman offered to resign, but Mr Wilson said he should stay. Fortunately, at a banquet on his visit to Britain, Mr Nixon greeted the ambassador with generosity. Mr Wilson wrote the president a note thanking him for ""one of the kindest and most generous acts I have known in a quarter of a century in politics"". On his trip to Britain, Mr Nixon also visited ministers in Downing Street and came for one-on-one talks at Chequers. The president enjoyed his visit, and was soon writing notes to ""Dear Harold"" and signing them off ""Dick Nixon"". This video can not be played Harold Macmillan meets John F Kennedy in 1961 After their first meeting, in April 1961 Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and President John F Kennedy were close allies, despite the stark contrast between the ageing British patrician and the glamorous president 23 years his junior. Harold Macmillan was said to have a very real and lasting affection for a man who was of the same generation as his own son, Maurice. According to his biographer, Macmillan watched JFK on the national stage with ""a combination of nervousness and pride an accomplished actor might feel for a mercurial young protege stepping up to take his first starring role in public"". Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower, seen together in Bermuda in 1953 Winston Churchill arrived in New York to a rapturous reception. He met President-elect Dwight Eisenhower at the apartment of Bernard Baruch, a wealthy businessman, on two separate occasions in the weeks before the inauguration. They came from different backgrounds, Mr Eisenhower, a Kansas boy, born in a shack beside the railroad tracks in rural Texas, and Mr Churchill, a British aristocrat, born in Blenheim Palace. Yet they had a friendship that was forged in the darkest periods of World War Two and lasted until Churchill's death in 1965.

"Reunited: It was the first time Tim Peake had seen the capsule since stepping out of it in June The spacecraft that carried Tim Peake to and from the International Space Station last year has gone on display at London's Science Museum. The museum says the Russian capsule is an important part of UK space history and hopes it will inspire the public. The Soyuz TMA-19M has been refurbished, but is still slightly singed from re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Business Secretary Greg Clark has confirmed that Major Peake will make a second mission to the space station. The timing will be decided by the European Space Agency (Esa). Mr Clark said: ""Tim Peake's Principia mission inspired a generation, and showed just how far science can take you."" The UK committed in December to continue to participate in Esa's space station programme. And last week, Esa's director-general Jan Woerner set out his plans for human space flight at a news conference in Paris. He announced that another mission was ""foreseen"" for Major Peake in the next wave of European manned missions. A second flight for the British astronaut would likely happen in the period 2019-2024. Tim Peake's Soyuz capsule is shown on the Kazakh steppe shortly after it returned him and two other crew members to Earth Major Peake's capsule sits atop a Soyuz rocket on the launch pad at Baikonur in 2015 This video can not be played Tim Peake's capsule goes on display at Science Museum Tim Peake said he was delighted to see the capsule in the UK: ""I hope that for everybody who gets to visit it will have a really great source of inspiration and maybe sow the seeds of future dreams for other people. "" Just over a year ago, Tim Peake set off for his mission to the International Space Station. Within a few weeks he became the first British astronaut to walk in space. Executives at the Science Museum hope the spacecraft's connection to the British astronaut will prove a major draw. Museum director, Ian Blatchford, told BBC News that the purchase of the spacecraft was almost like an ""impulse buy"". He explained that he made a casual enquiry while in Moscow over the summer whether the spacecraft was for sale and to his surprise the spacecraft owners agreed. It was from within this 2m-high, bell-shaped vehicle that Major Peake witnessed the wonders of space. The right-hand seat was Tim's and from it he looked out of the window and saw the curvature of the Earth for the first time. It was also from this window that he witnessed what it was like to re-enter the atmosphere at the end of his mission. The spacecraft provides the UK with a link to its own astronauts and a reminder of its role in space exploration.

"This video can not be played Residents were surprised to see the prince running down their street Prince Harry has been turning heads in his running gear - as he went for a jog with a group of young homeless people. He donned tights, shorts and trainers to pound the pavements in Willesden Green, north London, for a 17-minute run. The royal drew double-takes from motorists as he stepped out with young people and volunteers from the Running Charity. The charity helps young people develop life skills through sport. Prince Harry joined warm up before jogging with volunteers and young homeless people Programme officer Claude Umuhire, 26, took the runners, including a Met Police protection officer, through a strenuous warm-up session then led the more gentle run. He said about Harry: ""He didn't find any of it hard, I think he's been training just for today. ""He found everything easy. ""I tried to get him in the warm-up but he did pretty well, he kept giving me looks though every time I said five squats."" Despite apparently coping well with the run, the Prince suggested he might prefer a lighter form of exercise on future visits. When he left, he referred to a pool table in the charity's HQ and joked: ""Next time I will come and play pool maybe."" Prince Harry looked at a picture of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, after arriving at Depaul Trust Hostel Mr Umuhire added: ""There was a woman who was pulling out of her driveway then she realised who he was and she drove in front of us and started taking pictures of him. ""And as we were leaving, there was a guy at the traffic lights who looked across and did a double take - the joy in his face it was so funny, his eyes just opened up, he was so happy.""

"The gorilla would play with the village children and sometimes attended school with them The true tale of a gorilla who was raised like a child in an English village has been rediscovered. The ape, called John Daniel, was adopted by Alyce Cunningham, from Uley, Gloucestershire, in 1918 after her brother bought it for Â£300 in London. Village archivist Margaret Groom has published a collection of pictures of John Daniel in a book about Uley. The animal was sold to an American when it became too big for Ms Cunningham to look after. It died in 1922. Mrs Groom found the collection of photos in the village archives and said it was ""quite unique to have a gorilla grow up here"". She said: ""People still talk about it and a lot of people don't believe it. They say 'oh no that can't be possible'."" John Daniel was captured as a baby in Gabon and brought to the UK, where Ms Cunnigham's brother Rupert Penny saw it for sale in a department store. John Daniel was adopted by Alyse Cunningham and lived with her at her country house in Uley She adopted the ape and nicknamed him Sultan. Mrs Groom said John Daniel was raised like a normal child, had its own bedroom and could use the light switch and toilet. She said the villagers were very fond of the ape, which would play with children, eat roses from garden and drink cups of tea. Chidlren in Uley had fun wheeling John Daniel around the village in a wheelbarrow Once it grew to adult size Ms Cunningham could no longer look after it so, in 1921, she sold it to an American for one thousand guineas. She thought it would be sent to a home in Florida, but instead the ape ended up in Barnum and Baileys Circus. There its health deteriorated, with reports reaching Ms Cunningham that the animal was pining for her. She set sail for New York but the gorilla, by now aged four-and-a-half, died from pneumonia before she arrived. The story of John Daniel is also set to be part of an exhibition later this year in Uley.

"This video can not be played 'Rock, paper, scissors' like you've never seen it before What if it all depended on a rock, paper, scissors contest? Everything you had ever worked for your entire life, decided by a split-second choice. Rock. Paper. Scissors. For 24-year-old Miku Tanabe, that is exactly what happened. Whengripping footage emerged last month,externalof what appeared to be the most intense and melodramatic response to victory in any rock, paper, scissors contest in the history of mankind, the internet was beside itself with bewilderment. The crowd roared, she doubled over, wept with joy, the frenzy rose - and finally, she just looked at her hand, her bare hand, the true hero of this historic win. Despite being in AKB48 for years, Ms Tanabe never had a prominent role in the band What most people did not know was this was a contest that decided which member of wildly popular Japanese girl group AKB48 would get to front the band. ""For the last decade, I didn't get to do much TV work or didn't stand in the front row of our performance at the AKB theatre,"" Tanabe told the BBC. Suddenly her hysteria made much more sense. What lies behind the almost comic melodrama is actually a story of personal ambition, disappointment and an insight into Japan's unique music industry. Competition for roles at the top of the sprawling band empire is fierce Since 2005, the AKB48 group has sold more than 40 million singles and it has become little short of a phenomenon in the time it has been active. There are some 130 girls, not 48, in AKB48, and not all of them get to be part of their songs or TV appearances. They gained popularity as ""idols you can go and meet"" because members hold a daily performance at the AKB theatre in Akihabara. They are usually selected by producer Yasushi Akimoto based on their popularity.  And in what's known as the ""AKB48 general election"", the members of not only AKB48 but also its sister groups have been ranked by their fans annually since 2009. Ms Tanabe did not even stand in AKB48's election for the last two years, which in 2014 was won by Mayu Watanabe The competition between them can be intense and despite making it to one of the most sought-after pop music outfits in the country, it is easy to feel like you have failed. While Tanabe is a 10-year veteran of the band, it's safe to say she hasn't really enjoyed the spotlight. Her best performance was when she came 71st out of 296 girls in 2014 in the popularity contest. At that time it seemed to be the best outcome she could hope for so for the last two years, she didn't even stand in the AKB general election. She appeared to have given up becoming identified as a successful member of the group. AKB48's election even has Japanese political candidate-style posters for band members standing But seven years ago the selection took an unusual twist when the management began holding an  annual competition of rock, paper, scissors, or scissor, paper, stone, as it is otherwise known. ""This competition gives an opportunity to any members, so when I first heard that I could grab an opportunity to be selected by winning at rock, paper, scissors, I was excited and was very motivated,""  she told the BBC. For six years, she didn't come close to winning this game of chance. In 2010, she came 12th in the rock, paper, scissors competition. Then it got to October 2016. ""When I got to the final match, when I realised I might actually win, I was actually more scared than being thrilled,"" she recalled. The rest is internet history. AKB48 is essentially a franchise, with sister ""48"" acts around Japan and Asia As the winner, Tanabe got to be the lead singer of a seven-member unit for their newly released song ""Sakasa zaka"". ""I felt that all my hard work for the last decade has paid off,"" she told the BBC. Four months before she won the rock, paper, scissors competition, she wrote inher blog,externalthat ""I am probably approaching the end-of-life as an idol but I want to do what I can."" So the victory came as a surprise and reassured her that she was right not to have given up and felt justified in persevering despite the setbacks. ""I was selected because I continued being part of AKB48,"" she said. ""It was purely based on luck and the result was something I've long been wanting for."" ""Janken"", or rock-paper-scissors, is widely used to settle trivial disputes in Japan The competition is not without controversy. Some viewers complained in 2012 - when Japan's territorial dispute with China was at its recent peak - to ask why a TV station dropped a news programme to broadcast a mere rock, paper, scissors competition. When an already popular member won the competition in 2013, others asked if it was staged. And despite the brief attention that Tanabe enjoyed, her song hasn't been performing too well. This is a brutally competitive industry which is difficult to get into and even harder to maintain any hard-earned popularity andcertainly comes with the dark side. AKB48 as a group has so far survived its ups and downs, partly thanks to the reality TV elements of these competitions. And Tanabe is well aware the spotlight won't be on her forever. On the day of her CD sale, she had a poignanttweet,external: ""I doubt I'd ever take centre stage again in my life,"" and urged her fans to buy it for memory's sake.

"Amy Adams played Louise Banks in Arrival For a brief moment, Amy Adams' name was listed amongst the best actress nominees for the 2017 Oscars. But sadly for her, and her legion of fans, it was simply a typo. Soon, #NoAmyAdams was trending on Twitter. ""How could she not be nominated for Oscar?"" asked one. Another wrote: ""Ugh they did not just snub Amy Adams."" So why was it such a surprise the star failed to pick up a nomination, either for her role in best picture nominee Arrival, or for her other Oscar contender, Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals? Ten talking points from the Oscar nominations The women who did get a best actress nomination The Oscars: Full coverage Denis Villeneuve, director of the sci-fi film that sees Adams' linguist character Louise Banks attempt to speak to aliens, is no doubt pleased it is up for best picture. But he could not hide his sadness the star missed out. ""This is the big disappointment,""Villeneuve told US media,external. ""I'm deeply disappointed for Amy. ""She was the soul of this movie. For me, it was a given! She had the movie on her shoulders, she's the one who made it happen. ""It's a strange feeling to celebrate and feel sad at the same time."" Adams's fans made light of her lack of nomination on Twitter Film critics were unanimous in their praise of Adams in Arrival. The New York Timessaid,external: ""By turns inviting and opaque, Ms Adams turns softness and quiet into heroic qualities, keeping her voice low, modulated, and using stillness to draw you near."" The Los Angeles Timesagreed,external: ""Arrival is really Adams's film, a showcase for her ability to quietly and effectively meld intelligence, empathy and reserve."" The Telegraphsaid,external: ""Adams is one of the best actresses Hollywood has."" And it praised ""the supreme subtlety and screwed-down focus of her work"" in the film. The filmtopped the UK box officein November after taking Â£2.9m on its opening weekend - and it's received such a popularity boost in awards season that it's heading back to US cinemas with extra footage. ""Arrival is one awesome film. Must watch. Brilliant acting by Amy Adams,"" Arvind Ramanathantweeted,externallast month. Anna Escurriola agreed,writing,external: ""Arrival is extraordinary and the acting of Amy Adams is superb. When I see movies like this I love cinema even more."" Writing after the Oscar nominations had been announced, Christian Kellysaid,external: ""I must say, it is disappointing to not see Amy Adams nominated for Arrival. She was fantastic and drove the story beautifully."" Adams has quietly amassed an impressive list of acclaimed screen roles which has seen her nominated for Oscars five times in just over a decade. She was most recently recognised for playing Sydney Prosser in American Hustle, being nominated for best actress in 2014. She also picked up best supporting actress nods in 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2013 for roles in Junebug, Doubt, The Fighter and The Master. The Academy sometimes likes to reward people who've been waiting for a while for a trophy. Leonardo DiCaprio finally won best actor for The Revenant last year after campaigning by fans in his repeated nominations for other roles. But Adams is yet to pick up the elusive trophy. Arrival picked up a handful of nominations for this year's Oscars, with her other big film Nocturnal Animals scoring one. But did that split the vote and scupper her chance of success? It could well have done. Other actresses who have been nominated this year include Emma Stone and Natalie Portman - for La La Land and Jackie respectively. Their performances in those films have been widely praised and are the only roles both actresses have been associated with this awards season. By appearing in two critically-acclaimed movies near the Oscars, Adams may well have scuppered her own chances of a nomination, with Academy voters splitting their nominations between them. Astonishingly, Adams has received best actress nominations for her part in Arrival at 33 other film awards so far this season - and already won five of them. Among those recognising her include the Golden Globes, Bafta, London Critics Circle and Screen Actors Guild. They can't all be wrong can they?

"When the right to request flexible working was extended to all employees in 2014, the move was heralded as a game changer in the workplace. Georgie Gayler says she would never want to get a colleague in trouble but when people with kids take time off ""it adds up"" With anyone eligible to ask to work from home and/or reduce their hours, it seemed that a narrative long synonymous with working mothers and childcare had finally broadened in scope. Yet it appears we are some way off the level playing field anticipated. While technology continues to blur the boundary between home and the office and the rise of the gig economy demands more workplace agility, it seems childless employees are still experiencing a bias that makes a work-life balance a pipedream. ""From accommodating religious commitments to managing long-term medical conditions such as anxiety and depression, there are many reasons why people need to work flexibly, but many employers still view this as a privilege just for parents with young children,"" says Kate Headley, director of consulting at The Clear Company, which helps organisations recruit staff from a more diverse base. ""Instead, they need to open up their thinking to adopt flexible working and attract a whole new talent pool of qualified people that either can't or choose not to work traditional hours."" And for freelance social media director Georgie Gayler, who doesn't have children, a bias over formal flexible working requests is only part of the story. In her experience inconsistencies are rife and unquestioned across a number of informal arrangements, from time off automatically given when children are ill to leaving work early or coming in late to accommodate their needs. ""If their children are sick, or they need flexible working suddenly due to difficulties at home, then of course this should be recognised, but at the same time, the job still needs to be done and without an impact on other colleagues, and this is where it can often fall,"" she says. ""I'd never want to get a colleague in trouble over what might be considered a 'petty' 30 minutes here and there, but it adds up and is noticed more than managers and HR departments think."" Parents leaving work early or coming in late because of the school run can cause tension with co-workers With tensions particularly acute when it comes to ""picking up the slack"", some employment lawyers think there could be scope for a change in the law to ensure like-for-like hours. Such a development would be welcomed by people like marketing professional Ryan Lock. The 30-year-old jumped ship from his most recent job, having found that the flexible working culture promoted as an organisation-wide benefit was a perk available only to parents. ""I've seen colleagues have to fight really hard for something that has been advertised to them while having to cover when working parents take leave at short notice,"" he says. ""For me, flexible working is something that empowers you to work where and when you feel you can be most productive, be it home, the office or a coffee shop, whereas I do think a certain generation of senior management with children see it as a chance to block out windows for extracurricular activities."" For many millennials, flexible working means being able to work in environments where you can be the most productive As a millennial, he's part of the demographic increasingly rejecting the nine-to-five working model and demanding more from their employers.  It's a group that Claire Knowles, a partner at Acuity Legal, believes will be the driving force behind future legislative change in the next five years. In the meantime, while complaints against employers for unfair treatment are common, she admits few make it to tribunal. Perhaps even more surprising is the negligible rise in requests from childless employees to work flexibly since the legislation changed. ""The most common grievances around flexible working generally still involve parents - usually women - who have requested flexible working for an average of three years while they start families, but they then expect to be able to revert back to their normal working hours immediately and employers can't accommodate this,"" says Ms Knowles. Can your job be as flexible as this? Low paid 'miss out on flexible working' Can you be part-time at the top? While some cite a simple lack of awareness, Sir Cary Cooper, psychology professor at Manchester Business School, argues that internal pressures and a precarious economic climate are deterring childless employees from ""rocking the boat"". As lead scientist onThe Foresight Project: Mental Capital and Wellbeing,externalhe was tasked with advising the government on how to achieve the best possible mental well-being in the population, a study which included an in-depth look at the workplace. Women who request flexible working to start families are often surprised when they cannot later return to their original working hours His recommendation to extend the right to request flexible working was a catalyst in the law being changed, but now he would like to see childless employees pursue the right more robustly. ""There is concern particularly with men that requesting this shows a lack of commitment but we now have this law, a bedrock that says it's ok [to ask] and that employers have to give a very good reason for not granting it,"" he says. ""From a talent management perspective and given the technology we now have at our disposal I don't understand why all employers aren't embracing it, given the impact flexible working has on productivity."" Indeed, his report found that the benefit to the UK economy associated with offering the right to request flexible working to parents with children to be around Â£165m, and when opened to non-parents of working age the figure rises to Â£250m. Non-parent Claire Hyde is grateful that her employer lets her jobshare Lloyds Banking Group was an early proponent of opening flexible working to all. The company says putting bottom line before presenteeism has increased productivity, including a 10% rise in answered calls as well as increased employee satisfaction and retention rates. The company's joint head of internal communications, Claire Hyde, who doesn't have children, is a case in point. With 15 years' service to date, her three-day-a-week jobshare arrangement includes a mix of office and home working. ""I really appreciate being with a company that doesn't discriminate based on parental status. Everyone's individual circumstances are different and people may have other caring responsibilities, roles in their local community or additional personal commitments, organisations should be recognising and adapting to this."" And with 19 million people without dependents employed in the UK and global childlessness on the rise, perhaps she has a point. Can your job be as flexible as this?

The Mail thinks an internal investigation will decide whether Southern's performance is so poor that it has breached the terms of its contract.

"A small dig carried out after the scan confirmed the findings Ground-penetrating scans of a park have revealed three near-complete Roman buildings in Chichester. Archaeologists, who were left stunned by the degree of preservation, have said the only reason they survived was because Priory Park was never built on. Two houses and a third building were found. Moving images from a scan show the shapes of two buildings emerge. It is thought the houses in Noviomagus Reginorum - the Roman name for the town - were owned by people of importance. For more archaeology stories follow our Pinterest board,external More news from Sussex here Local geophysics specialist David Staveley, who had set out to identify all the city's Roman roads, was given permission to scan the parks because some might have survived there. This video can not be played Scans revealed a townhouse and another building Following his scans, a small dig was carried out in Priory Park. It is thought the houses were originally on a street but the road did not survive. James Kenny, an archaeologist at Chichester District Council, said the scans showed a townhouse with rooms and a freestanding building in the corner. ""It's difficult to say what it might have been, but the walls did survive. It might have been part of a bathhouse, or a cellar, or a winter dining room with under-floor heating,"" he said. Mr Kenny admitted there was ""nothing exceptional"" about a Roman house in a Roman town. But he said: ""What's exceptional is in a Roman town like Chichester, most of the archaeology has been interrupted by all sorts of house building."" Added to that, the city had no sewers until the 1880s and people had to dig holes in the ground, he said. ""An awful lot of archaeology was lost."" However, Priory Park, originally home to a monastery, had not been developed, and the buildings buried 0.5m below the surface showed a ""remarkable degree of preservation"", Mr Kenny said. Further exploration will take place this year and there may also be a larger investigation in the future. Scans also revealed another Roman street under the park, but this will not be uncovered.

"This video can not be played EU no longer wants to ""chastise"" the UK, says Philip Hammond It is the big question swirling around government. After another set of economic figures stronger than expected, is this economic pain cancelled, or simply postponed? On that central issue rests the fate of the government's economic policy. If it is pain cancelled that means better real incomes for voters. It means higher tax receipts for the government, lower levels of borrowing and more leeway to spend money on public services. And, of course, confidence tends to beget confidence. If consumers - the most important drivers of the UK economy - feel the world around them is feeling positive, they tend to spend. For businesses, it is not a lot different. Larry Fink, the head of the world's largest asset managers, BlackRock, made an interesting point at the World Economic Forum at Davos last week. Asked why consumer confidence hadn't collapsed following the referendum - or at least had recovered strongly after some initial uncertainty - Mr Fink answered that for lots of people who voted for Brexit or who voted for Donald Trump, the victories were not a negative event. ""They won,"" he said, simply felt good and kept spending. ""Car sales went up."" For the UK economy, it is worth considering two points. The Bank of England increased financial support for businesses after the Brexit vote First, the gloomy forecasts before the referendum about the possible effects of a vote to leave the European Union were based on Article 50, the mechanism for leaving the EU, being triggered immediately after the vote as David Cameron promised. That could have led to a chaotic departure from the EU and certainly would have created greater economic dislocation. Second, the Bank of England cut interest rates and increased financial support for businesses and banks, soothing market fears. These two points are not enough to explain all of the resilience in the economy, but they go some of the way. In my interview with the chancellor, he admitted that he was now ""more optimistic"" about the process of leaving the EU and the single market. He said that European leaders were no longer in chastising mood over Brexit, that had now past. A good deal is on, he said. A weaker pound is set to push up the price of everyday goods But, and of course there has to be a but when considering how an economy will perform -  a judgement at its most basic on how a million different decisions by human beings will play out. And the buts are these. The rate of inflation is increasing as the value of sterling declines. That will affect people's real incomes. Jobs are being moved out of the UK and on to the continent in sectors such as banking and finance as businesses prepare for Brexit. Investments have been delayed. The UK has, of course, not actually left the EU yet and at the moment is enjoying the stimulus of being in the EU's huge single market with a considerably weaker currency. That goldilocks situation will not last and the chancellor told me of his concerns about business investment. It was the Austrian economist, Joseph Schumpeter, who argued that shocks to an economy can boost growth. ""Creative destruction"" may be a little strong to describe the Brexit vote, but innovation can flow when the demands of uncertainty rise. After Britain fell out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, the precursor of the single currency, many predicted that inflation would rise and economic growth would stutter. In fact, the UK economy bounced back, inflation remained in check and the pound rose - after an initial fall. That is not to say that all ""dynamic"" shocks have such an effect. The financial crisis of 2008-09 has negatively affected economic growth for far longer than most expected as the financial services sector contracted rapidly, liquidity disappeared and businesses and consumers paid down debt. That is why it is still too early to say definitively whether the robust state of the UK economy today means the forecasts for economic pain made before the Brexit vote can now be safely ignored.

"Theresa May is preparing to meet new US President Donald Trump. Here's a look back at some first encounters of UK prime ministers and new US presidents: Gordon Brown andBarackObama - 3 March 2009 This video can not be played Gordon Brown's first meeting with Barack Obama came amid a global economic crisis The election of Barack Obama came at the tail end of the Labour government. Embroiled in both economic and political crisis, Gordon Brown spotted President Obama's election as an opportunity to be touched by the gold dust of the newly elected president. In March 2009, Downing Street proudly boasted that Mr Brown was the first European leader President Obama had met. The first meeting was dominated by the global financial crisis and the upcoming G20 summit in London. However, there was some embarrassment when President Obama gifted a box of US films to Brown - on DVDs that did not work on UK players. This video can not be played The two leaders went on to form a close bond Tony Blair and George W Bush's first summit came at a snowy Camp David - the US president's official retreat - seven months before the 9/11 attacks that would come to define their relationship. The two leaders would eventually form a tight bond, with both countries going to war in Iraq despite the opposition of some European allies. But the Camp David summit is remembered for something rather more trivial. Upon being asked what the two leaders had in common, President Bush replied: ""Well, we both use Colgate toothpaste."" This video can not be played There were trade tensions between Europe and the US when the two leaders met The first encounter between John Major and Bill Clinton was just a month after the president's inauguration. There was a certain degree of nervousness before the meeting. Mr Major had been a ferocious backer of George H W Bush in the 1992 presidential election. And between 1993 and 1997, the relationship between Mr Major and Mr Clinton never really blossomed. They fell out over the US issuing a visa to Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and the brewing conflict in the Balkans. There are shades of the present-day debate in the BBC's Martin Sixmith's report, as he says trade tensions between the European Community and the USA, and accusations of protectionism, are a ""cloud"" over Mr Major's visit. This video can not be played Margaret Thatcher meets incoming president George Bush Margaret Thatcher and president-elect George H W Bush's first official visit took place during her trip to Washington DC in November 1988. The visit was planned before the election to say goodbye to her ally Ronald Reagan, and the BBC report at the time wondered whether her relationship with President Bush could be ""as special"". She spent some time with the incoming president to discuss the end of the Cold War and the tensions in the Gulf. A year after she left Downing Street, President Bush invited Thatcher back to the White House to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award of the United States. This video can not be played Margaret Thatcher had a close relationship with Ronald Reagan When Margaret Thatcher met President Reagan just a month into his presidency, they weren't strangers - their first meeting took place in 1975, when he was the former governor of California and she was leader of the UK opposition. In 1981, the British economy was entering its sixth quarter of recession, and her government seemed on course for electoral defeat. At her lowest point, no-one placed themselves by her side as much as the incoming president of the United States, who made her his administration's first visitor and treated her with a warm welcome, in stark contrast to the frugality of his predecessor, Jimmy Carter. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan became political soulmates and good friends. ""Your problems,"" said the British prime minister, ""will be our problems, and when you look for friends, we shall be there."" This video can not be played James Callaghan flew to Washington to meet new US president Jimmy Carter James Callaghan's arrival in Washington - on Concorde - came amid an ongoing siege nearby, which led to the cancellation of the traditional 19-gun salute in case it alarmed the gunman. But there was still ""a very relaxed feeling"" about the ceremony, the BBC reported. President Jimmy Carter hailed the special relationship between the two nations, while James Callaghan said ""concerted intergovernmental action"" was needed for the global economy to emerge from recession. He promised a ""very warm welcome"" when the US president visited London. This video can not be played Harold Wilson meets new US President Richard Nixon in 1969 The Labour prime minister and the Republican president were poles apart, both politically and in their approach. Richard Nixon recoiled from Harold Wilson's suggestion, made at their first meeting in London in February 1969, that the two men use each other's first names. Another incident had ratcheted up the tension. Before the 1968 election, when Mr Nixon was expected to lose to vice-president Hubert Humphrey, Mr Wilson appointed his old ally John Freeman as ambassador in Washington. Unfortunately, Mr Freeman had once described Mr Nixon as a ""man of no principle"", and the president was not best pleased. Mr Freeman offered to resign, but Mr Wilson said he should stay. Fortunately, at a banquet on his visit to Britain, Mr Nixon greeted the ambassador with generosity. Mr Wilson wrote the president a note thanking him for ""one of the kindest and most generous acts I have known in a quarter of a century in politics"". On his trip to Britain, Mr Nixon also visited ministers in Downing Street and came for one-on-one talks at Chequers. The president enjoyed his visit, and was soon writing notes to ""Dear Harold"" and signing them off ""Dick Nixon"". This video can not be played Harold Macmillan meets John F Kennedy in 1961 After their first meeting, in April 1961 Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and President John F Kennedy were close allies, despite the stark contrast between the ageing British patrician and the glamorous president 23 years his junior. Harold Macmillan was said to have a very real and lasting affection for a man who was of the same generation as his own son, Maurice. According to his biographer, Macmillan watched JFK on the national stage with ""a combination of nervousness and pride an accomplished actor might feel for a mercurial young protege stepping up to take his first starring role in public"". Winston Churchill and Dwight Eisenhower, seen together in Bermuda in 1953 Winston Churchill arrived in New York to a rapturous reception. He met President-elect Dwight Eisenhower at the apartment of Bernard Baruch, a wealthy businessman, on two separate occasions in the weeks before the inauguration. They came from different backgrounds, Mr Eisenhower, a Kansas boy, born in a shack beside the railroad tracks in rural Texas, and Mr Churchill, a British aristocrat, born in Blenheim Palace. Yet they had a friendship that was forged in the darkest periods of World War Two and lasted until Churchill's death in 1965.

"Mr Trump's border wall announcement will make most of the headlines today, given that it was a central focus of his presidential campaign and has increased diplomatic tension with the Mexican government. His plan to target US ""sanctuary cities"", however, likely sets the stage for a much tougher, uglier domestic political fight. More than 400 jurisdictions across the country, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle - major cities in left-leaning states that did not vote for Mr Trump - have enacted policies protecting undocumented immigrants within their boundaries. Officials in these designated areas, including local law enforcement, are not allowed to enquire as to an individual's immigration status in the course of their duties. Candidate Trump pledged to end this practice, and on Wednesday he put some teeth into his promise - authorising the federal government to withhold funds from cities that do not co-operate with immigration officials or comply with federal law. His executive order frames the issue as one of national security. ""Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States wilfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States,"" it reads. ""These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our republic."" This video can not be played Mayors take stand against Trump The US government has often used the power of the purse to compel states and localities to bend to its will on matters like highway speed limits, educational policies and setting a minimum drinking age. So far, however, some of the biggest cities are preparing to go toe-to-toe with the federal government over the issue. They assert that they need to be able to provide services to all their residents to avoid public health crises and encourage co-operation between undocumented immigrants and police. ""Building and maintaining trust between local law enforcement and the communities they bravely serve is vital to ensuring public safety,"" New York Attorney General Eric T Schneiderman said in a press statement. ""Any attempt to bully local governments into abandoning policies that have proven to keep our cities safe is not only unconstitutional, but threatens the safety of our citizens."" According to estimates, New York City alone couldrisk losing,externalmore than $7bn in federal funds - although Mr Trump's executive order clarifies that funding for law enforcement won't be affected. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, whose city could lose $1bn in funding, took a similarlyconfrontational tone,external. ""There is no stranger among us,"" he said. ""We welcome people, whether you're from Poland or Pakistan, whether you're from Ireland or India or Israel and whether you're from Mexico or Moldova, where my grandfather came from, you are welcome in Chicago as you pursue the American Dream."" This video can not be played Sanctuary cities under threat by Donald Trump Larger cities may be willing to stand and fight the Trump administration, but they're not the only jurisdictions that could be in the crosshairs. Smaller towns, like Maywood, California, also have set themselves up as sanctuary cities, and they may be less able to survive the threatened federal cutbacks - unless they get help from their state governments. ""California is going to fight Trump all the way, and that's great to have the support from state leadership,"" Eduardo De La Riva, mayor pro tem of Maywood,told,externalthe Los Angeles Times. ""I think we're sending a clear message when you have several of the largest cities also saying we're going to take a stance."" In 2004 then-Senator Barack Obama condemned those who tried to divide the US into red states and blue states - Republican and Democratic. Mr Trump, in his inaugural address, took a more confrontational tone, and he appears ready to follow through with a policy that sets his conservative administration in a direct and highly visible confrontation with liberal cities.

"Levels of violence are up, staff numbers are down and complaints about overcrowding are widespread. Why are prisons in England and Wales under pressure? ""There's an incident at height - the prison's in lockdown."" I was in the gate-lodge at High Down Prison in Surrey when a message came through from the governor. BBC Special Report: Prisons under pressure,external The Ministry of Justice - which controls prisons in England and Wales - had, unusually, granted permission for me to visit a jail for aradio documentary about prison violence. High Down prison in Surrey They had chosen High Down, a prison built on the site of an old mental hospital and now home to 1,100 male inmates. I waited in the visitors centre worried my visit might be cancelled, but half an hour later the incident had been resolved. Ian Bickers, the High Down governor at the time of my visit in December 2014, brushed aside what had happened. A prisoner had clambered on to the safety netting under a landing because he was unhappy with the regime and wanted to move to another jail. Mr Bickers explained that prisoner protests were a common occurrence, but required adept handling. At that stage, High Down was on the edge of instability. Since then, a number of jails in England and Wales have fallen over the edge. This video can not be played The footage is understood to have been filmed by inmates of HMP Birmingham The recent disturbances at Lewes, Bedford, Birmingham and Swaleside prisons; the fatal stabbing of an inmate at Pentonville, followed by the escape of two of its prisoners; and therecord number of prisoner suicidesand assaults on staff all provide concrete evidence of the turmoil behind bars. In 2015, in his last annual report as Chief Inspector of Prisons, Nick Hardwick said jails were in their worst state for a decade. Last year, David Cameron, in one of his final domestic policy speeches as prime minister,said reoffending rates and levels of prison violence, drug-taking and self-harm ""should shame us all"". Even Liz Truss, who as justice secretary has overall responsibility for prisons, acknowledges that they're ""not working"" and are under ""serious and sustained pressure"". There have always been problems. For many years, internal reports painted a picture of daily outbreaks of violence, cell fires and self-harm across the prisons estate. This video can not be played The aftermath of the 1990 Strangeways Prison riot The worst disorder in the history of the prison service came in 1990 when two people died and hundreds were injured during rioting at Strangeways, in Manchester.  It evolved into a 25-day protest against the squalid conditions and was followed by disturbances at eight other prisons. The report into Strangeways was meant to be a watershed. It did lead to some improvements, including the beginning of the end of the practice of slopping out, where prisoners used chamber pots in their cells, but it did not herald an end to prison overcrowding. The principal reason is numbers. England and Waleswent from almost 45,000 prisoners in 1991 to 85,000 two decades later- an increase of nearly 90%. Justice and policing are devolved matters for Scotland and Northern Ireland. There has been nothing like the same rise in the jail population in Scotland, where the latest figure, around 7,200, is the lowest it has been for a decade. In Northern Ireland, there are some 1,500 people in custody, about 300 fewer than in the mid-1990s. So why did numbers rise so steeply in England and Wales? Some lobby groups and criminologists point to a ""moral panic"" following the murder in 1993 of the toddler James Bulger. Experts describe a sentencing ""arms race"" between political parties vying to be the strongest on law and order. Former Conservative leader Michael Howard's ""prison works"" versus former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's ""tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime"". This video can not be played Inside Wandsworth Prison: Trashed cells, hooch and legal highs Whatever the reasons, average sentence lengths have crept up,more offenders have been jailed for life or indeterminate termsand growing numbers of released prisoners have had to return to custody for breaching their licence conditions. New jails have been built, but have not kept up with demand. The Prison Reform Trust (PRT) calculates that an average of 20,000 prisoners, almost a quarter of the total, are held in overcrowded conditions. Many share cells designed for one. At times, when Labour was in power, there was so little spare capacity that cells at police stations and in court buildings were used to hold inmates. To ease the pressure, a scheme was introduced to let prisoners out up to 18 days before their standard release date, halfway through their sentence. Eighty-thousand inmates were freed under the scheme - in addition to those released early under an existing programme which required them to wear electronic tags. Overcrowding has a corrosive effect. It is, in the words of Strangeways report author Lord Woolf, ""a cancer eating at the ability of the prison service"" to deliver effective education, tackle offending behaviour and prepare prisoners for life on the outside. When the Coalition Government came to power in 2010 it began to look for savings, as part of its effort to reduce overall public spending. Five years later theNational Offender Management Service,external(NOMS), which is responsible for prisons in England and Wales, had reduced its budget by nearly a quarter. Wandsworth Prison is one of the country's most overcrowded Old jails that were expensive to operate were shut - 18 have closed since 2011. But the other tactic in the efficiency drive has been a programme of ""benchmarking"". Publicly run jails are required to peg their costs to the same level as the most efficient prisons, including those in the private sector. Fourteen jails in England and Wales, and two out of 15 prisons in Scotland, are operated by private firms - G4S, Serco and Sodexo. And benchmarking has certainly led to savings. The Ministry of Justice estimates that the average annual cost of a prison place fell by 20% between 2009-10 and 2015-16 to about Â£35,000. Benchmarking has involved major changes to the regime in prisons and cuts to staffing.  A standardised ""core day"" has been introduced in some jails, with the aim of making the most of prisoners' time out of their cells and giving them certainty about what activities they are doing. But the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Peter Clarke, said jails which had brought in the new core days had not increased the amount of prisoners' time spent unlocked. Under half of jails were assessed as delivering ""good"" or ""reasonably good"" purposeful activities compared with more than two-thirds in 2009-10. With the benchmarking programme and other cost-cutting, there was a dramatic reduction in staff numbers. Posts were cut in the Northern Ireland Prison Service as well, but in Scotland staff numbers have risen. The overall number of staff employed across the public sector prison estate in England and Wales has fallen from 45,000 in 2010 to just under 31,000 in September 2016. Although a small part of the reduction has been because of employees switching to jails transferred to the private sector, the decline is substantial by any measure, with the number of prison officers working in key front-line roles down by more than 6,000. The jobs market in areas such as London and south-east England has been so competitive that prisons have found it hard to attract and retain replacements on a Â£20,500 starting salary. Many experienced prison officers have taken voluntary redundancy - with their know-how and jail-craft sorely missed. About 200 staff each month are brought in from other jails to work at prisons where vacancies cannot be filled. Last November, members of the Prison Officers Association took part in a24-hour walkoutin protest at what they said were the ""chronic staff shortages and impoverished regimes"" in jails which they claimed had resulted in staff no longer being safe. As thousands of prison staff departed, a seemingly intractable drugs problem began to arrive in jails - ""legal highs"", also known as new psychoactive substances (NPS). Sold under names such as Spice and Black Mamba, by 2013 the synthetic cannabis compounds had become a major problem. In contrast, Scottish prisons have had no record of any seizures of the drug. Synthetic drugs are becoming an increasing problem in England's prisons The health dangers, bizarre behaviour and violence associated with NPS led to them being banned in the UK last year. In prisons, they have proved to be an unpredictable, and occasionally lethal, alternative to cannabis. Between June 2013 and April 2016, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman identified 64 deaths in jail where the prisoner was known or strongly suspected to have used or possessed NPS before they died. Despite the dangers, these synthetic drugs are popular because they are hard to detect using conventional drug testing methods and they provide a diversion to the boredom and frustration of prison life. The drugs are a source of income for criminal gangs whose illicit use of phones and drones, combined with the help of a number of corrupt staff, has helped the trade thrive behind bars. This video can not be played Watch a drone deliver drugs and mobile phones to London prisoners in April 2016 The destabilising impact of synthetic drugs, together with the loss of so many staff in such a short space of time, against a backdrop of overcrowding, has proved to be a dangerous cocktail for our prisons. The government's policy document, entitledPrison Safety and Reform,,externalpublished in November, acknowledges the scale of the challenge.  An extra 2,500 prison officers are being recruited, there will be financial incentives for staff to stay in their jobs, while sniffer dogs and new methods of drug testing are being deployed. Labour said the announcement was ""too little, too late"", saying earlier staff cuts had created a ""crisis in safety"". And there are calls for far more radical measures. Nick Clegg, deputy prime minister in the Coalition, together with the former Home Secretaries Jacqui Smith and Ken Clarke, said prisoner numbers must be steadily cut back to the levels of the early 90s, a reduction of some 40,000 inmates. ""We believe that an escalating prison population has gone well beyond what is safe or sustainable,"" they wrote in a letter to the Times. There are no signs, however, that Liz Truss, the justice secretary, has any intention of arbitrarily cutting the jail population. Sentencing changes and early release schemes are simply not on her agenda. Justice Secretary Liz Truss wants to cut prisoner numbers by reducing reoffending Michael Spurr, the chief executive of NOMS, has even gone as far as to say that he cannot see an end to prison overcrowding until at least after the next parliament - 2025, at the earliest. Instead, Ms Truss believes that any drop in prisoner numbers should come through a reduction in reoffending - fewer people going through the revolving door of the criminal justice system. She is hoping that extra staff and security improvements will steady the ship while longer-term changes to the management of prisons take effect.  Governors will have greater autonomy, there will be closer monitoring of prison performance and education and investment in modern facilities. HMP Berwyn in north Wales will be the UK's biggest prison A new jail, HMP Berwyn, opens in north Wales next month.  It has cost Â£250m to build and will house more than 2,000 male prisoners - making it the biggest prison in the UK. The extra places will help relieve some of the pressure on a system that still relies heavily on jails constructed in the Victorian era.  But more important, Berwyn sends a clear message that in spite of all the recent trouble, tensions and turmoil within prison walls, the government remains committed to the concept of imprisonment itself.

"Health inequality has been much discussed at learned seminars. In 2010 a ground-breaking report for the government in England by Sir Michael Marmot set out the social factors governing health and pointed to the role of a child's early years in determining life chances. Now, leading child health experts are saying that little progress has been made since then and that health inequality is still blighting the lives of young people. TheRoyal College of Paediatrics and Child Health is arguing that what it calls the wide gapbetween rich and poor is damaging infant health around the UK. The college president, Professor Neena Modi, points out that in general the health of young people has improved dramatically over the last 30 years. But she argues that a lot more needs to be done to improve child health and that it is ""particularly troubling"" that ""stark inequalities"" have widened in the last few years. The report says that the UK ranks high amongst Western European countries on mortality rates for infants under the age of one. The relative position, according to the report, has worsened since the UK sat around the average in 1970. Deprivation, it says, is strongly linked to death rates among children. The college believes that many of the causes of infant mortality are preventable and asserts that issues such as fetal growth restriction disproportionately affect the least advantaged families in society. Reducing child poverty, with benefits and housing policy playing a part, are crucial for improving infant survival, according to the report. Reducing child poverty - partly through benefits and housing policy - is crucial in improving infant survival, the report says New mortality data have been published this week by the Office for National Statistics. They underline again the scale of inequalities. Within England, the West Midlands had double the infant mortality rate of the South East in 2015, at 6.1 deaths per 1,000 live births. For the whole population (age-standardised), Blackpool, Glasgow, Belfast and Blaenau Gwent had considerably higher death rates than areas like Monmouthshire and City of London. The ONS release accompanying the data notes: ""The substantial variation in mortality rates between different local areas reflects underlying differences in factors such as income deprivation, socio-economic position and health behaviour."" The nation's statisticians are confirming the thrust of the Royal College report - that inequality is a key driver in health outcomes. Income inequality on some measures has fallen in recent years in the UK. But this followed a sharp decline in earnings and investment returns for the wealthiest households after the financial crisis at a time when benefits for the poorest were being protected by government policies. Inequality is higher than it was in the 1970s and is still relatively high compared to other advanced economies. Real wages for much of the population have stagnated since the start of the recession in 2008. It has been described as a ""lost decade"" even by the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. A recent ONS report on household inequality, noting the relative generosity of pensioner benefit increases compared to other parts of the population, stated: ""While retired households' incomes have soared in recent years, non-retired households still have less money, on average, than before the crash."" While most people close to or at average income levels remain financially stretched and there are no signs of a significant reduction in the gap between rich and poor, health disparities will be hard to shift. The latest Royal College report and data are a wake-up call if one were needed.

"Diane Munday had an abortion in 1961, six years before the Abortion Act - now 50 years old - made abortion legal in Britain. While she could afford a Harley Street operation, she knew her neighbours were facing backstreet procedures with knitting needles. Here she explains how this inspired a life-long campaign for reform. It wasn't until I was about 21 years old that I first heard the word ""abortion."" In those days you had clothes made by a dressmaker and a local young married woman was making me a party dress; I went to her house for fittings. She had three young children and lived in a small post-war prefab house. I remember a very happy family. The father worked in a  local factory and the children went to dancing lessons. One day when I came home from work - I was a research assistant at Barts Hospital - my mother told me the dressmaker had died. I discovered she had had a backstreet abortion that went wrong. I hadn't heard of this before - probably because the word was considered unmentionable. At that time a pregnant woman having an abortion and anyone who helped her could go to prison for it. I was so shocked by this that I mentioned it to colleagues at lunch the next day. The doctors I worked with said it was a common experience and invited me to ""stay behind on Friday evening and we'll show you what the world is really like"". I discovered then that all the London teaching hospitals set a few wards aside each Friday for women who were septic, bleeding or dying from having backstreet abortions. There would be a spate of cases on Friday because it was payday. They were often performed by people with some nursing experience using hot solutions and knitting needles or coat hanger hooks. A big problem was their inability to diagnose the stage of pregnancy accurately and the more advanced a pregnancy the more dangerous what they did became. Diane joined the Abortion Law Reform Society following the thalidomide scandal I put the incident to the back of my mind and over the next few years  got married and then had three children of my own (in less than four years - there was no ""pill"" back then). During my third pregnancy the doctor gave me a prescription for thalidomide because I had problems sleeping. I left it on the mantelpiece and did not take the drug. The thalidomide scandal broke shortly afterwards and I got to thinking that if I had been carrying a deformed foetus I would have wanted the option of ending the pregnancy. So I joined the Abortion Law Reform Association (ALRA) but initially did no more than pay my membership fee. This organisation had been founded in the 1930s but it wasn't really active as, post war, people preferred more polite social causes such as housing and education. Then I discovered I was pregnant again - my fourth in four years - and something in me just said: ""I cannot, I will not have this child."" My husband said he would much rather I continued the pregnancy but that it was my decision and he would support me whatever I decided. After much asking around I found my way to Harley Street where there was a semi-legal procedure. The gynaecologist sent me to a friend who was a psychiatrist who said my mental health was so damaged by the pregnancy that my life was endangered. This was an accepted reason for an abortion because of a recent court case called the Bourne Case. It was only available to those who could afford to pay. I was quoted Â£150 - which was thousands in 1961 - but the doctor later halved it. He arranged for me to go to a private nursing home in north London One in three women in Britain will have an abortion by the age of 45, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service Two-thirds of people believe women should be able to have an abortion if they want one, according to the British Attitudes Survey of 2012 Anti-abortionprotests outside clinicswhere abortions take place are becoming more common Abortion remainsillegal in Northern Ireland The procedure was done under general anaesthetic and I was in overnight. I found the nurses very unsympathetic - many of them disapproved because they were Roman Catholic. When I vomited due to the after effects of the anaesthetic, one nurse was extremely unpleasant. Coming round from the anaesthetic, I remembered the young dressmaker who had died and realised how similar our situations were; we were both young women with three young children but where we differed was that , because I had a chequebook, I was alive and  because she had no spare money she was dead. This seemed totally and unacceptably wrong. At that moment I vowed  to myself that I would do everything I could to prevent women dying because they were poor. So I went along to the next ALRA annual meeting, spoke to some people who had also joined because of the thalidomide scandal and within a year I was on the committee.  That was when I started speaking out about abortion and that became my main role in the organisation. A poster from the 1960s printed by the Abortion Law Reform Association I gave talks to groups and, from the start, decided to be open about it and say, ""I have had an abortion."" I clearly remember an early Townswomen's Guild meeting when, in the tea interval, members came up to me one after the other and said words to the effect of ""You know dear, I had an abortion in the 30s. My husband was out of work and we couldn't afford any more children."" From then on this was a common experience and I realised abortion was an unmentionable but routine part of women's lives. I became infamous. I was boycotted by the grocers in the village because they said my money was tainted - that I had been doing backstreet abortions on my kitchen table. My sons were affected by comments at school when I was on TV and I think my husband found it difficult. But it needed to be done, the work was so important as women were desperate. They would try to self-induce by drinking gin, having scalding baths and moving heavy furniture around. Some travelled across the country and knocked on my front door as well as that of our secretary, Dilys Cossey, because her address was on the ALRA literature. Listen toDiane Mundayspeaking to Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4 Get the Woman's Hour podcastfor more extraordinary stories This video can not be played Two different perspectives on abortion from Woman's Hour Despite being shunned by some in the village, women would come to me themselves or with their daughters when they were unmarried and pregnant. I'd drive them to a clinic and hold their hand while their daughter's pregnancy was ended but next time I saw them they'd cross the road. Later when ALRA needed money for its campaigning (it was run by unpaid volunteers) I approached the doctor who performed my own abortion to ask for a donation. It seemed to me that many doctors had benefited over the years and they could put some money back to help women who couldn't afford fees. He agreed and also gave me names of other doctors who might contribute. I asked him why he performed abortions and he told me that, when he was a young doctor, a patient said she would kill herself if she didn't get an abortion. He told her the usual tale about loving the baby when it was born: that night she drowned herself and he felt that he had killed her. Diane is concerned that there is still a taboo about admitting to having had an abortion After much lobbying of MPs and a number of Bills in the Commons and the Lords the 1967 Abortion Act was passed. This was a great victory and a big step forward for women. But, for me, even then, it was not enough. I always believed that the only person qualified to make a decision about a pregnancy was the woman herself.  We had had to make the concession that every abortion would be approved by two doctors. It was the price we paid for legalising any abortions at all. Nevertheless the beneficial effect was almost immediate with the numbers of women admitted to  London hospitals for ""septic miscarriages"" dropping hugely within a year of the Act coming into effect. But still there were battles to fight. Particularly in areas of the country where medical opposition to legal abortion had been most ferocious, surgeons said they wouldn't perform abortions. I helped set up the Birmingham (later British) Pregnancy Advisory Service to help women where NHS  doctors refused to comply with the Act. Initially it opened as a counselling service in someone's house.  Women who could afford it were charged two shillings a visit and counselled and referred on to sympathetic doctors who  would help them. This ensured that there was equitable treatment wherever somebody lived. Later, for 17 years, I worked for Bpas which had become a national organisation ensuring women were sympathetically and professionally treated wherever they lived and whatever the beliefs of local doctors. A London pro-choice rally in the 1970s I'm proud of what I have done  and of the benefits it has brought to so many women's lives. However, my concern now is the future. There's still a taboo around the subject making women reluctant to say: ""I feel all right about having had an abortion."" Half a century after reform we live in a very different world. Women's' rights have moved on. Medical technology has moved on. But we still require two doctors to sanction the termination of a pregnancy that the pregnant women herself has decided on. It's unbearable. We were among the first in Europe to allow abortion and now are almost the last to have stringent laws controlling it. I would like to think that, before I die, the job I helped to start is finished by abortion being taken out of the criminal law and the decision as to whether or not a pregnancy is to be ended is firmly placed where it belongs - in the hands of the pregnant woman.

"Reunited: It was the first time Tim Peake had seen the capsule since stepping out of it in June The spacecraft that carried Tim Peake to and from the International Space Station last year has gone on display at London's Science Museum. The museum says the Russian capsule is an important part of UK space history and hopes it will inspire the public. The Soyuz TMA-19M has been refurbished, but is still slightly singed from re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Business Secretary Greg Clark has confirmed that Major Peake will make a second mission to the space station. The timing will be decided by the European Space Agency (Esa). Mr Clark said: ""Tim Peake's Principia mission inspired a generation, and showed just how far science can take you."" The UK committed in December to continue to participate in Esa's space station programme. And last week, Esa's director-general Jan Woerner set out his plans for human space flight at a news conference in Paris. He announced that another mission was ""foreseen"" for Major Peake in the next wave of European manned missions. A second flight for the British astronaut would likely happen in the period 2019-2024. Tim Peake's Soyuz capsule is shown on the Kazakh steppe shortly after it returned him and two other crew members to Earth Major Peake's capsule sits atop a Soyuz rocket on the launch pad at Baikonur in 2015 This video can not be played Tim Peake's capsule goes on display at Science Museum Tim Peake said he was delighted to see the capsule in the UK: ""I hope that for everybody who gets to visit it will have a really great source of inspiration and maybe sow the seeds of future dreams for other people. "" Just over a year ago, Tim Peake set off for his mission to the International Space Station. Within a few weeks he became the first British astronaut to walk in space. Executives at the Science Museum hope the spacecraft's connection to the British astronaut will prove a major draw. Museum director, Ian Blatchford, told BBC News that the purchase of the spacecraft was almost like an ""impulse buy"". He explained that he made a casual enquiry while in Moscow over the summer whether the spacecraft was for sale and to his surprise the spacecraft owners agreed. It was from within this 2m-high, bell-shaped vehicle that Major Peake witnessed the wonders of space. The right-hand seat was Tim's and from it he looked out of the window and saw the curvature of the Earth for the first time. It was also from this window that he witnessed what it was like to re-enter the atmosphere at the end of his mission. The spacecraft provides the UK with a link to its own astronauts and a reminder of its role in space exploration. The Science Museum says that it wants the display to inspire those that see it, especially children - many of whom might wish to follow in Major Peake's footsteps. Follow Pallab onTwitter,external.

But if President Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, hoped it would silence his critics, he was wrong. Instead, it was the catalyst for a host of people and parks to follow suit. Badlands National Park, in South Dakota, posted a series of tweets,externalhighlighting climate science data a few days after The National Park Service briefly shut its Twitter operation following an apparent clampdown. It had retweeted photos about the turnout at President Trump's inauguration, suggesting numbers at the ceremony were lower those at President Obama's ceremony. Trump's 'control-alt-delete' on climate change policy World v Trump on global climate deal? President Trump: Seven ways the world could change The national park accounts were eventually reactivated with an apology message. It did not deter Badlands. ""Today, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years. #climate,"" one of its tweets said. The posts were widely shared - including by the Democratic National Committee under the hashtag #Resist - but had all been removed by Tuesday evening. Then on Wednesday Redwoods National Parktweeted about climate change,externaland the role of trees as a carbon sink, adding: ""More redwoods would mean less #climatechange"". Golden Gate National Recreation Areahad earlier posted that,external""2016 was the hottest year on record for the 3rd year in a row"", adding a link to a Nasa report on climate change. Death Valley National Park's account, meanwhile,tweeted about Japanese-Americans,externalinterned at the park during World War Two. While it made no mention of the president, other Twitter users interpreted the message as an objection to his pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country and to restrict the flow of refugees to the US. An account called AltUSNatParkService, which describes itself as the ""unofficial 'resistance' team"" of the US Park Service, has also been set up to more directly protest against the president. ""We believe that today in Trump's America, science and the environment have a place at the forefront of society and policy,"" the account tweeted on Thursday. It was quickly joined by Alt Nasa, described as ""the unofficial #resist team of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration"", while Rogue Nasa says it offers ""real news"" and ""real facts"". The National Parks Service has refused to comment. Meanwhile, a media blackout has been introduced at the US's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), according to the Associated Press news agency. Staff there have been banned from posting on any of the agency's social media accounts, The main EPA account has not posted anything since 19 January, a day before Mr Trump's inauguration.

"Some employers have rules regarding acceptable shades of lipstick MPs havecalled for companieswith sexist dress codes to be fined. But many jobs do have requirements for employees' appearances. ""No, however a policy of requiring women to wear high heels would likely amount to sex discrimination which is unlawful,"" says employment law solicitor Laura Allner, a senior associate at CMS. ""Where a policy clearly treats women less favourably than men, for example applying strict image criteria to females but no corresponding rules for men, then this would constitute direct sex discrimination, to which there is no defence."" Laura Allner of CMS Cameron McKenna says it would be difficult for a firm to justify forcing its female staff to wear high heels Mrs Allner adds: ""A policy of wearing high heels would almost certainly be considered 'indirectly discriminatory' provided a female complainant could show that the policy puts women - and her in particular - generally at a disadvantage.  Given the health issues associated with high heels, this argument would have merit. ""It would then be open for the employer to try to defend its dress policy.  To succeed the employer would need to show that it has a legitimate business interest for implementing the policy, and that its dress code is a measured way of achieving that. ""Where the defence is purely aesthetic, it would almost inevitably fail.  It is almost impossible to see how a tribunal could find a policy of requiring high heels justifiable - why not allow smart, flat shoes? ""Further, if an employee suffered from a disability, the employer is under a duty to make reasonable adjustments. So if health reasons meant that wearing heels was not appropriate, the employer would need to adjust its policy."" Employers can implement a dress code to ensure that employees are dressed in a manner that is appropriate for its particular business, provided this would not be deemed discriminatory. Employees can be asked to cover tattoos Mrs Allner says: ""A key issue is whether or not the employer can justify its policy - namely, show that the dress code being implemented is proportionate for it to achieve its particular business aim. ""For example, if there are health and safety reasons requiring employees' hair to be kept in a particular style, then this may be justifiable.  If a policy is purely implemented for stylistic reasons, then it is less likely to be justifiable. ""Previous high profile cases have considered bans on wearing religious items. The case law shows that the cases are very fact specific."" An employee can raise a grievance (either informally or formally) with his or her employer. ""If having done so, the employee wishes to take the matter further, it may be possible to raise a complaint of unlawful discrimination in an employment tribunal, if they have first sought to resolve the matter through the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, which is now mandatory,"" says Mrs Allner. Garish nail polish might be banned under some employer's rules ""It would be advisable to take legal advice before doing so, to understand the legal merits of the case.  Where an employee has been dismissed, or resigns in response to a discriminatory policy, the employee may also have a claim for unfair dismissal,"" she adds. Where an employee succeeds in a claim of unlawful discrimination, compensation is awarded largely on the basis of injury to feelings so the complainant would need to evidence this. ""Although theoretically uncapped, awards for a single one-off incident are likely to be at the lower end of the scale,"" says Mrs Allner. ""If the employee has also been dismissed or resigns and succeeds in a claim for constructive unfair dismissal, then again compensation for a discriminatory dismissal is uncapped and includes an element for lost earnings too."" However, in an unfair dismissal claim where there is no element of discrimination, lost earnings compensation is capped at the lower of the employee's gross annual salary, or Â£78,962. ""In an unfair dismissal case, employees are also under a duty to mitigate their losses by seeking alternative employment,"" says Mrs Allner.

" Monday 23rd January 2017 As a theme for a piece of music or song, mistaken identity has been well-used over time - byMozartin his operas,Bob Dylanin It Ain't Me Be,The Kinksin Lola, and byWu-Tang Clanin a track literally called Mistaken Identity. But what of actual mistaken identity in the world of music? There have been many amusing cases from all fields; here are half a dozen of our favourites. [Warning: The BBC is not responsible for the content of external websites] [LISTEN] BBC Radio 4 - Tupac Shakur: Hip Hop Immortal For music fans, Christmas 2016 was overshadowed by the deaths ofStatus Quo'sRick ParfittandGeorge Michael. But there was one story that spread across the internet on Christmas Day providing a bit of light relief - news that a Sri Lankan church had accidentally printed the lyrics of late rapperTupac Shakur's Hail Mary in its Christmas service programme instead of the 15th century Catholic prayer. Asthe Independent reported: ""The mix-up occurred at the 2016 Catholic Joy to the World Festival at the Colombo's Nelum Pokuna Theatre during one of Sri Lanka's largest Christmas celebrations earlier this month. Instead of finding the words 'Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee / blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb', the carol singers were invited to reflect on the 1997 song's themes of mortality, violence and sex and whether they wanted to 'ride or die'."" Shaun Ryder's 2011 autobiography Twisting My Melon is a mine of classic anecdotes from his days in theHappy Mondaysand beyond, including this one... It was 1989, the Mondays had just released their Madchester Rave On EP and they were on their biggest tour yet. Newcastle was the second date and Sean was late to leave Manchester for the gig. He arrived at Newcastle station with the group's manager Anthony 'Muzzer' Murray, then they hailed a cab and asked to be taken to ""the local gig venue"", where they hoped to find the rest of the band. Ryder: ""We ran up to the door and Muzzer was giving it, 'We're in the band, we're in the band... we're late,' and the bouncers just let us through and we legged it in. We waked through the auditorium, and should have clocked then that it was quite a civilised crowd... but we didn't. We just jumped on stage, and as I was walking across the stage I clocked the instruments and thought, 'We haven't got a saxophone,' but it still didn't click, and I just thought it was the support band's or something. ""Then we saw the dressing room door andMick Hucknallwas standing there with the rest ofSimply Redand I suddenly realised. 'F***! Wrong f****** venue!' We had turned up at a Simply Red gig. We were actually playing the Poly, which was just round the corner, so we did one sharpish."" Badly Drawn Boy, Damon Gough, was a musician on the make in 1997 - he'd released his first EP, but he was three years away from winning the 2000Mercury Prizewith his debut album, The Hour of Bewilderbeast. He was living in Manchester and specifically not working as a taxi driver. But that didn't stopThe Fall's Mark E. Smith coming out of the Night and Day Café and mistaking him for one. Smith needed to get to Stockport and, courteously, Gough obliged, believing it would be a good opportunity to persuade Smith to record one of his songs. Smith left his false teeth in Gough's car, which Gough kept. Then in 2001, Smith told Q magazine: ""I also left a bloody expensive leather jacket that he has not returned... about 110 quid. I haven't had that back. He can keep the teeth, though."" The above screengrab is taken from13 seconds into a videoof a March 1988 Sunrise rave and you have to admit - it looks uncannily like a youthful David Cameron, who was final-year student at Oxford at the time. Viceflagged it up in 2008 when Cameron was leader of the Conservative Party and it went viral, forcing Tory HQ to ""categorically"" deny that the raver was Dave, although he didn't start work at their Conservative Research Department until six months after the footage was recorded. Official word, then: it's a doppelgänger, which makes sense. The famous Bullingdon Club picture of Cameron, in which he has much shorter hair, is from 1987. In 2015,Buzzfeed unearthed another picture- from 1988. In that, he has short hair too. The Priests Ava Maria 3rd party content may contain ads -see our FAQsfor more info One is a classical musical trio made up of Roman Catholic priests from Northern Ireland, the other is a punk band from Washington DC. The former are calledThe Priests, the latter justPriests, resulting in a holy mix-up in late 2016 - photos of the three clerics appeared on ticket sites and in gig listings to promote the punk band's 2017 US tour. Fr Eugene O'Hagan from The Prieststold the BBCthat some fans has been contacting them over how to get tickets for their non-existent US gigs. ""We were taken a bit by surprise, needless to say,"" he said. ""It would be a whole new audience if we walked out on stage. Or if they walked out on stage, with our fan base, there might be a few heart attacks in the audience."" He added: ""They're a very different band from us. I Googled them the other evening to find that they're described as singing with tempered tension, thoughtful rage and relentless energy. I think the only thing we have in common with them might be the relentless energy."" Amused,Priests extended""warm wishes to our brethren 'The Priests'"". [LISTEN] BBC Radio 6 Music - Producer Steve Levine on Primal Scream's Rocks As a band statement, it pulled no punches: ""Primal Scream are totally disgusted that the Home Secretary Theresa May ended her speech at the Tory party conference with our song Rocks. How inappropriate. Didn't they research the political history of our band? Hasn't she listened to the words? Does she even know what getting your rocks off means? No. She is a Tory; how could she?"" It was October 2011, and someone had toldPrimal Screamthat the current PM had walked off stage at her party conference to their 1994 hit. It sounded like a tall tale (lyrics include: ""Dealers keep dealin', thieves keep thievin'"") and it turned out to be untrue - May hadn't used the song at all; she'd played the equally surprising 2001 track Bohemian Like You byThe Dandy Warhols, the controversial video for which contains full-frontal male and topless female nudity.

"It was only yesterday that the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, told MPs it just might all be a bit tricky to have a White Paper, a formal document outlining the government's plans for Brexit, and stick to the timetable they want to pursue. Rebel Remainers though were ""delighted"", that, stealing Jeremy Corbyn's thunder, a planted question from a loyal Tory MP at PMQs today produced in fact a promise from the Prime Minister that, after all, there will be a White Paper. It is a climbdown, no question, a last-minute change of heart. Late last night Brexiteers were being assured there would be no bending, no delay to the government's plans and no giving in to the Remainers. Even early this morning, government sources were privately suggesting that they were quite happy to have the white paper option up their sleeve, but there were no immediate plans to make that promise. Then voila, at 1205 GMT, the pledge of a white paper suddenly emerged. As one senior Tory joked, ""welcome to the vacillation of the next two years"". It may be being described as a ""massive, unplanned"" concession but it doesn't seriously hurt the government. First off, it shows goodwill to the rebel Tory Remainers, many of whom feel their Eurosceptic rivals have had the upper hand of late. Schmoozing matters round these parts. It takes one of the potential arguments that could have gathered pace off the table, before the Article 50 bill is even published. And, rightly or wrongly, no one expects a white paper will contain anything new that the prime minister has not yet already said. It's largely a victory for the Remainers about process, rather than substance. For her critics this is evidence of weakness, that's she has been pushed into changing her mind. But it doesn't need to change the government's timetable, and today's embarrassment of a climbdown might be worth the goodwill that Number 10 will get in return.
