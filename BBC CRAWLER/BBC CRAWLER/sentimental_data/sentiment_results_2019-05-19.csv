"The good will of nurses in England is being abused by politicians who have failed to get to grips with a desperate shortage of staff, nurse leaders say. Royal College of Nursing general secretary Dame Donna Kinnair will call for safe staffing levels to be enshrined in law in a speech on Monday. There are currently nearly 40,000 nurse vacancies - one in nine posts. However, the government says it is committed to increasing the number of nurses in training. But Dame Donna, in an address to the RCN's annual conference in Liverpool, will say this is not enough. A report earlier this year by three leading think tankswarned vacancies could rise to 70,000 within five years and 100,000 in 10if action was not taken. Dame Donna will say the situation has been made worse by the removal of a student bursary for trainees and the introduction of tuition fees in 2016. She will also say the good will of nurses is being abused - and that ministers need to consider the financial and human cost of leaving jobs unfilled. She will demand tougher rules on safe staffing be introducing, criticising the ""vague metric"" currently used which does not distinguish between care provided by registered nurses or healthcare assistants. Dame Donna will point to the new staffing law in Scotland, which cleared its final parliamentary hurdle earlier this month, as evidence of how legislation can be introduced. Scotland is now the second country in the UK to set staffing accountability in law after Wales became the first in Europe to legislate in 2016. She will say: ""We will not stop until people are held to account for the desperate shortages each and every one of us has witnessed. Politicians must stop short-changing the public. ""They must stop the rot and put an end to the workforce crisis in nursing. ""Rather than only looking at the cost of educating and employing nurses, the government must think about the true cost - financial and human - of not doing it. 'Employers, decision-makers and ministers with the power to change things should not let individual nurses take the blame for systemic failings. ""The goodwill of nursing staff is being abused and politicians must know it is running out. I will not stand by while this profession is denigrated."" The Department of Health and Social Care has already announced plans to increase training places by 25% - and the NHS in England is now working on a long-term plan for the workforce. A spokeswoman praised the ""commitment"" of nurses and said the government would ""secure"" the staff the service needed.

"This video can not be played Dina had to give birth to her rapist's child - under Alabama's abortion ban women would have no choice. US President Donald Trump has outlined his ""strongly pro-life"" views on abortion amid controversy over strict new laws passed in several states. Mr Trump said he was against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a ""serious health risk"" to the mother. His stance on what is a divisive election issue in the US emerged days after Alabama passed a law banning abortion in almost all cases. A pro-choice rally is planned later on Sunday in protest at the new measures. Should men have a say in abortion debate? The women looking outside the law for abortions Emotional abortion stories shared with #youknowme Supporters ofAlabama's abortion bansay they expect the law to be blocked in court, but hope that the appeals process will bring it before the US Supreme Court. They want the highest court in the land - which now has a conservative majority - to overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling making abortion a right across the US. Sixteen other states are also seeking to impose new restrictions on abortion. The US president outlined his views amid the controversy over Alabama's new law Mr Trump, whose position on abortion has shifted over the years, had been largely silent on the Alabama restrictions until Saturday, when he posted a series of tweets outlining his views. ""I am very strongly pro-life, with the three exceptions,external- rape, incest and protecting the life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan"", he said. The president added that judicial measures, such as his appointment of conservative Supreme Court judges Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, had helped to make abortion laws in various states more restrictive. ""We have come very far in the last two years with 105 wonderful new federal judges (many more to come), two great new supreme court justices â¦ and a whole new and positive attitude about the right to life."" Abortion is an issue which remains controversial in the US, with evangelical Christians in particular forming a nucleus of voters who want to restrict, or even outlaw, the procedure completely. Mr Trump has adjusted his stance over the years. In 1999, he said: ""I'm very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still - I just believe in choice."" But in March 2016, he clarified that his position was ""pro-life with exceptions"". On Saturday he tweeted that Republicans must unite to ""win for life in 2020"". This video can not be played The Pink House: The last abortion clinic in Mississippi Senior Democrats have also suggested that the issue will be an important one in the 2020 presidential campaign. Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren responded to Alabama's abortion ban by saying:""This ban is dangerous and exceptionally cruel,external- and the bill's authors want to use it to overturn Roe v Wade. ""I've lived in that America and let me tell you: We are not going back - not now, not ever. We will fight this. And we will win."" Since the Supreme Court ruling on abortion in 1973, the number of abortion clinics has dropped in many US states, and in 2017, six states reportedly had just one abortion clinic in operation. Earlier this year the governors of Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio signed bills banning terminations if an embryonic heartbeat could be detected. What's behind Georgia's anti-abortion 'heartbeat bill'? Why are people talking about NY's abortion law? The women looking outside the law for abortions According to the Guttmacher Institute - a group which campaigns for reproductive rights - none of these bans are yet in effect, but their introduction is part of a strategy to get the cases heard by the Supreme Court. But other states are taking measures to safeguard abortion rights. In January, New York signed into law a bill protecting the right to terminate a pregnancy after 24 weeks in certain cases.

"Mr Coveney suggested many British politicians do not understand the complexity of NI politics Ireland's deputy prime minister has ruled out any renegotiation of the Brexit withdrawal deal if Theresa May is replaced as UK prime minister. Speaking on RTÃ, TÃ¡naiste Simon Coveney said ""the personality might change but the facts don't"". He described Mrs May as a ""decent person"" and strongly criticised Conservative MPs at Westminster. Mrs May has promised to set a timetable for the election of her successor after the next Brexit vote. Mr Coveney described political events at Westminster as ""extraordinary"", as he questioned the logic of politicians who believed a change of leader would deliver changes to the agreement struck by Mrs May. He said Conservative MPs were ""impossible"" on the issue of Brexit. ""The EU has said very clearly that the Withdrawal Agreement has been negotiated over two-and-a-half years, it was agreed with the British government and the British cabinet and it's not up for renegotiation, even if there is a new British prime minister,"" he said. Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide Why PM's Brexit plan may not be dead yet He told RTÃ's This Week programme that many British politicians ""don't, quite frankly, understand the complexity of politics in Northern Ireland"". ""They have tried to dumb this debate down into a simplistic argument whereby it's Britain versus the EU, as opposed to two friends tying to navigate through the complexity of a very, very difficult agreement,"" he added. Mr Coveney also said the Irish government would continue to focus significant efforts and financial resources towards planning for a no-deal Brexit scenario, followingFriday's collapse of Brexit talks in the UK. He said time was of the essence for the UK to get a deal through Parliament, adding that he was concerned Britain would not ""get its act together over summer"" and leave without a deal. On Wednesday, Mrs May announced thatMPs would vote on the bill that would pave the way for Brexitin the week beginning 3 June. If the bill is not passed, the default position is that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October without a deal. Brexit had been due to take place on 29 March. But the UK was given an extension until 31 October after MPs three times voted down the withdrawal agreement Mrs May had negotiated with the EU - by margins of 230, 149 and 58 votes.

"Thousands of teenagers are living in supported or semi-supported accommodation, which can often be a house on a residential street Thousands of teenagers in care are being ""dumped"" in unregulated homes and ""abandoned to organised crime gangs"", the BBC has been told. The number of looked-after children aged 16 and over living in unregistered accommodation in England has increased 70% in a decade, Newsnight has found. Police forces have raised concerns, saying criminals see the premises as an easy target for recruitment. The government said children in care ""deserve good quality accommodation"". The Association of Directors of Children's Services (ADCS) said local authorities do ""many things"" - including unannounced checks and DBS checks - to monitor provision. As part of a special series of reports, Britain's Hidden Children's Homes, Newsnight has learned that - according to figures from the Department for Education - around 5,000 looked after children in England are living in so-called 16+ supported or semi-supported accommodation - up from 2,900 10 years ago. Children in care 'unnecessarily criminalised' Counting the kids in gangs Thousands of teens living alone 'in care' This type of accommodation is not inspected or registered by Ofsted, even though residents are in the care of the state. But because they are deemed to be receiving support, rather than care, the accommodation is not subject to the same checks and inspections as registered children's homes. Local authorities can pay to place children in unregistered accommodation if they deem it is in a child's best interests. This can often be simply a house on a residential street, with staff on site or visiting for as little as a few hours a week. Amy - now 19 - was moved to one of these homes in Bedfordshire, when she was 16 years old. ""There was a mattress but no bed sheets, it was freezing cold and I had to use my coat and blanket as a duvet. It made me feel sort of desperate and very alone."" Amy - not her real name - said there were times she was frightened living in the home. ""I was hit in the face by one of the staff members,"" she said. Jackie Sebire, assistant chief constable at Bedfordshire Police and the National Police Chiefs' Council lead on serious violence, said that more than half of the 60 homes for looked-after children in Bedfordshire are unregulated. ""They are the ones that we have the majority of the children going missing from because the care is so inconsistent,"" she said. Jackie Sebire, assistant chief constable at Bedfordshire Police, said care is 'inconsistent' Amy was among these missing children, taking the train to ""meet random men in London, as anywhere is better than this"". ""We'd just get random men off the internet and then sometimes they would come and pick us up at the home and they'd take us places.  A lot of them were just strange men who just wanted younger girls and they were very, very dangerous,"" she said. ""They wanted sex and they wanted drugs and because they would buy you alcohol they would think you owed them something."" Amy says she was not sexually assaulted. The home Amy lived in told Newsnight it investigates complaints thoroughly and operates with high standards. It said it would support the 16+ sector being regulated. A Bedford Borough Council spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the concerns raised which were fully investigated at the time. ""Semi-independent living accommodation for young people over 16 is not regulated by an inspection regime and this is an issue across the country. Many local authorities share our concerns and this has been discussed in parliament."" The All-Party Parliamentary Group for Missing Children and Adults has been looking into the issue, and wrote to 43 police forces in England and Wales. Thirty-four responded, with at least three-quarters expressing concern. Newsnight has been given exclusive access to this research, which the group's chairwoman, Ann Coffey, described as painting an overall picture ""of dumping children in a twilight world and leaving them to fend for themselves and take their chances"". Cambridgeshire Police said premises are often ""well known to local criminals"" and seen as ""an easy target location for recruitment of new children"". This was echoed by Hertfordshire Police. The force said it had seen examples where young adults had been targeted and ""girls have been groomed and trafficked to other areas"". Ms Coffey said ""we should be very concerned"" about this growing sector. ""It is absolutely essential that that market is regulated in a way that meets the needs of children,"" she said. ""If you don't have regulation then what will happen is it will meet the needs of the providers - the people who are basically making a profit out of this kind of accommodation."" ""I wouldn't place my 16 or 17-year-old in this accommodation,"" she added. ""Why should we be placing other 16 and 17-year-olds in this twilight world where, at a very vulnerable age where they need the greatest level of support, we are abandoning them to paedophiles and organised crime gangs?"" Andrew Neilson, from the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""Exposing children to greater risks of criminalisation and exploitation isn't just wrong: it makes a mockery of joined-up government."" The Department for Education ""should be reviewing the situation urgently"", he added. Jackie Sebire and the NPCC also want action from government. ""If you think about all the places we regulate the fact that we don't regulate those 16+ settings - it's just wrong and it really needs to change nowâ¦ because the care is so inconsistent,"" she said. ""Ofsted could have a duty to regulate if the legislation and their remit changed and that is one solution we have proposed."" But ADCS said it would not advocate for total regulation, as it ""would limit flexibility"". They added: ""We are keen to see providers of accommodation take their responsibilities to provide suitable accommodation seriously and to have open and transparent ways in which this can be assured."" Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""Semi-independent living can act as a stepping-stone for young people about to come out of care... ""Local authorities are required to make sure that children in care and care leavers are given suitable accommodation to meet their needs, including that they are safe and secure which is why I recently wrote to all Directors of Children's Services to remind them of this obligation.""

"This video can not be played Young people in Singapore say they are now wary of buying Huawei phones Google has barred the world's second biggest smartphone maker, Huawei, from some updates to the Android operating system, dealing a blow to the Chinese company. New designs of Huawei smartphones are set to lose access to some Google apps. The move comes after the Trump administration added Huawei to a list of companies that American firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence. Google said it was ""complying with the order and reviewing the implications"". Huawei said it would continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products, covering those that have been sold or are still in stock globally. ""We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally,"" it added. Huawei's Android loss: How it affects you In a press briefing, China said it ""supports the relevant company [Huawei] to defend its legitimate rights according to law"". Existing Huawei smartphone users will be able to update apps and push through security fixes, as well as update Google Play services. But when Google launches the next version of Android later this year, it may not be available on Huawei devices. Future Huawei devices may no longer have apps such as YouTube and Maps. Huawei can still use the version of the Android operating system available through an open source licence. Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy, said the move by Google would have ""big implications for Huawei's consumer business"". UK mobile trade body Mobile UK said it was ""working closely with relevant authorities to understand the implications of the US Department of Commerce's placement of Huawei on its Entity List."" This video can not be played What does Google's move mean for Huawei phone users? Last Wednesday, the Trump administration added Huawei to its ""entity list,external"", which bans the company from acquiring technology from US firms without government approval. Trump declares national emergency over IT threats Huawei: The world's most controversial company? Which countries are blocking Huawei? In his first comments since the firm was placed on the list, Huawei chief executive Ren Zhengfei told Japanese media on Saturday: ""We have already been preparing for this."" He said the firm, which buys about $67bn (Â£52.6bn) worth of components each year according to the Nikkei business newspaper, would push ahead with developing its own parts. Huawei faces a growing backlash from Western countries, led by the US, over possible risks posed by using its products in next-generation 5G mobile networks. Several countries have raised concerns that Huawei equipment could be used by China for surveillance, allegations the company has vehemently denied. Huawei has said its work does not pose any threats and that it is independent from the Chinese government. However, some countries have blocked telecoms companies from using Huawei products in 5G mobile networks. So far the UK has held back from any formal ban. ""Huawei has been working hard on developing its own App Gallery and other software assets in a similar manner to its work on chipset solutions. There is little doubt these efforts are part of its desire to control its own destiny,"" said Mr Wood. US chipmakers including Intel, Qualcomm and Broadcom are reported to have told their workers they will stop supplying Huawei,according to Bloomberg,external. Intel would not to comment to the BBC. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Ryan Koontz said Huawei would be ""seriously crippled"" if it did not have these ""key US components"", although the Chinese firm is believed to have stockpiles in place. California-based Xilinx said it was aware of the order by the Trump administration and was ""co-operating"" but had nothing to add. Outside the US, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is continuing to deliver to Huawei. The Nikkei reported that TSMC had said it owned a ""complicated and sophisticated export control compliance system"" and ""based on the data in the system we are not changing our shipping practice for the time being"". This video can not be played We explain the controversy around Huawei's 5G tech â using castles By Leo Kelion, BBC Technology desk editor In the short term, this could be very damaging for Huawei in the West. Smartphone shoppers would not want an Android phone that lacked access to Google's Play Store, its virtual assistant or security updates, assuming these are among the services that would be pulled. In the longer term, though, this might give smartphone vendors in general a reason to seriously consider the need for a viable alternative to Google's operating system, particularly at a time that the search giant is trying to push its own Pixel brand at their expense. As far as Huawei is concerned, it appears to have prepared for the eventuality of being cut off from American know-how. Its smartphones are already powered by its own proprietary processors, and earlier this year its consumer devices chieftold German newspaper Die Welt that,external""we have prepared our own operating systems - that's our plan B"". Even so, this move could knock its ambition to overtake Samsung and become the bestselling smartphone brand in 2020 seriously off course. The latest move against Huawei marks an escalation in tensions between the firm and the US. The company isfacing almost two dozen criminal charges filed by US authorities. Washington is also seeking the extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wangzou from Canada, where she was arrested in December at the behest of American officials. It comes as trade tensions between the US and China also appear to be rising. The world's two largest economies have been locked in a bruising trade battle for the past year that has seen tariffs imposed on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. A quick guide to the US-China trade war Moving to Vietnam to avoid US-China trade war Earlier this month, Washington more than doubled tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate with its own tariff hikes on US products.

"This video can not be played Facts and figures about the world's biggest democratic exercise India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is on course to win the general election, exit polls suggest. The BJP and the main opposition Congress party battled it out with powerful regional rivals in a bruising campaign over seven phases of polling. Results will be announced on 23 May. Analysts warn exit polls have often been wrong in the past. Many saw the election as a referendum on Mr Modi who won a landslide in 2014. A party or coalition needs 272 seats in parliament to form a government. Four exit polls saw big wins for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), predicting that it would win anywhere between 280 and 315 seats, far more than the Congress party. However, a Nielsen-ABP news channel poll suggested that the BJP alliance would win 267 seats, falling short of a majority. This prediction comes despite its projection that the party would lose heavily in the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 MPs to parliament, more than any other. In 2014 the BJP won 71 of the state's seats, but the Nielsen-ABP poll suggests this time it will lose as many as 51 of those seats to powerful regional parties.

The election began on 11 April and was held in seven phases for security and logistical reasons. With 900 million eligible voters, it is the world's biggest exercise in democracy. As voting ended, there was a flurry of meetings by opposition leaders, sparking speculation. With farming in crisis, unemployment on the rise and growing fears that India is heading for a recession, the economy is perhaps the biggest issue. Under Mr Modi, the world's sixth-largest economy has lost some of its momentum. Growth hovers around 7% and a leaked government report claimsthe unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the 1970s. Many saw the election as a referendum on Prime Minister Modi A crop glut and declining commodity prices have led to stagnant farm incomes, leaving many farmers saddled with debt. Many also see this election as a battle for India's identity and the state of its minorities. A strident - and at times violent - Hindu nationalism has become mainstream in the past five years, with increased attacks against minorities, including the lynchings of dozens of Muslims accused of smuggling cows.

India then launched unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan, prompting Pakistan to respond in kind and bringing the two countries to the brink of war.

"This video can not be played The moment a billionaire cleared a whole class's student debt A billionaire technology investor has shocked graduating students in Atlanta, Georgia, by telling them he will pay off all of their student loans. Robert F Smith, one of America's most prominent black philanthropists, was giving an address at Morehouse College, a historically all-male black college. Nearly 400 students will benefit at a cost of tens of millions of dollars. The class of 2019 and their teachers were stunned at the news before breaking into applause. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Back-handed run out & a brilliant catch - England wrap up 4-0 series win Fifth one-day international, Emerald Headingley, Leeds England 351-9 (50 overs):Root 84, Morgan 76, Shaheen 4-82 Pakistan 297 (46.5 overs):Sarfaraz 97, Babar 80, Woakes 5-54 England win by 54 runs; win series 4-0 Scorecard England comfortably defeated Pakistan in their final one-day international before the World Cup to complete a 4-0 series victory. Joe Root's 84 and 76 from captain Eoin Morgan helped lift the home side to 351-9, a total that looked like being much higher after a rapid start at Headingley. Pakistan seemed all but beaten after Chris Woakes' new-ball burst reduced them to 6-3, only for Babar Azam (80) and Sarfaraz Ahmed (97) to share a partnership of 146. But Babar was run out by a clever flick from Adil Rashid and Sarfaraz was brilliantly run out by Jos Buttler, either side of Rashid's flying catch to dismiss Shoaib Malik off his bowling. With Woakes going on to claim 5-54, the tourists were dismissed for 297 to lose by 54 runs. England will name their World Cup squad on Tuesday, then play two warm-up games that do not have ODI status, against Australia next Saturday and Afghanistan the following Monday. They open the tournament against South Africa at The Oval on 30 May. TMS podcast: Woakes in the wickets as England prepare for World Cup in style England selectors face difficult call over squad - Vaughan How England beat Pakistan - clips and analysis as it happened Cricket World Cup schedule This series has seen England demonstrate their awesome batting power and attempt to identify the pace bowlers that will be included in their final squad. On a day when captain Morgan chose to bat in order to replicate losing the toss and being made to post a total in the World Cup, it was a last chance for fast bowlers David Willey and Tom Curran to push their claims. Willey offers a left-arm option, Curran yorkers and slower balls. Both can bat and made useful lower-order contributions, but neither bowled a telling spell. In may be that Curran, Willey and Liam Plunkett are fighting for two spots to join Woakes, Mark Wood and Jofra Archer. Joe Denly, in England's provisional squad to bat and bowl some leg-spin, was not afforded another opportunity. If England want a stronger bowler, he could make way for Liam Dawson. As for Pakistan, experts at peaking in tournaments and winners of the Champions Trophy here in 2017, they have shown glimpses of their potential at various times throughout the series. In Leeds, their pace bowlers showed signs of improvement, while Babar and Sarfaraz were defiant. They will be benefit from the return of leg-spinner Shadhab Khan, who can play in the World Cup after recovering from hepatitis. Listen to Tuffers & Vaughan reveal all-time England ODI XI on Monday (21:00 BST, 5 Live) This video can not be played 'That's gone miles' - Morgan breaks roof tile with huge six Aided by poor Pakistan bowling and worse fielding, the rate England began their innings hinted towards an absolutely massive total. That it did not materialise was down to the control gained by Pakistan's spinners and the recovery of their pace bowlers, none more so than Shaheen Afridi, who picked up 4-82. But that is to take nothing away from England's batsmen. Openers Jonny Bairstow (32) and James Vince (33) punished anything loose before Root and Morgan added 117 for the third wicket. This video can not be played England opener Vince caught for 33 Root played drives off the pacemen, then flicked and swept the spinners. Morgan heaved two sixes into the leg side and lofted two more inside-out over extra cover. When Morgan became one of four England batsmen to fall to the short ball, it began a period where every home surge was halted by a wicket. Jos Buttler (34) and Ben Stokes (21) made contributions, but there may be a slight concern over Moeen Ali, who registered a second successive duck. Woakes, Willey and Curran played cameos, the latter's 29 from 15 balls full of entertaining swipes and scoops. This video can not be played Spectator retrieves ball after Curran six For all the talk of the extra pace of Archer and Wood, it is Woakes who is likely to lead England's World Cup attack and his first two overs proved why. On a surface offering just a hint of movement, his full length had Fakhar Zaman held at second slip, then both Abid Ali and Mohammad Hafeez lbw. The classy Babar and doughty Sarfaraz rebuilt with deflections, guides and good running. They were comfortable before England's first flash of inspiration. Sarfaraz sent Babar back, Buttler's throw was wide but Rashid, with his back turned, backhanded the ball on to the stumps to leave Babar short. In response, Sarfaraz repeatedly sent Rashid to the leg-side boundary, only for the England man to leap to his left to take an excellent one-handed catch off Malik. The captain presented England's last realistic obstacle until he was removed by Buttler's luck, anticipation and quick-thinking. As Sarfaraz tried to run Moeen to third man, Buttler stuck out his right boot. The ball rebounded into his left foot and, with Sarfaraz trying to get back after setting off for a run, Buttler removed the bails. This video can not be played 'The crowd are loving it' - Rashid's one-handed catch dismisses Malik England captain Eoin Morgan on Test Match Special:""I am very proud of the guys and the way they have performed throughout the series. The nature of how we have chopped changed our team - the performance of the side has remained consistent. ""That shows a lot of hunger in the squad and no-one can be faulted. Everyone has performed and today was same."" Chris Woakes, who was named man of the match:""It's been a great series for us and a great few weeks for us against a strong Pakistan team. The confidence is high and keeps everyone on their toes. We are always trying to improve and it is a great place to be. ""We are wishing each other the best and enjoying our success. Thankfully it was my turn to take the wickets today but we like to share it around."" Former England batter Ebony Rainford-Brent, TMS analyst:""Clinical is what comes to mind about England throughout the series. Everyone stepped up.

"Kompany captained Manchester City to the Premier League title, FA Cup and Carabao Cup this season Vincent Kompany says joining Anderlecht as player-manager is the ""most passionate yet rational"" decision he has made after announcing he has left Manchester City. The 33-year-old has signed a three-year deal with the Belgian club after 11 years at Etihad Stadium, eight of which he spent as club captain. Saturday's 6-0 FA Cup final win over Watford was Kompany's final game for City, after winning four Premier League titles, two FA Cups and four League Cups. In an open letter on Facebook, Belgium defender Kompany said leaving City ""doesn't feel real"". ""Countless of times have I imagined this day,"" he said. ""After all, the end has felt nearby for so many years. ""Man City has given me everything. I've tried to give back as much as I possibly could."" In a second letter released hours later, Kompany announced his move to Anderlecht, who said his arrival marked the ""return of the prince"". ""I want to share my knowledge with the next purple generations,"" said Kompany, who first joined Anderlecht at the age of six. ""With that, I will also put a bit of Manchester in the heart of Belgium."" This video can not be played Man City 6-0 Watford: Pep's got no chill, worst coin toss ever & City run riot Centre-back Kompany joined City from Hamburg as a defensive midfielder in 2008 and was named club captain three years later. He scored his final goal against Leicester on 6 May, a brilliant strike from 25 yards that was voted goal of the season on BBC Match of the Day. That victory took City to within one win of the Premier League title, which they sealed on the final day of the season with victory at Brighton. Football Daily: Vincent parts Kompany with Man City 'Kompany enhances his legend with wonder goal' 'Don't shoot, Vinny' - reaction to Kompany's decisive goal ""The time has come for me to go now,"" Kompany said. ""As overwhelming as it is, I feel nothing but gratefulness. I am grateful to all those who supported me on a special journey, at a very special club. ""I remember the first day, as clear as I see the last. I remember the boundless kindness I received from the people of Manchester. ""I will never forget how all Man City supporters remained loyal to me in good times and especially bad times. Against the odds, you have always backed me and inspired me to never give up."" City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said: ""There have been many important contributors to Manchester City's renaissance, but arguably none are more important than Vincent Kompany. ""He defines the essence of the club. For a decade he has been the lifeblood, the soul, and beating heart of a supremely talented squad. ""A booming voice in the dressing room yet a quiet and measured ambassador off it, Vincent can be as proud of himself as we are of him."" Manchester City won the Premier League on the final day of the season after one of the most thrilling campaigns in the league's history After the 1-0 win over Leicester - City's final home game of the season - Kompany was in tears as the team enjoyed a lap of honour. By beating Watford 6-0 at Wembley, City became the first men's side to complete the domestic treble in England. In September, the club will hold Kompany's testimonial match, from which he willdonate all profits to Manchester's homeless. He said: ""Sheikh Mansour changed my life and that of all the City fans around the world, for that I am forever grateful. A blue nation has arisen and challenged the established order of things, I find that awesome. ""I cherish the counsel and leadership of a good human being, Khaldoon Al Mubarak. Man City could not be in better hands."" Al Mubarak said: ""He will always be part of the City family. ""I am not sure he expected to lift the Premier League trophy on four occasions during his captaincy but he will be remembered and revered whenever this period of unprecedented City success is spoken about by future generations. ""His leadership, intelligence and determination have seen him adapt brilliantly to playing under four different managers and overcome some debilitating injuries. ""He is a special character who has answered every demand the club has made of him."" Vincent Kompany in stats Since Kompany's first season with the club, City have won more domestic trophies (10) than any other English side Only David Silva (282) and Joe Hart (266) have made more Premier League games for City than Kompany (265) Kompany has played more Premier League games than any other Belgian player in the league's history Among defenders, only former Chelsea captain John Terry has kept more Premier League clean sheets (101) than Kompany (94) since his debut Kompany scored five goals in 73 games for Anderlecht from 2003 to 2006. The club are the most successful team in Belgian history but are currently sixth in the Belgian First Division A. They have won 34 league titles, the most recent in 2016-17. ""I stopped at their training grounds on my way to international duty last year. Just to say hello,"" Kompany said. ""[Marc] Coucke, the chairman, and sports director Michael Verschueren asked my opinion regarding the difficult situation the club was in. ""I shared my thoughts and listened to their vision for the future: ambitious, courageous and determined to get back to number one."" Kompany offered his help with ""no strings attached"", and said it was ""unexpected"" when they offered him the position of player-manager ""not so long ago"". ""I was left not only impressed, but also intrigued by this sign of confidence in me,"" he said. This video can not be played FA Cup final: Watch all six Man City goals in 60 seconds Injuries have taken their toll on Kompany in recent years, and he featured in only 17 of City's 38 league games this season because of muscle injuries. However, he will be remembered for his influence and contribution on the pitch, where he led City to a first top-flight title since 1968 in 2012. Along with Sergio Aguero and David Silva, Kompany is one of only three survivors from that triumph, and they repeated the achievement in 2014 and 2018. City retained their title this month, finishing one point ahead of Liverpool after one of the most thrilling seasons in Premier League history. ""How often does someone get the chance to end such an important chapter, representing a club with such great history and tradition, in such a great fashion?"" Kompany said.

"The network was hit by widespread delays and cancellations a year ago The new National Rail summer timetable has come into effect, with 1,000 new train services being introduced across Great Britain. The operators and infrastructure firm Network Rail say they have learned the lessons of last summer's disruption. Then, a more extensive shake-up led to weeks of chaos on the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Northern networks. Train operators say they will monitor the latest changes carefully and respond quickly to any problems. ""The railway has a long way to go to win back passenger confidence,"" said Darren Shirley, chief executive of pressure group Campaign for Better Transport. ""But we hope that the lessons of last year have been learnt and the introduction of the new timetable... will improve people's perceptions of the railways, rather than further damaging them. ""In the event that things do go wrong, we would expect the rail industry to have a robust contingency plan so that passengers aren't left stranded again."" And Anthony Smith, boss of independent watchdog Transport Focus, said Monday morning's commute would provide a major test. Rail passenger groups are hoping for a smooth timetable change this year ""Passengers waiting on platforms just want the trains to run on time... they have paid for a service, and want the service to be reliable,"" he said. The timetable changes in May 2018 led to weeks of disruption to large parts of the network, The number of trains cancelled each day by GTR and Northern hit up to 470 and 310 respectively. GTR says passengers should be confident about the new services GTR was fined Â£5m by the rail regulator over its poor communication during an eight-week period of upheaval. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) found that the company ""failed to provide appropriate, accurate and timely information"" to passengers. Among operators adding extra services are South Western Railway, GTR, Northern, Scotrail and Transport for Wales. Industry body the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said train companies and Network Rail have only made changes where there is a ""high confidence"" infrastructure, rolling stock and staffing plans are ready. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was criticised for his role in the rail chaos RDG chief executive Paul Plummer said: ""Introducing 1,000 more services a week to meet demand on a congested network poses a significant challenge but we are working together to ensure improvements are introduced with the absolute minimum of disruption."" Following the chaos of a year ago, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was criticised after an ORR investigation found there was a ""lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities"", and that ""nobody took charge"".

"This video can not be played Facts and figures about the world's biggest democratic exercise India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is on course to win the general election, exit polls suggest. The BJP and the main opposition Congress party battled it out with powerful regional rivals in a bruising campaign over seven phases of polling. Results will be announced on 23 May. Analysts warn exit polls have often been wrong in the past. Many saw the election as a referendum on Mr Modi who won a landslide in 2014. A party or coalition needs 272 seats in parliament to form a government. Four exit polls saw big wins for the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), predicting that it would win anywhere between 280 and 315 seats, far more than the Congress party. However, a Nielsen-ABP news channel poll suggested that the BJP alliance would win 267 seats, falling short of a majority. This prediction comes despite its projection that the party would lose heavily in the bellwether state of Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 MPs to parliament, more than any other. In 2014 the BJP won 71 of the state's seats, but the Nielsen-ABP poll suggests this time it will lose as many as 51 of those seats to powerful regional parties.

The election began on 11 April and was held in seven phases for security and logistical reasons. With 900 million eligible voters, it is the world's biggest exercise in democracy. As voting ended, there was a flurry of meetings by opposition leaders, sparking speculation. With farming in crisis, unemployment on the rise and growing fears that India is heading for a recession, the economy is perhaps the biggest issue. Under Mr Modi, the world's sixth-largest economy has lost some of its momentum. Growth hovers around 7% and a leaked government report claimsthe unemployment rate is the highest it has been since the 1970s. Many saw the election as a referendum on Prime Minister Modi A crop glut and declining commodity prices have led to stagnant farm incomes, leaving many farmers saddled with debt. Many also see this election as a battle for India's identity and the state of its minorities. A strident - and at times violent - Hindu nationalism has become mainstream in the past five years, with increased attacks against minorities, including the lynchings of dozens of Muslims accused of smuggling cows. This video can not be played 'I want to teach, not wash dishes abroad' And national security is in the spotlight after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir in February. India then launched unprecedented air strikes in Pakistan, prompting Pakistan to respond in kind and bringing the two countries to the brink of war.

"The vandals ransacked the hall, smashing years of work Thousands of pounds worth of model railway exhibits have been destroyed in an act of ""total wanton destruction"". Market Deeping Model Railway Club lost years of work in the raid at Welland Academy in Stamford on Saturday. Its chairman Peter Davies, 70, said exhibits were smashed, thrown around and stamped on, including a locomotive unit worth about Â£8,500. Four youths have been arrested on suspicion of burglary and criminal damage. A funding page set up to raise Â£500 for the club has made more than Â£32,000 in a matter of hours. One contributor, Barry Cave, posted on the page: ""Horrendous act of vandalism, hope my donation helps a little."" Club members had worked on their projects for many years - but found this damage Some of the exhibits were worth thousands of pounds The club had set up the exhibition in the school for viewing on Sunday. Mr Davies, who trained as a teacher and youth worker, said he was in ""total confusion"" over the vandalism. ""Models that were made over years were trodden on and thrown around. It's a total wanton destruction of the highest order. ""I've never experienced anything like it. A hurricane would have done less damage."" The club had set up an exhibition in the school for viewing on Sunday Mr Davies said club members were ""devastated and distraught"". ""Can you imagine your life's work wrecked?"" he said. ""One guy spent 25 years on his work and it's wrecked, it's just horrendous. ""We will never have the time to build the sort of layouts again, that's where the anger comes from."" He said the club had received support from ""all over the world - as far away as New Zealand"". He added: ""We will rise from this, no question, we will be bigger and better. But we'll never get the years back it took to build those exhibits."" The vandals did ""more damage than a hurricane"" The models and buildings were stamped on and thrown around the hall during the attack Lincolnshire Police said: ""On arrival at the school we arrested four youths, who were on the premises, for burglary and criminal damage. ""We are continuing our investigation and confirm damage was done to model railway exhibits which had been set up in the school for a display today [Sunday].""

"Bringing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament is the last roll of the dice for the prime minister Labour has finally pulled the plug on the Brexit talks with the government, at the end of a week in which they appeared to be on life support. So is it, as some suggest, time to read the last rites on Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Let's be clear - it will be challenging, to say the least, for the legislation to get through the Commons. But reports of its demise may well have been exaggerated. It may not go down to immediate defeat. And this is why. A leaked memo from the government side, not agreed by Labour or the cabinet, contained a wheeze that could have been attractive to both leaderships. Even before the Withdrawal Agreement Bill makes its appearance, the memo suggested there could be a ""free vote"" in Parliament on another referendum. Labour-Tory Brexit talks end without deal Pound hits four-month low as Brexit talks end Brexit: What happens next? This is rather different from what the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, was suggesting - that there ought to be a ""confirmatory"" vote, as part of a package, on any agreed deal. The leaders of both the main parties aren't keen on another public vote, to say the least. So a stand-alone Commons vote on the issue, divorced from the deal, would be more likely to go down to defeat - as it has on previous occasions. Jeremy Corbyn could say to People's Vote supporters in his ranks: ""Oh, I did try for a referendum, but oops, it didn't work - so now let's just leave with the best possible deal."" But it would seem that this approach has been scuppered by Labour's wider negotiating team and, presumably, by the cabinet. I have had a strong steer that this proposal in the leaked government memo won't go ahead in this form. But this might not be the setback it seems for the prime minister because supporters of another referendum may have no option but to vote initially for her bill. There will be a vote at what's called, in parliamentary speak, second reading in the first week in June. If the prime minister is defeated at this point, it's basically the end of the road for her deal and her premiership. Theresa May's immediate fate could be in the hands of Labour MPs But if MPs vote for the bill at second reading, they then get an opportunity to change it - and that would include an amendment on another referendum. So it's not impossible that some people who hate Theresa May's deal give it their temporary backing so they can discuss improving it, or putting it to a public vote. Talks with Labour are over - but efforts to win over individual Labour MPs are not. Note the wording of Downing Street's statement that ""complete agreement"" hasn't been reached. So expect to see some incentives in - or around - the Brexit bill for opposition MPs to back the government. For example, a commitment to stay in step with the EU on workers' rights and environmental protection. Allies of Sir Keir have blamed the breakdown of the talks on the PM's inability to get a customs union compromise past her cabinet. But if she keeps Conservative MPs on board in the legislation by eschewing a customs union but delivers a ""comprehensive"" (trust me, this word is important to some Labour MPs) temporary arrangement to last until the next election, some soft opposition to her deal may crumble. Then there is the argument put forward by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles, echoed off the record by some in Downing Street. If the prime minister's bill gets shot down in flames there is no other readily available vehicle to prevent the default option of no deal. Indeed, No 10 insiders expect to see ""vociferous"" arguments for no deal if Theresa May's legislation falls. Some unions, such as the GMB and Unison, favour another referendum. But the leadership of Unite, which is closest to Mr Corbyn, essentially favours leaving with a deal - and Labour MPs will be made well aware of this. So even if Labour formally opposes the bill at second reading, there could be a sizeable rebellion from those former Remainers representing Leave areas - safe in the knowledge that they wouldn't exactly be upsetting some powerful forces in the party. And the MPs who support what's called Common Market 2.0 could be crucial to the outcome. These are, broadly speaking, Labour MPs who are neither Corbynistas nor in favour of another referendum - such as Lucy Powell and Stephen Kinnock - and they are very keen to avoid no deal. However, if the Labour whip is to oppose, expect it to be rigorously enforced irrespective of the views of the party leader's office. So Mrs May's immediate fate may still be in the hands of opposition MPs The forthcoming leadership contest may firm up opposition to Theresa May's bill on the Conservative benches By putting the Withdrawal Agreement Bill out of its misery almost as soon as it appears, the prime minister's critics know she will vacate office sooner rather than later. But some candidates will be keener for her to get Brexit over the line, even with a less than optimal deal, so they don't immediately get bogged down with difficult votes. It would also allow them to make their pitch based on the future relationship with the EU. So could some of their supporters - irrespective of their public criticism of the deal - quietly vote to get it over the line? Set against all this, there is plenty of analysis in the public domain which will tell you how impossible it is for a deal to go through. But right now, No 10 might well see ""highly improbable"" as grounds for optimism. Hope dies last, does it not?

"Samuel Abdulraheem has no recollection of the day he was abducted, aged seven, from his family home in the northern Nigerian city of Kano. Although he came from a large family - his father had 17 children by four wives - Samuel was on his own with a nanny that day. His family were told he had gone outside to ride his bicycle. They would not see him again for another six years. ""There is nothing we didn't do to try to find him,"" his older sister Firdausi Okezie recalls. Then aged 21, she was not made aware of his disappearance at first. Her brother had always enjoyed rushing to answer the phone and speak with her when she called home from university. But when other members of the household began answering it when she rang, she suspected something was wrong. After her classes one afternoon, Firdausi travelled home unexpectedly and her father, an architect and hotelier, was forced to reveal the heart-breaking truth: Her favourite sibling had been missing for more than a month. At first Samuel's mother, pictured here a few years before the disappearance, was not told her son was missing ""At first, my father had the nanny arrested, but after investigations, they let her go,"" Firdausi says. They also tried to hide the news from Samuel's mother, who was divorced from his father, for as long as possible. Every time she called from her new home in a different city, they would conjure different excuses. Eventually, an uncle was assigned the unenviable task of telling her. In addition to extensive police investigations, the family placed adverts in newspapers and sent out search parties to comb the streets. They checked ditches in case he had been the victim of a hit and run, and even consulted Muslim spiritual priests, known as malams. In time, her father asked the family to accept that their brother was dead - they had done the best they could. Firdausi refused to give up. She dedicated her university thesis to her missing brother and a year after graduating, she moved south to Lagos in search of work. She converted to Christianity and started attending Winners Chapel - one of Nigeria's mega churches based in Ogun state just outside the city. Every December, the church holds a five-day gathering of its members from all over the world. During the event, known as Shiloh, interested members of the congregation are allocated free stands to display their goods and services within the church premises. Still without a job in December 2000, Firdausi applied for a stand to sell some tie-dye fabrics her mother had made. While waiting for a carpenter to help set up the display, she sat on a chair and placed her head in her lap for some rest. That was when she heard a beggar appealing, in the name of Allah, for spare change. Firdausi looked up. This beggar had his hand firmly planted on the left shoulder of a boy who was dressed in a tattered brown tunic and undersized trousers. Firdausi screamed - the haggard boy guiding the beggar was her lost brother. Samuel, now aged 30, cannot recall exactly how he was stolen from his family: ""All I remember is the train journey."" He was taken to a one-armed woman who lived on the outskirts of Lagos in an area mostly occupied by disabled beggars. The woman hired him out to blind beggars for 500 naira (approximately $5 or Â£2.50 at the time) per day. The sight of blind men and women being led around by boys and girls is common on many streets in Nigeria - especially in dense traffic where they usually tap on car windows, or around churches and mosques. Only Samuel lived with the woman, sleeping on a mat in her shack. Over the years, he says about five others boys turned up to live with other women in the same yard, each hired out to blind beggars. Samuel suspects that something must have been done or given to him during that time because he does not recall ever thinking of his family during that period, or wondering what had become of them. ""I am not sure I had emotions then,"" he says. ""Just a zombie that knew he had to wake up and lead a beggar out. Make money, eat food and sleep, and the same routine the next day. Different beggars hired him for a period of anything from a week to a month. At the end of each day, Samuel and the beggar slept alongside others in various public spaces. If a beggar enjoyed working with him, they hired him again for another period. ""I was like a slave,"" he says. ""I couldn't say I wanted to go and do anything. I had to be around always."" As he was always on the move, Samuel made few friends, only occasionally playing with the children of other beggars he bumped into in the evenings. Sometimes people gave them food while they were out begging. At other times they hung around restaurants and ate the leftovers or scavenged in dustbins. ""I was always hungry. During the daytime when you work, you hardly sit down to eat,"" he recalls. ""I didn't feel the beggars were bad. They wake up, beg, the way people wake up and go to work."" Day after day, Samuel walked from one end of Lagos to the other with a beggar's right hand gripping his shoulder. Sometimes, they trekked to neighbouring states or across the border to Benin. If the beggars received news of potential benefactors gathered somewhere, they told Samuel and he took them there by bus. ""There were times when you get so tired and you start bypassing people, but blind people are very sensitive - their hearing - so they pick up sound. Sometimes they would twist your shoulder and say: 'There is someone there. Why are you moving away?' ""They try to make as much money as they can."" In December 2000, a beggar he was guiding heard news of the programme at Winners Chapel where they ran into his sister. At first, Firdausi was too shocked to reach out and touch her brother - who can still recall her scream. ""I fell down on the floor,"" she says. Samuel looked gaunt, his right shoulder was significantly tilted and he appeared dumb, not speaking a word. The sight caused Firdausi to burst into tears. ""It took a while but I knew that she was someone I knew - that this person was someone related to me,"" Samuel says. David Oyedepo, founder of the Winners Chapel, held Samuel and prayed for him Soon a crowd gathered and drawn by the commotion, church officials also arrived. They managed to make sense of Firdausi's barely coherent joy and decreed that it was a ""miracle"" worth sharing with the entire congregation. They ferried Samuel to a corner and gave him a quick wash. They found him fresh clothes to wear and rushed them both to the stage of the 50,000-seat auditorium where Firdausi was given a microphone. In tears, she narrated how she had just found her brother who had been missing for six years. Firdausi recalls how the entire congregation leapt out of their chairs in shouts of praise and thanksgiving. The founder of the church, David Oyedepo, then held Samuel and prayed for him. Five things about Nigeria: The superpower with no power 'Landlords make single women feel like prostitutes' Nigeria in nine maps and charts That night they slept on the church premises in a car, as it was a long way to get back to where Firdausi lived. She remembers waking up throughout the night and touching her brother to make sure he was real. Today Firdausi says that she regrets being so engrossed in finding her brother that she did not try to rescue the others from where he was kept. Shortly before his rescue, a new young child had arrived in the yard, Samuel says. At first, the boy wept non-stop and refused to eat. Suddenly, he became silent, leading Samuel to suspect that something had been done or given to the boy to quieten him. Samuel pictured with his sister on the day of her wedding, about two years after she found him ""In a developed country, you would just go and tell the police. But, here, the police would ask you to give them money for fuel and all that, and I didn't even have a job,"" Firdausi says. Besides, reintegrating her 13-year-old brother into normal life was proving more difficult than she had imagined. He had not returned to live with his father and she was taking care of him. Boils and rashes had broken out all over his body, giving off a foul stench. His right shoulder remained bent for more than a year, requiring X-rays and physiotherapy before it finally stopped showing signs of the pressure from years of being gripped by beggars. Their mother did not recognise the youngest of her seven children - who was now rough and haggard. She had to raise his arm and search for a birthmark before she finally believed that the person in front of her was actually her son. After six years of no formal education, Samuel was barely literate. Firdausi was left frustrated with the search for a school - with many saying he was too old to join at primary level. Just when she had almost lost hope, Firdausi met a school proprietor who had seen them on the stage at the church. The woman agreed to admit him, while Firdausi made arrangements for additional private classes. Samuel Abdulraheem excelled at his studies In three months, Samuel zoomed from primary one to primary four. Within a year, he had passed the entrance exams to secondary school. Samuel spent only three years in secondary school when, aged 17, he felt confident enough to sit for university entrance exams. He passed with flying colours, attaining the best result in his entire school, and gained admission to study chemical engineering at the Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria. But Samuel's academic prowess would eventually lead to the sudden end to his studies. Other students often sought his assistance with assignments and he was expelled during his fourth year after being caught writing another student's answers during exams. Samuel now works as a supervisor on construction sites. ""Someday when I am comfortable financially, I hope to continue my education,"" he says, adding that computer science might be an option as he is good with gadgets. Samuel holds no ill feelings about what he went through while in captivity. He believes that all those years shaped him and taught him to try to always be nice to people. ""Nothing that people do actually gets to me. I just see it as a way of life. I don't hold grudges,"" he says. Memories of the constant hunger have affected the way he relates to beggars and their guides today. He never gives them money. ""I'd rather buy them food. Because, back then, it was better giving me food than money because the money went to the beggar and none came to me."" Samuel hopes that, by sharing his story, people will pay more attention to beggars and the children who often guide them. ""When they see a beggar with someone, they should have a second thought that, possibly, this child could need help,"" he says. ""Don't just see and give money and walk away.""

"The network was hit by widespread delays and cancellations a year ago The new National Rail summer timetable has come into effect, with 1,000 new train services being introduced across Great Britain. The operators and infrastructure firm Network Rail say they have learned the lessons of last summer's disruption. Then, a more extensive shake-up led to weeks of chaos on the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Northern networks. Train operators say they will monitor the latest changes carefully and respond quickly to any problems. ""The railway has a long way to go to win back passenger confidence,"" said Darren Shirley, chief executive of pressure group Campaign for Better Transport. ""But we hope that the lessons of last year have been learnt and the introduction of the new timetable... will improve people's perceptions of the railways, rather than further damaging them. ""In the event that things do go wrong, we would expect the rail industry to have a robust contingency plan so that passengers aren't left stranded again."" And Anthony Smith, boss of independent watchdog Transport Focus, said Monday morning's commute would provide a major test. Rail passenger groups are hoping for a smooth timetable change this year ""Passengers waiting on platforms just want the trains to run on time... they have paid for a service, and want the service to be reliable,"" he said. The timetable changes in May 2018 led to weeks of disruption to large parts of the network, The number of trains cancelled each day by GTR and Northern hit up to 470 and 310 respectively. GTR says passengers should be confident about the new services GTR was fined Â£5m by the rail regulator over its poor communication during an eight-week period of upheaval. The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) found that the company ""failed to provide appropriate, accurate and timely information"" to passengers. Among operators adding extra services are South Western Railway, GTR, Northern, Scotrail and Transport for Wales. Industry body the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) said train companies and Network Rail have only made changes where there is a ""high confidence"" infrastructure, rolling stock and staffing plans are ready. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was criticised for his role in the rail chaos RDG chief executive Paul Plummer said: ""Introducing 1,000 more services a week to meet demand on a congested network poses a significant challenge but we are working together to ensure improvements are introduced with the absolute minimum of disruption."" Following the chaos of a year ago, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was criticised after an ORR investigation found there was a ""lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities"", and that ""nobody took charge"".

"Bringing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament is the last roll of the dice for the prime minister Labour has finally pulled the plug on the Brexit talks with the government, at the end of a week in which they appeared to be on life support. So is it, as some suggest, time to read the last rites on Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Let's be clear - it will be challenging, to say the least, for the legislation to get through the Commons. But reports of its demise may well have been exaggerated. It may not go down to immediate defeat. And this is why. A leaked memo from the government side, not agreed by Labour or the cabinet, contained a wheeze that could have been attractive to both leaderships. Even before the Withdrawal Agreement Bill makes its appearance, the memo suggested there could be a ""free vote"" in Parliament on another referendum. Labour-Tory Brexit talks end without deal Pound hits four-month low as Brexit talks end Brexit: What happens next? This is rather different from what the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, was suggesting - that there ought to be a ""confirmatory"" vote, as part of a package, on any agreed deal. The leaders of both the main parties aren't keen on another public vote, to say the least. So a stand-alone Commons vote on the issue, divorced from the deal, would be more likely to go down to defeat - as it has on previous occasions. Jeremy Corbyn could say to People's Vote supporters in his ranks: ""Oh, I did try for a referendum, but oops, it didn't work - so now let's just leave with the best possible deal."" But it would seem that this approach has been scuppered by Labour's wider negotiating team and, presumably, by the cabinet. I have had a strong steer that this proposal in the leaked government memo won't go ahead in this form. But this might not be the setback it seems for the prime minister because supporters of another referendum may have no option but to vote initially for her bill. There will be a vote at what's called, in parliamentary speak, second reading in the first week in June. If the prime minister is defeated at this point, it's basically the end of the road for her deal and her premiership. Theresa May's immediate fate could be in the hands of Labour MPs But if MPs vote for the bill at second reading, they then get an opportunity to change it - and that would include an amendment on another referendum. So it's not impossible that some people who hate Theresa May's deal give it their temporary backing so they can discuss improving it, or putting it to a public vote. Talks with Labour are over - but efforts to win over individual Labour MPs are not. Note the wording of Downing Street's statement that ""complete agreement"" hasn't been reached. So expect to see some incentives in - or around - the Brexit bill for opposition MPs to back the government. For example, a commitment to stay in step with the EU on workers' rights and environmental protection. Allies of Sir Keir have blamed the breakdown of the talks on the PM's inability to get a customs union compromise past her cabinet. But if she keeps Conservative MPs on board in the legislation by eschewing a customs union but delivers a ""comprehensive"" (trust me, this word is important to some Labour MPs) temporary arrangement to last until the next election, some soft opposition to her deal may crumble. Then there is the argument put forward by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles, echoed off the record by some in Downing Street. If the prime minister's bill gets shot down in flames there is no other readily available vehicle to prevent the default option of no deal. Indeed, No 10 insiders expect to see ""vociferous"" arguments for no deal if Theresa May's legislation falls. Some unions, such as the GMB and Unison, favour another referendum. But the leadership of Unite, which is closest to Mr Corbyn, essentially favours leaving with a deal - and Labour MPs will be made well aware of this. So even if Labour formally opposes the bill at second reading, there could be a sizeable rebellion from those former Remainers representing Leave areas - safe in the knowledge that they wouldn't exactly be upsetting some powerful forces in the party. And the MPs who support what's called Common Market 2.0 could be crucial to the outcome. These are, broadly speaking, Labour MPs who are neither Corbynistas nor in favour of another referendum - such as Lucy Powell and Stephen Kinnock - and they are very keen to avoid no deal. However, if the Labour whip is to oppose, expect it to be rigorously enforced irrespective of the views of the party leader's office. So Mrs May's immediate fate may still be in the hands of opposition MPs The forthcoming leadership contest may firm up opposition to Theresa May's bill on the Conservative benches By putting the Withdrawal Agreement Bill out of its misery almost as soon as it appears, the prime minister's critics know she will vacate office sooner rather than later. But some candidates will be keener for her to get Brexit over the line, even with a less than optimal deal, so they don't immediately get bogged down with difficult votes. It would also allow them to make their pitch based on the future relationship with the EU. So could some of their supporters - irrespective of their public criticism of the deal - quietly vote to get it over the line? Set against all this, there is plenty of analysis in the public domain which will tell you how impossible it is for a deal to go through. But right now, No 10 might well see ""highly improbable"" as grounds for optimism. Hope dies last, does it not?

"This video can not be played Rory Stewart: ""Part of the bold offer will be around workers' rights"" Theresa May has said a ""new and improved"" Brexit deal will be put to MPs when they vote on the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill in early June. Writing in the Sunday Times,,externalMrs May said the bill will be a ""bold offer"". Cabinet minister Rory Stewart told the BBC he hoped extra guarantees on workers' rights would enable ""sensible"" Labour MPs to support the government. But Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would oppose the bill and it was ""very difficult"" to see it making progress. While he would consider new proposals ""very carefully"", he said what was being talked about did not appear ""fundamentally different"" from what was already on the table. Why PM's Brexit plan may not be dead yet Brexit: What happens next? A really simple guide to Brexit Scottish First MinisterNicola Sturgeon said support in Scotland for stayingin the EU had strengthened since the 2016 referendum - when 62% of voters backed Remain - and voters should send a clear message about this in Thursday's European elections. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Every other party is ...defining everybody on 2016. We're not"" Mrs Mayannounced this weekthat MPs would vote on the bill - which would bring the withdrawal agreement into UK law - in the week beginning 3 June. If the bill is not passed, the default position is that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October without a deal. Labour has said it will vote against the bill after talks with the government on trying to agree a compromise acceptable to its MPs broke down. The bill risks failing to clear its first parliamentary hurdle, with many Conservative Brexiteers, as well as the DUP, SNP and Liberal Democrats, also opposed. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""The SNP has been clear and straight with people: We want to keep Scotland in the EU"" But in her Sunday Times piece, Mrs May said she will ""not be simply asking MPs to think again"" on the same deal that they have repeatedly rejected - but on ""an improved packaged of measures that I believe can win new support"". The PM said she wanted MPs to consider the new deal ""with fresh pairs of eyes - and to give it their support"". By Jonathan Blake, political correspondent With any sales pitch that sounds like it's too good to be true, it's important to check the small print. And so with Theresa May's promise of a ""new and improved"" Brexit deal - MPs will be wondering what exactly has changed. A promise of a further referendum would win plenty of support from Labour but Downing Street's ruled that out. Changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Northern Ireland backstop, would sway the DUP and many of her own MPs, but the EU won't agree to that. Additions on workers' rights and environmental protections might be enough to sway a few Labour votes. And there may be - after a series of votes in Parliament - some movement on the UK's future customs relationship with the EU, but that is as likely to turn off Tory MPs as it is to woo the opposition. Not for the first time there appear to be no good options for Theresa May. But a ""bold offer"" is quite a promise to make, and if her deal has a hope of passing, she will somehow have to live up to it. Rory Stewart, who is the international development secretary, suggested the two main parties were ""about half an inch apart"" on the three main issues under discussion - protecting employment rights and environmental standards and having a strong trading relationship with the EU and the rest of the world. ""None of us want to remain in the European Union, none of us want a no-deal Brexit which means logically there has to be a deal,"" he said. ""We're in the territory of a deal and where we need to focus is Parliament and particularly getting Labour votes across - maybe not Jeremy Corbyn's vote but there are many other moderate, sensible Labour MPs that we should be able to bring across."" While Labour ""reserved the right"" to consider new proposals, Mr Corbyn said the official talks were at an end and he would not hand ministers a ""blank cheque"" Any agreement, he said, must include the scope for future governments to exceed the EU's employment and environmental standards not just keep pace with them. This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable: ""It's absolutely clear that no Brexit is where we should be going"" This video can not be played Chuka Umunna: ""Faced with no-deal or revocation, you've got to revoke"" On the issue of another referendum, he said Labour had kept the option on the table but any vote would have to be on a ""credible"" deal - which he suggested did not exist right now. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said he would be prepared to support the bill if the government agreed to give the public the final say on the terms of exit in a referendum. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr his party had discussed the ""practicalities"" of holding another public vote and it was possible before the 31 October deadline. ""We need a proper referendum that will come to a resolution on the issue, with remain on the ballot paper."" But Change UK spokesman Chuka Umunna said there was ""simply not enough time"" to hold a referendum before 31 October. Given it was ""almost certain"" the Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be defeated, he said the only option was for the the UK to stop Brexit by revoking Article 50. ""We are facing a national emergency,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""What would be undemocratic would be imposing a no-deal Brexit on the British people that there is not a mandate for."" This video can not be played The Conservatives jostling to be the next prime minister A cabinet meeting on Tuesday is to consider plans for another series of ""indicative votes"" by MPs to establish which proposals could command a majority. Asked if he would accept anything backed by Parliament, which has so far failed to unite behind an alternative, Mr Corbyn said it was ""very unlikely"" to resolve the impasse. ""The government has to come up with legislation, through negotiation with the EU,"" he said. ""The idea that they can produce a bill at the beginning of June and get it through all its stages by the end of July is very very unlikely."" Brexit had been due to take place on 29 March. But the UK was given an extension until 31 October after MPs three times voted down the withdrawal agreement Mrs May had negotiated with the EU - by margins of 230, 149 and 58 votes.

"This video can not be played WATCH: My revenge porn story YouTube star Chrissy Chambers recently won herfour-year legal battleagainst an ex who shared videos of the couple having sex online. For Chrissy, like most victims, it was a painful and distressing experience. The UK'sRevenge Porn Helpline,externalhas seen huge year-on-year increase in reported incidents since it was launched in 2015. The hotline received just over 500 reports in 2015 and more than 1000 in 2017. Once someone has a photo or video of you, it's very hard to control what happens to it. The charity Victim Support says even if you're in a relationship, think very carefully before you share any sexual images, ""whether this is online, in person or text"". It also suggests checking your privacy settings on your social media accounts regularly - and turning off your webcam when you're not using it. But if someone does post sexual images of you, what can you do? Rebecca Sharp has worked for the Revenge Porn Helpline since it launched in 2015. Here's what she recommends. Keeping evidence of what has been posted is important if a victim plans on reporting the incident to the police You should make a record of what has been posted online. Even if legal matters aren't your first thought, it could be important later. ""We always encourage people to take screenshots of what you've found, where it's been shared,"" Rebecca tells Newsbeat. Social media can remove pictures quickly when they are reported, but that could leave you without proof of a crime. ""If they do decide that's a route they want to go down, then the police have evidence of what's happened,"" she says. Social media sites have strict rules about revenge porn and say they deal with offenders quickly and severely Getting the main social media platforms to get revenge porn removed is mostly a simple process, according to Rebecca. They all have strict guidelines on how users can get intimate content removed. The Revenge Porn Hotline has a good working relationship with 'legitimate' adult websites but the biggest problems come on unregulated sites. ""Places like Pornhub and XVideos respond to us quite positively and quickly with taking content down,"" Rebecca says. But it's much harder dealing with sites dedicated to revenge porn - because their whole aim is to show those photos and videos. You might be able to use the""right to be forgotten"". This lets you ask search engines like Google to remove material from their search results. The photos or videos don't get deleted but this approach makes them much harder to find. You'll probably need a lawyer to help. The biggest fear can be that people closest to you will see what's been posted. Telling them first could soften the blow. ""We would always encourage people to go to trusted family and friends for support,"" says Rebecca. ""They have been the victim of a crime. So just as if their house had been broken into or if they'd been sexually assaulted, they would want to ask for help."" She says if you can prepare people for what's happened, they're more likely to respond sensitively. It took YouTuber Chrissy Chambers more than four years to settleher revenge porn casebecause it started before laws to make it illegal were introduced. ""This definitely felt like something that was never going to end,"" she told Newsbeat after winning her case. It had an impact on her mental health and relationship but she encourages others to do what she did, saying they ""are not alone"" and that ""there are people who desperately want to help you."" However, since laws around revenge porn are relatively new, Rebecca says experiences of dealing with cases can differ greatly between UK police forces. Across England, Wales and Scotland, revenge porn is a specific criminal offence. In Northern Ireland, it's due to become law. It's described as ""the sharing of private, sexual materials, either photos or videos, of another person without their consent and with the purpose of causing embarrassment or distress"". The offence covers photos or videos showing people engaged in sexual activity which would not usually be done in public, or with their genitals, buttocks or breasts exposed or covered only with underwear. It includes sharing the material as well as posting it online. In England and Wales, the maximum punishment is two years in prison - in Scotland, it's five years. Since April 2015 it has been illegal to share revenge porn images online Despite the stress of this happening, Rebecca encourages victims to remain positive about reporting incidents. ""Removing revenge porn can be done,"" she says. ""It's not an 'all or nothing' situation. Just because it's out there doesn't mean we can't get it back."" Chrissy Chambers also says it's important to stand up for yourself, rather than hide in shame. ""To every victim of this insidious kind of attack, I am here to say: You can fight back, and win. ""You will heal and move on - and you will not have to take those steps alone.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: My revenge porn story ""There's not an area of my life it hasn't touched,"" says Chrissy Chambers, reflecting on the secret sex tape her ex-boyfriend posted online. ""It has affected my life in every way imaginable and I'm sure it will continue to for the rest of my life."" During her four-year legal battle against the man - who cannot be named for legal reasons - Ms Chambers went from YouTube musician to ""revenge porn"" campaigner. Here, she tells her story to the BBC's Jane Wakefield. JW: How did you first find out the video had been uploaded? CC: I initially found out through a friend and a fan who wrote to us and said: ""I just want to alert you that someone is spreading these links."" Someone was distributing links all over our YouTube channel, saying: ""You think Chrissy Chambers is a role model? She's actually a whore, look at these videos."" I clicked the link and then realised for the first time what had happened. I literally fell down on the ground and it felt just like I was getting hit with a baseball bat. Musician Chrissy Chambers To find out that the video existed and to find out that this had happened at all, it was like my world came crashing down. How has it affected your life? In every way imaginable. I have PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder], I became an alcoholic at 23. I almost died. I had depression, anxiety, night terrors. It affected my relationship. We [Chrissy and partner Bria Kam] had a successful YouTube channel at that point and had about 50,000 young women who were following us and looking up to us. Chrissy Chambers makes videos with fiancee Bria Kam (left) Some of them said: ""I looked up to you so much, I can't support someone who would choose to do this."" It was heartbreaking for me - but knowing that I had all these other people who loved us and supported us, I felt a huge responsibility to stand up for myself and seek justice. I wanted to set an example in case this ever happened to them. You live in the United States but the videos were uploaded in the UK, so your case was fought here. What happened? My ex uploaded the videos before the [revenge porn] law was passed here in the UK. I was here in the UK the day the law passed and we went to the police to try and get criminal charges. They said the statute of limitations on my case had long passed and I was not going to be able to pursue criminal charges Then you had a crowdfunding campaign to raise money for a civil case. We raised the money in a month. The public reaction to the situation was an outpouring of love and support - and also horror at the situation. I won monetary damages from my ex, as well as being assigned copyright to the videos. That was the most important piece of the puzzle, because if these videos are ever shared again I can now go to the websites directly and submit takedown notices or pursue legal action. We have spent four-and-a-half years fighting to get the rights to get the videos taken down. It just means everything. Chrissy won her civil case The money is important too. Since he got anonymity, there needed to be some reparation for the suffering and all of the therapy and things we had to go through. The real victory for me was getting justice and setting a precedent for others. Did you contact websites previously to have the videos taken down? What did they say? If websites actually responded, that would be great. When I reached out in the past I got no response. It wasn't until we sent a letter from a lawyer that some of the videos started to come down. I would like to see these websites require some proof of consent for videos uploaded, and a much better system for takedown notices. If somebody says a video was not consensual, it should come down quickly to protect the victim. You have become a figurehead for fighting revenge porn. What would you say to other victims? I would say to other victims who maybe don't have the confidence and don't know what to do about pursuing it, that I know exactly how you feel. Chrissy proposed to partner Bria (left) on Wednesday I've been there. There are many days where I don't feel confident to keep fighting. Justice can be served. I finally learned that there was a light at the end of my tunnel. Don't give up hope. Even if it takes years you can get justice and you didn't deserve to have this happen to you.

"This video can not be played Revenge porn victim: 'I felt like I had been raped' One in three allegations of so-called revenge porn are withdrawn by the complainant, new figures show. Since it was made a criminal offence in 2015 victims have chosen not to support charges in 2,813 of 7,806 incidents. Some alleged victims say it is because they are not granted anonymity, while others cite a lack of police support. The Ministry of Justice said it was committed to supporting victims but had no current plan to change the law around identification. The North Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, Julia Mulligan, has launched apetition to change the law,externalto grant victims anonymity, as is the case for complainants in sexual offence cases. To date it has received more than 15,000 signatures. She said: ""We think the law is fundamentally flawed. At the moment [revenge porn] is a communications offence not a sexual offence and that means victims face the likelihood of being publically named and we think that puts people off."" Humans to vet Facebook revenge porn photos Revenge porn almost killed me Facebook 'remembers' nude images to combat revenge porn The BBC obtained figures relating to revenge porn complaints from 34 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales. Revenge porn is described as ""the sharing of private, sexual materials, either photos or videos, of another person without their consent and with the purpose of causing embarrassment or distress"". The offence covers photos or videos showing people engaged in sexual activity which would not usually take place in public. It includes sharing the material as well as posting it online. In England and Wales, the maximum punishment is two years in prison - in Scotland, it is five years. Lydia (whose name has been changed), from West Yorkshire, was with her partner for a year before they split up and he took it badly. ""I didn't know he was taking pictures. I was blindfolded and I didn't know he was taking videos of me. I thought it was just us having fun. ""After I split up with him I got this email from a woman I didn't know saying there were explicit photos of me on a website. ""I looked on the site and typed in my name and saw my pictures - I couldn't believe it - I freaked out, had a complete meltdown. ""I'm a really private person - it was so upsetting. I called the police and I tried to contact different websites to get them to remove my pictures and video. ""He got sentenced to six months in prison. It didn't feel long enough for what he put me through. ""I feel like I was molested - like I was raped."" Lauren Evans, from Hertfordshire, contacted Thames Valley Police in 2015 after she discovered sexual images of her were being shared via social media by a man she had met online. She said, however, she was made to feel that she was responsible for what had happened. ""I felt like it was all my fault,"" she said. ""Even the police officer I told my story to said 'I guess you've learnt your lesson now then', and that shook me to my core. ""I thought if the police think it's my fault then what is the point in going on."" She also said the term ""revenge porn"" should be changed as it ""makes it sound like the victim is deserving of this"". A spokesperson for Thames Valley Police said it could not comment on individual cases but that takes allegations of revenge porn ""extremely seriously"". Catherine Knibbs is a cyber trauma researcher and psychotherapist and said some people will never get over the trauma of being a victim of revenge porn. ""Prosecutions are long, lengthy distressing process for most victims of any kind of crimes,"" she said. ""In terms of sexual crimes - you're looking at the proposition you might be told it's your fault, you asked for it - lot of victim blaming, very difficult for victims to come to terms with."" Data collated by the BBC shows there has been an increase in the number of revenge porn cases reported to police since records began, from 1,861 offences in 2015-16 to 3,307 in 2017-18. The proportion of cases resulting in charges, however, has fallen. In 2015-16 it stood at 14% and in 2017-18 was just 7%. Vanessa Smith, Det Ch Insp of the West Yorkshire Cyber Crime Unit, said: ""Revenge porn itself is extortion, blackmail, it can be sexual harassment or stalking. I would urge people to be trustful of the police - we will treat your call with sensitivity. ""We need to know basics - how it's been posted, to which sites - and then we can work with those sites and organisations. I know Facebook and Twitter have provided more guidance to their customers and have been quite robust monitoring it."" A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Revenge porn is an awful abuse of trust which leaves victims feeling humiliated and degraded. ""By making it a specific offence we sent a clear message that it will not be tolerated, and there have now been almost 300 convictions. ""We are committed to supporting and protecting victims. We have no current plans to extend automatic anonymity to victims of the offence, but we keep the law under constant review.""

"This video can not be played Rory Stewart: ""Part of the bold offer will be around workers' rights"" Theresa May has said a ""new and improved"" Brexit deal will be put to MPs when they vote on the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill in early June. Writing in the Sunday Times,,externalMrs May said the bill will be a ""bold offer"". Cabinet minister Rory Stewart told the BBC he hoped extra guarantees on workers' rights would enable ""sensible"" Labour MPs to support the government. But Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would oppose the bill and it was ""very difficult"" to see it making progress. While he would consider new proposals ""very carefully"", he said what was being talked about did not appear ""fundamentally different"" from what was already on the table. Why PM's Brexit plan may not be dead yet Brexit: What happens next? A really simple guide to Brexit Scottish First MinisterNicola Sturgeon said support in Scotland for stayingin the EU had strengthened since the 2016 referendum - when 62% of voters backed Remain - and voters should send a clear message about this in Thursday's European elections. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Every other party is ...defining everybody on 2016. We're not"" Mrs Mayannounced this weekthat MPs would vote on the bill - which would bring the withdrawal agreement into UK law - in the week beginning 3 June. If the bill is not passed, the default position is that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October without a deal. Labour has said it will vote against the bill after talks with the government on trying to agree a compromise acceptable to its MPs broke down. The bill risks failing to clear its first parliamentary hurdle, with many Conservative Brexiteers, as well as the DUP, SNP and Liberal Democrats, also opposed. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""The SNP has been clear and straight with people: We want to keep Scotland in the EU"" But in her Sunday Times piece, Mrs May said she will ""not be simply asking MPs to think again"" on the same deal that they have repeatedly rejected - but on ""an improved packaged of measures that I believe can win new support"". The PM said she wanted MPs to consider the new deal ""with fresh pairs of eyes - and to give it their support"". By Jonathan Blake, political correspondent With any sales pitch that sounds like it's too good to be true, it's important to check the small print. And so with Theresa May's promise of a ""new and improved"" Brexit deal - MPs will be wondering what exactly has changed. A promise of a further referendum would win plenty of support from Labour but Downing Street's ruled that out. Changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, including the Northern Ireland backstop, would sway the DUP and many of her own MPs, but the EU won't agree to that. Additions on workers' rights and environmental protections might be enough to sway a few Labour votes. And there may be - after a series of votes in Parliament - some movement on the UK's future customs relationship with the EU, but that is as likely to turn off Tory MPs as it is to woo the opposition. Not for the first time there appear to be no good options for Theresa May. But a ""bold offer"" is quite a promise to make, and if her deal has a hope of passing, she will somehow have to live up to it. Rory Stewart, who is the international development secretary, suggested the two main parties were ""about half an inch apart"" on the three main issues under discussion - protecting employment rights and environmental standards and having a strong trading relationship with the EU and the rest of the world. ""None of us want to remain in the European Union, none of us want a no-deal Brexit which means logically there has to be a deal,"" he said. ""We're in the territory of a deal and where we need to focus is Parliament and particularly getting Labour votes across - maybe not Jeremy Corbyn's vote but there are many other moderate, sensible Labour MPs that we should be able to bring across."" While Labour ""reserved the right"" to consider new proposals, Mr Corbyn said the official talks were at an end and he would not hand ministers a ""blank cheque"" Any agreement, he said, must include the scope for future governments to exceed the EU's employment and environmental standards not just keep pace with them. This video can not be played Sir Vince Cable: ""It's absolutely clear that no Brexit is where we should be going"" This video can not be played Chuka Umunna: ""Faced with no-deal or revocation, you've got to revoke"" On the issue of another referendum, he said Labour had kept the option on the table but any vote would have to be on a ""credible"" deal - which he suggested did not exist right now. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said he would be prepared to support the bill if the government agreed to give the public the final say on the terms of exit in a referendum. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr his party had discussed the ""practicalities"" of holding another public vote and it was possible before the 31 October deadline. ""We need a proper referendum that will come to a resolution on the issue, with remain on the ballot paper."" But Change UK spokesman Chuka Umunna said there was ""simply not enough time"" to hold a referendum before 31 October. Given it was ""almost certain"" the Withdrawal Agreement Bill would be defeated, he said the only option was for the the UK to stop Brexit by revoking Article 50. ""We are facing a national emergency,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""What would be undemocratic would be imposing a no-deal Brexit on the British people that there is not a mandate for."" This video can not be played The Conservatives jostling to be the next prime minister A cabinet meeting on Tuesday is to consider plans for another series of ""indicative votes"" by MPs to establish which proposals could command a majority. Asked if he would accept anything backed by Parliament, which has so far failed to unite behind an alternative, Mr Corbyn said it was ""very unlikely"" to resolve the impasse. ""The government has to come up with legislation, through negotiation with the EU,"" he said. ""The idea that they can produce a bill at the beginning of June and get it through all its stages by the end of July is very very unlikely."" Brexit had been due to take place on 29 March. But the UK was given an extension until 31 October after MPs three times voted down the withdrawal agreement Mrs May had negotiated with the EU - by margins of 230, 149 and 58 votes.

"Laws covering so-called revenge porn are not fit for purpose and police still need more training, experts say. Victims should receive anonymity and laws need to include threats to share images, according to Sophie Mortimer from the Revenge Porn helpline. Figures from 19 forces in England and Wales revealed police investigations have doubled in the last four years but the number of charges has fallen. The National Police Chiefs Council said forces take the crime ""very seriously"". Revenge porn - the sharing of private or sexual images or videos of a person without their consent - became an offence in England and Wales in April 2015. Similar laws were later introduced in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Love Island's Zara: Revenge porn victims need anonymity Revenge porn almost killed me Revenge porn: 'I became the lawyer I needed' What to do if you're a victim Figures from 19 of 43 police forces in England and Wales show the number of alleged cases being investigated by officers has more than doubled in the last four years - from 852 in 2015-16 to 1,853 in 2018-19. However, the figures also reveal that the number of charges dropped by 23% - from 207 to 158 - during the same period. Revenge porn is currently categorised as a ""communications crime"", meaning victims are not granted anonymity. In the last year, more than a third of victims decided not to proceed with the case. Some say it is because they are not granted anonymity, while others cited a lack of police support. Alice Ruggles died after an ex-boyfriend broke into her home in Gateshead In October 2016, Alice Ruggles, 24, was murdered by a former boyfriend who cut her throat after breaking into her home in Gateshead. After her death it emerged that her killer, Trimaan Dhillon, had threatened to share intimate images of her online as part of a campaign of stalking and harassment. Alice's mother, Dr Sue Hills, said threatening to share images should be made part of the law. She said her daughter may have sought help sooner if Dhillon had not held the threat over her. ""It causes immensely serious psychological damage - it is a crime,"" she said. Ms Mortimer, from the Revenge Porn helpline, backed her call. She added: ""We'd also like to see it made a sexual offence because that would guarantee anonymity for victims."" Sophie Mortimer: 'Key that frontline services understand what the law means' She also called for better training of police officers. ""It's all very well changing the law and making these things illegal, but if the frontline services don't understand what the law actually means then you've only done half the job."" Research by the University of Suffolk found 95% of police officers who took part in a survey in 2017 said they had not had any training on revenge porn legislation. A joint Ministry of Justice and Home Office statement said: ""When we engaged with victims and campaigners in designing the new law they accepted that the motive for this crime is almost always malicious, rather than sexual, which is why the law considers it a non-sexual offence. ""We launched and continue to support the Revenge Porn helpline, which helps victims to speak with the police and to social media companies about removing the content."" Chief Constable Simon Bailey from the National Police Chiefs' Council said forces ""pursue all lines of inquiry and prosecute people where appropriate"". ""The College of Policing has produced a briefing and training note, which all officers involved in these types of investigations can access.""

"The only blip on Wilder's otherwise flawless record is a draw with Tyson Fury in December 2018 Deontay Wilder produced a sensational first-round knockout of Dominic Breazeale to retain his WBC world heavyweight title in New York. Wilder, 33, flattened his fellow American with 43 seconds of the opening round left - taking his record to 41 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. Breazeale was on the ropes early on before finding a solid shot to respond to the champion. But Wilder finished the fight moments later with a huge right hand. Fury or Joshua? Wilder's next fight 'probably next year' Saunders wins WBO super-middleweight title After his victory, Wilder was approached by Cuba's Luis Ortiz in the ring - a man he beat in 2018 - but when asked about potential contests with British heavyweights Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua, said ""no doors are closed"" and that such fights ""are in discussion"". ""All parties involved are talking,"" Wilder told Showtime. ""There's too many people and opinions involved. It will take our teams to sit down, handle things, squash everything and get it done for the fans. ""The big fights will happen the way we all benefit. We risk our lives in here, so let us get our time to iron out our differences and you guys will know when it happens."" Breazeale, 33, left the ring without talking to the media, fresh from a punch that left him sprawled on the canvas and unable to answer the count. His counter-punch when cornered had briefly seen Wilder engage in a couple of grapples but - after a pause for breath - the champion followed a left-hand jab with a right to the jaw which was as accurate as it was destructive. It was a 40th victory by knockout for Wilder and just a second career loss for Breazeale, following his 2016 defeat by Anthony Joshua. It was just a second career loss for Breazeale, following his 2016 defeat by Anthony Joshua Wilder will face a World Boxing Councilhearingfor pre-fight comments wherehe again raised the prospect of an opponent dying in the ring. ""This is the only sport where you can kill a man and get paid for it at the same time,"" Wilder had said in the build-up. ""It's legal."" But afterwards Wilder spoke warmly about his beaten rival. ""Everything came out of me tonight,"" Wilder told Showtime. ""I know it's been a big build-up, a lot of animosity, chaos and hatred to one another, a lot of words said. It just came out tonight. ""This is what makes boxing great. When you have stuff to overcome. ""I've told him I love him and I want to see him go home to his family. I know we say things we mean sometimes but when you get into a fight and settle your differences, if you can then hug him and kiss him, I wish the world was like that, handle things with our hands and then live to see another day."" Scotland's Taylor wins first world title England's Whiteside wins on pro debut 'Scary' Inoue wins bantamweight world title With this win, Wilder successfully defended his title for the ninth time, becoming only the 10th man to achieve that milestone in consecutive fights in the heavyweight division. The Alabama fighter's ring craft has at times been ridiculed because of his unorthodox nature, and a controversial draw with Fury in December led some to say he had been exposed when coming up against a skilled fighter. What is undeniable is his vicious power, and a right hand that means he only needs to land sporadically to turn fights his way. Fury, knocked down twice in their Los Angeles thriller, knows all about it - but will he face the threat in a rematch? And will we ever see Wilder and Joshua fight for the four world titles they possess? Wilder said a rematch and the big fights will come but, with the three men signed to different broadcasters, each with their own financial goals, the biggest battles of all will need to take place at the negotiating table. The American's manager Shelly Finkel told BBC Sport that fights of such magnitude are more likely in 2020 so, for now at least, heavyweight focus turns to Joshua's defence against American Andy Ruiz Jr on 1 June and Fury's contest with German fighter Tom Schwarz two weeks later. Wilder has done his part and can bask in the glory of a highlight reel knockout. His rivals cannot slip up in the coming four weeks.

"Kompany captained Manchester City to the Premier League title, FA Cup and Carabao Cup this season Vincent Kompany says joining Anderlecht as player-manager is the ""most passionate yet rational"" decision he has made after announcing he has left Manchester City. The 33-year-old has signed a three-year deal with the Belgian club after 11 years at Etihad Stadium, eight of which he spent as club captain. Saturday's 6-0 FA Cup final win over Watford was Kompany's final game for City, after winning four Premier League titles, two FA Cups and four League Cups. In an open letter on Facebook, Belgium defender Kompany said leaving City ""doesn't feel real"". ""Countless of times have I imagined this day,"" he said. ""After all, the end has felt nearby for so many years. ""Man City has given me everything. I've tried to give back as much as I possibly could."" In a second letter released hours later, Kompany announced his move to Anderlecht, who said his arrival marked the ""return of the prince"". ""I want to share my knowledge with the next purple generations,"" said Kompany, who first joined Anderlecht at the age of six. ""With that, I will also put a bit of Manchester in the heart of Belgium."" This video can not be played Man City 6-0 Watford: Pep's got no chill, worst coin toss ever & City run riot Centre-back Kompany joined City from Hamburg as a defensive midfielder in 2008 and was named club captain three years later. He scored his final goal against Leicester on 6 May, a brilliant strike from 25 yards that was voted goal of the season on BBC Match of the Day. That victory took City to within one win of the Premier League title, which they sealed on the final day of the season with victory at Brighton. Football Daily: Vincent parts Kompany with Man City 'Kompany enhances his legend with wonder goal' 'Don't shoot, Vinny' - reaction to Kompany's decisive goal ""The time has come for me to go now,"" Kompany said. ""As overwhelming as it is, I feel nothing but gratefulness. I am grateful to all those who supported me on a special journey, at a very special club. ""I remember the first day, as clear as I see the last. I remember the boundless kindness I received from the people of Manchester. ""I will never forget how all Man City supporters remained loyal to me in good times and especially bad times. Against the odds, you have always backed me and inspired me to never give up."" City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said: ""There have been many important contributors to Manchester City's renaissance, but arguably none are more important than Vincent Kompany. ""He defines the essence of the club. For a decade he has been the lifeblood, the soul, and beating heart of a supremely talented squad. ""A booming voice in the dressing room yet a quiet and measured ambassador off it, Vincent can be as proud of himself as we are of him."" Manchester City won the Premier League on the final day of the season after one of the most thrilling campaigns in the league's history After the 1-0 win over Leicester - City's final home game of the season - Kompany was in tears as the team enjoyed a lap of honour. By beating Watford 6-0 at Wembley, City became the first men's side to complete the domestic treble in England. In September, the club will hold Kompany's testimonial match, from which he willdonate all profits to Manchester's homeless. He said: ""Sheikh Mansour changed my life and that of all the City fans around the world, for that I am forever grateful. A blue nation has arisen and challenged the established order of things, I find that awesome. ""I cherish the counsel and leadership of a good human being, Khaldoon Al Mubarak. Man City could not be in better hands."" Al Mubarak said: ""He will always be part of the City family. ""I am not sure he expected to lift the Premier League trophy on four occasions during his captaincy but he will be remembered and revered whenever this period of unprecedented City success is spoken about by future generations. ""His leadership, intelligence and determination have seen him adapt brilliantly to playing under four different managers and overcome some debilitating injuries. ""He is a special character who has answered every demand the club has made of him."" Vincent Kompany in stats Since Kompany's first season with the club, City have won more domestic trophies (10) than any other English side Only David Silva (282) and Joe Hart (266) have made more Premier League games for City than Kompany (265) Kompany has played more Premier League games than any other Belgian player in the league's history Among defenders, only former Chelsea captain John Terry has kept more Premier League clean sheets (101) than Kompany (94) since his debut Kompany scored five goals in 73 games for Anderlecht from 2003 to 2006. The club are the most successful team in Belgian history but are currently sixth in the Belgian First Division A. They have won 34 league titles, the most recent in 2016-17. ""I stopped at their training grounds on my way to international duty last year. Just to say hello,"" Kompany said. ""[Marc] Coucke, the chairman, and sports director Michael Verschueren asked my opinion regarding the difficult situation the club was in. ""I shared my thoughts and listened to their vision for the future: ambitious, courageous and determined to get back to number one."" Kompany offered his help with ""no strings attached"", and said it was ""unexpected"" when they offered him the position of player-manager ""not so long ago"". ""I was left not only impressed, but also intrigued by this sign of confidence in me,"" he said. This video can not be played FA Cup final: Watch all six Man City goals in 60 seconds Injuries have taken their toll on Kompany in recent years, and he featured in only 17 of City's 38 league games this season because of muscle injuries. However, he will be remembered for his influence and contribution on the pitch, where he led City to a first top-flight title since 1968 in 2012. Along with Sergio Aguero and David Silva, Kompany is one of only three survivors from that triumph, and they repeated the achievement in 2014 and 2018. City retained their title this month, finishing one point ahead of Liverpool after one of the most thrilling seasons in Premier League history. ""How often does someone get the chance to end such an important chapter, representing a club with such great history and tradition, in such a great fashion?"" Kompany said.

"This video can not be played Dina had to give birth to her rapist's child - under Alabama's abortion ban women would have no choice. US President Donald Trump has outlined his ""strongly pro-life"" views on abortion amid controversy over strict new laws passed in several states. Mr Trump said he was against abortion except in cases of rape, incest or a ""serious health risk"" to the mother. His stance on what is a divisive election issue in the US emerged days after Alabama passed a law banning abortion in almost all cases. A pro-choice rally is planned later on Sunday in protest at the new measures. Should men have a say in abortion debate? The women looking outside the law for abortions Emotional abortion stories shared with #youknowme Supporters ofAlabama's abortion bansay they expect the law to be blocked in court, but hope that the appeals process will bring it before the US Supreme Court. They want the highest court in the land - which now has a conservative majority - to overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling making abortion a right across the US. Sixteen other states are also seeking to impose new restrictions on abortion. The US president outlined his views amid the controversy over Alabama's new law Mr Trump, whose position on abortion has shifted over the years, had been largely silent on the Alabama restrictions until Saturday, when he posted a series of tweets outlining his views. ""I am very strongly pro-life, with the three exceptions,external- rape, incest and protecting the life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan"", he said. The president added that judicial measures, such as his appointment of conservative Supreme Court judges Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, had helped to make abortion laws in various states more restrictive. ""We have come very far in the last two years with 105 wonderful new federal judges (many more to come), two great new supreme court justices â¦ and a whole new and positive attitude about the right to life."" Abortion is an issue which remains controversial in the US, with evangelical Christians in particular forming a nucleus of voters who want to restrict, or even outlaw, the procedure completely. Mr Trump has adjusted his stance over the years. In 1999, he said: ""I'm very pro-choice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it. I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when I listen to people debating the subject. But you still - I just believe in choice."" But in March 2016, he clarified that his position was ""pro-life with exceptions"". On Saturday he tweeted that Republicans must unite to ""win for life in 2020"". This video can not be played The Pink House: The last abortion clinic in Mississippi Senior Democrats have also suggested that the issue will be an important one in the 2020 presidential campaign. Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren responded to Alabama's abortion ban by saying:""This ban is dangerous and exceptionally cruel,external- and the bill's authors want to use it to overturn Roe v Wade. ""I've lived in that America and let me tell you: We are not going back - not now, not ever. We will fight this. And we will win."" Since the Supreme Court ruling on abortion in 1973, the number of abortion clinics has dropped in many US states, and in 2017, six states reportedly had just one abortion clinic in operation. Earlier this year the governors of Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi and Ohio signed bills banning terminations if an embryonic heartbeat could be detected. What's behind Georgia's anti-abortion 'heartbeat bill'? Why are people talking about NY's abortion law? The women looking outside the law for abortions According to the Guttmacher Institute - a group which campaigns for reproductive rights - none of these bans are yet in effect, but their introduction is part of a strategy to get the cases heard by the Supreme Court. But other states are taking measures to safeguard abortion rights. In January, New York signed into law a bill protecting the right to terminate a pregnancy after 24 weeks in certain cases.

"This video can not be played The contest's highlights - from singing in the shower and bendy poles to the Netherlands' triumph. The Netherlands' Duncan Laurence has won the 2019 Eurovision Song Contest with his song Arcade. He had been the bookmakers' favourite to win, and came through to the top of the leaderboard with 492 points after the public vote. The UK's Michael Rice came bottom, after getting just three points from the public vote, and a total of 16 points for Bigger Than Us. Laurence said: ""Here's to dreaming big, this is to music first, always."" The last time The Netherlands won was 1975. The audience joined in as Laurence performed the track again at the end of the show. Italy finished second with 465 and Russia third with 369 points. Eurovision 2019 live page In pictures: Highlights from the contest Madonna makes a statement at Eurovision The ceremony also saw last year's winner Netta perform, while singers from previous contests also sang each other's songs.

She kicked off her set with a version of Like A Prayer, with backing dancers dressed as monks. She went on to sing Future, her new single featuring the rapper Quavo.

Capital Breakfast presenter Roman Kemp was also unimpressed,calling for autotune,externalto come to the rescue. A section of her performance in which her backing dancers displayed Israeli and Palestinian flags was not an approved part of the act, organisers said. Eurovision said: ""In the live broadcast of the Eurovision Song Contest Grand Final, two of Madonna's dancers briefly displayed the Israeli and Palestinian flags on the back of their outfits. ""This element of the performance was not part of the rehearsals which had been cleared with the EBU and the host broadcaster, KAN. The Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political event and Madonna had been made aware of this."" It wasn't just the Queen of Pop who was apparently breaking the rules either. The organisers said Iceland's Eurovision act could face punishment after displaying Palestinian flags during the live broadcast. During the final, the band members held up Palestinian flags while their public vote was being announced. In a statement, Eurovision said the ""consequences of this action"" will be discussed by the contest's executive board"". Alongside the contest, there were clashes in central Jerusalem as ultra-orthodox Jews protested against Eurovision. This video can not be played Ultra-orthodox Jews in Jerusalem are angry that the contest was scheduled on the Jewish Sabbath They objected to the scheduling of the Eurovision Song Contest on the Jewish Sabbath, resulting in angry scenes as demonstrators clashed with police. At one point, a small number of women held a counter protest, showing their bras. There were other protests in Tel Aviv over Israel's occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights. There have also been campaigns online. The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) has been using social media to oppose holding the contest in Israel because of its treatment of Palestinians. It accuses Israel of trying to whitewash (""artwash"") discrimination, which it likens to apartheid, the system of racial segregation once used in South Africa.

"The only blip on Wilder's otherwise flawless record is a draw with Tyson Fury in December 2018 Deontay Wilder produced a sensational first-round knockout of Dominic Breazeale to retain his WBC world heavyweight title in New York. Wilder, 33, flattened his fellow American with 43 seconds of the opening round left - taking his record to 41 wins and a draw from 42 bouts. Breazeale was on the ropes early on before finding a solid shot to respond to the champion. But Wilder finished the fight moments later with a huge right hand. Fury or Joshua? Wilder's next fight 'probably next year' Saunders wins WBO super-middleweight title After his victory, Wilder was approached by Cuba's Luis Ortiz in the ring - a man he beat in 2018 - but when asked about potential contests with British heavyweights Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua, said ""no doors are closed"" and that such fights ""are in discussion"". ""All parties involved are talking,"" Wilder told Showtime. ""There's too many people and opinions involved. It will take our teams to sit down, handle things, squash everything and get it done for the fans. ""The big fights will happen the way we all benefit. We risk our lives in here, so let us get our time to iron out our differences and you guys will know when it happens."" Breazeale, 33, left the ring without talking to the media, fresh from a punch that left him sprawled on the canvas and unable to answer the count. His counter-punch when cornered had briefly seen Wilder engage in a couple of grapples but - after a pause for breath - the champion followed a left-hand jab with a right to the jaw which was as accurate as it was destructive. It was a 40th victory by knockout for Wilder and just a second career loss for Breazeale, following his 2016 defeat by Anthony Joshua. It was just a second career loss for Breazeale, following his 2016 defeat by Anthony Joshua Wilder will face a World Boxing Councilhearingfor pre-fight comments wherehe again raised the prospect of an opponent dying in the ring. ""This is the only sport where you can kill a man and get paid for it at the same time,"" Wilder had said in the build-up. ""It's legal."" But afterwards Wilder spoke warmly about his beaten rival. ""Everything came out of me tonight,"" Wilder told Showtime. ""I know it's been a big build-up, a lot of animosity, chaos and hatred to one another, a lot of words said. It just came out tonight. ""This is what makes boxing great. When you have stuff to overcome. ""I've told him I love him and I want to see him go home to his family. I know we say things we mean sometimes but when you get into a fight and settle your differences, if you can then hug him and kiss him, I wish the world was like that, handle things with our hands and then live to see another day."" Scotland's Taylor wins first world title England's Whiteside wins on pro debut 'Scary' Inoue wins bantamweight world title With this win, Wilder successfully defended his title for the ninth time, becoming only the 10th man to achieve that milestone in consecutive fights in the heavyweight division. The Alabama fighter's ring craft has at times been ridiculed because of his unorthodox nature, and a controversial draw with Fury in December led some to say he had been exposed when coming up against a skilled fighter. What is undeniable is his vicious power, and a right hand that means he only needs to land sporadically to turn fights his way. Fury, knocked down twice in their Los Angeles thriller, knows all about it - but will he face the threat in a rematch? And will we ever see Wilder and Joshua fight for the four world titles they possess? Wilder said a rematch and the big fights will come but, with the three men signed to different broadcasters, each with their own financial goals, the biggest battles of all will need to take place at the negotiating table. The American's manager Shelly Finkel told BBC Sport that fights of such magnitude are more likely in 2020 so, for now at least, heavyweight focus turns to Joshua's defence against American Andy Ruiz Jr on 1 June and Fury's contest with German fighter Tom Schwarz two weeks later. Wilder has done his part and can bask in the glory of a highlight reel knockout. His rivals cannot slip up in the coming four weeks.
