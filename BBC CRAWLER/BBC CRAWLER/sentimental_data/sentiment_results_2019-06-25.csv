"Stephanie Grisham, press secretary for First Lady Melania Trump A top aide to Melania Trump will be the next White House press secretary and communications director, the first lady has announced on Twitter. Stephanie Grisham, who serves as the first lady's deputy chief of staff and communications director, will fill the vacancy left by Sarah Sanders. ""I can think of no better person to serve the Administration & our country,"" Mrs Trump wrote on Twitter. Mrs Sanders announced her resignation from the post earlier this month. President Donald Trump said Ms Grisham was ""fantastic"" and had accepted the job on Tuesday morning. ""Stephanie has been with me from the beginning,"" he told reporters. ""A lot of people wanted the job, a lot of people wanted to do it. I've asked people, who do you like, and so many people said Stephanie. She's here, she knows everyone, she actually gets along with the media very well."" Calling her time at the White House ""the honour of a lifetime"", Mrs Sanders said she would be returning to Arkansas at the end of June to spend more time with her family. Hours after the announcement, Mrs Sanders wrote on Twitter that her replacement would do ""an incredible job"". ""I'm so proud that another mom and a great friend will be taking over,"" she said. Ms Grisham, considered a leading candidate for Mrs Sanders' replacement, has worked for the Trump family since 2015. She will accompany US President Donald Trump in her new role on his trip to Japan and Korea this week, CNN reported. Ms Grisham will serve both as press secretary and communications director, a post that has been empty since the departure of Bill Shine in March. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Grisham began working for the Trump family in 2015 and is one of the last remaining aides from the presidential campaign who still serves in the White House. She previously worked as a spokeswoman and a communications operative in Republican politics, including Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign for president. Ms Grisham, who has long been involved in Arizona politics, was one of Mr Trump's first staffers in the state, organising his campaign work there in the early stages of the 2016 election. Throughout her tenure in the administration, Ms Grisham has been fiercely loyal to the first lady and the Trump family. While working with Mrs Trump, Ms Grisham is said to have run a tight operation, allowing few leaks or missteps. ""She has developed a great amount of trust from both the president and the first lady, which is a pretty high commodity here,"" said Mrs Sandersto the Washington Post,externallast year. ""There aren't a lot of people who have a lot of regular interaction with both of them."" In June 2017, when Mr Trump tweeted that MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski was ""bleeding badly from a facelift"", Mrs Grisham rushed to defend his remarks. ""When her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder,"" Ms Grisham said in a statement on behalf of Mrs Trump. Last June when Mrs Trump was criticised for her choice of a jacket worn on a trip to a migrant child detention centre in Texas, Ms Grisham quickly lambasted US media for focusing on the first lady's fashion choice.

Last fall, reports circulated that deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel clashed with members of the first lady's staff as Mrs Trump prepared for her first solo trip abroad to Africa. When Mr Trump's team failed to take action, Ms Grisham put out a statement dismissing Mrs Ricardel, without any warning to the administration, according to the Washington Post. ""It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honour of serving in this White House,"" the statement said. Days later, Mrs Ricardel left her post and transitioned to a new role within the administration.

"San Francisco has become the first US city to ban sales of e-cigarettes until their health effects are clearer. Officials on Tuesday voted to ban stores selling the vaporisers and made it illegal for online retailers to deliver to addresses in the city. The Californian city is home to Juul Labs, the most popular e-cigarette producer in the US. Juul said the move would drive smokers back to cigarettes and ""create a thriving black market"". San Francisco's mayor, London Breed, has 10 days to sign off the legislation, but has indicated she will. The law would begin to be enforced seven months from that date, although there have been reports firms could mount a legal challenge. Anti-vaping activists say firms deliberately target young people by offering flavoured products. Not only is more scientific investigation into the health impact needed, critics say, but vaping can encourage young people to switch to cigarettes. E-cigarettes: How safe are they? Juul: The rise of a $38bn e-cigarette phenomenon E-cigarettes 'much better for quitting smoking' E-cigarette use among US teens rises dramatically Vaping - the rise in five charts Earlier this year the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the national regulator, issued proposed guidelines giving companies until 2021 to apply to have their e-cigarette products evaluated. A deadline had initially been set for August 2018, but the agency later said more preparation time was needed. San Francisco's City Attorney, Dennis Herrera, who campaigned for a ban, praised the move and said it was necessary because of an ""abdication of responsibility"" by the FDA in regulating e-cigarettes. This video can not be played Smoking v vaping: Watch lab test results According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of US teenagers who admitted using nicotine products rose about 36% last year, something it attributed to a growth in e-cigarette use. Under federal law, the minimum age to buy tobacco products is 18 years, although in California and several other states it is 21. Juul previously said it supported cutting vaping among young people but only in conjunction with tougher measures to stop them accessing regular cigarettes. The company's small device, just longer than a flash drive, has about 70% of the US vaping market. San Francisco's ban would ""drive former adult smokers who successfully switched to vapor products back to deadly cigarettes"", said Juul spokesman Ted Kwong. It would also stop adult smokers switching and create a ""thriving black market"". ""We have already taken the most aggressive actions in the industry to keep our products out of the hands of those underage and are taking steps to do more."" Traditional tobacco products will ""remain untouched by this legislation, even though they kill 40,000 Californians every year,"" he said. Juul, 35%-owned by Marlboro maker Altria Group, has already withdrawn popular flavours such as mango and cucumber from retail stores and closed its social media channels on Instagram and Facebook.

"Up to 20 million manufacturing jobs around the world could be replaced by robots by 2030, according to analysis firm Oxford Economics. People displaced from those jobs are likely to find that comparable roles in the services sector have also been squeezed by automation, the firm said. However, increasing automation will also boost jobs and economic growth, it added. The firm called for action to prevent a damaging increase in income inequality. Each new industrial robot wipes out 1.6 manufacturing jobs, the firm said, with the least-skilled regions being more affected. Regions where more people have lower skills, which tend to have weaker economies and higher unemployment rates anyway, are much more vulnerable to the loss of jobs due to robots, Oxford Economics said. Moreover, workers who move out of manufacturing, tend to get new jobs in transport, construction, maintenance, and office and administration work - which in turn are vulnerable to automation, it said. On average, each additional robot installed in those lower-skilled regions could lead to nearly twice as many job losses as those in higher-skilled regions of the same country, exacerbating economic inequality and political polarisation, which is growing already, Oxford Economics said. We've seen plenty of predictions that robots are about to put everyone, from factory workers to journalists, out of a job, with white collar work suddenly vulnerable to automation. But this report presents a more nuanced view, stressing that the productivity benefits from automation should boost growth, meaning as many jobs are created as lost. And while it sees the robots moving out of the factories and into service industries, it's still in manufacturing that the report says they will have the most impact, particularly in China where armies of workers could be replaced by machines. Where service jobs are under threat, they are in industries such as transport or construction rather than the law or journalism and it's lower-skilled people who may have moved from manufacturing who are vulnerable. The challenge for governments is how to encourage the innovation that the robots promise while making sure they don't cause new divides in society. Oxford Economics also found the more repetitive the job, the greater the risk of its being wiped out. Jobs which require more compassion, creativity or social intelligence are more likely to continue to be carried out by humans ""for decades to come"", it said. The firm called on policymakers, business leaders, workers, and teachers to think about how to develop workforce skills to adapt to growing automation. About 1.7 million manufacturing jobs have already been lost to robots since 2000, including 400,000 in Europe, 260,000 in the US, and 550,000 in China, it said. The firm predicted that China will have the most manufacturing automation, with as many as 14 million industrial robots by 2030. In the UK, several hundreds of thousands of jobs could be replaced, it added. However, if there was a 30% rise in robot installations worldwide, that would create $5 trillion in additional global GDP, it estimated. At a global level, jobs will be created at the rate they are destroyed, it said.

"Victims of so-called revenge porn could be given better protection as part of a review of image-based sexual abuse laws, the government has announced. Campaigners have been calling for victims to have the same protection of anonymity as other sexual offences. The Law Commission will examine the legislation around the sharing of explicit images without consent. Sophie Mortimer, from the Revenge Porn helpline, said she would encourage a move to make it a sexual offence. Sharing explicit images without consent became an offence in England and Wales in April 2015, with similar laws introduced later in Northern Ireland and Scotland. 'I was blamed for my revenge porn' Revenge porn laws 'not fit for purpose' What to do if you're a victim It is currently categorised as a ""communications crime"", meaning victims are not granted anonymity as other victims of sexual abuse are.

The government has said the review, to be ""launched shortly"", will consider the case for granting automatic anonymity to such victims, so they cannot be named publicly, as is the case for victims of sexual offences. The review will also take in ""cyber-flashing"" - when people receive unsolicited sexual images on their phone - and ""deepfake"" pornography, which is the practice of superimposing an individual's face on to pornographic photos or videos without consent.

"Donald Trump signed an executive order for new sanctions against Iran on Monday Donald Trump has lashed out at the ""ignorant and insulting statement"" released by Iran after the US president announced fresh sanctions against the Middle Eastern nation. The tweets came after Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said the move proved the White House was ""mentally disabled"". Mr Trump said it showed Iran's leaders ""do not understand reality"". He unveiled the sanctions on Monday, saying they were a response to recent ""aggressive behaviour"" by Iran. The sanctions target a number of individuals, notably Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who Mr Trump said was ""ultimately responsible for the hostile conduct of the regime"". The US has alleged Ayatollah Khamenei has access to vast wealth which helps fund the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC). In a 2018 op-ed,US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested it was as much as $95bn (Â£75bn),externaland was ""used as a slush fund for the IRGC"". But Mr Rouhani questioned why the US would single out a man who he said only ""owns a Hoseyniyyeh [prayer venue] and a simple house"", calling the sanctions ""outrageous and idiotic"". This video can not be played Iran's president says the US is lying about wanting dialogue He also said it suggested the US is lying about wanting dialogue. But Mr Trump said the only thing Iran understood was ""strength and power, and the USA is by far the most powerful military force in the world"". ""Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force,"",externalhe added in a tweet. ""In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration."" Some analysts said the sanctions were largely symbolic, although the US treasury department said the measures would lock up billions of dollars in assets. Mr Trump said the measures would deny Ayatollah Khamenei, his office, and those closely affiliated with him, access to key financial resources and support. This video can not be played President Trump: ""The assets of Ayatollah Khamenei and his office will not be spared"" The treasury also said it was also imposing sanctions on eight senior commanders of the IRGC's navy, air force, and ground forces,external, including the head of an air force unit that the US said had orderedthe shooting down of a US surveillance dronelast week. Who is Ayatollah Ali Khamenei? Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif - who was the country's top negotiator on the nuclear deal - would be targeted later this week, it added. Tensions have increased steadily since May 2018, when Mr Trump abandoned the landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and began reinstating sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Last month, Iran scaled back some of its commitments under the deal, including on the amount of low enriched uranium it is allowed to stockpile, after Mr Trump ended exemptions from US secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil. On Tuesday - after Mr Trump's tweets - Iran's deputy foreign minister said ""with attention to the promises that have not been carried out from the European side"", it had no reason left to carry out its nuclear deal commitments unilaterally, Iran previously announcedthe stockpile limit would be breached on 27 June, and it plans to announce further reductions in its commitments on 7 July. Tensions have manifested themselves in other ways, including the shooting down of the US drone over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran said it had violated its airspace; the US insisted it was over international waters. The US has also accused Iran of being behindtwo sets of explosions that have damaged six oil tankers in the region, through which a fifth of the world's oil passes each day. Iran has rejected the allegation. Despite this, Mr Trump insisted he was willing to start negotiations on a new nuclear accord that would also see Iran agree to curb its ballistic missile programme and end what he calls its ""malign"" activities in the Middle East. ""If they don't want to, that's fine too. But we would love to be able to. And, frankly, they might as well do it soon,"" he said.

"Carcasses at the farms were left to rot for days, Animal Equality UK said Chickens reared to supply major retailers are being kept in ""horrifying conditions"" on giant farms, an animal rights group has claimed. Animal Equality UK said it uncovered ""extreme suffering"" at three Moy Park farms in Lincolnshire while carrying out a covert investigation. The charity said carcasses were ""left to rot for days"". Moy Park, which supplies products to supermarkets including Sainsbury's and Tesco, said it was investigating. Investigators for the charity said they visited the farms on multiple occasions between February and April this year, entering through open doors and carrying out covert filming at night. They said many of the birds were found with severe leg injuries, with some unable to stand. ""These birds were clearly suffering and should have been culled before they reached this advanced state of suffering,"" the group said. Footage released by the charity also claims to show dead birds among the flocks at all three farms. ""Some of these carcasses had clearly been there for some time, bringing into question whether the required twice daily flock checks were indeed being carried out,"" it added. Conditions at the farms were described as ""utterly dismal"" Campaigners said they also found an accumulation of faeces and many of the birds were panting and had reddened skin at the rear. Animal Equality UK executive director Dr Toni Vernelli said the investigation found birds being kept in ""utterly dismal conditions"", with up to 30,000 birds to a shed. A spokesperson for Moy Park, which is one of the largest suppliers of poultry products in the UK, said: ""We have a zero-tolerance attitude toward anything that jeopardises the health and welfare of our birds and we are fully investigating these allegations. ""We have robust processes in place to carefully monitor the welfare conditions for our birds and we have regular independent audits, taking corrective action with our farming partners if required."" Latest news and updates from Lincolnshire 'Sickening' pig abuse trio avoid jail Farmhand punched and kicked calves In a statement, Sainsbury's said: ""All our suppliers are expected to meet our high welfare standards and we are investigating this footage."" A Tesco spokesperson said: ""We have strong procedures in place to ensure the welfare of the animals in our supply chain. ""We are working closely with our supplier to fully investigate this."" According to the group, some birds had reddened skin at the rear while others were unable to stand All three farms are certified by the Red Tractor farm-approval scheme, which requires produce to be ""traceable, safe and farmed with care"". Ms Vernelli said: ""Images of distressed birds in giant double-decker sheds will be a shock to many consumers who buy British, Red Tractor-certified meat thinking they can trust its animal welfare standards. ""Yet the truth is, the unnatural conditions chickens are forced to endure in these vast sheds are utterly dismal."" According to the charity, none of the farms had perches inside the sheds, violating Red Tractor's requirements. A spokesperson for Red Tractor said: ""Our own routine auditing of these farms had identified some breaches to our high standards, and we have been working with them to ensure they put the necessary processes in place for them to remain Red Tractor-certified."" Breaches found at one of the farms have already been resolved, while the other two are still within their 28 days to fully comply, they added.

"Tesco has tried to resolve a condiment conundrum in one of its ready meals. Customer Matthew Stock did not mince his words when he tweeted Tesco asking it to explain a best before date of 20140 on a sachet of burger relish. The chain responded saying the date code on the relish included with two beef burgers was the ""Julian date"". Translated into the Gregorian calendar, the most commonly used calendar in the world, 20140 would be 20 May 2020, Tesco tweeted. However, adding to the confusion, the Julian date 20140 actually corresponds to 19 May 2020, the 140th day of 2020, not 20 May. The Julian date is used in some fields, including astronomy and the food industry, to calculate the days which have passed between two events, for example between a food production date and a best before date. It is not based on the historical Julian calendar, which predated use of the Gregorian calendar in the UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Stock bought the Tesco own label meal which contained two burgers, two buns, two cheese slices and the sachet of relish. He tweeted the supermarket, saying: ""Hello there Tesco, could you please explain this expiry date please?"" Tesco employee Maggie replied: ""The date code on the relish only is the Julian date. 20140 is the 140th day. This translated into the Gregorian calendar is the 20th May 2020."" Matthew Stock tweeted back: ""Are you serious? Surely that's not a legitimate way of dating products?"" Maggie responded: ""Hi Matthew, I fully agree with you. If I had received this myself I wouldn't have known what this meant. What I can do is pass this through to my support team to ask why they date it this way. I'll come back to you asap."" A Tesco spokesman told the BBC: ""The Julian date code is used by our supplier for internal traceability purposes. The standard best before date is printed on the outside of the main packaging. ""We're sorry if any of our customers got in a pickle about this and we have relished the chance to put the record straight. ""All food manufacturers are legally required to stamp a best before or a use-by date on their products. Best-before dates are indicators of the quality of the food item, use-by dates are about their safety. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) pointed out the date on the relish shown in the tweet was ""best before end"" and ""is about quality not safety"". In a statement the FSA said: ""The outer pack should have a use-by date or best-before date, this would be the date consumers would be expected to follow for the product as a whole.""

"This video can not be played Lisa Quarrell is worried she will face a child protection probe A Scottish mum who admitted smuggling cannabis oil into the country to give to her six-year-old son has been visited by police. Lisa Quarrell, a former police officer, brought the medicine into the country illegally to treat her son Cole who has a rare form of epilepsy. She fears she is now facing child protection proceedings as a result. ""It's terrifying"", she said. ""But there was no choice as far as I was concerned."" Cole Thompson has had brain surgery and tried many anti-epileptic drugs. A bad day for him could mean up to 16 seizures, most of which would happen at night. But he had not responded to existing drugs. In a BBC documentary, his mother Lisasaid she had smuggled a cannabis medicine containing the ingredient THC- the part of the plant that produces a high - into the country from Holland after getting a prescription from a doctor there. She spent thousands of pounds bringing the drug back illegally but her son is now being prescribed cannabis oil legally by a private London hospital. Cole had brain surgery at the age of two to try to stop the seizures Since giving Cole the oil, Lisa has reported a marked improvement in his condition. Although medicines containing THC can be prescribed in the UK, doctors are largely refusing to do so, saying there is not enough evidence they are safe or work. Lisa, from East Kilbride, has been visited by the police who have requested access to her son's medical records. She now faces the prospect of child protection proceedings. ""The police said I had taken an unorthodox approach and they would have to clarify whether there was any criminal element or child protection issue for my kid,"" she told BBC Scotland. Lisa was asked to sign a mandate that allowed the police to start an investigation and permitted them to contact Cole's doctors and any clinical professionals that were involved with him. ""I agreed because if I didn't it would just go straight to a child protection investigation,"" she said. The police have since asked for information and reports from the private hospital where Lisa now gets Cole's medication. A Police Scotland spokesman told BBC Scotland the case had been fully investigated and it had been established that there was no criminality. However, he said he could not comment on whether child protection proceedings were under way. Lisa said she had been told in October that there was ""no good outcome"" for Cole and in March she was told that doctors ""didn't know how to fix him"". ""The fact that I've gone down a different route of alternative medicine and got him fixed, I can't understand why people wouldn't be wanting to know more about it and ask me questions rather than criminalising me and demonising me for saving my son's life,"" she said. Lisa said she had decided to go public with her situation so her family had the chance of a normal life ""I'm now going to have education, social services, heath, the police all over my life. Social services can now do spot checks in my house to make sure I'm doing what needs to be done for my kids. ""I don't have anything to hide. But it's still not nice. I've hardly slept."" Lisa said she decided to go public with her situation so her family had the chance of a normal life. ""What was my alternative?,"" she said ""Live like this for the rest of my life? Hide? Scared every time the door goes?"" Speaking about her decision to smuggle the cannabis oil, she said: ""There was no choice as far as I was concerned. It was either let my son die or take it into my own hands and fix him while they [NHS and politicians] sort out the red tape. ""I'm not going to stop. Out of everybody, the only people that are not financially gaining from the cannabis is the parents, but we get nothing that money could buy which is our kids back. So for that reason I won't stop."" Monica Lennon said the NHS and Scottish government needed to ""pull together"" on the issue Central Scotland MSP Monica Lennon has given her support to Lisa. ""This is not a good use of police time,"" she said. ""Lisa is a loving, caring mother who has had to fight every step of the way for Cole. ""I can understand why parents would go to desperate lengths to make sure their child's life is prolonged. ""Parents like Lisa are doing their very best for their children. ""We really need the Scottish government and the NHS to pull together on this and make sure that children like Cole get access to medicinal cannabis.""

"The fire brigade were called out to rescue people who had been stranded at the flooded Stirling Rugby Club Fourteen people were rescued by boat from Stirling County Rugby Club after torrential thundery downpours affected the area. Stirling fire and rescue service's water rescue unit was called out at about 20:45 on Monday. No-one was injured. Flash flooding affected many roads in Stirling and Edinburgh. In Stirling, Castleview Primary and Wallace High schools were closed due to severe flooding. Stirling Council said there were ""early indications"" that Wallace High School would reopen on Wednesday. This video can not be played Edinburgh flooding: Rising water causes chaos Stirling's Tesco superstore was forced to close after water poured in through the shops's roof. Store bosses said on Monday it would be shut until further notice, but it re-opened on Tuesday afternoon. Edinburgh and Stirling had been hit with flash flooding and thunder with one man stranded on a car roof. One road in Stirling was deep enough with flowing water to create an improvised water slide. This video can not be played There was enough flowing water on this Stirling street to create an improvised water slide. Heavy rain led to disruption in the west of the capital across Bankhead, Clermiston and Corstorphine. Earlier Edinburgh Trams suspended some services until water had subsided from the tracks and advised passengers to use buses instead. The MP for Edinburgh West, Christine Jardine, posted footage of water lapping up the front of her constituency office on St John's Road. She advised people in the area to stay safe and to alert the emergency services if they were affected by flooding. Flooding forced the closure of MP Christine Jardine's office Ms Jardine said: ""The water appears to have gone down as quick as it rose - but we're hearing terrible stories about people in other parts on top of cars. ""I'm worried about people coming home to flooded homes. The first thing we did was put the electricity off - if it gets into the wiring it can be dangerous. ""We've had heavy thunder from around 13:00 and I think the drains couldn't cope as we're at the foot of the hill."" Police advised motorists to take care and use alternative routes where possible.

"Kirsty Noble's 'casualty' was actually boyfriend Sam Main A lifeboat crew member went to the aid of a ""dummy"" during a training exercise - only to be stunned with a marriage proposal. The RNLI team in Aberdeen had helped disguise Kirsty Noble's boyfriend Sam Main as the ""casualty"" during the training at the city's Fishmarket Quay. When Kirsty went to help, he got up onto one knee and brought out an engagement ring. He then popped the question - and Kirsty said yes. That was met with cheering and applause from the entire lifeboat crew. Sam got onto one knee for the proposal Kirsty said: ""Surprised is an understatement - it was an amazing occasion and to spend it with my best friends was very special."" Sam said: ""It was an amazing day and I'm delighted that she said yes. ""A lot of planning went into the day so I'm so happy that it all went to plan. ""I'm really grateful to the whole RNLI team for all their help in making it possible."" Kirsty said yes to the unexpected offer Lifeboat coxswain Davie Orr said: ""Aberdeen's volunteer lifeboat crew is a very close-knit team.

"Mr Johnson has said the public expects Brexit promises to be honoured Boris Johnson has called on his Conservative leadership rival Jeremy Hunt to commit to leaving the EU on 31 October ""deal or no deal"". Mr Johnson said the two men should agree that the revised Brexit deadline must be met ""no matter what"" in order to keep promises to the British people. Mr Hunt has suggested he could seek extra time if he was close to getting a better deal but was not quite there. The two are vying to succeed Theresa May, with the result due on 23 July. The deadline for Brexit was pushed back to 31 October after MPs rejected the deal Mrs May agreed with the EU three times. In an interview with Talk Radio, one of a series of media and public appearances, Mr Johnson said he would stick to that date ""come what may, do or die"". Johnson defends Brexit plan and 'row' silence Johnson tax plan 'would benefit wealthy' In an effort to turn the pressure up on his rival, Mr Johnson later tweeted a copy of a letter he had written to Mr Hunt insisting this was the ""central question"" of the contest. ""Leaving on 31st October - with no ifs, buts or maybes - is the only way to restore trust in our democracy. In short this is about whether the original people's vote will be respected.""

Like Mr Johnson, Mr Hunt has also promised to renegotiate Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement, particularly focusing on the controversial Irish backstop. He has said he would back a no-deal exit as a last resort but he has hinted he might ask for more time beyond 31 October if necessary to get an improved deal. Committing to a deadline that might come too soon to allow a proper negotiation risks triggering a general election and the ""political suicide"" of the Conservatives, Mr Hunt has said. Responding to his rival's letter, Mr Hunt suggested Mr Johnson was afraid of debating the issue face to face. Sky News was forced to scrap a planned debate later on Tuesday after Mr Johnson refused to attend, leading Mr Hunt's team to accuse his rival of ""bottling it"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Johnson has struggled to explain in detail how he will get the EU and MPs on side in time to enable the UK to leave with a deal on Halloween. But on a visit to the Wisley Gardens in Surrey, he insisted there was a ""new dynamic"" in place in Brussels and London since last month's European elections - which saw a surge in support for populist anti-EU parties - and there was ""goodwill"" on both sides to do a deal. Mr Johnson belatedly hit the campaign trail on Tuesday He stopped off at a butchers in Oxshott He insisted getting rid of the backstop - the insurance policy designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - was a precondition to a renegotiated agreement even though the EU has ruled this out on many occasions. He suggested he would be willing to ""suspend"" the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" the UK has agreed to pay the EU until he had secured commitments on trade and the border. Pressed over why the EU would agree to this, the former Mayor of London said ""what I bring is the ability to change the equation"". However, he conceded his plan to maintain frictionless trade with the continent after Brexit throughArticle 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)would require the approval of the rest of the EU and could not happen unilaterally. This was reiterated by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox - a backer of Mr Hunt - who wrote in a letter to one of his constituents that Article 24 ""would not, by itself, allow the UK to maintain tariff-free trade with the EU in the absence of a negotiated agreement"". ""It is important that public debate on this topic is conducted on the basis of fact rather than supposition, so that we are able to make decisions in the best interests of our country,"" he wrote. Watch in full: Johnson talks to Laura Kuenssberg After days of criticism that he was hiding away, Mr Johnson undertook a succession of media and public appearances and met members of the public in a walkabout in Surrey. But he continued declined to answer questions about Friday's row with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds. There has been speculation about whether a picture of the couple sitting happily in a beer garden, which appeared in Monday's newspapers, was actually taken over the weekend as much of the initial coverage implied. Mr Johnson said he was not responsible for what pictures newspapers published Asked during an interview with LBC whether the picture was actually much older, Mr Johnson repeatedly refused to comment on its ""antiquity or provenance"" and said the persistent line of questioning was ""farcical"". Mr Johnson has also raised eyebrows by making a series of uncosted spending pledges. Areas ranging from social care and schools to infrastructure and broadband are all set for investment if he becomes prime minister, Mr Johnson has said. He also said he would prioritise reducing the tax burden on those on lower incomes, by raising National Insurance thresholds, ahead of other measures. He has faced criticism for proposing to also increase the level at which people pay the higher rate of income tax from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000, a move which financial experts have said would cost billions and favour the top 8% of earners.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: 'I am trustworthy' Jeremy Hunt has said the next prime minister should be someone who is trustworthy, otherwise the UK risks a general election and no Brexit. In an interview with the BBC, the foreign secretary said the ability to negotiate a new Brexit deal ""is about the personality of the prime minister"". ""I do believe I can be trusted to deliver this deal,"" he said. Mr Hunt said he would leave the EU without a deal, but not if there was a ""prospect of a better deal"". He and Boris Johnson are competing to take over from Theresa May, with the winner of the contest due to enter Number 10 on 24 July. In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Hunt said he and Mr Johnson both wanted to change the Brexit deal negotiated by Mrs May - and their aspirations for the substance of a new deal were similar. But, he said: ""The judgement is - who is the person we trust as prime minister to go to Brussels and bring back that deal? ""If you choose someone where there is no trust, there's going to be no negotiation, no deal and quite possibly a general election - which can mean we have no Brexit either."" Mrs May's deal has been rejected three times by MPs, but Mr Hunt said he believed that there was a better ""deal to be done"" with Brussels and he was the man to get it. ""We've had a lot of discussion about how, but we need to have more of a discussion about who."" Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? In full: Jeremy Hunt interview Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Who chooses the next PM? When asked whether he was implying that rival Mr Johnson was untrustworthy, he said he would ""never"" make those comments about a colleague. ""No, I'm saying I am trustworthy and I believe that I can be trusted to deliver that deal,"" he added. He said if Mr Johnson became prime minister he would serve him to the ""best of my ability"" and he hoped Mr Johnson ""would do the same as me"". Mr Johnson told the BBC on Monday that anyone questioning his character was ""talking absolute nonsense"". This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt says he is the right man to negotiate a new deal At the moment the UK is leaving the EU on 31 October, after the date was twice extended from 29 March. Mr Johnson has insisted he will leave by that date ""deal or no deal"" and challenged his opponent to do the same. But Mr Hunt called the date a ""fake deadline"" that could ""trip us into a general election and hand the keys to Jeremy Corbyn and we will have no Brexit at all"". He said that while he was prepared to leave without a deal, he would not pursue a no-deal Brexit if there was ""a prospect of a better deal"" within reach. ""What Theresa May tried to do was a deal involving the backstop,"" he said, referring to the controversial policy that aims to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. ""I was in cabinet at the time and I supported her loyally, but I never thought that was the right approach. ""What I'm talking about is a deal that doesn't involve the backstop as it's constituted, so it would be different."" Compare the candidates Johnson's 'deal or no deal' challenge to Hunt No-deal Brexit: What you need to know When asked how he would solve the issue of the Irish border without the backstop, he said he would pursue a ""technology-led solution"". He said he believed the government would ""know very soon, well before 31 October"" whether a new deal could be negotiated, and based on that, he would make a decision about whether or not to pursue no deal instead. The EU has repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, and has rejected the idea that technology could overcome the potential Irish border issues. Jeremy Hunt is the underdog in this race and where does he see an opportunity to change that? Well, by talking about character. He knows very well that many Tory members, many MPs, many members of the public, have real doubts about whether or not Boris Johnson is suitable to take the reins at Number 10. And although Mr Hunt tried very hard to deny it - he said he was not suggesting Mr Johnson was actually untrustworthy - it was very telling that he chose again and again to emphasise he is the one to trust - and only if someone you can trust is in charge is there a possibility of getting a revised Brexit deal. He clearly is determined to push and push again at the doubts that are in some people's minds about the suitability, the temperament and the character of the frontrunner in this race. Clearly, they are very different political characters - one the showman, one wanting to pitch himself as the steady hand. But it's also important to understand we should not let that mask the fact that there isn't a vast amount of difference between what they are both promising on the EU. And both men's proposals for how they get us out of the Brexit mess are based on suggestions the European Union has turned down on many occasions. Mr Hunt also set out his policy on social care in the interview, suggesting a system of automatic contributions towards costs where people are rewarded for ""doing the right thing"". He said councils did need more money for social care and people wanted to know that as they get older ""they're going to be properly looked after"". ""So I think there is a bit of public money, but it's also about personal responsibility,"" he said. ""I think we should be a country where people save for their social care costs, particularly those last few months, possibly years, of their life when things can be very uncomfortable, very painful, just in the same way they save for their pension. ""And I think it can be something that people can opt out of, but it should be an automatic thing."" The Tory leadership contender was also quizzed on his view that the legal time limit for an abortion should be reduced from 24 weeks to 12. He said there were ""very strong views"" on ""all sides"" of the debate, but as health secretary he ""did not seek to change the law"" and it ""will be the same as prime minister"". He said if there was a vote on legal time limits brought to Parliament, it would be ""a matter of conscience"". Would obscure trade rule help with no-deal Brexit? 'Don't be a coward,' Hunt tells Johnson Hunt rules out change to abortion law On his ambitions to be prime minister, he said he had been ""waiting for this moment for 30 years of my life"". ""I have been sitting around that cabinet table thinking how I want to transform our country,"" he said. ""I think this is a moment, when I look at Brexit and this incredible moment in our history, when we could really unleash our potential and that's what gets me up in the morning."" Asked what it was, 30 years ago, that inspired him, he joked: ""I won't say that. I think if I say that it's really going to put people off. ""But look, I would love to do this job, I think I can make a difference. ""I think this is a moment where if we send the right person, we can't just solve Brexit, we can open a whole new chapter in our history, an exciting chapter. That's what I want to do."" Having completed a Q&A session, Jeremy Hunt tweeted he would be enjoying some cold pizza A debate on Sky News between the two leadership hopefuls was cancelled, after Mr Johnson declined to take part. Mr Hunt instead used the time on Monday evening for a Q&A on Twitter. Replying to a question on student loans he said he would look again at the repayments process adding he could not ""justify 6% interest rates"". He also said that in housing policy he would introduce a ""Right to Own"" scheme aimed at helping young people to buy a house. The cabinet minister used the question session to display a lighter side, comparing himself to 1970s sitcom character Basil Fawlty and joking that he was getting ""useful ideas"" from the notoriously brutal TV show Game of Thrones.

"Boris Johnson's tax proposals would cost ""many billions"" and benefit the wealthy the most, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Mr Johnson, the front-runner in the race to lead the Conservative Party, has outlined plans to raise the threshold for the higher rate of income tax to Â£80,000. The IFS said only 8% of individuals would gain in the short run. Changes to national insurance would help lower earners, the IFS said. Under Mr Johnson's proposals: the higher rate of tax would be paid on earnings over Â£80,000 (rather than the current threshold of Â£50,000) the point at which workers start paying national insurance contributions would rise, although a new threshold was not specified ""These are expensive pledges to cut tax [which] between them will cost many billions of pounds"", said Tom Waters, research economist at the IFS and co-author of the report. ""It is not clear that spending such sums on tax cuts is compatible with both ending austerity in public spending and prudent management of the public finances,"" he added. Following the financial crisis government spending was curtailed in order to reduce borrowing, but the government has recently signalled an easing of austerity. Mr Johnson's campaign team did not respond to an approach for comment on the IFS report. But earlier this monthhe told the Telegraph,externalhe would fund the income tax cuts partly by using money that had been set aside by the Treasury for a possible no-deal Brexit. ""We should be raising thresholds of income tax so that we help the huge numbers that have been captured in the higher rate by fiscal drag,"" Mr Johnson said. However during the televised leadership debate he described the tax plan as ""an ambition"" rather than a fixed policy. On Monday,in an interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson addressed questions over Britain's exit from the EU. The IFS said raising the threshold for the higher rate of tax would take around two and half million people out of the top income tax bracket and cost about Â£9bn. Top earners would gain an average of nearly Â£2,500 a year, the IFS said. But while in the short run only 8% of the population were set to benefit, more people would move into the Â£50,000 to Â£80,000 bracket as time went on and would enjoy a lower rate of tax as a result, it said. The numbers of those falling into the higher tax bracket had ""crept up"" over time, so that there are currently more than four million higher rate taxpayers, compared with one and a half million 30 years ago, the IFS said. Johnson defends Brexit plan and 'row' silence Who gets to choose the UK's next prime minister? Scale of Brexit task facing future PM Raising the point at which workers start to pay national insurance contributions would help low-earning individuals, the IFS said, although it benefited higher earners as well. The IFS said increases to tax credits would be a more effective way to help low income households. Mr Johnson is running against Jeremy Hunt in a vote by Conservative party members to be chosen as the next Conservative party leader and to take over from Theresa May as prime minister. Mr Hunt has said he is in favour of a plan to cut the tax on company profits from 17% to 12.5% from 2020.

"Tesco has tried to resolve a condiment conundrum in one of its ready meals. Customer Matthew Stock did not mince his words when he tweeted Tesco asking it to explain a best before date of 20140 on a sachet of burger relish. The chain responded saying the date code on the relish included with two beef burgers was the ""Julian date"". Translated into the Gregorian calendar, the most commonly used calendar in the world, 20140 would be 20 May 2020, Tesco tweeted. However, adding to the confusion, the Julian date 20140 actually corresponds to 19 May 2020, the 140th day of 2020, not 20 May. The Julian date is used in some fields, including astronomy and the food industry, to calculate the days which have passed between two events, for example between a food production date and a best before date. It is not based on the historical Julian calendar, which predated use of the Gregorian calendar in the UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Stock bought the Tesco own label meal which contained two burgers, two buns, two cheese slices and the sachet of relish. He tweeted the supermarket, saying: ""Hello there Tesco, could you please explain this expiry date please?"" Tesco employee Maggie replied: ""The date code on the relish only is the Julian date. 20140 is the 140th day. This translated into the Gregorian calendar is the 20th May 2020."" Matthew Stock tweeted back: ""Are you serious? Surely that's not a legitimate way of dating products?"" Maggie responded: ""Hi Matthew, I fully agree with you. If I had received this myself I wouldn't have known what this meant. What I can do is pass this through to my support team to ask why they date it this way. I'll come back to you asap."" A Tesco spokesman told the BBC: ""The Julian date code is used by our supplier for internal traceability purposes. The standard best before date is printed on the outside of the main packaging. ""We're sorry if any of our customers got in a pickle about this and we have relished the chance to put the record straight. ""All food manufacturers are legally required to stamp a best before or a use-by date on their products. Best-before dates are indicators of the quality of the food item, use-by dates are about their safety. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) pointed out the date on the relish shown in the tweet was ""best before end"" and ""is about quality not safety"". In a statement the FSA said: ""The outer pack should have a use-by date or best-before date, this would be the date consumers would be expected to follow for the product as a whole.""

"A house burns in the upmarket Paradise Pines neighbourhood of California in November A UN expert has warned of a possible ""climate apartheid"", where the rich pay to escape from hunger, ""while the rest of the world is left to suffer"". Even if current targets are met, ""millions will be impoverished"", said Philip Alston, the UN's special rapporteur on extreme poverty. He also criticised steps taken by UN bodies as ""patently inadequate"". ""Ticking boxes will not save humanity or the planet from impending disaster,"" Mr Alston warned. The Australian native is part of the UN's panel of independent experts, and submitted his report â which is based on existing research â to the UN Human Rights Council on Monday. A key warning was that the world's poor are likely to be hardest hit by rising temperatures - and the potential food shortages and conflict that could accompany such a change. Developing nations are expected to suffer at least 75% of the costs of climate change â despite the fact that the poorer half of the world's population generate just 10% of emissions This video can not be played How young people feel about effects of pollution and climate change Those ""who have contributed the least to emissions... will be the most harmed,"" he said, warning that the effects could undo 50 years of progress on poverty reduction. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Stripes strike chord on global warming Spy satellites reveal rapid Himalayan glacier melt On the other hand, Mr Alston cites examples of how the wealthy in Western nations already cope with extreme weather events. When Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, most citizens were left without power, yet ""the Goldman Sachs headquarters was protected by tens of thousands of its own sandbags and power from its generator."" Similarly, ""private white-glove firefighters have been dispatched to save the mansions"" of the wealthy. This ""over-reliance"" on the private sector would likely lead to what he termed ""climate apartheid"" â where the rich ""escape overheating, hunger, and conflict"". As far back as 2007,the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the ""poorest of the poor in the world... are going to be the worst hit"".,external Mr Alston's report heavily criticises the lack of action, despite such warnings, over the past several decades. ""Sombre speeches by government officials at regular conferences are not leading to meaningful action,"" Mr Alston wrote in a scathing put-down of current policy. ""Thirty years of conventions appear to have done very little."" This video can not be played Why are governments taking so long to take action on climate change? Among those coming in for criticism are Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, for opening up the rainforest to mining, and ""weakening"" environmental protections. US President Donald Trump also comes under fire â for placing ""former lobbyists in oversight roles"", ""actively silencing and obfuscating climate science"", and also rolling back environmental protections. Trump UN pick: Climate change 'poses real risks' Climate protesters storm coalmine in Germany Yet Mr Alston's scorn is not only for politicians, but also for the UN Human Rights Council to which he submitted the report. ""The Human Rights Council can no longer afford to rely only on the time-honoured techniques of organizing expert panels, calling for reports that lead nowhere, urging others to do more but doing little itself, and adopting wide-ranging but inconclusive and highly aspirational resolutions,"" he wrote. Instead, it must commission an urgent expert study on the possible options available to avert disaster, and ""propose and monitor specific actions"", Mr Alston said. There may also be wider societal implications. The International Organisation for Migration warned in a 2014 report that estimates for migration as a result of climate change vary wildly â from about 25 million to one billion people by 2050. Mr Alston's report contains one estimate of 140 million displaced people in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America alone. This video can not be played The women too scared to have children due to climate change Democracy, he warned, could also be at risk as governments struggle to make major changes to cope. ""The human rights community, with a few notable exceptions, has been every bit as complacent as most governments in the face of the ultimate challenge to mankind represented by climate change,"" the report said. He said that the entire human rights community had failed ""to face up to the fact that human rights might not survive the coming upheaval"".

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson on Brexit, privacy and his character Boris Johnson has admitted he would need EU co-operation to avoid a hard Irish border or the possibility of crippling tariffs on trade in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In an exclusive interview with the BBC, the favourite to be the next PM said: ""It's not just up to us."" But he said he did ""not believe for a moment"" the UK would leave without a deal, although he was willing to do so. Asked about a row he'd had with his partner, he said it was ""simply unfair"" to involve ""loved ones"" in the debate. Reports of the argument on Friday with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, dominated headlines over the weekend after the police were called to their address in London. The interview comes afterSky News said it would have to cancel a head-to-head debateon Tuesday between the two leadership contenders as Mr Johnson had ""so far declined"" to take part. Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Who chooses the next PM? Johnson tax plan 'would benefit wealthy' Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd told Radio 4's Today programme she found Mr Johnson's decision to ignore live TV debates ""very odd"" and urged him ""to reconsider"". Following days of criticism that he has been avoiding media scrutiny, Mr Johnson has given a number of other interviews, including with LBC and Talk Radio. On LBC, he was repeatedly challenged on his personal life and a photograph which showed him and his partner. Asked whether his campaign was behind the release of the picture, Mr Johnson refused to answer. He told Talk Radio's political editor Ross Kempsell he would ""not rest"" until the UK had left the EU, insisting Brexit would happen on 31 October ""come what may... do or die"". Meanwhile, the other candidate, Jeremy Hunt haspromised to boost defence spending by Â£15bnover the next five years if he becomes prime minister. In his interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Johnson said the existing deal negotiated by Theresa May ""is dead"". He insisted it was possible to broker a new deal with the EU before the end of October because the political landscape had changed in the UK and on the continent. ""I think actually that politics has changed so much since 29 March,"" he said, referring to the original Brexit deadline. ""I think on both sides of the Channel there's a really different understanding of what is needed."" Watch Laura Kuenssberg's interview in full Read the full transcript Compare the candidates Would obscure trade rule help with no-deal Brexit? At the moment, the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October after the PM's Brexit deal was rejected three times by Parliament, and the EU has previously said the withdrawal agreement reached with the UK cannot be reopened. Mr Johnson said he would be able to persuade Brussels to resolve the Irish border issue - a key sticking point - despite repeated warnings from EU leaders that that was impossible. He said there were ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" that could be made to avoid border checks. When challenged that these did not exist yet, Mr Johnson replied: ""Well, they do actually... in very large measure they do, you have trusted trader schemes, all sorts of schemes that you could put into place."" But, he admitted, there was ""no single magic bullet"" to solve the issue. Mr Johnson's really controversial gamble is to say he could do a new trade deal with EU leaders before the end of October. And he says he would be able to do that before resolving the most controversial conundrum - how you fix the dilemma over the Irish border. He clearly believes he has the political skill to pull that off. He and his supporters would say that is a plan. But it is a plan that is full of ifs and buts - either heroic or foolhardy assumptions to imagine that EU leaders and Parliament would be ready to back his vision - and back it by Halloween - on an extremely tight deadline. The political pressure is on, not just to get it done quickly, but done in a way that does not harm our relations with the rest of the world and the livelihoods of people living in this country. In terms of the controversies over his personal life, it is absolutely clear even now - when he is on the threshold of No 10 - that Boris Johnson thinks there are questions he simply does not have to answer. And for a politician about whose character many people have their doubts, that is going to follow him around unless and until he is willing to give more. Mr Johnson said if he was elected he would start new talks as soon as he reached Downing Street to discuss a free trade agreement. He also said he hoped the EU would be willing to grant a period of time where the status quo was maintained for a deal to be finalised after Brexit. He called this ""an implementation period"", but accepted this was not the same as the implementation period in the current draft treaty agreed with the EU. 'Don't be a coward,' Hunt tells Johnson Neighbour defends Johnson row recording Is it OK to tell someone to 'man up'? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Mr Johnson committed to passing new laws as soon as possible in order to guarantee the rights of EU citizens living in the UK. The former foreign secretary also suggested EU leaders might change their attitude to renegotiation because they had Brexit Party MEPs they did not want in their Parliament, and wanted to get the Â£39bn that had been promised as part of the so-called divorce bill. And he said MPs could be more willing to back a revised deal because - after disappointing local and European elections last month - they realised both Labour and the Conservatives would face ""real danger of extinction"" if Brexit were to be stalled again. Mr Johnson refused again to give more detail of what happened at his home in the early hours of Friday. ""I do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones,"" he said. ""And there's a very good reason for that. That is that, if you do, you drag them into things that really is... not fair on them."" Instead of his private life, he said the public actually want to know ""what is going on with this guy?"" ""Does he, when it comes to trust, when it comes to character, all those things, does he deliver what he says he's going to deliver?"" Despite widespread criticisms from his fellow Conservatives that he cannot be trusted, Mr Johnson said anyone questioning his character was ""talking absolute nonsense"". He also refused to respond to accusations from rival Jeremy Hunt that he was being a ""coward"" for avoiding more head-to-head TV debates, promising that if elected he would ""govern from the centre right"" because the centre ""is where you win"". Ms Rudd, who is supporting Mr Hunt, said Mr Johnson was making a mistake by shying away from the debates and said he needed to ""go further"" in explaining his Brexit plan. ""This is an incredibly difficult situation and Boris needs to explain how he will deal with both sides of the Conservative Party that have concerns and try and break the impasse with the European Union. ""Enthusiasm and optimism is not sufficient."" Respondingto claims that a dozen Tory MPs would be prepared to bring down a governmentheading to a no-deal Brexit, she said: ""I think that's about right. I think it's slightly less than that, but it's certainly more than two.""

"Mr Johnson has said the public expects Brexit promises to be honoured Boris Johnson has called on his Conservative leadership rival Jeremy Hunt to commit to leaving the EU on 31 October ""deal or no deal"". Mr Johnson said the two men should agree that the revised Brexit deadline must be met ""no matter what"" in order to keep promises to the British people. Mr Hunt has suggested he could seek extra time if he was close to getting a better deal but was not quite there. The two are vying to succeed Theresa May, with the result due on 23 July. The deadline for Brexit was pushed back to 31 October after MPs rejected the deal Mrs May agreed with the EU three times. In an interview with Talk Radio, one of a series of media and public appearances, Mr Johnson said he would stick to that date ""come what may, do or die"". Johnson defends Brexit plan and 'row' silence Johnson tax plan 'would benefit wealthy' In an effort to turn the pressure up on his rival, Mr Johnson later tweeted a copy of a letter he had written to Mr Hunt insisting this was the ""central question"" of the contest. ""Leaving on 31st October - with no ifs, buts or maybes - is the only way to restore trust in our democracy. In short this is about whether the original people's vote will be respected.""

Like Mr Johnson, Mr Hunt has also promised to renegotiate Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement, particularly focusing on the controversial Irish backstop. He has said he would back a no-deal exit as a last resort but he has hinted he might ask for more time beyond 31 October if necessary to get an improved deal. Committing to a deadline that might come too soon to allow a proper negotiation risks triggering a general election and the ""political suicide"" of the Conservatives, Mr Hunt has said. Responding to his rival's letter, Mr Hunt suggested Mr Johnson was afraid of debating the issue face to face. Sky News was forced to scrap a planned debate later on Tuesday after Mr Johnson refused to attend, leading Mr Hunt's team to accuse his rival of ""bottling it"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Johnson has struggled to explain in detail how he will get the EU and MPs on side in time to enable the UK to leave with a deal on Halloween. But on a visit to the Wisley Gardens in Surrey, he insisted there was a ""new dynamic"" in place in Brussels and London since last month's European elections - which saw a surge in support for populist anti-EU parties - and there was ""goodwill"" on both sides to do a deal. Mr Johnson belatedly hit the campaign trail on Tuesday He stopped off at a butchers in Oxshott He insisted getting rid of the backstop - the insurance policy designed to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland - was a precondition to a renegotiated agreement even though the EU has ruled this out on many occasions. He suggested he would be willing to ""suspend"" the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" the UK has agreed to pay the EU until he had secured commitments on trade and the border. Pressed over why the EU would agree to this, the former Mayor of London said ""what I bring is the ability to change the equation"". However, he conceded his plan to maintain frictionless trade with the continent after Brexit throughArticle 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)would require the approval of the rest of the EU and could not happen unilaterally. This was reiterated by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox - a backer of Mr Hunt - who wrote in a letter to one of his constituents that Article 24 ""would not, by itself, allow the UK to maintain tariff-free trade with the EU in the absence of a negotiated agreement"". ""It is important that public debate on this topic is conducted on the basis of fact rather than supposition, so that we are able to make decisions in the best interests of our country,"" he wrote. Watch in full: Johnson talks to Laura Kuenssberg After days of criticism that he was hiding away, Mr Johnson undertook a succession of media and public appearances and met members of the public in a walkabout in Surrey. But he continued declined to answer questions about Friday's row with his girlfriend Carrie Symonds. There has been speculation about whether a picture of the couple sitting happily in a beer garden, which appeared in Monday's newspapers, was actually taken over the weekend as much of the initial coverage implied. Mr Johnson said he was not responsible for what pictures newspapers published Asked during an interview with LBC whether the picture was actually much older, Mr Johnson repeatedly refused to comment on its ""antiquity or provenance"" and said the persistent line of questioning was ""farcical"". Mr Johnson has also raised eyebrows by making a series of uncosted spending pledges. Areas ranging from social care and schools to infrastructure and broadband are all set for investment if he becomes prime minister, Mr Johnson has said. He also said he would prioritise reducing the tax burden on those on lower incomes, by raising National Insurance thresholds, ahead of other measures. He has faced criticism for proposing to also increase the level at which people pay the higher rate of income tax from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000, a move which financial experts have said would cost billions and favour the top 8% of earners.

"Boris Johnson's tax proposals would cost ""many billions"" and benefit the wealthy the most, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Mr Johnson, the front-runner in the race to lead the Conservative Party, has outlined plans to raise the threshold for the higher rate of income tax to Â£80,000. The IFS said only 8% of individuals would gain in the short run. Changes to national insurance would help lower earners, the IFS said. Under Mr Johnson's proposals: the higher rate of tax would be paid on earnings over Â£80,000 (rather than the current threshold of Â£50,000) the point at which workers start paying national insurance contributions would rise, although a new threshold was not specified ""These are expensive pledges to cut tax [which] between them will cost many billions of pounds"", said Tom Waters, research economist at the IFS and co-author of the report. ""It is not clear that spending such sums on tax cuts is compatible with both ending austerity in public spending and prudent management of the public finances,"" he added. Following the financial crisis government spending was curtailed in order to reduce borrowing, but the government has recently signalled an easing of austerity. Mr Johnson's campaign team did not respond to an approach for comment on the IFS report. But earlier this monthhe told the Telegraph,externalhe would fund the income tax cuts partly by using money that had been set aside by the Treasury for a possible no-deal Brexit. ""We should be raising thresholds of income tax so that we help the huge numbers that have been captured in the higher rate by fiscal drag,"" Mr Johnson said. However during the televised leadership debate he described the tax plan as ""an ambition"" rather than a fixed policy. On Monday,in an interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson addressed questions over Britain's exit from the EU. The IFS said raising the threshold for the higher rate of tax would take around two and half million people out of the top income tax bracket and cost about Â£9bn. Top earners would gain an average of nearly Â£2,500 a year, the IFS said. But while in the short run only 8% of the population were set to benefit, more people would move into the Â£50,000 to Â£80,000 bracket as time went on and would enjoy a lower rate of tax as a result, it said. The numbers of those falling into the higher tax bracket had ""crept up"" over time, so that there are currently more than four million higher rate taxpayers, compared with one and a half million 30 years ago, the IFS said. Johnson defends Brexit plan and 'row' silence Who gets to choose the UK's next prime minister? Scale of Brexit task facing future PM Raising the point at which workers start to pay national insurance contributions would help low-earning individuals, the IFS said, although it benefited higher earners as well. The IFS said increases to tax credits would be a more effective way to help low income households. Mr Johnson is running against Jeremy Hunt in a vote by Conservative party members to be chosen as the next Conservative party leader and to take over from Theresa May as prime minister. Mr Hunt has said he is in favour of a plan to cut the tax on company profits from 17% to 12.5% from 2020.

"Earlier this year, the meticulously managed world of K-pop was rocked by scandal. Seungri, a singer in one of the world's most famous boy bands, Big Bang, was questioned by police over allegations he was procuring prostitutes for his business and had embezzled funds at Burning Sun, a nightclub he part-owned in the exclusive Gangnam district of Seoul, South Korea. Several of his celebrity K-pop friends were also caught sharing sex videos and bragging in a chat room about raping women. One by one, Korean heartthrobs more used to being mobbed by fans found themselves fending off reporters as they made their way to the police station to face questions from drug-taking to rape. But in recent months an even more shocking picture has emerged of Gangnam, where South Korea's high society live, work and play. The BBC has heard allegations that in its glitzy nightclubs, women have been drugged to order by powerful men and raped, and that underage girls are being sexually exploited for profit. The BBC has sought the voices of those caught up in Seoul's sex scandal. We have heard from club-goers and club employees as well as victims, including underage girls who say they were recruited to have sex with paying customers. They all say the abuse of women in the clubs is pervasive and often violent. We have been told that elite clients, known as VIPs - and the richest VVIPs - were prepared to pay tens of thousands of dollars to have women who were enjoying a night out drugged and taken to a nearby hotel room, the abuse routinely captured on camera. As one club-goer put it to us: ""These men are hunters and they pay to get in the game. So you need prey. It's foolish to think you won't get shot in this place."" A warning: this article contains details of alleged sexual assaults which you may find upsetting. We were shown a harrowing video which allegedly depicts a sexual assault. The still image in front of me gives me an idea of the horror which will follow. A woman is lying naked on a red sofa with three men staring down at her. I press play, and the men approach her. One laughs as he lifts up a limb and it falls. Her body is limp and she does not respond. The two minute video is too upsetting to describe in detail. She appears to be sexually assaulted by all three men. Repeatedly. The video was allegedly shared in a chat room between employees - I cannot verify its contents. But this clip is now part of a police investigation into activities at several clubs in Gangnam. Gangnam has often been described as the Beverly Hills of Seoul. Flashy and fashion-conscious, it's a symbol of prosperity and status. At night, it's the neon playground of the very rich and those eager for a taste of the celebrity lifestyle. The cost of a night out appears almost irrelevant. One wealthy, connected club-goer told us he spent up to $17,000 (Â£13,300) on just one evening. A viral social media clip shows a man spinning on the dance floor, throwing bank notes into the air like confetti. The dÃ©cor is loud and ostentatious. The dress code is, of course, designer chic and for many of the more prestigious nightclubs, gaining entry requires being on an approved list. DJs are celebrities in their own right, conducting crowds of dancers crammed around the turntables. Beautiful women serve thousand-dollar bottles of champagne to revellers who appear ready to party until dawn. Kim - not her real name - used to be a regular on the Gangnam scene. She liked to dance and she had a few favourite DJs. One evening last December she was invited to a nightclub for drinks. Among the group was an Asian businessman who she claims took an interest in her and began serving her whisky. ""When he was pouring the drink, I couldn't see him,"" she says. ""He had his back against me. So I drank around three to four glasses. Every time I did so, he kept giving me water to drink."" At some point, she claims, she blacked out and woke up in a hotel room with the man looking down on her. ""He forced me to lie down but I didn't want to, so I kept getting up. When I got up, he would grab my neck and force me down on the bed over and over. I thought someone could die like this by having their neck broken. ""I started crying and yelling. Then, he got on top of me and used both of his hands to block my mouth and started pressing down hard. He kept saying 'relax, relax'."" She told us she feared for her life. ""I couldn't resist his power and I was in so much pain that I could die, so I just gave up and lay there like a dead body."" Kim says she had been drugged in the club and was raped. Afterwards she threw up, then begged to go home. ""I was grabbing my clothes and other things to leave when he took his phone to take a photo with his face and my face in it. I said what are you doing and 'no, no'. But he grabbed my arm and wouldn't let me go. So I thought it'd be best to just take this photo and leave otherwise I could get into some real harm. ""So he just took the photo and I left."" Kim went to the police the next day. They found no trace of drugs in her blood, but prosecutors tell us that is not unusual. The most common drug used to incapacitate a victim is thought to be GHB, or Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate a strong sedative that is undetectable in the body after a few hours. ""Thankfully I was awake when it happened and I can fully describe what I dealt with,"" she told us. But she said she had found other women online who also believe they were drugged and raped after visiting Gangnam clubs, but have no clear memory of what happened. The businessman was found and questioned but he has strongly protested his innocence. In a statement to the BBC he said she did not black out. He said he did not rape, sexually assault or physically assault her at all and that CCTV footage shows her willingly leaving the club with him and walking to the hotel. The investigation continues. Over the past few months, police have questioned nearly 4,000 people, focusing on allegations of drugs, prostitution, sexual assault and illicit filming linked to the club scene which have outraged the public. Those questioned include several male celebrities from the K-pop scene. Seungri - real name Lee Seung-hyun - has resigned from show business, denying that he ever procured prostitutes but saying the scandal ""has become so big"". The continuing controversy has led to the resignation of the head of a major South Korean entertainment company - Yang Hyun-suk, chief producer of YG Entertainment, which was behind the viral hit Gangnam Style. He denied wrongdoing, but said he could no longer withstand ""humiliating"" allegations of his involvement in a drug scandal andwas stepping down to fight them,external. Seungri, once one of South Korea's biggest pop stars, has stepped away from show business The allegations have encouraged others to speak out. People we spoke to who were an integral part of Seoul's club scene have described a culture of exploitation, where the procuring of women for sexual gratification had become almost routine for some wealthy clients. The clubs employ hosts known as ""MDs"" to cater to guests' desires. It's a murky role - one female MD told us it entailed building relationships with ""pretty girls"" to bring them into the clubs. They would entice them with the offer of free entry and free drinks. MDs would have a number of beautiful women on their call lists. Many would encourage them to drink with their clients and the MDs would then take around 13-15% of the drinks sale. With the right clients, some of them would make around $20,000 a month. As one MD put it: ""To secure high-paying clients, MDs need to be able to supply hot girls."" We have heard repeated allegations that at some point and at the request of clients, the women's drinks were being spiked, rendering them unconscious. However one senior club executive told the BBC that the suggestion GHB had been sold or distributed to customers and sexual assault encouraged was ridiculous. A former host at a famous Gangnam nightclub said one VVIP - the elite guests - was ""well-known for his crazy appetite for unconscious women"". ""He ordered me to bring two totally drunk or unconscious women to him,"" he told us. Specifically, he said, the client's request was: ""Bring me zombies."" He claimed to have witnessed several attempted sexual assaults: ""I saw a few people every week that didn't seem like they were drunk, but gone in a different way. You can tell with your eyes the difference between who is drunk on alcohol and who is gone from something else."" Lee - not his real name - worked as an MD and said these women were ""just people who came to the club"". I wanted to ensure I understood what he was telling me. So I put the question to him clearly: ""Ordinary women going into the club for a nice night out, could face being drugged and raped? Is that what you saw?"" ""Yes,"" came the reply. After procuring the women, he said, the clients ""would usually take them to the hotel above the club or there are a lot of hotels near here, or motels"". We cannot name any of these workers, because they fear reprisals. Likewise a regular club-goer told us that he had been in the VIP room at a Seoul nightclub when a waiter brought in unconscious women. ""I don't know if someone drugged her but I had a woman who was clearly hallucinating and unconscious. I wondered if she was mentally ill, especially since she was drooling and her body was limp. I worried - what if she dies here?"" He denies being involved in drugging or attacking women and said he had challenged the host. ""I told the waiter that she is too drunk, and he said: 'She's not drunk. She won't remember a thing so you can do whatever you want.' ""Sexy, beautiful women are the prey. These men are the hunters. And they pay to get in the game. So you need prey, and the MDs are the ones who release the prey."" Joo Won-gyu is a church pastor who has become one of the most vocal campaigners against sexual violence in Gangnam. Pastor Joo says he saw rapes 'three or four times a week' He had been working with runaway teenagers in 2015 when 20 of them disappeared. He tracked them down and found them working as underage prostitutes at clubs. He decided to become a driver for some of these clubs to try to discover more about how these teenagers were being treated and recruited. He said scouts or pimps would entice runaway teenage girls by claiming they would help them become entertainers or actresses after ""working"" at the club for two to three years. Others were even promised plastic surgery. One of the youngest girls working in clubs had been recruited at the age of 13, he claims. The age of consent is 20 in South Korea. Sex with a minor is statutory rape. He said he had witnessed a number of unconscious women being raped in that time. He told us how he believed the system worked. ""VIPs would tell MDs 'I want to sleep with that girl'. The MD would then tell the girl 'that VIP is super-rich' and then the MD would take the girl into the partitioned area. Then they would drink together, put GHB in the drink or actually get her drunk on alcohol to rape or sexually assault her."" He drove us around the back alleys of Gangnam where he would drop off clients or sex workers, including underage girls, at hotels or office apartments. He described it as a ""challenging time"". This video can not be played The Burning Sun scandal: ""I witnessed women being raped inside clubs"" ""I saw women raped inside clubs, raped outside clubs behind cars, being drugged against their will, being beaten and so on. I would say three to four times a week I'd see this."" Joo tried but failed to remove several girls from these clubs. He would not let us meet any of them, but allowed us to put questions to two of them by phone, through him. One who was recruited for clubs at the age of 16 was very blunt about her role. ""When we were there we were drinking, taking drugs, dancing like idiots and we gave our bodies in rotation,"" she said. South Korea's spy cam porn epidemic The music fans being sexually abused The women left behind by #MeToo in India What has #MeToo actually changed? She said the men were ""like kings"". Both teenagers said the sex was often violent - they and their friends would need medical treatment. Her clients often filmed her. She was told to act innocently, and sometimes she was to act as if she was being raped. ""For girls like us they'd make porn out of itâ¦ I just act like I don't see it when they film me."" Joo says these videos could be used to blackmail the young girls to prevent them from leaving the club's service, or to stop them going to the police. The minors said that on many occasions they were not alone with these men in the motel rooms. One told us the VVIPs would bring along women they'd picked up at clubs who had been drugged and they would witness them being assaulted or raped. Some girls were lured with marijuana, they said, but if the men ""think it could be a crazy bitch that could sue them, then they would drug them with GHB and film them unknowingly"". ""They are just unconscious. They cannot get a grip. Or they have no idea what they did."" Now that the police investigation is under way, I asked one, through the Pastor, what she would like to see happen to those involved in this sex scandal. ""I hope they all die,"" she said. ""Only those who have aâ¦ strong mind survive following Gangnam."" Prostitution is illegal in South Korea, and yet the sex trade is thriving and thought to be worth around $13bn a year. There is no shortage of prostitutes, for those who want such services. This video can not be played The use of hidden and up-skirt cameras is a huge problem in South Korea But one rich club client told us that the men he knew did not want a prostitute. He said comparing prostitutes to ordinary women was ""like a business car versus your own car"". ""You cannot touch a normal girl like that easily. The sense of achievement follows when you gain access to certain things that not everyone is allowed to."" We challenged him that having sex with women who are unable to give consent was rape. ""Normal women who drink normally will not take off their undies? So what do men do?"" he answered indignantly. ""They try to make them drunk, but they refuse. What do you do? ""You say innocently that 'I'm only here to dance. Sure, but will people let you only dance? This is a jungle. It's right that you are here to sightsee, but there are alligators, lions and lizards out to get you. Sexy beautiful women are prey."" The idea of being preyed upon by men will feel disturbingly familiar to so many women in South Korea. Last year, thousands took to the streets of Seoul to protest at so called ""spy cameras"", where videos of women, often sexually explicit, were taken without their knowledge. The scandal has prompted further large protests as campaigners call for justice. They fear that police cannot be trusted to investigate fairly. South Korean women have been growing collectively angrier about hidden cameras and revenge porn Shin Ji-ye from the Green Party addressed the last mass rally on International Women's Day in March and claimed this abuse had taken place over ""decades"". ""In so many clubs,"" she said, ""we have heard the screaming testimonies of women being raped and assaulted."" But there is anger that it was only when celebrities were arrested and police collusion was suspected that action was taken. There is fear that the voices of female victims have been ignored for too long. Police have arrested 354 people in the last three months in connection with what has become known as The Burning Sun Scandal. Of them, 87 were arrested for brokering sex, secretly filming sex and rape. In 20 cases women had been drugged. But campaigners say the total number of female victims may be much higher. Lawyer Cha Mee-kyung says such ""hidden crimes"" happen but ""are not reflected in justice system statistics"". There are also claims that some police officers turned a blind eye to reports about the nightclubs. President Moon Jae-in has ordered an investigation into alleged police corruption and said there was ""evidence suggesting that the prosecutors and police purposely conducted incomplete investigations, and actively prevented the truth from being revealed"". The Gangnam station chief has been removed from his position after a special inquiry. Reporting a rape can be hard for victims. Many women in South Korea are reluctant to come forward. They fear the stigma. They believe they will be judged by an extremely patriarchal society. Supt Choi Hyun-a said all allegations would be investigated thoroughly The use of drugs also makes it difficult for women to remember the details of an assault. Lawyer Kim Jeong-hwan is in the process of trying to bring to court South Korea's first case involving GHB. He said the nature of GHB meant it was ""highly likely the victims would not have a clear recollection"" of the night. ""On top of that it is hard to secure evidence that GHB has been used as it is extremely unlikely that a blood test will detect the drug because it disappears so quickly from the body,"" he added. Then there is the fear of not being believed. It is their word against the rich and the powerful. Will a police force, which is already being accused of trying to cover up some of these crimes, be able to hold those in positions of power accountable? The Korean National Police Agency has set up a special unit to investigate crimes against women. Supt Choi Hyun-a told the BBC that her officers would ""thoroughly and fairly investigate so that all South Korean citizens had a greater trust in the police"". She added that her team would focus its efforts on ""preventing sex crimes where women are drugged"". ""We know this frightens women the most,"" she said. Some women are concerned that once this controversy has passed, the exploitation will continue. But campaigners have vowed to fight on. Kim told me that she had never before thought of herself as a feminist or a fighter. After her alleged rape, that has changed. ""I really wanted to catch these evil men. I want the law to change. I want a society where these drugs can't be used and where no more victims are created.""

"A house burns in the upmarket Paradise Pines neighbourhood of California in November A UN expert has warned of a possible ""climate apartheid"", where the rich pay to escape from hunger, ""while the rest of the world is left to suffer"". Even if current targets are met, ""millions will be impoverished"", said Philip Alston, the UN's special rapporteur on extreme poverty. He also criticised steps taken by UN bodies as ""patently inadequate"". ""Ticking boxes will not save humanity or the planet from impending disaster,"" Mr Alston warned. The Australian native is part of the UN's panel of independent experts, and submitted his report â which is based on existing research â to the UN Human Rights Council on Monday. A key warning was that the world's poor are likely to be hardest hit by rising temperatures - and the potential food shortages and conflict that could accompany such a change. Developing nations are expected to suffer at least 75% of the costs of climate change â despite the fact that the poorer half of the world's population generate just 10% of emissions This video can not be played How young people feel about effects of pollution and climate change Those ""who have contributed the least to emissions... will be the most harmed,"" he said, warning that the effects could undo 50 years of progress on poverty reduction. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts Stripes strike chord on global warming Spy satellites reveal rapid Himalayan glacier melt On the other hand, Mr Alston cites examples of how the wealthy in Western nations already cope with extreme weather events. When Hurricane Sandy hit New York in 2012, most citizens were left without power, yet ""the Goldman Sachs headquarters was protected by tens of thousands of its own sandbags and power from its generator."" Similarly, ""private white-glove firefighters have been dispatched to save the mansions"" of the wealthy. This ""over-reliance"" on the private sector would likely lead to what he termed ""climate apartheid"" â where the rich ""escape overheating, hunger, and conflict"". As far back as 2007,the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the ""poorest of the poor in the world... are going to be the worst hit"".,external Mr Alston's report heavily criticises the lack of action, despite such warnings, over the past several decades. ""Sombre speeches by government officials at regular conferences are not leading to meaningful action,"" Mr Alston wrote in a scathing put-down of current policy. ""Thirty years of conventions appear to have done very little."" This video can not be played Why are governments taking so long to take action on climate change? Among those coming in for criticism are Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, for opening up the rainforest to mining, and ""weakening"" environmental protections. US President Donald Trump also comes under fire â for placing ""former lobbyists in oversight roles"", ""actively silencing and obfuscating climate science"", and also rolling back environmental protections. Trump UN pick: Climate change 'poses real risks' Climate protesters storm coalmine in Germany Yet Mr Alston's scorn is not only for politicians, but also for the UN Human Rights Council to which he submitted the report. ""The Human Rights Council can no longer afford to rely only on the time-honoured techniques of organizing expert panels, calling for reports that lead nowhere, urging others to do more but doing little itself, and adopting wide-ranging but inconclusive and highly aspirational resolutions,"" he wrote. Instead, it must commission an urgent expert study on the possible options available to avert disaster, and ""propose and monitor specific actions"", Mr Alston said. There may also be wider societal implications. The International Organisation for Migration warned in a 2014 report that estimates for migration as a result of climate change vary wildly â from about 25 million to one billion people by 2050. Mr Alston's report contains one estimate of 140 million displaced people in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America alone. This video can not be played The women too scared to have children due to climate change Democracy, he warned, could also be at risk as governments struggle to make major changes to cope. ""The human rights community, with a few notable exceptions, has been every bit as complacent as most governments in the face of the ultimate challenge to mankind represented by climate change,"" the report said. He said that the entire human rights community had failed ""to face up to the fact that human rights might not survive the coming upheaval"".

"The fire brigade were called out to rescue people who had been stranded at the flooded Stirling Rugby Club Fourteen people were rescued by boat from Stirling County Rugby Club after torrential thundery downpours affected the area. Stirling fire and rescue service's water rescue unit was called out at about 20:45 on Monday. No-one was injured. Flash flooding affected many roads in Stirling and Edinburgh. In Stirling, Castleview Primary and Wallace High schools were closed due to severe flooding. Stirling Council said there were ""early indications"" that Wallace High School would reopen on Wednesday. This video can not be played Edinburgh flooding: Rising water causes chaos Stirling's Tesco superstore was forced to close after water poured in through the shops's roof. Store bosses said on Monday it would be shut until further notice, but it re-opened on Tuesday afternoon. Edinburgh and Stirling had been hit with flash flooding and thunder with one man stranded on a car roof. One road in Stirling was deep enough with flowing water to create an improvised water slide. This video can not be played There was enough flowing water on this Stirling street to create an improvised water slide. Heavy rain led to disruption in the west of the capital across Bankhead, Clermiston and Corstorphine. Earlier Edinburgh Trams suspended some services until water had subsided from the tracks and advised passengers to use buses instead. The MP for Edinburgh West, Christine Jardine, posted footage of water lapping up the front of her constituency office on St John's Road. She advised people in the area to stay safe and to alert the emergency services if they were affected by flooding. Flooding forced the closure of MP Christine Jardine's office Ms Jardine said: ""The water appears to have gone down as quick as it rose - but we're hearing terrible stories about people in other parts on top of cars. ""I'm worried about people coming home to flooded homes. The first thing we did was put the electricity off - if it gets into the wiring it can be dangerous. ""We've had heavy thunder from around 13:00 and I think the drains couldn't cope as we're at the foot of the hill."" Police advised motorists to take care and use alternative routes where possible.

"The Scottish Public Pensions Agency runs retirement plans for over 500,000 public sector workers Auditors have criticised Scotland's public sector pension body over a failed IT project which cost millions and ""considerably set back planning"". The Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA) runs retirement plans for over half a million public sector workers. It spent more than Â£6m on a new IT system which the chosen supplier, Capita, was not able to deliver. Audit Scotland said the SPPA had not applied enough scrutiny to Capita's bid and now had a Â£23m gap in its budgets. Read the full Audit Scotland report here,external The principal role of the body - an executive agency of the Scottish government which is based in Tweedbank - is to administer and pay the pensions of half a million members, who include teachers, NHS staff, police officers and firefighters. In 2015, it awarded a contract to Capita to integrate its pension administration and payment operations, with the goal of redesigning its systems and making financial savings in the long term. However, the firm missed a series of deadlines and was unable to provide a working system, and the SPPA pulled the plug on the project in February 2018. In total, the public body spent Â£6.3m on the project, including Â£800,000 paid to Capita, and a further Â£2.4m extending contracts with existing suppliers when the new IT scheme fell apart. It now has a Â£23m gap in its revenue and capital budgets across the next five years. Capita eventually paid back Â£700,000 in November 2018, following a legal process. The Scottish Public Pensions Agency is based in Tweedbank Audit Scotland has now concluded that the SPPA ""did not prepare a clear business case"" for the new system, and set an ""unrealistic"" 18-month timetable for completion. The group's report also said the SPPA ""did not adequately scrutinise the winning tender for the project"" which had come in at an ""abnormally low cost"". The Scottish government's legal department advised bosses that ""more in depth questions should be asked to fully assess the bid"". The agency replied that they ""did not have the skills to further probe the tender"" and accepted the bid, along with Capita's assurances that it could deliver. Auditors highlighted a high turnover in the leadership team over the brief lifetime of the project, with four different senior officers responsible for it across three years, and a series of changes at executive level. They said this ""made it more difficult to manage the supplier and hold it to account"". Auditor General Caroline Gardner said: ""The public sector is under pressure and we are seeing more instances of bodies embarking on IT projects without the necessary staff and assurance arrangements in place to manage them properly. ""In this instance, I found no evidence of a clear business case for a new integrated system, which was pursued at a time when the SPPA was going through significant change. The result was a project that failed to provide value for money and has considerably set back the SPPA's planning."" Auditor General Caroline Gardner said there was ""no evidence of a clear business case"" for the project The Scottish Conservatives likened the scheme to past failed projects likethe farm payments IT system. Pensions spokesman Bill Bowman said it was ""yet another botched IT contract"" which ""poses some serious questions for the government"", adding: ""The hundreds of thousands of public sector workers whose pensions depend on this organisation deserve answers."" Labour's James Kelly said it was ""an absolute mess which has cost taxpayers millions of pounds"". A spokesman for the Scottish government said there would be no disruption to pension services as a result of the failed project. He said: ""The SPPA is already taking steps to improve how contracts are managed and will consider the findings of the Public Audit and Post Legislative Scrutiny Committee when it has considered the report. ""The Scottish government is examining the report and will be reviewing its findings.""

"Kirsty Noble's 'casualty' was actually boyfriend Sam Main A lifeboat crew member went to the aid of a ""dummy"" during a training exercise - only to be stunned with a marriage proposal. The RNLI team in Aberdeen had helped disguise Kirsty Noble's boyfriend Sam Main as the ""casualty"" during the training at the city's Fishmarket Quay. When Kirsty went to help, he got up onto one knee and brought out an engagement ring. He then popped the question - and Kirsty said yes. That was met with cheering and applause from the entire lifeboat crew. Sam got onto one knee for the proposal Kirsty said: ""Surprised is an understatement - it was an amazing occasion and to spend it with my best friends was very special."" Sam said: ""It was an amazing day and I'm delighted that she said yes. ""A lot of planning went into the day so I'm so happy that it all went to plan. ""I'm really grateful to the whole RNLI team for all their help in making it possible.""

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's home was renovated with Â£2.4m of taxpayer-funded costs, royal accounts show. Frogmore Cottage in Windsor was turned into a single property for Prince Harry and Meghan, from five separate homes. The couple, who moved from Kensington Palace in April before the birth of their son Archie, paid for fittings. The Queen's Sovereign Grant from the Treasury was Â£82m in 2018-19, with Â£33m set aside for maintenance, including major work on Buckingham Palace. The Sovereign Grant isfunded by profits from the Crown Estate.,external The estate is the Royal Family's commercial property arm and owns land and buildings in prime central London locations and across the UK.  It is managed by an independent organisation, with any profit paid to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers. Separate accounts show the Crown Estate provided a record Â£343.5m to the Treasury in 2018-19, up 4.3% on last year. Theroyal accounts,externalsaid the renovation of Frogmore Cottage was paid out of the Sovereign Grant and involved the ""reconfiguration and full refurbishment of five residential units in poor condition to create the official residence for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex"". The 19th Century, Grade II-listed, property was given to them by the Queen. It sits in the grounds of royal residence Frogmore House, where Prince Harry and Meghan held their wedding reception in May 2018. Who lived in Harry and Meghan's house? Harry and Meghan split from royal charity Harry and Meghan move to Windsor MPs back Â£369m Buckingham Palace revamp Defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced and inefficient heating systems updated. The house also required extensive rewiring - including an electrical sub-station - and the installation of gas and water mains. The refurbishment took about six months although some areas are yet to be completed, such as repainting the exterior. Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, said: ""The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation in line with our responsibility to maintain the condition of the occupied royal palaces estate."" The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also carried out renovations before moving into their Kensington Palace home in 2013,spending more than Â£4m on converting offices into an apartment. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex moved to Frogmore Cottage in April Taxpayer-funded spending on the royals has been a sensitive topic for decades. That's why Palace officials went out of their way to explain how much had to be done to Frogmore Cottage, and how anything over basic fixtures and fittings would be paid for by the couple themselves. The Sovereign Grant is to cover the cost of official duties and for the upkeep of royal palaces. However, some will ask, why did the couple have to move out of Kensington Palace? And why, if they felt that strongly about it, didn't they pay for the refurbishment of the house in Windsor themselves? The Royal Family's ""core"" sovereign grant is based on 15% of the net surplus of the Crown Estate, and allocated two years in arrears. From 2017-18, the total grant was increased to 25% of the surplus for a 10-year period - with the extra funding intended to meet theÂ£369m costs of refurbishing Buckingham Palace. Excluding money transferred to reserves for future building work at the palace, the Queen's official expenses last year were Â£67m, a 41% year-on-year increase,the figures show.,external A large amount of the rise was due to the ongoing renovation at Buckingham Palace, and work on the other occupied royal residences. The campaign group Republic questioned why money had been spent on Frogmore Cottage at a time while public services were under financial pressure. Graham Smith, from Republic, called for a parliamentary inquiry into royal spending, adding: ""The general funds of the Treasury should not be spent on individual members of the royal family at all - even if we had all the money to spend on public services it should not be happening."" An independent commercial property business and one of the largest property portfolios in the UK The majority of assets are in London, but the estate also owns property in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Holdings include Windsor Great Park and Ascot racecourse, but most of the portfolio is made up of residential property, commercial offices, shops, businesses and retail parks Managed by an independent organisation, with any profit paid to the Treasury for the benefit of all UK taxpayers Dates back from the time of the Norman Conquest Has been managed on behalf of the government since 1760 when George III handed over its running in return for an annual payment Funds the Sovereign Grant which supports the official duties of the Queen and maintains the occupied royal palaces The royal accounts show the cost of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall's official travel by air and rail funded by the Sovereign Grant rose by almost a third last year to Â£1.3m, as the couple took on more royal duties from the Queen. The report said there was a 98% increase in carbon emissions from flights used on official royal visits overseas in 2018-19 - going up to 3,344 tonnes of CO2 from 1,687. Buckingham Palace said the rise was ""due to higher usage of chartered large fixed wing aircraft for foreign business travel"", adding there was five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one the previous year. The trips are decided by the Foreign Office. The accounts also reveal the Duke of Edinburgh maintains an office with a private secretary and receives Â£359,000 annuity from the Treasury. Despite retiring from public duties in 2017, Prince Philip has an official relationship with hundreds of organisations and charities, Separately, the Prince of Wales pays for the public duties of Prince Harry and Meghan and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and some of their private costs, out of his Duchy of Cornwall income, which was Â£21.6m last year. Accounts from Clarence House show this funding - in the year Meghan officially joined the Royal Family - stood at just over Â£5m, up 1.8% on 2017-18.

And why, if they felt that strongly about it, didn't they pay for the refurbishment of the house in Windsor themselves? The Royal Family's ""core"" sovereign grant is based on 15% of the net surplus of the Crown Estate, and allocated two years in arrears. From 2017-18, the total grant was increased to 25% of the surplus for a 10-year period - with the extra funding intended to meet theÂ£369m costs of refurbishing Buckingham Palace. Excluding money transferred to reserves for future building work at the palace, the Queen's official expenses last year were Â£67m, a 41% year-on-year increase,the figures show.,external A large amount of the rise was due to the ongoing renovation at Buckingham Palace, and work on the other occupied royal residences. The campaign group Republic questioned why money had been spent on Frogmore Cottage at a time while public services were under financial pressure. Graham Smith, from Republic, called for a parliamentary inquiry into royal spending, adding: ""The general funds of the Treasury should not be spent on individual members of the royal family at all - even if we had all the money to spend on public services it should not be happening.""

The report said there was a 98% increase in carbon emissions from flights used on official royal visits overseas in 2018-19 - going up to 3,344 tonnes of CO2 from 1,687. Buckingham Palace said the rise was ""due to higher usage of chartered large fixed wing aircraft for foreign business travel"", adding there was five such overseas visits in 2018-19 compared to one the previous year. The trips are decided by the Foreign Office. The accounts also reveal the Duke of Edinburgh maintains an office with a private secretary and receives Â£359,000 annuity from the Treasury. Despite retiring from public duties in 2017, Prince Philip has an official relationship with hundreds of organisations and charities, Separately, the Prince of Wales pays for the public duties of Prince Harry and Meghan and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and some of their private costs, out of his Duchy of Cornwall income, which was Â£21.6m last year. Accounts from Clarence House show this funding - in the year Meghan officially joined the Royal Family - stood at just over Â£5m, up 1.8% on 2017-18.

"The Scottish Public Pensions Agency runs retirement plans for over 500,000 public sector workers Auditors have criticised Scotland's public sector pension body over a failed IT project which cost millions and ""considerably set back planning"". The Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA) runs retirement plans for over half a million public sector workers. It spent more than Â£6m on a new IT system which the chosen supplier, Capita, was not able to deliver. Audit Scotland said the SPPA had not applied enough scrutiny to Capita's bid and now had a Â£23m gap in its budgets. Read the full Audit Scotland report here,external The principal role of the body - an executive agency of the Scottish government which is based in Tweedbank - is to administer and pay the pensions of half a million members, who include teachers, NHS staff, police officers and firefighters. In 2015, it awarded a contract to Capita to integrate its pension administration and payment operations, with the goal of redesigning its systems and making financial savings in the long term. However, the firm missed a series of deadlines and was unable to provide a working system, and the SPPA pulled the plug on the project in February 2018. In total, the public body spent Â£6.3m on the project, including Â£800,000 paid to Capita, and a further Â£2.4m extending contracts with existing suppliers when the new IT scheme fell apart. It now has a Â£23m gap in its revenue and capital budgets across the next five years. Capita eventually paid back Â£700,000 in November 2018, following a legal process. The Scottish Public Pensions Agency is based in Tweedbank Audit Scotland has now concluded that the SPPA ""did not prepare a clear business case"" for the new system, and set an ""unrealistic"" 18-month timetable for completion. The group's report also said the SPPA ""did not adequately scrutinise the winning tender for the project"" which had come in at an ""abnormally low cost"". The Scottish government's legal department advised bosses that ""more in depth questions should be asked to fully assess the bid"". The agency replied that they ""did not have the skills to further probe the tender"" and accepted the bid, along with Capita's assurances that it could deliver. Auditors highlighted a high turnover in the leadership team over the brief lifetime of the project, with four different senior officers responsible for it across three years, and a series of changes at executive level. They said this ""made it more difficult to manage the supplier and hold it to account"". Auditor General Caroline Gardner said: ""The public sector is under pressure and we are seeing more instances of bodies embarking on IT projects without the necessary staff and assurance arrangements in place to manage them properly. ""In this instance, I found no evidence of a clear business case for a new integrated system, which was pursued at a time when the SPPA was going through significant change. The result was a project that failed to provide value for money and has considerably set back the SPPA's planning."" Auditor General Caroline Gardner said there was ""no evidence of a clear business case"" for the project The Scottish Conservatives likened the scheme to past failed projects likethe farm payments IT system. Pensions spokesman Bill Bowman said it was ""yet another botched IT contract"" which ""poses some serious questions for the government"", adding: ""The hundreds of thousands of public sector workers whose pensions depend on this organisation deserve answers."" Labour's James Kelly said it was ""an absolute mess which has cost taxpayers millions of pounds"". A spokesman for the Scottish government said there would be no disruption to pension services as a result of the failed project. He said: ""The SPPA is already taking steps to improve how contracts are managed and will consider the findings of the Public Audit and Post Legislative Scrutiny Committee when it has considered the report. ""The Scottish government is examining the report and will be reviewing its findings.""

"The law, which is set to come into force in 2021, will be named after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse A law protecting allergy sufferers will be introduced following the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse. The teenager died after an allergic reaction to a Pret A Manger baguette. Under ""Natasha's law"", food businesses will have to include full ingredients labelling on pre-packaged food. Natasha's parents said ""helping save other allergy sufferers and their families from the enduring agony that we will always bear is a fitting legacy for her life"". Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the couple were an ""inspiration"". ""These changes will make food labels clear and consistent and give the country's two million food allergy sufferers confidence in making safe food choices,"" he said. The law, which will apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland, is set to come into force by the summer of 2021. Businesses will be given a two-year implementation period to adapt to the changes. Natasha suffered a severe reaction after eating sesame in a baguette Natasha's parents have also launched a charity in memory of their daughter. The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation was announced by Tanya and Nadim Ednan-Laperouse on Tuesday, with the couple aiming to establish a research centre at the University of Southampton to find a cure for allergies. Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said: ""It will be groundbreaking, the first of its kind. ""Here we will fund and harness allergy medical breakthroughs, support academic and industry research and develop new therapies that will offer hope for effective allergy treatments.""

She died of anaphylaxis after collapsing on board a flight to Nice on 17 July 2016. The coroner looking into her death said Natasha had been ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging. Pret a Manger said it was ""deeply sorry for Natasha's death"" and said it would be listing all ingredients on its freshly made food. A spokesman said: ""Full ingredient labels are now in over 60 Pret shops as part of our nationwide rollout. ""Before we took this step, we ran a number of pilots to confirm that this approach would be safe, practical and effective. ""We are pleased that the Government has chosen to support full ingredient labelling."" Tanya and Nadim Ednan-Laperouse have campaigned for a change to the current rules which state that food pre-prepared on the premises in which it is sold does not need to display information about allergens. They said they were ""delighted"" by the announcement and thanked Mr Gove and Health Secretary Matt Hancock for ""their unflinching support"". The announcement was also welcomed by the Food Standards Agency, which said the change would mean ""better protection"" for allergic consumers.

Gerald Corrigan was shot and fatally wounded in the attack outside his isolated home on Holyhead in April. He died three weeks later, sparking what has become the largest murder inquiry on Anglesey in two decades. His funeral was held on Monday in Knutsford, Cheshire, where family members described him as a ""wonderful man"". ""My dad believed in the good in people and in life, and in the importance of family, friendship and love,"" said his son Neale Corrigan. ""He taught me that we can change, that to forgive brings freedom, and that we should believe in the best in people as no-one is perfect."" Family's appeal over crossbow shooting 'Largest' murder manhunt The partner of the retired video and photography lecturer said it was ""impossible to express my deep sadness and shock at the horrific murder of Gerry"". ""He was my best friend and my soul mate. All the time we have been together I have been proud to walk at his side and he stood beside me, always,"" said Marie Bailey. Mr Corrigan's home lies in a relatively remote part of the island His daughter also paid tribute, following the funeral service at St Vincent De Paul Roman Catholic Church. ""My dad was a very kind and funny man,"" said Fiona Corrigan. ""He taught me an appreciation of art and nature. There are so many happy moments we shared and I will miss him too much to say.""

"Jeremy Hunt says he would boost defence spending by Â£15bn over the next five years if he becomes prime minister. The Tory leadership candidate's promise would mean spending on defence would rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2023/24, from its current 2%. He said the move would help combat ""new threats to western values"" and show the UK is ""ready to defend its interests"". Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who backs Mr Hunt, said the government must give the armed forces ""what they need."" ""Jeremy's clear commitment to do that is one reason why he has my support,"" she added. Reality Check: What's happening to defence spending? MoD 'facing Â£7bn funding black hole' F-35 fighter jets join fight against IS Sources close to Mr Hunt suggested the policy would be funded through economic growth and fiscal ""headroom"" set aside by Chancellor Phillip Hammond. ""I was the person who secured a historic funding boost for the NHS and as prime minister I'll do the same for defence,"" the former health secretary said. ""My plan for defence will give our brave troops the backing they need and show the world that when it comes to the new threats to Western values, Britain is back and Britain's voice will be strong,"" he added. Mr Hunt's move comes after repeated complaints from US President Donald Trump over the defence spending of Nato allies. The UK is one of the few European members to reach the current target of 2% of GDP. The foreign secretary has previously said it is not ""not sustainable"" to expect the US to spend 4% of its GDP on defence, while other Nato allies spent between 1% and 2% and has called for the UK to consider ""decisively"" increasing military spending after Brexit. His pledge comes afterwarnings of a funding black hole of at least Â£7bn in plans to equip the UK's armed forces.

Under the agreement with Ofwat, each customer will receive at least Â£17 in 2021 and at least Â£11 per year for the following four years. Southern will pay a total of Â£123m to customers, as well as a fine of Â£3m. Ofwat said that proportionate to the size of the business, the penalty for the failings - which took place between 2010 and 2017 - was the biggest it has ever imposed. It added the total would have been bigger if Southern had not co-operated with its investigation and addressed its errors. Watchdogs 'need to prove they protect consumers' says NAO Most water firms fail to meet challenges Southern Water: Supplies 'half of demand' by 2030 Southern's failings included not making the necessary investment, which led to equipment failures, and spills of wastewater. Ofwat also found the company manipulated its wastewater sampling process, which meant it misreported information about the performance of a number of sewage treatment sites. As a result of the misreporting, it avoided penalties under Ofwat's incentive regime. However, Â£91m of the Â£123m it is now having to pay to customers makes up for this. Ofwat would not say where the spillages took place. Southern operates in the south-east of England, serving customers in Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. It has over 300 wastewater treatment sites and Ofwat said a ""significant number"" of these had had been affected by problems. It is not the first time Southern has been punished for misreporting information about its performance. In 2007, Ofwat fined the company Â£20.3m,externalafter its actions meant it could raise its prices by more than it should have done. Ms Fletcher said the findings showed ""the company was being run with scant regard for its responsibilities to society and the environment"". ""It was not just the poor operational performance, but the co-ordinated efforts to hide and deceive customers of the fact that are so troubling,"" she added. ""The previous management failed to stamp out this behaviour and failed to manage its plants properly. In doing so, Southern Water let down its customers and operated in a way completely counter to the public service ethos we expect."" Southern Water's current chief executive, Ian McAulay, who was appointed in 2017, said: ""There are no excuses for the failings that occurred. ""We have clearly fallen far short of the expectations and trust placed in us by our wastewater customers and the wider communities we serve. ""We are fully committed to the fast pace of change delivered since 2017. There is a lot more work to do but we're pleased that this proposal agreed with Ofwat enables us to fully make amends to our customers and regain their trust as quickly as possible.""
