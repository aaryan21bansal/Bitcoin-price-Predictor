"Past detainees claim they were forced to work making toys and household goods China is to end a punishment system for prostitution that allowed police to hold sex workers and their clients in custody for up to two years at so-called education centres. Detainees were forced to work, allegedly making toys and household goods. The detention system will come to an end on 29 December. Those still in custody will be released, according to Xinhua, China's state media. Prostitution remains illegal in China. It carries punishments of up to 15 days in detention and fines of up to 5,000 yuan (Â£546). China sex workers 'abused by police' China issues tough online rules China's state media claims the ""custody and education"" system has helped to maintain a ""good social atmosphere and public order"" since it was introduced more than 20 years ago. It added that over time, the system has become less and less appropriate. A study by NGO Asia Catalyst in 2013questioned whether this scheme was effective,external. The report included interviews with 30 female sex workers from two cities. It claimed detainees were unable to learn new skills during detention that could help them after their release. The report added that the detainees typically undertake manual labour. It said: ""All of the sex workers we interviewed returned to the sex trade immediately after release."" A 2013 report by Human Rights Watch interviewed 140 sex workers, clients, police and specialists and found that many sex workers were beaten by police in an attempt to coerce confessions. One worker claimed she had been deceived into signing a confession. ""The police told me it was fine, all I needed to do was sign my name and they would release me after four or five days,"" she said. ""Instead, I was locked up in [a] Custody and Education centre for six months."" Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps Inside one of the world's largest licensed brothels Shen Tingting, director of Asia Catalyst, said the move to abolish forced labour detention centres is positive but only a small step towards safeguarding the rights of sex workers. ""Chinese law and policies focus on prohibition and cracking down on sex work, rather than providing a framework to ensure the health and safety of sex work as a profession,"" she said. In 2013, China announced it had abolished its system of ""re-education through labour camps"" for petty criminals. That decision came after several high-profile miscarriages of justice, including a case where a mother was sent to a labour camp after demanding justice for her daughter who had been raped. However, the abolition did not extend to the ""custody and education"" system affecting sex workers and their clients. China isn't totally abandoning the idea of re-education. Authorities in the country claim a number of camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang are voluntary education camps that help to combat extremism. However rights groups claim many Chinese Uighur people have been rounded up into the camps and made to criticise or denounce their faith.

"The plane crashed shortly after it took-off from Lafayette airport Five people have been killed after a plane crashed next to a Walmart supermarket in Lafayette, Louisiana. One person from onboard the plane survived. The plane hit a car as it crashed, injuring the driver. Two more people on the ground were also hurt.

One of the victims has been identified as sports reporter Carley Ann McCord. Her husband confirmed her death to the Associated Press. The Walmart supermarket was evacuated, KATC News reported.

"This video can not be played Views at Australia's iconic Three Sisters rock formation are obscured by thick smoke Volunteer firefighters in New South Wales will get compensation for loss of earnings after spending time away from jobs to battle bushfires in the state, Australia's federal government says. The offer of up to A$6,000 ($4,200; Â£3,200) for privately-employed volunteers follows weeks of wrangling. PM Scott Morrison - who had previously rejected the idea - said it should not lead to permanent pay. More than 100 fires are continuing to burn, with the largest near Sydney. Authorities fear a heatwave forecast to sweep across Australia in the coming days could see the bushfires escalate. Temperatures are set to hit over 40C (104F) in several bushfire-affected states including New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. The sacrifices of Australia's unpaid firefighters Mr Morrison's compensation announcement came after weeks of criticism by opposition parties. ""The early and prolonged nature of this fire season has made a call beyond what is typically made on our volunteer firefighters,"" Mr Morrison said. This video can not be played The BBC's Shaimaa Khalil visited the village of Balmoral which was razed by the fires There are 70,000 people in the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, most of them unpaid. Earlier this month two volunteer firefighters - both young fathers - were killed whena tree fell on their truck as they drove towards a massive firein the state. The compensation scheme is a joint initiative between the federal government and NSW. The federal government says other states and territories could bring in similar schemes. A visual guide to the bushfires and extreme heat How is Australia tackling climate change? Volunteers who are employed by small- and medium-sized businesses or are self-employed will be able to apply for up to A$300 per day that they have volunteered if they have spent more than 10 days battling the flames. ""While I know RFS volunteers don't seek payment for their service, I don't want to see volunteers or families unable to pay bills, or struggle financially as a result of the selfless contribution they are making,"" Mr Morrison said. ""This is not about paying volunteers. It is about sustaining our volunteer efforts by protecting them from financial loss."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

New South Wales Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons had also previously rejected the idea compensation. ""Don't do the volunteers a disservice by suggesting that you're going to pay them, because then they're no longer volunteers and that's absolutely the sentiment that I'm getting loud and clear everywhere I go,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said earlier this week. Meanwhile, in Sydney, more than a quarter of a million people have signed a petition to cancel the New Year's Eve fireworks and spend the money on fighting bushfires instead, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. But Sydney Mayor Clover Moore said earlier this month that the fireworks had been planned for more than a year and could not be cancelled.

"Rory Burns, who was dropped on 20, has made six half-centuries in 14 Tests for England First Test, Supersport Park, Centurion (day three of five): South Africa 284(De Kock 95, Curran 4-58)& 272(Van der Dussen 51, Archer 5-102) England 181(Denly 50, Philander 4-16) &121-1(Burns 77*) England chasing 376 to win Scorecard Rory Burns' unbeaten 77 gave England hope of chasing an unlikely 376 to beat South Africa in the first Test in Centurion. The opener, who put on 92 for the first wicket with Dom Sibley, steered England to 121-1 at the close of day three, with 255 still needed for what would be England's highest run chase. South Africa were dismissed for 272 as Jofra Archer took 5-102. England, though, were afflicted by illness on day three. Jos Buttler did not take to the field and was replaced behind the stumps by Jonny Bairstow, while captain Joe Root also spent time off the field. TMS podcast: Could England record chase be on the cards? England hopeful Root & Buttler will be fit to bat England's Test team of the decade - as chosen by you England will need to complete their highest run chase, surpassing the 362 they made to beat Australia at Headingley in August, if they are to win this Test. England's highest successful Test run chases 362-9v Australia, Headingley, 2019 332-7v Australia, Melbourne, 1928 315-4v Australia, Headingley, 2001 307-6v New Zealand, Christchurch, 1997 298-4v Australia, Melbourne, 1895 The highest successful chase at Centurion by a visiting team is England's 251-8 in 2000, a Test which waslater referenced in a match-fixing trial,externalinvolving then South Africa skipper Hansie Cronje. Burns and Sibley played well in conditions that were suited to bowling. Burns was the more fluent of the two, hitting several confident drives through mid-wicket, while Sibley was patient against a disciplined attack. The chase looked to have got off to a poor start when Burns was given out lbw to Kagiso Rabada for six in the first over, but a review showed the ball was missing off stump. Burns also profited from another mistake in the field as the metronomic Vernon Philander found the outside edge on 20, and the low offering was dropped by Rassie van der Dussen at first slip. Sibley grew in confidence, clipping Dwaine Pretorius through mid-wicket for four, as the two shared England's highest opening partnership of 2019. However, Sibley was visibly frustrated after he chipped a Keshav Maharaj delivery straight back to the bowler. South Africa are without a win in five Tests but, on a pitch that has shown uneven bounce since the first day, it will still require a huge effort from England to secure an unlikely win. Jofra Archer (centre) claimed three of the six South Africa wickets to fall on day three England's performance in the morning session was reminiscent of their recent overseas tours to Australia: a tired bowling attack, lacking consistency, being flayed around the ground. They had their chances, with substitute fielder Zak Crawley missing a run-out of Van der Dussen early on - and his 91-run stand with nightwatchman Anrich Nortje further frustrated England. The tourists did not bowl full enough to Van der Dussen - he was eventually trapped lbw for 51 by a pitched-up Archer delivery - and allowed Nortje to settle into a rhythm before he eventually fended Archer to short leg. Quinton de Kock attacked Archer, hooking consecutive 90mph deliveries for six, and could have done further damage had he not walked after edging Stokes to Bairstow. The final four batsmen added 102 runs as England's bowlers were kept out in the field for much of the day, with Philander scoring 46. Archer claimed his third five-wicket haul in seven Tests but he finished the innings with an economy rate of 6.00. While England have been hampered by illness in the build-up to this Test, they looked worryingly flat so early in such a big series. England in South Africa - fixtures & results South Africa's Philander to join Somerset BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""England's chance of winning is probably 5%, but you are against a team who has lost any kind of winning habit at all. ""It is important to remember it is certainly not 0%, which it was halfway through this afternoon. South Africa's bowling didn't seem to have much confidence or belief about it."" England batting coach Graham Thorpe on the Test Match Special podcast:""We've got a chance. ""We know the fight we've got in our dressing room and what we're going to try and achieve tomorrow."" Ex-England assistant coach Paul Farbrace on The Cricket Social:""England have batted themselves into a good position. ""The first hour tomorrow will be really important.

"Sydney's New Year fireworks - pictured here in 2018 - generate millions for the economy More than a quarter of a million people have signed a petition calling for Sydney's New Year's Eve fireworks to be cancelled and the money spent on fighting fires that threaten the city.

"Catriona Matthew - pictured with the Solheim Cup - has been made an OBE Scottish golfer Catriona Matthew, who captained Team Europe to Solheim Cup victory over the US, has been appointed an OBE in the New Year Honours list. The 50-year-old has been recognised for services to golf, 10 years after becoming an MBE. Rose Reilly, who moved to Italy to become a professional footballer in the 1970s, has been appointed an MBE. Banker Ross McEwan and former Labour politician Brian Wilson are among the others to be honoured. Ms Matthew, who grew up in North Berwick, told the BBC she was ""absolutely delighted"" when she opened her post to find the news that she was to receive the honour. Honours for Newton-John and England cricketers Famous names in the New Year Honours Knighthoods for directors Mendes and McQueen Morgan and Stokes among New Year Honours Festive honour for original Calendar Girl She said it was ""quite a surprise"" and she was ""very excited"" to get the recognition for her achievements. ""It's a huge honour for myself, for the team and for woman's golf"", she added. She said the victory on ""home soil"" had been ""very special"". Her family are looking forward to travelling down to Buckingham Palace to see her receive the honour. Rose Reilly took Italy by storm Another sportswoman honoured, with an MBE, is Rose Reilly - the Scottish footballer who left Scotland at 17 to become a professional footballer in Europe. Europe beat USA to win Solheim Cup Scots footballer who won the World Cup Despite already turning out for the Scotland national team, Ms Reilly, 64, from Ayrshire, went on to be selected for Italy before captaining the side that won the Mundialito in 1984 - a competition seen as a predecessor of the Women's World Cup. Recalling the moment she learned she was to be honoured, Ms Reilly said: ""My first reaction was I went up to the cemetery to tell my mum and dad. ""I was so proud - proud for them."" She added that she had struggled to keep the news a secret. ""I was nearly doing somersaults. I was walking about beaming, smiling at people... I didn't even know,"" she said. ""I was very happy because it was for us women from Scotland, for women's football generally."" She added: ""I never looked for honours. I played football because of the love, the passion I've got for it. I used to pass my honours on to a fan or a friend. I've not got the trophies. ""Every victory is a victory, but this is the cherry on the cake. I'm holding on to this one."" Commonly awarded ranks: Companion of honour - Limited to 65 people.

When he took the helm in 2013, the bank was more than 80% owned by the UK government, but the taxpayer's stake has since reduced to 62.4%. One of his challenges was to prepare the bank to be returned to private hands - a task still not complete, but with progress being made after RBS posted profits for the second consecutive year in February. There were also OBEs for two people involved at the V&A museum in Dundee. Lesley Knox, the former chairwoman of the museum, received the honour for services to culture and director Philip Long is recognised for services to heritage and culture. Actress Maureen Beattie, who stars with David Tennant in the upcoming TV drama Deadwater Fell, has also been made an OBE. Beattie - whose father is the popular Scottish actor and comedian Johnny Beattie - is being recognised for services to the entertainment industry, having become the second female president of the Equity trade union last year. Meanwhile, Helen Holland has also been made an OBE for services to survivors of childhood abuse, having co-founded the Wellbeing Scotland project In Care Abuse Survivors. Former Labour politician Brian Wilson has been made a CBE for services to business and charity in Scotland. He served as a minister of state under Tony Blair and is currently the chairman of Harris Tweed Hebrides, which has been credited with leading the tweed industry out of crisis. Mr Wilson, also a director at Celtic FC, has spoken of his ""surprise"" when told of his royal honour. He set up the company in 2008, ""when the industry was at a low ebb"". He said: ""I think this is more of a recognition of everyone who has been involved in the Harris Tweed revival."" The former politician added: ""I think it's generally accepted that we have led the revival of an industry that's in a pretty perilous condition."" The same honour goes to Joanna Baker, who was formerly managing director of the Edinburgh International Festival and chair of the National Youth Choir of Scotland. Professor Rowena Arshad, the head of Edinburgh University's Moray House School of Education and co-director of the Centre for Education and Racial equality, has been made a CBE for services to education and equality. Prof Arshad was a member of the first black women's group in Scotland and was the equal opportunities commissioner for Scotland from 2001 to 2007. Ian Curle, who was chief executive of spirits company Edrington - which owns brands including Macallan, the Famous Grouse and Highland Park whiskies - is another who has been appointed a CBE. He is honoured for services to the Scotch whisky industry after stepping down from the drinks firm in March. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""The people of Scotland recognised in the Queen's New Year Honours have made exceptional contributions to communities the length and breadth of this country and beyond.""

"Rory Burns, who was dropped on 20, has made six half-centuries in 14 Tests for England First Test, Supersport Park, Centurion (day three of five): South Africa 284(De Kock 95, Curran 4-58)& 272(Van der Dussen 51, Archer 5-102) England 181(Denly 50, Philander 4-16) &121-1(Burns 77*) England chasing 376 to win Scorecard Rory Burns' unbeaten 77 gave England hope of chasing an unlikely 376 to beat South Africa in the first Test in Centurion. The opener, who put on 92 for the first wicket with Dom Sibley, steered England to 121-1 at the close of day three, with 255 still needed for what would be England's highest run chase. South Africa were dismissed for 272 as Jofra Archer took 5-102. England, though, were afflicted by illness on day three. Jos Buttler did not take to the field and was replaced behind the stumps by Jonny Bairstow, while captain Joe Root also spent time off the field. TMS podcast: Could England record chase be on the cards? England hopeful Root & Buttler will be fit to bat England's Test team of the decade - as chosen by you England will need to complete their highest run chase, surpassing the 362 they made to beat Australia at Headingley in August, if they are to win this Test. England's highest successful Test run chases 362-9v Australia, Headingley, 2019 332-7v Australia, Melbourne, 1928 315-4v Australia, Headingley, 2001 307-6v New Zealand, Christchurch, 1997 298-4v Australia, Melbourne, 1895 The highest successful chase at Centurion by a visiting team is England's 251-8 in 2000, a Test which waslater referenced in a match-fixing trial,externalinvolving then South Africa skipper Hansie Cronje. Burns and Sibley played well in conditions that were suited to bowling. Burns was the more fluent of the two, hitting several confident drives through mid-wicket, while Sibley was patient against a disciplined attack. The chase looked to have got off to a poor start when Burns was given out lbw to Kagiso Rabada for six in the first over, but a review showed the ball was missing off stump. Burns also profited from another mistake in the field as the metronomic Vernon Philander found the outside edge on 20, and the low offering was dropped by Rassie van der Dussen at first slip. Sibley grew in confidence, clipping Dwaine Pretorius through mid-wicket for four, as the two shared England's highest opening partnership of 2019. However, Sibley was visibly frustrated after he chipped a Keshav Maharaj delivery straight back to the bowler. South Africa are without a win in five Tests but, on a pitch that has shown uneven bounce since the first day, it will still require a huge effort from England to secure an unlikely win. Jofra Archer (centre) claimed three of the six South Africa wickets to fall on day three England's performance in the morning session was reminiscent of their recent overseas tours to Australia: a tired bowling attack, lacking consistency, being flayed around the ground. They had their chances, with substitute fielder Zak Crawley missing a run-out of Van der Dussen early on - and his 91-run stand with nightwatchman Anrich Nortje further frustrated England. The tourists did not bowl full enough to Van der Dussen - he was eventually trapped lbw for 51 by a pitched-up Archer delivery - and allowed Nortje to settle into a rhythm before he eventually fended Archer to short leg. Quinton de Kock attacked Archer, hooking consecutive 90mph deliveries for six, and could have done further damage had he not walked after edging Stokes to Bairstow. The final four batsmen added 102 runs as England's bowlers were kept out in the field for much of the day, with Philander scoring 46. Archer claimed his third five-wicket haul in seven Tests but he finished the innings with an economy rate of 6.00. While England have been hampered by illness in the build-up to this Test, they looked worryingly flat so early in such a big series. England in South Africa - fixtures & results South Africa's Philander to join Somerset BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""England's chance of winning is probably 5%, but you are against a team who has lost any kind of winning habit at all. ""It is important to remember it is certainly not 0%, which it was halfway through this afternoon. South Africa's bowling didn't seem to have much confidence or belief about it."" England batting coach Graham Thorpe on the Test Match Special podcast:""We've got a chance. ""We know the fight we've got in our dressing room and what we're going to try and achieve tomorrow."" Ex-England assistant coach Paul Farbrace on The Cricket Social:""England have batted themselves into a good position. ""The first hour tomorrow will be really important.

"This video can not be played Views at Australia's iconic Three Sisters rock formation are obscured by thick smoke Volunteer firefighters in New South Wales will get compensation for loss of earnings after spending time away from jobs to battle bushfires in the state, Australia's federal government says. The offer of up to A$6,000 ($4,200; Â£3,200) for privately-employed volunteers follows weeks of wrangling. PM Scott Morrison - who had previously rejected the idea - said it should not lead to permanent pay. More than 100 fires are continuing to burn, with the largest near Sydney. Authorities fear a heatwave forecast to sweep across Australia in the coming days could see the bushfires escalate. Temperatures are set to hit over 40C (104F) in several bushfire-affected states including New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. The sacrifices of Australia's unpaid firefighters Mr Morrison's compensation announcement came after weeks of criticism by opposition parties. ""The early and prolonged nature of this fire season has made a call beyond what is typically made on our volunteer firefighters,"" Mr Morrison said. This video can not be played The BBC's Shaimaa Khalil visited the village of Balmoral which was razed by the fires There are 70,000 people in the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, most of them unpaid. Earlier this month two volunteer firefighters - both young fathers - were killed whena tree fell on their truck as they drove towards a massive firein the state. The compensation scheme is a joint initiative between the federal government and NSW. The federal government says other states and territories could bring in similar schemes.

Volunteers who are employed by small- and medium-sized businesses or are self-employed will be able to apply for up to A$300 per day that they have volunteered if they have spent more than 10 days battling the flames. ""While I know RFS volunteers don't seek payment for their service, I don't want to see volunteers or families unable to pay bills, or struggle financially as a result of the selfless contribution they are making,"" Mr Morrison said. ""This is not about paying volunteers. It is about sustaining our volunteer efforts by protecting them from financial loss."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Nobody saw it coming. Hong Kong's year of protest and violence stunned everyone from observers to participants. What started the crisis was political - but emotion has fuelled it. We picked seven to explain this year of tears, exhilaration, broken relationships and personal pride. Text by the BBC's Grace Tsoi, portrait photographs by Curtis Lo Kwan Long. Saturday 30 March 2019 was the last normal day. Clear and sunny, it began like any other weekend in Hong Kong with its singular cocktail of frenetic leisure - family lunches, shopping late into the neon-lit night and cute selfies at every opportunity. The next day, something more political began. A few thousand people marched through a dispiriting drizzle to protest against a proposal that would have allowed extradition to China: ""With extradition to the mainland, Hong Kong becomes a dark prison,"" they chanted. It didn't get much coverage then. But the city was listening. Within six months, Hong Kong was a place of huge protest marches, street battles and an unapologetic police response of tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannon and live fire. Teenagers shot bows and arrows, the parliament chamber was vandalised, hundreds of young people now know how to make Molotov cocktails and start fires. But after the bill was withdrawn, the anger became more palpable if anything. Politics may have been the trigger, but reckless passion is the fuel and on display everywhere. Arguments have broken out on the street between strangers: one man was set on fire while arguing with anti-government protesters; a taxi driver full of rage ran his car through a group of protesters; a student fell to his death in unexplained circumstances; an elderly cleaner standing in the middle of the road gaping at a fight was hit by a stray brick careening through the air. He died. It is a difficult thing to report dispassionately on the descent of your home, a city famous for stability, into a surreal dystopian vision. People are worried about China's domination but they are also worried about what violence has done to the fabric of society. It seems as if nobody is sleeping well any more. The textbook factors of politics, economics, demographics, even democratic ideals, ideology and identity cannot fully explain this - but the emotional intensity generated by the interplay of it all completes the picture. Even though the politics divides, the emotions are what the city shares - and these stories have helped me understand Hong Kong's fraught predicament. When Fiona met her husband at school, she knew she would marry him one day. Now, in their late 30s, they have a picture-perfect family with two children. But this is the year everything changed. She is a protester. He is a policeman. ""I tell him I feel less love for him,"" Fiona says. They didn't discuss politics when they were dating - there was little politics to discuss then. It was only during the 2014 Occupy movement, which sought changes to Hong Kong's electoral system, that political differences emerged. She left home for the protest zone one month after she gave birth to their son, but felt wounded by the scorn of her husband. Despite that, she believed that love could bridge any differences. That's not the case any more and the turning point for her - as for many others in Hong Kong - came on 21 July. That night had seen protests erupt across the city. But as people headed home late in the evening another element entered the fray. In the rural district of Yuen Long, a large group of white-clad pro-government men, rumoured to be linked to triad gangs and armed with rods and poles, were waiting at the train station. They began beating people they believed to be protesters. ""I rushed out from the toilet with my phone in my hand. I told him the white shirts were beating up ordinary citizens in Yuen Long. He said he knew and went into the bedroom. He slept soundly that night, while I stayed wide awake."" Outrage swept across Hong Kong and by the following morning there were accusations that the police had not done enough. Their denials were insufficient to prevent Yuen Long being used as proof that the police were not there for the people but for the masters. The next weekend of protest was one of the most violent seen up to that point. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Fiona's anger only grew as police became more heavy-handed. She and her husband began quarrelling over alleged police brutality. Support for protesters, even as they went further in their violent action, is attested to by opinion polls. Protesters took out their rage on companies seen as pro-government: the MTR train operator saw stations and ticket machines vandalised, Chinese-owned ATMs were destroyed - this in a city famous for its respect for the rule of law. Yet the results of district election last month saw an overwhelming victory for pro-democratic figures. Fiona's husband, though, was not swayed. ""Why is he so foolish? He thinks there's nothing wrong with the Chinese Communist Party and the extradition bill,"" Fiona says. And so contempt crept into their relationship. Her husband, however, still loves her very much. ""He keeps sending me heart emojis. I used to reply to him with a heart but now I don't feel like doing it. And he keeps asking... ""I really want to love him again, but I can't."" She does acknowledge, though, that ""this is his pride. This is his identity."" It is an acknowledgement needed by those in Hong Kong who support the police and the government. For them, one of the most unsettling things about Hong Kong's year is not confrontations between police and protesters, but the political fights that erupt on the street. Just over a month ago Crystal Chu, a 49-year-old businesswoman, arrived at the border station of Sheung Shui at the call of a pro-Beijing group, which planned to stage a protest. About 100 of them were soon outnumbered by pro-democracy protesters. She was first pelted with eggs and projectiles and then she was hit in the head - she needed three stitches. ""That moment was horrifying. I feel like they came from hell,"" she says, at a loss to understand a dehumanising cycle of hatred against people simply expressing their views. ""They do this in the name of freedom. But it's just sheer violence."" The intensity of this hatred is being taken as a direct challenge to a system that has guaranteed stability, prosperity and a quiet life. For them, the pro-democracy movement is staffed by thugs with little understanding of political realities. ""Why don't they recognise themselves as Chinese? You can't deny this because we have black hair and yellow skin,"" Ms Chu says. ""Do you think Hong Kong can ever be separated from China?"" Few - on either side - have a clear grasp of the legal complexities of Hong Kong's special status, which makes safeguarding its fate all the more precarious. So the arguments end up being about ideology, identity and history. Ms Chu came from the mainland in her 20s. Many others of her generation, but born and bred in Hong Kong, will recall grandparents' tales about life in China. In the 1960s those grandparents may have swum over.  Although they left China behind, it remains part of their identity. The younger generation out on the streets does not share such memories - it is easier for them to disregard the older ties that bind. Their touchstones are globalised cultural memes of defiance: ""If we burn, you burn with us"" - they chant referencing The Hunger Games; Can You Hear the People Sing? they belt out from Les Miserables;  Pepe the Frog, a symbol of the alt right movement, was also adopted - certainly unwittingly. Ms Chu, though, feels alarm when strangers walk past quickly. Over the past six months, Celine, a protester in her 20s, has attended almost every single march or rally going - and fought hard. ""Every time I am terrified. But I still do the same next time."" The fear she has on the frontline is, she says, dwarfed by her fear of what could come if she doesn't act. She is afraid of the way China has weighed in on Hong Kong's politics. After five booksellers who sold salacious books about Chinese leaders turned up in Chinese custody, after China interpreted Hong Kong's mini-constitution so a few pro-democracy lawmakers could be disqualified, she asked herself: if they can do this now, what might happen when that mini-constitution expires in 2047? This is a fear shared by an entire generation. She will be in her 50s. Her generation will be parents. What will become of their children? In the beginning, she only set up roadblocks using bricks. Soon her hands no longer shook when she threw petrol bombs. Teenage protesters grappling with ""collective trauma Young, radical and ready for tear gas With each passing month of exhausting and escalating protest, she watched both her resolve harden and her fear increase. The clashes bring thrills but everything changed for her during the siege of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University in November. It was the site of a three-day showdown between police and protesters barricaded on the campus. Hours of intense fighting saw huge fires, petrol bombs, bricks and even bows and arrows being fired at police. Police struck back with rubber bullets, water cannon and tear gas so dense people could not see through the choking clouds. ""I thought I might die inside."" ""I saw a pool of blood,"" she says. ""Many people were bleeding from their heads and they were crying."" She eventually managed to escape without being arrested. Now, whenever she passes the university during bus rides she cries uncontrollably and finds it difficult to breathe. Many young protesters acknowledge that their actions, while raising awareness, may only increase the likelihood of a more fundamental crackdown at some point. They know the risks but it is about balancing the probabilities of fears. For those that speak out against protests - there is another, more deep-seated fear. They say that their Hong Kong, the safe prosperous society they built, is disappearing. Although staying silent was not ideal, they worry that this path is inevitable self-destruction from within rather than the feared assault from outside. Mr Tsang's mind went blank when he received a call one rainy October evening telling him that his daughter had been arrested in a protest. He was on a night shift as a security guard but hopped on a bus and arrived at the police station soaking wet. It was after midnight when he finally saw his daughter Alice. The 16-year-old was followed by police officers and her hands were bound. ""We didn't need to speak,"" Mr Tsang says. ""We could understand each other."" Alice has been charged with rioting, an offence which could lead to up to a decade in jail. She's one of about 1,000 underage demonstrators who have been arrested since protests started in June. She says she isn't a frontline protester, but couldn't leave the protest site because every route was surrounded by police. One of the most striking moments over the past few months was when school headteachers went to Polytechnic University to try to negotiate the release of their students. The first person to be shot by a live bullet was a secondary-school student. It is not just young people, but adolescents who have got involved. They may court dangerous thrills, but they believe they are safeguarding uncertain futures. Either way the trauma and the impact on this generation is yet to be properly understood. In Mr Tsang's eyes, Alice is an ordinary teenager who loves make-up and shopping. She's also a daddy's girl who sometimes gets jealous of the family cat: ""She says I love the cat more than her."" He has always known she was a protester: ""I can't lock her up at home. No parent should do that."" Yet he also witnessed a positive change in her because of the protests. She became more confident and made more friends. For a girl with depression and anxiety, that meant a lot. She is a living example of a culture of youth solidarity that has embodied these protests. They feel the older generation hasn't safeguarded their future, so it is in their hands - they have no options. He still lets her join protests, but only those with police approval - he does not want to crush her ideals. In 2013, Lily Wong became a widow. Her husband died of a heart attack, leaving her with two young sons. Three years ago she set up a snack shop as she didn't want to be on social welfare any more. Business had been booming at Ms Wong's snack shop. Patrons travelled from other districts to taste her handmade steamed rice rolls, pudding cakes and herbal drinks. Recently, she thought that she might just be able save enough for a mortgage down payment. But all that changed after she uploaded a photo to Facebook of her attending a pro-police rally. Ms Wong says she supports the police because it is the duty of police officers to maintain law and order. ""I don't regret uploading the photo because I just expressed my personal opinion."" How is Hong Kong runand what is the Basic Law? Avisual guideto how one peaceful protest turned violent The backlash was immediate. Young people stopped coming to her shop and it has become the target of health and safety complaints. This video can not be played Hong Kong protests: ""I was born here, I'm a Hongkonger too"" In October, officials from different departments visited her shop almost every other day, she says: they came to investigate things like food hygiene and compliance with fire regulations. Apps in Hong Kong now identify outlets as either ""blue"" -  sympathetic towards police - or ""yellow"", which means protest sympathisers. During one such visit, she broke down in tears: ""I was very emotional. I support my family and I want stability for them. But it felt like I was being pushed to the edge of a cliff."" Ms Wong mourns the loss of the old Hong Kong. ""Hong Kong is a wonderful place. No matter one's education level, as long as one's willing to work, one will not starve,"" she says. ""Now, even eating is decided by colours."" She understands young people feel the need to fight for their future, but feels they are ignoring the cost of their actions and the fruits of the efforts of past generations. ""Society has been torn by politics, and I feel sad for it."" It was Derek's childhood dream to become a policeman. Officers always look sharp in cop movies and he truly believed he could help people. But now he wants to quit. Obedience is the most prized quality for police officers, as Derek has known from his first day - with little room for dissent. For months, as violence has raged in Hong Kong, police officers have been wearing masks and their warrant cards have not been on display. Police say the masks are protective, but protesters say police are trying to conceal their identity to escape accountability. ""When I am on duty, I don't hide my face and I show my police number,"" Derek says. ""This is a principle I adhere to."" But this had implications for him on the front line when a senior officer questioned his motives. For the police, this has all been genuinely tough. Officers have to put in at least 15 hours a day. Riot gear is heavy and it's exhausting to run around in the scorching sun. Policemen and their families have been doxxed - meaning their personal information has been leaked online - many feel this is just for doing their job. They face hatred just as much as they are accused of fuelling it. How is Hong Kong run? Seven ways China's media took on HK protests Nonetheless, Derek feels there are no excuses for the unruly behaviour of police officers caught on camera beating protesters or opening fire: ""Frontline officers have no restraint and use excessive force,"" he says. He disapproves of unquestioning loyalty within the police force - but he thinks the same thing is happening among protesters. He can't accept any assault on people of different political persuasions. ""I asked my pro-protest friends if they would distance themselves from this - all of them said no,"" Derek says. So he doesn't know where he stands in this new Hong Kong. For mainland-born Benjamin, the protests have finally made him consider himself a Hongkonger - after more than a decade. On 16 June he spent five hours marching from Victoria Park to Admiralty by himself - a march that protesters said was attended by two million people. ""I am proud of this city,"" Benjamin says. He was touched by the resolve of the peaceful marchers. But he is at odds with the community known as gang piao - (a Mandarin term which means Hong Kong drifters). These are the well-educated Chinese elites who move to Hong Kong. Every year, the government accepts 20,000 such ""drifters"", often scorned by locals for taking jobs. ""I can say 99 out of 100 drifters see their Chinese identity as unassailable,"" Benjamin says, and that they see a distinct Hong Kong identity as unacceptable. Many mainlanders feel they have dedicated themselves to the city, but are suspected of just being ""brainwashed"" automatons. They cannot help but wonder if a touch of xenophobia is involved, even from people who they believe to be of their ""own kind"" - another example of how complex identity and allegiances are. After university, Benjamin was determined to leave mainland China. He valued personal freedoms and had a natural scepticism towards the authoritarian Chinese government. But it has also been difficult for him to build friendships with locals because of differences in background and language. ""We can... have dinner together,"" he says. ""But we can't become good friends."" An August encounter with a pro-protest Uber driver sticks in his mind. After a minor argument over a pick-up, ""he said to me that he could tell I am not from here by my accent,"" Benjamin recounts. When he and two friends were thrown out of the car, his friends seized the opportunity. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 ""They said, 'Don't you stand on their side? Oh, they don't see you as one of them?'"" He is now looking to move away from Hong Kong and China. The city is living a double life. Protests at the weekend, business as usual on weekdays. But Hong Kong has entered its first recession in a decade, with the number of tourists plummeting more than 40%. Mr Chan, who has been working as a hawker for more than four decades, knows that tough times have come. Before the protests, he made more than HK$1,000 (about $130; Â£100) every day. ""Now we only make a few hundred dollars."" His account is a corrective to the narrative that economic decline will infuriate Hongkongers - it hasn't yet. But shops are closing down and people are feeling financial pain. Despite this, the 67-year-old remains unfazed, even though Kowloon has become a battleground. A Guangzhou native, Mr Chan was witness to the Cultural Revolution - he once saw a peasant being beaten to death by children. He swam to Hong Kong in 1973. Mr Chan doesn't blame the protesters for his losses. ""The future belongs to the youth, and they are fighting for things they want,"" he says. ""We have enjoyed the most prosperous time, and we can only accept when things go downhill. It's as simple as that."" James was in school for the 2014 Occupy Movement which eventually fizzled out - the protesters had lost. On the last night before the clearance of the protest site, someone hung a banner with the words: ""It's just the beginning."" ""People said we would be back. In the beginning I wasn't that optimistic. I thought it would take at least 10 years,"" James says. ""I didn't know it would happen so quickly."" James was in awe when a million took to the streets on 9 June. But he was especially touched by a July march organised by senior citizens who call themselves ""the silver-haired"".  He did not know there would be so many older people who support the protests. It was not the same experience at home - where he sees protesters as critical to defending Hong Kong's civil liberties, his parents think they are trouble-makers. ""My mother said it was right to beat people, and it's better to punish them all."" These differences have also upset his mother: ""I have raised him... provided an education for him. The way he treats his elders makes me uncomfortable,"" she says. ""He said I am not educated and know nothing. ""I don't care about which side he supports politically. But he can't treat his parents this way."" Seeing the older protesters was a moment of exhilaration for him, a bridge between generations. These protests have been pivotal in cementing identity for thousands more like James across Hong Kong. It is no longer just a free-wheeling capitalist dream, where as long as you make money political apathy will rule the day. In just over 20 years it has seen one of the most rapid developments of group identity. But it doesn't just go one way. ""China has developed well,"" says Lily Wong, who runs the snack shop. ""Young people don't understand their identities and their origins."" She is one of those who feels the breath of China over their shoulder and is not chilled by it - but reassured. They too have enjoyed being open about their feelings despite threats and condemnation from the many who support the cause of the protesters. What nobody can do is tell us where Hong Kong goes from here. What they all know is that no matter what their view, they will fight with all their heart for what they believe is the best for the city. Names have been changed, apart from Crystal Chu and Lily Wong. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The background you need on Hong Kong's protests Â© 2025 BBC.

"Former deputy leader of the Labour Party Tom Watson has said he stood down as an MP because of ""brutality and hostility"" within his party. The former West Bromwich East MP, who stood down last month,told the Guardian,externalcriticism from factions and on social media became a ""heavy load"". Mr Watson also claimed party officials concealed a death threat towards him. The 52-year-old, who has lost eight stone in weight, is retraining as a gym instructor. Speaking to the Guardian's Weekend magazine in the wake of Labour's election defeat on 12 December, Mr Watson said ofhis decision to stand down: ""The point is that the brutality and hostility is real and it's day to day. ""So I just thought: now's the time to take a leap, do something different. You've had a good innings. You've done good stuff. Go now."" Asked to expand on the culture he experienced, he said: ""The return of political factionalism. The idea that you could be portrayed as the enemy within. People questioning your motives. ""Social media pile-ons. Condemnation from powerful trade union general secretaries on broadcast media. Internal bickering."" This video can not be played Tom Watson: ""This is a very personal decision for me, I've got lots of other things I want to do in life"" The Guardian said Mr Watson had praised outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn personally but had criticised his leadership. He also admitted voting for rival Owen Smith during the party's 2016 leadership election, which followed dozens of resignations from the shadow cabinet and a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn that was passed by 172 to 40 Labour MPs. ""I thought, as soon as the leader loses the confidence of the parliamentary party it's almost impossible to see how you can form a government. ""I thought Jeremy should have resigned, and he nearly did."" The party is nowpreparing for a fresh leadership racein the wake of the recent election result. The Conservatives won an 80 seat majorityafter Labour's ""red wall"" across the Midlands and the north of England crumbled. Those seats included Mr Watson's former constituency, West Bromwich East, which was gained by the Tories for the first time with a majority of 1,593. In his first sit-down interview since the result, Mr Watson also asked questions of Labour's campaign strategy. ""There were announcements everywhere, but none of them got through because there were so many,"" he said. ""You knew what Boris Johnson's was: get Brexit done. What was the Labour strapline?"" Former Labour MP Andy Burnham, who is now Greater Manchester Mayor, said he recognised Mr Watson's description of the party, adding: ""We cannot carry on as we are"". ""The tone of public discourse, generally but also internally, has become poisonous at times and I think Tom was very much bearing the brunt of that,"" he toldRadio 4's Today programme. And Mr Burnham - who finished runner-up to Mr Corbyn in the 2015 Labour leadership contest - called on candidates bidding to replace Mr Corbyn as party leader to help make Labour ""a broad church where we respect each other... as soon as possible.""

"Rory Burns, who was dropped on 20, has made six half-centuries in 14 Tests for England First Test, Supersport Park, Centurion (day three of five): South Africa 284(De Kock 95, Curran 4-58)& 272(Van der Dussen 51, Archer 5-102) England 181(Denly 50, Philander 4-16) &121-1(Burns 77*) England chasing 376 to win Scorecard Rory Burns' unbeaten 77 gave England hope of chasing an unlikely 376 to beat South Africa in the first Test in Centurion. The opener, who put on 92 for the first wicket with Dom Sibley, steered England to 121-1 at the close of day three, with 255 still needed for what would be England's highest run chase. South Africa were dismissed for 272 as Jofra Archer took 5-102. England, though, were afflicted by illness on day three. Jos Buttler did not take to the field and was replaced behind the stumps by Jonny Bairstow, while captain Joe Root also spent time off the field. TMS podcast: Could England record chase be on the cards? England hopeful Root & Buttler will be fit to bat England's Test team of the decade - as chosen by you England will need to complete their highest run chase, surpassing the 362 they made to beat Australia at Headingley in August, if they are to win this Test. England's highest successful Test run chases 362-9v Australia, Headingley, 2019 332-7v Australia, Melbourne, 1928 315-4v Australia, Headingley, 2001 307-6v New Zealand, Christchurch, 1997 298-4v Australia, Melbourne, 1895 The highest successful chase at Centurion by a visiting team is England's 251-8 in 2000, a Test which waslater referenced in a match-fixing trial,externalinvolving then South Africa skipper Hansie Cronje. Burns and Sibley played well in conditions that were suited to bowling. Burns was the more fluent of the two, hitting several confident drives through mid-wicket, while Sibley was patient against a disciplined attack. The chase looked to have got off to a poor start when Burns was given out lbw to Kagiso Rabada for six in the first over, but a review showed the ball was missing off stump. Burns also profited from another mistake in the field as the metronomic Vernon Philander found the outside edge on 20, and the low offering was dropped by Rassie van der Dussen at first slip. Sibley grew in confidence, clipping Dwaine Pretorius through mid-wicket for four, as the two shared England's highest opening partnership of 2019. However, Sibley was visibly frustrated after he chipped a Keshav Maharaj delivery straight back to the bowler. South Africa are without a win in five Tests but, on a pitch that has shown uneven bounce since the first day, it will still require a huge effort from England to secure an unlikely win. Jofra Archer (centre) claimed three of the six South Africa wickets to fall on day three England's performance in the morning session was reminiscent of their recent overseas tours to Australia: a tired bowling attack, lacking consistency, being flayed around the ground. They had their chances, with substitute fielder Zak Crawley missing a run-out of Van der Dussen early on - and his 91-run stand with nightwatchman Anrich Nortje further frustrated England. The tourists did not bowl full enough to Van der Dussen - he was eventually trapped lbw for 51 by a pitched-up Archer delivery - and allowed Nortje to settle into a rhythm before he eventually fended Archer to short leg. Quinton de Kock attacked Archer, hooking consecutive 90mph deliveries for six, and could have done further damage had he not walked after edging Stokes to Bairstow. The final four batsmen added 102 runs as England's bowlers were kept out in the field for much of the day, with Philander scoring 46. Archer claimed his third five-wicket haul in seven Tests but he finished the innings with an economy rate of 6.00. While England have been hampered by illness in the build-up to this Test, they looked worryingly flat so early in such a big series. England in South Africa - fixtures & results South Africa's Philander to join Somerset BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""England's chance of winning is probably 5%, but you are against a team who has lost any kind of winning habit at all. ""It is important to remember it is certainly not 0%, which it was halfway through this afternoon. South Africa's bowling didn't seem to have much confidence or belief about it."" England batting coach Graham Thorpe on the Test Match Special podcast:""We've got a chance. ""We know the fight we've got in our dressing room and what we're going to try and achieve tomorrow."" Ex-England assistant coach Paul Farbrace on The Cricket Social:""England have batted themselves into a good position. ""The first hour tomorrow will be really important.

"Nobody saw it coming. Hong Kong's year of protest and violence stunned everyone from observers to participants. What started the crisis was political - but emotion has fuelled it. We picked seven to explain this year of tears, exhilaration, broken relationships and personal pride. Text by the BBC's Grace Tsoi, portrait photographs by Curtis Lo Kwan Long. Saturday 30 March 2019 was the last normal day. Clear and sunny, it began like any other weekend in Hong Kong with its singular cocktail of frenetic leisure - family lunches, shopping late into the neon-lit night and cute selfies at every opportunity. The next day, something more political began. A few thousand people marched through a dispiriting drizzle to protest against a proposal that would have allowed extradition to China: ""With extradition to the mainland, Hong Kong becomes a dark prison,"" they chanted. It didn't get much coverage then. But the city was listening. Within six months, Hong Kong was a place of huge protest marches, street battles and an unapologetic police response of tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannon and live fire. Teenagers shot bows and arrows, the parliament chamber was vandalised, hundreds of young people now know how to make Molotov cocktails and start fires. But after the bill was withdrawn, the anger became more palpable if anything. Politics may have been the trigger, but reckless passion is the fuel and on display everywhere. Arguments have broken out on the street between strangers: one man was set on fire while arguing with anti-government protesters; a taxi driver full of rage ran his car through a group of protesters; a student fell to his death in unexplained circumstances; an elderly cleaner standing in the middle of the road gaping at a fight was hit by a stray brick careening through the air. He died. It is a difficult thing to report dispassionately on the descent of your home, a city famous for stability, into a surreal dystopian vision. People are worried about China's domination but they are also worried about what violence has done to the fabric of society. It seems as if nobody is sleeping well any more. The textbook factors of politics, economics, demographics, even democratic ideals, ideology and identity cannot fully explain this - but the emotional intensity generated by the interplay of it all completes the picture. Even though the politics divides, the emotions are what the city shares - and these stories have helped me understand Hong Kong's fraught predicament. When Fiona met her husband at school, she knew she would marry him one day. Now, in their late 30s, they have a picture-perfect family with two children. But this is the year everything changed. She is a protester. He is a policeman. ""I tell him I feel less love for him,"" Fiona says. They didn't discuss politics when they were dating - there was little politics to discuss then. It was only during the 2014 Occupy movement, which sought changes to Hong Kong's electoral system, that political differences emerged. She left home for the protest zone one month after she gave birth to their son, but felt wounded by the scorn of her husband. Despite that, she believed that love could bridge any differences. That's not the case any more and the turning point for her - as for many others in Hong Kong - came on 21 July. That night had seen protests erupt across the city. But as people headed home late in the evening another element entered the fray. In the rural district of Yuen Long, a large group of white-clad pro-government men, rumoured to be linked to triad gangs and armed with rods and poles, were waiting at the train station. They began beating people they believed to be protesters. ""I rushed out from the toilet with my phone in my hand. I told him the white shirts were beating up ordinary citizens in Yuen Long. He said he knew and went into the bedroom. He slept soundly that night, while I stayed wide awake."" Outrage swept across Hong Kong and by the following morning there were accusations that the police had not done enough. Their denials were insufficient to prevent Yuen Long being used as proof that the police were not there for the people but for the masters. The next weekend of protest was one of the most violent seen up to that point. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The background you need on the Hong Kong protests Fiona's anger only grew as police became more heavy-handed. She and her husband began quarrelling over alleged police brutality. Support for protesters, even as they went further in their violent action, is attested to by opinion polls. Protesters took out their rage on companies seen as pro-government: the MTR train operator saw stations and ticket machines vandalised, Chinese-owned ATMs were destroyed - this in a city famous for its respect for the rule of law. Yet the results of district election last month saw an overwhelming victory for pro-democratic figures. Fiona's husband, though, was not swayed. ""Why is he so foolish? He thinks there's nothing wrong with the Chinese Communist Party and the extradition bill,"" Fiona says. And so contempt crept into their relationship. Her husband, however, still loves her very much. ""He keeps sending me heart emojis. I used to reply to him with a heart but now I don't feel like doing it. And he keeps asking... ""I really want to love him again, but I can't."" She does acknowledge, though, that ""this is his pride. This is his identity."" It is an acknowledgement needed by those in Hong Kong who support the police and the government. For them, one of the most unsettling things about Hong Kong's year is not confrontations between police and protesters, but the political fights that erupt on the street. Just over a month ago Crystal Chu, a 49-year-old businesswoman, arrived at the border station of Sheung Shui at the call of a pro-Beijing group, which planned to stage a protest. About 100 of them were soon outnumbered by pro-democracy protesters. She was first pelted with eggs and projectiles and then she was hit in the head - she needed three stitches. ""That moment was horrifying. I feel like they came from hell,"" she says, at a loss to understand a dehumanising cycle of hatred against people simply expressing their views. ""They do this in the name of freedom. But it's just sheer violence."" The intensity of this hatred is being taken as a direct challenge to a system that has guaranteed stability, prosperity and a quiet life. For them, the pro-democracy movement is staffed by thugs with little understanding of political realities. ""Why don't they recognise themselves as Chinese? You can't deny this because we have black hair and yellow skin,"" Ms Chu says. ""Do you think Hong Kong can ever be separated from China?"" Few - on either side - have a clear grasp of the legal complexities of Hong Kong's special status, which makes safeguarding its fate all the more precarious. So the arguments end up being about ideology, identity and history. Ms Chu came from the mainland in her 20s. Many others of her generation, but born and bred in Hong Kong, will recall grandparents' tales about life in China. In the 1960s those grandparents may have swum over.  Although they left China behind, it remains part of their identity. The younger generation out on the streets does not share such memories - it is easier for them to disregard the older ties that bind. Their touchstones are globalised cultural memes of defiance: ""If we burn, you burn with us"" - they chant referencing The Hunger Games; Can You Hear the People Sing? they belt out from Les Miserables;  Pepe the Frog, a symbol of the alt right movement, was also adopted - certainly unwittingly. Ms Chu, though, feels alarm when strangers walk past quickly. Over the past six months, Celine, a protester in her 20s, has attended almost every single march or rally going - and fought hard. ""Every time I am terrified. But I still do the same next time."" The fear she has on the frontline is, she says, dwarfed by her fear of what could come if she doesn't act. She is afraid of the way China has weighed in on Hong Kong's politics. After five booksellers who sold salacious books about Chinese leaders turned up in Chinese custody, after China interpreted Hong Kong's mini-constitution so a few pro-democracy lawmakers could be disqualified, she asked herself: if they can do this now, what might happen when that mini-constitution expires in 2047? This is a fear shared by an entire generation. She will be in her 50s. Her generation will be parents. What will become of their children? In the beginning, she only set up roadblocks using bricks. Soon her hands no longer shook when she threw petrol bombs. Teenage protesters grappling with ""collective trauma Young, radical and ready for tear gas With each passing month of exhausting and escalating protest, she watched both her resolve harden and her fear increase. The clashes bring thrills but everything changed for her during the siege of Hong Kong's Polytechnic University in November. It was the site of a three-day showdown between police and protesters barricaded on the campus. Hours of intense fighting saw huge fires, petrol bombs, bricks and even bows and arrows being fired at police. Police struck back with rubber bullets, water cannon and tear gas so dense people could not see through the choking clouds. ""I thought I might die inside."" ""I saw a pool of blood,"" she says. ""Many people were bleeding from their heads and they were crying."" She eventually managed to escape without being arrested. Now, whenever she passes the university during bus rides she cries uncontrollably and finds it difficult to breathe. Many young protesters acknowledge that their actions, while raising awareness, may only increase the likelihood of a more fundamental crackdown at some point. They know the risks but it is about balancing the probabilities of fears. For those that speak out against protests - there is another, more deep-seated fear. They say that their Hong Kong, the safe prosperous society they built, is disappearing. Although staying silent was not ideal, they worry that this path is inevitable self-destruction from within rather than the feared assault from outside. Mr Tsang's mind went blank when he received a call one rainy October evening telling him that his daughter had been arrested in a protest. He was on a night shift as a security guard but hopped on a bus and arrived at the police station soaking wet. It was after midnight when he finally saw his daughter Alice. The 16-year-old was followed by police officers and her hands were bound. ""We didn't need to speak,"" Mr Tsang says. ""We could understand each other."" Alice has been charged with rioting, an offence which could lead to up to a decade in jail. She's one of about 1,000 underage demonstrators who have been arrested since protests started in June. She says she isn't a frontline protester, but couldn't leave the protest site because every route was surrounded by police. One of the most striking moments over the past few months was when school headteachers went to Polytechnic University to try to negotiate the release of their students. The first person to be shot by a live bullet was a secondary-school student. It is not just young people, but adolescents who have got involved. They may court dangerous thrills, but they believe they are safeguarding uncertain futures. Either way the trauma and the impact on this generation is yet to be properly understood. In Mr Tsang's eyes, Alice is an ordinary teenager who loves make-up and shopping. She's also a daddy's girl who sometimes gets jealous of the family cat: ""She says I love the cat more than her."" He has always known she was a protester: ""I can't lock her up at home. No parent should do that."" Yet he also witnessed a positive change in her because of the protests. She became more confident and made more friends. For a girl with depression and anxiety, that meant a lot. She is a living example of a culture of youth solidarity that has embodied these protests. They feel the older generation hasn't safeguarded their future, so it is in their hands - they have no options. He still lets her join protests, but only those with police approval - he does not want to crush her ideals. In 2013, Lily Wong became a widow. Her husband died of a heart attack, leaving her with two young sons. Three years ago she set up a snack shop as she didn't want to be on social welfare any more. Business had been booming at Ms Wong's snack shop. Patrons travelled from other districts to taste her handmade steamed rice rolls, pudding cakes and herbal drinks. Recently, she thought that she might just be able save enough for a mortgage down payment. But all that changed after she uploaded a photo to Facebook of her attending a pro-police rally. Ms Wong says she supports the police because it is the duty of police officers to maintain law and order. ""I don't regret uploading the photo because I just expressed my personal opinion."" How is Hong Kong runand what is the Basic Law? Avisual guideto how one peaceful protest turned violent The backlash was immediate. Young people stopped coming to her shop and it has become the target of health and safety complaints. This video can not be played Hong Kong protests: ""I was born here, I'm a Hongkonger too"" In October, officials from different departments visited her shop almost every other day, she says: they came to investigate things like food hygiene and compliance with fire regulations. Apps in Hong Kong now identify outlets as either ""blue"" -  sympathetic towards police - or ""yellow"", which means protest sympathisers. During one such visit, she broke down in tears: ""I was very emotional. I support my family and I want stability for them. But it felt like I was being pushed to the edge of a cliff."" Ms Wong mourns the loss of the old Hong Kong. ""Hong Kong is a wonderful place. No matter one's education level, as long as one's willing to work, one will not starve,"" she says. ""Now, even eating is decided by colours."" She understands young people feel the need to fight for their future, but feels they are ignoring the cost of their actions and the fruits of the efforts of past generations. ""Society has been torn by politics, and I feel sad for it."" It was Derek's childhood dream to become a policeman. Officers always look sharp in cop movies and he truly believed he could help people. But now he wants to quit. Obedience is the most prized quality for police officers, as Derek has known from his first day - with little room for dissent. For months, as violence has raged in Hong Kong, police officers have been wearing masks and their warrant cards have not been on display. Police say the masks are protective, but protesters say police are trying to conceal their identity to escape accountability. ""When I am on duty, I don't hide my face and I show my police number,"" Derek says. ""This is a principle I adhere to."" But this had implications for him on the front line when a senior officer questioned his motives. For the police, this has all been genuinely tough. Officers have to put in at least 15 hours a day. Riot gear is heavy and it's exhausting to run around in the scorching sun. Policemen and their families have been doxxed - meaning their personal information has been leaked online - many feel this is just for doing their job. They face hatred just as much as they are accused of fuelling it. How is Hong Kong run? Seven ways China's media took on HK protests Nonetheless, Derek feels there are no excuses for the unruly behaviour of police officers caught on camera beating protesters or opening fire: ""Frontline officers have no restraint and use excessive force,"" he says. He disapproves of unquestioning loyalty within the police force - but he thinks the same thing is happening among protesters. He can't accept any assault on people of different political persuasions. ""I asked my pro-protest friends if they would distance themselves from this - all of them said no,"" Derek says. So he doesn't know where he stands in this new Hong Kong. For mainland-born Benjamin, the protests have finally made him consider himself a Hongkonger - after more than a decade. On 16 June he spent five hours marching from Victoria Park to Admiralty by himself - a march that protesters said was attended by two million people. ""I am proud of this city,"" Benjamin says. He was touched by the resolve of the peaceful marchers. But he is at odds with the community known as gang piao - (a Mandarin term which means Hong Kong drifters). These are the well-educated Chinese elites who move to Hong Kong. Every year, the government accepts 20,000 such ""drifters"", often scorned by locals for taking jobs. ""I can say 99 out of 100 drifters see their Chinese identity as unassailable,"" Benjamin says, and that they see a distinct Hong Kong identity as unacceptable. Many mainlanders feel they have dedicated themselves to the city, but are suspected of just being ""brainwashed"" automatons. They cannot help but wonder if a touch of xenophobia is involved, even from people who they believe to be of their ""own kind"" - another example of how complex identity and allegiances are. After university, Benjamin was determined to leave mainland China. He valued personal freedoms and had a natural scepticism towards the authoritarian Chinese government. But it has also been difficult for him to build friendships with locals because of differences in background and language. ""We can... have dinner together,"" he says. ""But we can't become good friends."" An August encounter with a pro-protest Uber driver sticks in his mind. After a minor argument over a pick-up, ""he said to me that he could tell I am not from here by my accent,"" Benjamin recounts. When he and two friends were thrown out of the car, his friends seized the opportunity. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 ""They said, 'Don't you stand on their side? Oh, they don't see you as one of them?'"" He is now looking to move away from Hong Kong and China. The city is living a double life. Protests at the weekend, business as usual on weekdays. But Hong Kong has entered its first recession in a decade, with the number of tourists plummeting more than 40%. Mr Chan, who has been working as a hawker for more than four decades, knows that tough times have come. Before the protests, he made more than HK$1,000 (about $130; Â£100) every day. ""Now we only make a few hundred dollars."" His account is a corrective to the narrative that economic decline will infuriate Hongkongers - it hasn't yet. But shops are closing down and people are feeling financial pain. Despite this, the 67-year-old remains unfazed, even though Kowloon has become a battleground. A Guangzhou native, Mr Chan was witness to the Cultural Revolution - he once saw a peasant being beaten to death by children. He swam to Hong Kong in 1973. Mr Chan doesn't blame the protesters for his losses. ""The future belongs to the youth, and they are fighting for things they want,"" he says. ""We have enjoyed the most prosperous time, and we can only accept when things go downhill. It's as simple as that."" James was in school for the 2014 Occupy Movement which eventually fizzled out - the protesters had lost. On the last night before the clearance of the protest site, someone hung a banner with the words: ""It's just the beginning."" ""People said we would be back. In the beginning I wasn't that optimistic. I thought it would take at least 10 years,"" James says. ""I didn't know it would happen so quickly."" James was in awe when a million took to the streets on 9 June. But he was especially touched by a July march organised by senior citizens who call themselves ""the silver-haired"".  He did not know there would be so many older people who support the protests. It was not the same experience at home - where he sees protesters as critical to defending Hong Kong's civil liberties, his parents think they are trouble-makers. ""My mother said it was right to beat people, and it's better to punish them all."" These differences have also upset his mother: ""I have raised him... provided an education for him. The way he treats his elders makes me uncomfortable,"" she says. ""He said I am not educated and know nothing. ""I don't care about which side he supports politically. But he can't treat his parents this way."" Seeing the older protesters was a moment of exhilaration for him, a bridge between generations. These protests have been pivotal in cementing identity for thousands more like James across Hong Kong. It is no longer just a free-wheeling capitalist dream, where as long as you make money political apathy will rule the day. In just over 20 years it has seen one of the most rapid developments of group identity. But it doesn't just go one way. ""China has developed well,"" says Lily Wong, who runs the snack shop. ""Young people don't understand their identities and their origins."" She is one of those who feels the breath of China over their shoulder and is not chilled by it - but reassured. They too have enjoyed being open about their feelings despite threats and condemnation from the many who support the cause of the protesters. What nobody can do is tell us where Hong Kong goes from here. What they all know is that no matter what their view, they will fight with all their heart for what they believe is the best for the city.

"More has to be done about the number of plastic ""bags for life"" distributed by retailers, according to a Welsh Government report. It said the 5p levy had reduced the sale of single-use carrier bags since it was introduced in 2011. But the largest 10 supermarket chains in Wales issued 65.2 million reusable plastic bags between 2017 and 2018. Environmental charities,externalsaid they were still treated as disposable by many people. Wales became the first UK nation to introduce a requirement to charge for most single-use carrier bags in 2011, making a plastic ""bag for life"" a more cost-effective alternative. However, arecent study,externalconcluded that most need to be used at least four times to be more environmentally friendly, and many do not see this lifespan. This video can not be played Plastic pollution: could plastic bags help save the planet? A total of 94.1 million single-use carrier bags were issued in Wales in 2017-18, compared with 119.4 million in 2015-16. Many larger retailers are opting to further reduce their carbon footprint, offering paper bag alternatives to single-use carrier bags and ""bags for life"". Bags for life 'adding to rising plastic waste' Wales 'leads way' cutting plastic bag use Morrisons to trial 20p paper bags Morrisons introduced paper bags earlier this year and said they hope it will remove an estimated 1,300 tonnes of plastic from the environment each year. Andy Atkinson, group customer and marketing director, said: ""Our customers have told us that reducing plastic is their number one environmental concern so introducing the paper bag across the nation will provide another way of reducing the plastic in their lives."" Morrisons said paper bags have been popular with customers Prof Wouter Poorting, an environmental psychologist at Cardiff University, said the decline in purchases of single-use carrier bags showed the charge had remained highly effective in changing people's behaviour. However, he added that paper bags were not the answer and the Welsh Government should increase the price of ""bags for life"" to provide a greater incentive to reuse them or bring alternatives. ""Although they are not made of plastic, they are effectively single-use,"" Mr Poorting said. ""What a lot of people don't know is that it takes more energy to produce paper bags, so they are not good for the environment either."" The Welsh Government said it was ""proud to be the first country in the UK to introduce a charge for single use carrier bags"". A spokesman said: ""We are committed to doing everything we can to reduce the amount of waste.""

"The cocaine was discovered in soy flour containers bound for Togo Uruguay says it has seized a record haul of 6 tonnes of cocaine, calling it the biggest setback for traffickers in the country's history. Naval and customs officers seized 4.4 tonnes of the drug in Montevideo port. It had been hidden in four soy flour containers destined for Lome, the capital of Togo. Another 1.5 tonnes was later found on a ranch, local reports said. The drugs have an estimated total street value of about $1.3bn (Â£1bn). Uruguay is increasingly being used as a transit point to move drugs from Latin America to Africa and Europe. The country's previous record haul was in November, when authorities uncovered a container with three tonnes of cocaine, also in Montevideo, bound for Cotonou in Benin via the Spanish island of Tenerife. Is the Netherlands becoming a narco-state? The 4.4 tonnes found recently came to light when scanners at Montevideo's port showed ""anomalies"" in the containers, officials said. Suspicions had already been raised by the fact that the export firm had not transported much soya in the past, soya is not widely consumed in Africa and nearly a third of cocaine consumed in Europe is smuggled there via Africa, local media reported. Navy spokesman Diego Perona told journalists that the first container was found to contain more than 3,000 ""bricks"" of cocaine each weighing 1.1kg (2.4lb). The containers were due to be loaded on to an Italian-registered ship, local media reported. Uruguay's customs director Jaime Borgiani said the 4.4 tonnes of cocaine would be worth $1bn in the European market. He said it was not known exactly where the cocaine had originated but that it was loaded on to trucks on Tuesday at a ranch in the south-western Soriano department, 290km (180 miles) from Montevideo. The interior ministry said police raided the ranch and found more cocaine there, with Uruguay's El PaÃ­s newspaper reporting that a further 1.5 tonnes of the drug were seized. The ranch's owner and his son were arrested along with two workers. The ministry posted a photo of some of the drugs on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

""The important thing is to show the world and drug traffickers that you don't mess around with Uruguayan customs,"" Mr Borgiani said. ""We've taken the necessary steps to rid the country of this scourge."" There has been a surge in the availability of cocaine due to a huge increase in global cultivation of the coca leaf plant, which is at its highest level for almost 20 years. Earlier this year the EU drugs agency warned that European authorities were seizing record quantities of increasingly pure cocaine, whileenterprising criminals were setting up ""cocaine call centres""to provide fast and flexible delivery services. Issues such as the use of large shipping containers to transport cocaine were proving a major challenge, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drugs Addiction (EMCDDA) said.
