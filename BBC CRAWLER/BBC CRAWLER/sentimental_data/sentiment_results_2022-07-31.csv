"Matt Walls went over the barriers and into the crowd as he tried to avoid a crash 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. England cyclist Matt Walls has been released from hospital after he was involved in a crash in which both he and his bike flew into the crowd. The 24-year-old Olympic champion has ""stitches in his forehead, scrapes and bruises"" but no major injuries, said Team England. He was treated in the stands at Lee Valley VeloPark for 40 minutes. The Isle of Man's Matt Bostock and Canada's Derek Gee were also taken to hospital for tests. Spectators were also injured, with one taken away in a wheelchair. The rest of the session was abandoned and spectators were asked to leave while Walls was having treatment. A Team England statement said:  ""Following medical treatment in hospital, Matt Walls has been discharged with stitches in his forehead, scrapes and bruises but thankfully no major injuries."" Walls later tweeted,externalto thank people for their messages of support, adding: ""I've somehow come away with no serious injures, just a few stitches and pretty banged up. ""I really hope everyone else involved is OK, including the spectators that may have been injured."" This video can not be played 'Could have been an awful lot worse' - details shared on Walls cycling crash The crash happened in the final lap of the men's scratch race qualifying as eight riders collided on the track. Walls had been trying to avoid riders who had fallen in an incident that began on the entrance to the corner. The stricken pair of New Zealander George Jackson and Australia's Josh Duffy were sliding up the banking, forcing Walls up on to the barrier and then over it into the crowd. Footage from the race showed Walls colliding with several spectators. Gee also surfed the top of the barrier but managed to avoid following Walls into the stands. A Birmingham 2022 spokesperson said: ""Three cyclists and two spectators have been treated by the on-site medical team. ""The three cyclists have been taken to hospital. The two spectators did not require hospital treatment."" Walls won omnium gold and madison silver for Team GB at last summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo. Canadian Mathias Guillemette was disqualified from the race for causing the initial crash. Walls' crash came just a day after England team-mate Joe Truman was knocked unconscious and suffered a broken collarbone in a collision in the keirin. On Sunday, England's Laura Kenny said both Walls' and Truman's crashes had had an effect on her. ""I messaged Jason [Kenny - her husband] and said, 'I'm not sure I want to do this',"" she said. ""It puts everything into perspective when something like that happens. ""We all know it's a dangerous sport so when you're not feeling physically fit to put yourself at the front of it you can't help but think, 'why am I doing this?'."" She added: ""I think the crashes are getting worse and it's because the speeds are getting higher, the positions [on the bike] are getting more extreme. ""At some point [cycling governing body] the UCI are going to have to put a cap on these positions. Maybe there should be screens because Matt should not have been able to go over the top and into the crowd, that's pretty damn dangerous. ""It's the third time now I've been in a velodrome and witnessed someone go over the top. ""[Matt] was laughing and making jokes with the paramedics, which is brilliant to hear but if he'd [not gone over] he would have done less damage."" Sir Chris Hoy, former Olympic, Commonwealth and world champion, speaking to BBC Sport This was a direct result of not having some form of barrier at the top of the fencing. It might seem strange that there is nothing to stop riders going over the fence. It's very rare for it to happen but it has over the years - maybe half a dozen times over 20 years. Personally I think it's preventable if you put a plexiglass screen around like they do in ice hockey. Look at motorsport and its catch fencing and the lengths they go to protect the crowd and also the athletes. I didn't want to see the video, I have seen a shot of it, and it was horrendous to see but on the whole it's a very safe sport. All you can do is learn from mistakes and think: How can we make the velodrome safer for athletes and spectators? I hope the people in power look at this and think something really has to be done before something genuinely serious happens in the future.

"Nichelle Nichols (far right) on the set of the film Star Trek: The Final Frontier in 1989 American actress Nichelle Nichols, best known for her role in 1960s sci-fi TV series Star Trek, has died aged 89. Nichols broke barriers in her role as Lieutenant Nyota Uhura in the series, becoming one of the first black actresses in the US to play a figure in authority. She was later employed by Nasa in an effort to encourage more women and African-Americans to become astronauts. She died of natural causes on Saturday night, her son Kyle Johnson said. Nichelle Nichols at a Comic Con event in Los Angeles, California in 2021 In a statement posted on Facebook, Mr Johnson wrote: ""I regret to inform you that a great light in the firmament no longer shines for us as it has for so many years. ""Her light however, like the ancient galaxies now being seen for the first time, will remain for us and future generations to enjoy, learn from, and draw inspiration."" US President Joe Bidenpaid tribute, saying,external: ""In Nichelle Nichols, our nation has lost a trailblazer of stage and screen who redefined what is possible for Black Americans and women."" The Star Trek TV series broke down stereotypes in the 1960s by casting black and minority actors in high-profile roles. Nicholls was cast in the series as Lt Uhura, who was portrayed as a competent and level-headed communications officer - shattering stereotypes. In 1968, she and Star Trek star William Shatner, who played Captain Kirk in the series, broke new ground when they shared one of television's first interracial kisses - though it was not a romantic one. Despite her success, however, Nichols had initially considered leaving the show. But she wasÂ convinced otherwise by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who described her character as the ""first non-stereotypical role portrayed by a black woman in television history"". She wanted to leave because she had been offered a role in a show that was heading to Broadway,saying in an interview that her ""life was theatre"".,external Nichols was asked by Star Trek creator Gene Rodenberry to think about her decision for a couple of days, which she agreed to do. That weekend, she went to a fundraiser in Los Angeles where she was introduced to someone who was described by the event organiser as ""her biggest fan, he's desperate to meet you"". That man was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who said: ""Yes, Miss Nichols, I am your greatest fan. We admire you greatly."" She told him she was going to leave Star Trek and he said: ""You cannot. You cannot. For the first time on television, we are being seen as we should be seen every day, as intelligent... beautiful, people who can sing, dance and go into space, be lawyers, teachers, and yet you don't see it on television until now."" Nichols explained: ""I could say nothing, I just stood there realising that everything he said was the truth."" Nichols did not regret staying at Star Trek Dr. King continued: ""Gene Rodenberry opened a door for the world to see us. If you leave, that door can be closed because your role is not a black role and it's not a female role, he can fill it with anyone, including an alien!"" Nichols later said: ""At that moment, the world tilted for me and I knew then... that I was something else. The world was not the same. And I remember being angry - why me? Why should I have to?"" But she went back to Rodenberry the following week and told him what happened and said she would stay. Rodenberry responded: ""Thank god for Martin Luther King, somebody knows where I am coming from."" Nichols said she never looked back and had never regretted her decision. She went on to feature in the first six Star Trek movies following the series' end in 1969. As well as working as an actress, Ms Nicholls also became an ambassador for the US space agency Nasa, helping to recruit women and minorities to its Space programme. Following the news of her death, Star Trek co-star George Takei wrote in a tweet: ""My heart is heavy, my eyes shining like the stars you now rest among, my dearest friend."" Allow Twitter content?

"Spain's body-positive campaign received coverage from lots of media outlets A third woman has said she thinks her picture may have been used for a Spanish ""beach body"" advertising campaign without her permission. Cancer survivor Juliet FitzPatrick, who has had a mastectomy, thinks a woman in the advert may have been based on her. The advert by Spain's equality ministryaimed to encourage women to go to the beach, regardless of how they look. But now three British women have come forward to say their pictures were used without permission. One of the complaints came on Friday. On Saturday another woman featured on the poster said her prosthetic leg had been edited out. The campaign's creator, Arte Mapache, apologised for using those images without consent. Sixty-year-old Ms FitzPatrick, from southern England, said the face of the woman who had a mastectomy could be based on one of her pictures. But she told the BBC on Sunday that the body in the poster was not hers as the woman had one breast while she had a double mastectomy - as the picture below shows. What happened ""seems to be totally against"" the theme of the campaign, she added. ""For me it is about how my body has been used and represented without my permission."" Juliet FitzPatrick was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 and is now cancer-free Ami Barwell, a British photographer who took the above photo, suspects the body in the poster was lifted from her picture of another woman. ""I think that the person who created the art has gone through my gallery and pieced them together,"" Barwell told the BBC. ""But without any clarification from the artist I can't say for absolutely certain,"" she added. Both Ms FitzPatrick and Barwell only found out about the poster after they received messages on social media on Saturday. Both of them have said they have contacted the artist Arte Mapache but are still waiting for a response. Over the past few days British modelsNyome Nicholas-WilliamsandSian Green-Lordsaid their pictures were used in the poster without their permission. Arte Mapache issued an apology. ""Given the - justified - controversy over the image rights in the illustration, I have decided that the best way to make amends for the damages that may have resulted from my actions is to share out the money I received for the work and give equal parts to the people in the poster,"" the artist said. ""I hope to be able to solve all this as soon as possible, I accept my mistakes and that is why I am now trying to repair the damage caused,"" she added. The BBC has reached out to both Arte Mapache and the Spanish government for comment but has received no response so far. In a statement earlier this week, Spain's Women's Institute said the campaign was a response to the ""fatphobia, hatred and the questioning of non-normative bodies - particularly those of women, something that's most prevalent in the summertime.""

"The strike action could result in rubbish piling up Council workers have no alternative than to take ""all-out"" strike action which could shut schools and leave rubbish piling up, a union has warned. Employees who work in education settings and refuse centres voted to strike after rejecting a 2% pay offer. Unite representative Eddie Cassidy said union members could not afford to accept the ""measly offer"". Local authority body Cosla said it had asked the Scottish government for more money. The Scottish government repeated that it was urging all parties to find a resolution to avoid industrial action. Hundreds of schools could close in council strikes Council workers in Scotland vote for strike action Pay settlements for council workers - apart from teachers - are the responsibility of Cosla and are determined through negotiations at the Scottish Joint Committee (SJC). Further talks are due to take place between Cosla and the joint unions on Monday. Unions have said the walkouts could happen after pupils return from the summer break in August, with hundreds of schools affected. The strike ballot of about 25,000 council workers from the Unison, Unite and GMB unions was said to be the largest in more than a decade. Mr Cassidy, a Scottish Representative on Unite's Executive Council, told BBC Radio Scotland'sThe Sunday Showthat it was apparent that the Scottish government was not taking the issue seriously. ""The cuts to local authority budgets have been deeper and harder in Scotland than they have in England over the past decade and that was a choice by the Scottish SNP government,"" he said. ""I have to agree with the first minister when she said on Friday that this was all about robbing Peter to pay Paul because she's certainly robbed local authority budgets over the past 10 years to pay somewhere else."" He said the membership had ""had enough"" and could not afford to accept a ""2% measly offer"". Mr Cassidy said the Scottish government was hiding behind the ""technical fact"" that it did not have front-line responsibility for local government which he said was ""quite laughable"". He added: ""They are the ones who have ring-fenced the vast majority of the sums of money they've given to budgets and have told local government what they can and cannot do in relation to the community tax over the past 10 years. Hundreds of schools could close if the strike goes ahead ""Cosla have made it crystal clear that they agree with us, that the money on offer is not enough for the workforce, and the only way local government get their money is by funding from the Scottish SNP government. ""They have cut deeply into essential services."" It is estimated that more than half of Scotland's 250,000 council workers earn less than Â£25,000 a year for a 37-hour week. However, Mr Cassidy said many only earned between Â£18,000 and Â£22,000 a year, adding that ""2% doesn't go anywhere near it"". He said some workers could not afford to buy both bread and milk and some had asked to take holidays at the end of the month because they could not afford bus fares to get to work. ""That's unsustainable,"" he said. ""These holidays are meant to alleviate stress and anxiety and our members are subsidising the vast cuts the Scottish government have implemented on the budgets of local authority. ""That's just totally unacceptable."" He said members in England had been offered up to 10.5% by the UK government. Last week Unison said workers were ""fed up of being used as a political football"" between council body Cosla and the Scottish government, while the GMB said the 2% offered was a ""shameful proposal"". A Cosla spokesman said it ""valued hugely the local government workforce"" and that discussions with the unions would continue in order to ""reach an agreement and avoid strike action."" The spokesman added: ""As employers we have a responsibility to ensure that any pay deal offered is both sustainable and affordable and that is why we are unable to go beyond the current offer at this point. ""We are currently in discussions with the Scottish government and await their response to leaders' request for additional funding."" The Scottish government said: ""Ministers note and respect the results of the local government industrial action ballots. Local government workers play a crucial role in our communities and are integral to our recovery from the pandemic. ""Although the Scottish government has no formal role in the national local government pay negotiations, the government and Cosla are working to jointly explore all of the options available to find solutions. ""In the meantime, the Scottish government urges both parties to continue dialogue and seek a resolution which avoids industrial action."" Hundreds of schools could close in council strikes Council workers in Scotland vote for strike action Teachers' strike off after union's legal challenge Strikes suspended as financial deal under way Strikes set to close Glasgow schools called off Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

"This video can not be played Commonwealth Games 2022: Peaty beaten as Wilby claims gold 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. England's James Wilby shattered team-mate Adam Peaty's hold on the 100m breaststroke title with a superb swim at Birmingham's Commonwealth Games. Wilby, so long in the shadow of Peaty, screamed with delight as his finish overhauled the fading Olympic champion and brought him home in 59.25 seconds. Peaty, who broke his foot in May, ended up fourth, behind Australian duo Zac Stubblety-Cook and Sam Williamson. ""Sometimes it doesn't go to plan,"" Peaty told BBC Sport afterwards. ""That's a lack of training, lack of racingâ¦ it is what it is. ""I'm a fighter and sometimes you have got to have these moments to keep fighting."" Peaty, 27 insisted that he still intends to defend his Olympic title in Paris in two years' time despite his first 100m breaststroke defeat since 2014 and described Wilby's performance as ""great"". Peaty had raised his friend's fist into the air, in the style of a boxing referee crowning a winner, while they were still in the water. ""At the end of the day we're both incredible racers,"" Wilby told BBC Sport. ""We all know what Adam is capable of. ""We'll both be back to race again and race each other and It's always going to be an exciting one. But that one was really fun."" Peaty had led by 0.13 seconds at halfway and an expectant crowd, including his partner and young son, anticipated victory. Instead they got a crowd-scene finish. Peaty's stroke shortened and by the time he had glided to the wall, he had been passed by his rivals. His time of 59.86 was well short of his own world record of 56.88. Peaty is due to return for the 50m breaststroke heats on Monday morning, less than 14 hours after his defeat. This video can not be played Commonwealth Games 2022: Tai wins gold in women's 100m Backstroke S8 Earlier in the evening, England's Alice Tai put clear water between herself and the competition to take 100m S8 backstroke gold by more than four seconds. Victory continues the 23-year-old's impressive comeback from major surgery. After years of pain, Tai, who was born with bilateral talipes, or clubfoot, opted to amputate her right leg below the knee in January. ""I realised I was wasting time, if a better quality life was possible what was I waiting for?"" she said at the time. Major medals certainly are still part of her life. The change initially made turns challenging, but Tai showed she has adapted quickly as she left silver-winning New Zealander Tupou Neiufi in her wake with Wales' Lily Rice taking bronze. Wales' 19-year-old Medi Harris showed her potential with bronze in a high-class 100m backstroke won by Australian Olympic champion Kaylee McKeown. ""I'm so happy with that swim, it was a really good race,"" she told BBC Sport ""Hopefully as time goes on I'll be able to work on that back end and keep up with them."" Meanwhile, England's James Guy won bronze - his first medal of these Games - in the men's 200m butterfly and England's team of Freya Colbert, Tamryn van Selm, Abbie Wood and Freya Anderson took bronze in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay. Australia's Emma McKeon shruggedoff speculation over her relationship with team-mates Kyle Chalmers and Cody Simpson,her partners past and present, to win a record 11th Commonwealth gold. The 28-year's collection of Commonwealth golds now surpasses fellow Australian swimmers Ian Thorpe, Susie O'Neill and Leisel Jones, who previously shared the mark with 10. McKeon led home a green-and-gold clean sweep in the 50m freestyle with team-mates Meg Harris and Shayna Jack following her home for silver and bronze. McKeon's winning time was 23.99 seconds, 0.21 off compatriot Cate Campbell's Games record. South Africa's Chad le Clos won a record-equalling 18th Commonwealth Games medal, but had to settle for silver as Lewis Clareburt took his 200m butterfly title. Le Clos' haul matches that of two shooters - England's Mick Gault and Australian Phillip Adams. The 30-year-old led by a third of a second at halfway, but could not resist New Zealander Clareburt's late surge. South Africa's Tatjana Schoenmaker won 200m breaststroke gold with England's Molly Renshaw just outside the medals in fourth. The evening concluded with the Australian quartet of Madison Wilson, Kiah Melverton, Mollie O'Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus beating the world record on their way to 4x200m freestyle relay gold. Australia's time of seven minutes 39.29 seconds was an improvement of more than a second on the 7:40.33 set by surprise gold-medal winners China at the Olympics last summer.

"A shake-up of Scotland's education system which would see a kindergarten stage for three to six-year-olds will be debated at the SNP's conference. Toni Guigliano, the party's policy convenor, said it would have a positive impact on young children. The move would bring Scotland into line with countries such as Finland, where formal education starts at seven. The Scottish government welcomed the debate but said it had no plans to raise the school age. Mr Guigliano told BBC Radio Scotland'sThe Sunday Showthe status quo was not working. Should the school starting age be raised to seven? School attainment gap 'still wide', watchdog warns Formal school lessons should start 'above age of five' He said: ""We are seeing more children with mental health problems. ""We are seeing more children with additional support needs and an attainment gap that is not narrowing at the scale that we would like. ""So what we are asking for is a culture shift in how we do early years education in this country."" Last year,Audit Scotland warnedthat the gap between what Scotland's poorest and richest young people were achieving in school ""remained wide"". Mr Guigliano said the system was ""designed to build a workforce"" but did not reflect the challenges of the digital age. He added: ""If we get early years right so many other things will fall into place."" The proposal would see a kindergarten stage for three to six-year-olds, which would amount to increasing early years education by 12 months. This would be followed by six years of primary education. Mr Guigliano said it would be ""fully funded"" and children would not lose a year of schooling. He said: ""The question is whether primary one sits with formal education or whether it sits with early years education. ""And if you listen to early years experts, parents, teachers they are very clear that no four or five-year-old should be subjected to the pressures of the formal school system."" Mr Guigliano said his proposal should be discussed as part of the Scottish government's national conversation on education, which was launched last month. He said: ""When your education standards are slipping you don't double down on reading and writing in the early years. ""You look at wellbeing. You look at development. That's the way to approach it."" The proposal does not include a timeframe as Mr Guigliano said there would have to be investment in staff and training. Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), told The Sunday Show he believed in a play-based approach to early years learning. But he said ""insufficient resources"" had been put in place in the current system. Mr Flanagan said: ""We are not opposed to a strategy of kindergarten stage but you would have to look at resources, you would have to look at the training for staff. ""And we are very clear that you have to look at a very firm role for teachers within that continuum because we don't want a kindergarten stage which is disconnected from formal primary education."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""While the government does not have plans to change the school age it is welcome that there is an active debate on these issues and all such contributions will form as part of the national discussion on education. ""That discussion will inform plans to reform the education system to deliver change and improve outcomes for learners."" The issue will be debated at the SNP conference which is being held in Aberdeen from 8-10 October.

"Richard Hawkes was one of five people exonerated in July A public inquiry into the Post Office scandal is putting pressure on the company and the government to speed up compensation payments to victims. Chair Sir Wyn Williams will publish a progress report in the coming weeks. If he is unhappy that the Post Office and the government are not acting on its recommendations, he will issue a formal report to Parliament. The scandal is described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history. A public inquiry, led by the retired judge, has been examining the treatment of thousands of sub-postmasters who were made to pay their own money to cover shortfalls in accounts when a faulty IT system made it look like money was missing from their branches. More than 700 individuals were given criminal convictions. So far, 81 people have had their convictions quashed. Interim payments of Â£100,000 have been made to most, but not all, of those who have been exonerated. No-one has yet received a full and final settlement and thousands more left out of pocket are seeking redress. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Post Office scandal victims to get more money Former sub-postmaster Richard Hawkes was one of five people who were exonerated in July, 18 years after being convicted of false accounting. ""Now the weight has been lifted, as your character is back as it should be,"" the 75 year-old told the BBC. But while the fight to clear his name is over, Mr Hawkes is only just beginning the process of claiming compensation. After completing community service, Mr Hawkes eventually managed to find a job cleaning laboratory equipment, where he worked until he was 71 years old. ""Somehow we managed to hang onto the house,"" he said, although he still has a mortgage. It was only at the start of this year that he finally paid his brother back for a sum of money lent to cover debts the Post Office claimed he owed them. Some 15 months ago, the Post Office, and the government as its sole shareholder, apologised to sub-postmasters and promised swift and fair compensation. However, many are still waiting. Sharon Brown, a former sub-postmaster in Sunderland and mother-of- two, was accused of theft by the Post Office in 2012 and is furious that her compensation hasn't arrived yet. Former sub-postmaster Sharon Brown is still waiting for compensation She told the BBC she has only survived thanks to the financial support of relatives, including her sister-in-law who took out a loan on her behalf. At one stage, she had to rely on credit cards to buy food for her family. ""I want my life back,"" she said. ""I want to be able to walk about and hold my head up and say finally 'I got compensation because they did me wrong'. ""They've ruined so many people's lives, it's heart-breaking."" A Post Office spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to ensure that there is meaningful compensation for victims and that such events can never happen again."" The public inquiry into the Post Office scandal, which began hearing evidence in February 2021, was set up to examine who was to blame for the wrongful prosecutions and why nothing was done to prevent them. However, Sir Wyn became so concerned about the slow progress of compensation for sub-postmasters that he took special evidence at hearings in July. Sir Wyn has now decided to publish a progress update in the coming weeks, and will issue a formal report to Parliament if he's not happy those recommendations are being acted on. It seemed as though that pressure was bearing fruit earlier this summer, followinggood news at the end of June for more than 500 sub-postmasterswho had previously been excluded from compensation. The then-Postal Affairs Minister Paul Scully said a scheme worth Â£19.5m had been arranged to ensure they did not miss out. But since then it's been all change in the Cabinet. There's now a new minster for Postal Affairs - and victims are worried it qill be yet another delay on their route to compensation. Jane Hunt, who replaced Paul Scully as minister for postal affairs, declined an interview but she said she looked forward ""to continuing [Scully's] excellent work in delivering compensation for postmasters"". A former supreme court justice has been asked to give advice to try and break the impasse between victims and the Post Office over how much should be paid. During the inquiry hearings the Post Office admitted that it had anticipated hundreds of applications for compensation, but had ultimately received thousands. The Post Office said it did not have enough staff to process the volume of claims, and had so far dealt with only the more straightforward claims of lower value.

Former England and Arsenal defender Alex Scott was highly emotional on BBC One after the final whistle. ""So many people have been involved to get women's football to this point, to see this trophy,"" she said. ""This is what we've all been dreaming of, the amount of investment in the game to get us to this point. ""This moment reminds me of the 1999 Women's World Cup when USA won that. It changed the face of soccer in America forever. I feel this is a moment in England. This is the moment."" The final was watched by 87,192 people at Wembley - a record for a Euros game in men's or women's football. The Women's Euros attendance record had also been broken in the opening game at Old Trafford, with 68,871 watching England beat Austria 1-0. In total, 574,875 people watched Euro 2022 - more than twice the previous record. Seven of the top Women's Euros attendances have been this summer - also at the home grounds of Southampton, Brighton, Sheffield United and MK Dons. ""Back in 2018 we were begging people to host the Euros games in their stadiums,"" continued Scott. ""So many people said no. I hope they're looking at themselves and thinking they weren't brave enough. ""I'm not standing up at corporate events begging for them to get involved in the women's game. If you're not involved, you've missed the boat. You've missed the train, it's finally left the station, it's gathering speed."" Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall praised Sarina Wiegman's role in England's triumph. ""It comes to clearness and communication,"" he said in his role as a BBC pundit. ""I spoke to some of my players before the Euros. Sarina had one-to-one talks with each of them - 'I see you as a starter, I see you as an impact player'. ""They knew before they were coming in what was expected of them. Once I heard that I immediately had a feeling this is going to be a great Euros for England - they won't waste energy on those conversations when they're in the tournament."" Former keeper Rachel Brown-Finnis, who played with Scott in England's last final - a 6-2 defeat to Germany at the 2009 Euros - added: ""I'm tearful with joy.

"This video can not be played Commonwealth Games 2022: Peaty beaten as Wilby claims gold 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. England's James Wilby shattered team-mate Adam Peaty's hold on the 100m breaststroke title with a superb swim at Birmingham's Commonwealth Games. Wilby, so long in the shadow of Peaty, screamed with delight as his finish overhauled the fading Olympic champion and brought him home in 59.25 seconds. Peaty, who broke his foot in May, ended up fourth, behind Australian duo Zac Stubblety-Cook and Sam Williamson. ""Sometimes it doesn't go to plan,"" Peaty told BBC Sport afterwards. ""That's a lack of training, lack of racingâ¦ it is what it is. ""I'm a fighter and sometimes you have got to have these moments to keep fighting."" Peaty, 27 insisted that he still intends to defend his Olympic title in Paris in two years' time despite his first 100m breaststroke defeat since 2014 and described Wilby's performance as ""great"". Peaty had raised his friend's fist into the air, in the style of a boxing referee crowning a winner, while they were still in the water. ""At the end of the day we're both incredible racers,"" Wilby told BBC Sport. ""We all know what Adam is capable of. ""We'll both be back to race again and race each other and It's always going to be an exciting one. But that one was really fun."" Peaty had led by 0.13 seconds at halfway and an expectant crowd, including his partner and young son, anticipated victory. Instead they got a crowd-scene finish. Peaty's stroke shortened and by the time he had glided to the wall, he had been passed by his rivals. His time of 59.86 was well short of his own world record of 56.88. Peaty is due to return for the 50m breaststroke heats on Monday morning, less than 14 hours after his defeat. This video can not be played Commonwealth Games 2022: Tai wins gold in women's 100m Backstroke S8 Earlier in the evening, England's Alice Tai put clear water between herself and the competition to take 100m S8 backstroke gold by more than four seconds. Victory continues the 23-year-old's impressive comeback from major surgery. After years of pain, Tai, who was born with bilateral talipes, or clubfoot, opted to amputate her right leg below the knee in January. ""I realised I was wasting time, if a better quality life was possible what was I waiting for?"" she said at the time. Major medals certainly are still part of her life. The change initially made turns challenging, but Tai showed she has adapted quickly as she left silver-winning New Zealander Tupou Neiufi in her wake with Wales' Lily Rice taking bronze. Wales' 19-year-old Medi Harris showed her potential with bronze in a high-class 100m backstroke won by Australian Olympic champion Kaylee McKeown. ""I'm so happy with that swim, it was a really good race,"" she told BBC Sport ""Hopefully as time goes on I'll be able to work on that back end and keep up with them."" Meanwhile, England's James Guy won bronze - his first medal of these Games - in the men's 200m butterfly and England's team of Freya Colbert, Tamryn van Selm, Abbie Wood and Freya Anderson took bronze in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay. Australia's Emma McKeon shruggedoff speculation over her relationship with team-mates Kyle Chalmers and Cody Simpson,her partners past and present, to win a record 11th Commonwealth gold. The 28-year's collection of Commonwealth golds now surpasses fellow Australian swimmers Ian Thorpe, Susie O'Neill and Leisel Jones, who previously shared the mark with 10. McKeon led home a green-and-gold clean sweep in the 50m freestyle with team-mates Meg Harris and Shayna Jack following her home for silver and bronze. McKeon's winning time was 23.99 seconds, 0.21 off compatriot Cate Campbell's Games record. South Africa's Chad le Clos won a record-equalling 18th Commonwealth Games medal, but had to settle for silver as Lewis Clareburt took his 200m butterfly title. Le Clos' haul matches that of two shooters - England's Mick Gault and Australian Phillip Adams. The 30-year-old led by a third of a second at halfway, but could not resist New Zealander Clareburt's late surge. South Africa's Tatjana Schoenmaker won 200m breaststroke gold with England's Molly Renshaw just outside the medals in fourth. The evening concluded with the Australian quartet of Madison Wilson, Kiah Melverton, Mollie O'Callaghan and Ariarne Titmus beating the world record on their way to 4x200m freestyle relay gold. Australia's time of seven minutes 39.29 seconds was an improvement of more than a second on the 7:40.33 set by surprise gold-medal winners China at the Olympics last summer.

"Octopus Energy is seeking Â£1bn in taxpayer funding to take over collapsed rival Bulb from the UK government. Bulb has been bailed out by the state and is being run by an administrator since going bust last November. The Â£1bn funding is part of a package being discussed where Octopus would also pay more than Â£100m for Bulb's customers as well as entering a profit-sharing deal with the government. The government declined to comment ""due to commercial sensitivity"". The state bailout of Bulb is already expected to cost the taxpayer around Â£2bn by next year. But the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's independent forecaster, said in March: ""Given the volatility in global energy markets, there remains uncertainty around the final cost."" It is understood that the additional Â£1bn being sought by Octopus,which was first reported by Sky News,external, would be paid back in full over time. It would be used to purchase energy in advance through a practice known as hedging. Octopus Energy declined to comment. Since Bulb's collapse in November, the price of wholesale gas has jumped by 78%, exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine and the Kremlin's decision to reduce energy supplies to Europe. Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? Martin Lewis says energy bills at 'desperate' point Since Ofgem took over the running of Bulb, it has not been hedging its purchases of wholesale energy which sources said has led to higher costs. Millions of UK households are bracing for a further steep rise in energy bills later this year. Ofgem had expected the typical household to see an Â£800 increase in energy bills to Â£2,800 a year. But it recently said it would be higher and energy industry analysts Cornwall Insight said the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October. Bulb was one of more than 30 energy companies that collapsed last year following a spike in wholesale gas prices. Bulb, with 1.6 million customers, was the biggest firm to go bust but Ofgem estimates that the cost of all the other energy companies which collapsed in 2021 could reach Â£2.7bn - or Â£94 per customer. It includes the cost of transferring customers from failed energy providers to new firms. The Â£2.7bn figure is in addition to the billions of pounds earmarked for Bulb which,according to the National Audit Office,external, has already seen the government spend Â£900m to keep the company running. Octopus was the only bidder for Bulb, which filed for administration last year, and if a deal is agreed, it would significantly boost Octopus's 3.1 million customer base. The government has announced that households in England, Scotland and Waleswill receive Â£400 to help with rising fuel bills in autumn. Tory leadership contenders Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have also promised to reduce household energy bills. Foreign Secretary Ms Truss said she would temporarily axe green energy taxes, which would save around Â£153 per year, while former chancellor Mr Sunak pledged to cut VAT on bills, a saving of around Â£160 per year.

"Sian Green-Lord says the image on the left was used without permission, and removed her prosthetic leg A British model says she was left furious after the Spanish government used her image without permission and edited out her prosthetic leg. The photo was used as part of abody positivity campaign launched by Spain's equality ministry. But Sian Green-Lord, 32, said she only found out about the campaign when friends messaged her about it. She is the second woman featured in the campaign to say her photos were used without permission. On Friday, Nyome Nicholas-Williams, from London, told the BBC thatan image from her Instagram page was used in the posterreleased by the Spanish Institute for Women. It features an illustration of five women - including one who has had a mastectomy - on a beach underneath the slogan ""summer is ours too"". Ms Green-Lord is seen at the bottom left of the image. Speaking in an Instagram story, she said she was left ""shaking with rage"" after she saw her photos had been edited to remove her prosthetic leg. She said her swimsuit had also been altered. ""I don't know how to even explain the amount of anger that I'm feeling right now,"" she said in the video. ""There's one thing using my image without my permission. But there's another thing editing my body."" ""I literally don't even know what to say but it's beyond wrong,"" Ms Green-Lord added. The influencer and mother-of-one's leg was amputated after she was hit by a taxi while on holiday in New York in 2013. She was walking with a friend in Manhattan when the vehicle mounted the kerb.

"This video can not be played 'Unreal scenes!' - Kelly gives England the advantage in extra time Euro 2022 has been a huge success for England - both on and off the pitch. The Lionesses captivated the nation with a swashbuckling run that ended with anextra-time victory over Germanyin the final of a tournament which has attracted record crowds, carnival atmospheres and unprecedented media coverage for the sport. Women's football has already enjoyed a dramatic increase in popularity and publicity in recent years, but what impact will this tournament have? In the build-up to Sunday's final, we asked for your opinions. Larry Dickens, from Shropshire, is among those who never had any interest in women's football before this summer's Euros. ""To be honest, I was in danger of misogyny. OK that's extreme, but you see, it is a man's game,"" he quips. ""I never bothered with women's football before, now I am hooked. It has been a breath of fresh air - tough, resilient and honest, superb footballers with excellent skills."" He says previously he wasn't sure he could support two teams, but now sees he can follow the men's and women's teams for the same club. ""I haven't noticed much change in male friends as yet, but my wife likes the footy too now. Our team is Newcastle, howay the lasses!"" He is not the only recent male convert. Tim Williamson, a 67-year-old Arsenal fan from north London, said that he first got into watching football in 1966, when he, along with the rest of the country, was gripped by England's World Cup-winning journey, and now the same is happening for him and the women's team. ""I never took women's football seriously until the Euros competition."" The Lionesses' quarter-final with Spain was the first time he had watched a women's game in full. ""To my wife's anger I found myself screaming and swearing at the set just like I do when Arsenal are playing,"" he says. Tim Williamson says he was ""hooked"" after watching the Sweden game He has also noticed ""an extraordinary difference"" among his friends. ""I'd say about half my male mates into football are suddenly talking about the women's game. They even know the names of the players!"" Before the tournament there was a debate about the size and profile of some of the grounds chosen to host the Euros, and while Leigh and Rotherham may have seemed unlikely footballing arenas for some of the world's best players, it has opened up the sport to new fans. Coach driver Barry Critchley, 52, from Leigh, says he has always had a soft spot for the Netherlands so the Euros gave him the perfect chance to watch them in person when they came to town. ""Whilst watching the games I really only saw football being played, not women's football. I am no activist or anything but to me it was just good quality football and a safe, pleasant atmosphere."" He says he has already booked tickets for England's World Cup qualifier at Stoke in September and intends to get tickets for Manchester United's women. And will he persuade his mates to join him? ""I was waxing lyrical about Daphne van Domselaar after her performance against France. One driver listened but they are all staunch Everton or Liverpool fans and as far as they are concerned there is only one team."" Helen, from Sheffield, went to her first women's match when the reigning champions, the Netherlands, took on the highest-ranked team in the competition, Sweden, in her city. ""I had the best night ever! I just loved my first experience, the atmosphere was incredible, I felt safe at the ground, and travelling to and from."" She says she has signed up to the mailing list to get tickets for Manchester City and United as they are her nearest Women's Super League sides - adding: ""I'm currently deciding which team to follow! After Alessia Russo's backheel wonder goal I think it has to be Man Utd."" WSL clubs will be hoping to boost their attendances off the back of the Euros. Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City are among the clubs which have recently announced fixtures for their women's teams at their men's home ground. Andrew, from Nottingham, says: ""WSL matches must start selling out every game for the game to grow."" But with the start of the men's Premier League season just around the corner, David, from Wigan, says that will mean that even if England win the title, in a few weeks it will all be forgotten about - ""that's the way it is"". Mark Reid had previously taken his two daughters - Georgie, 12, pictured here, and Summer, 15, to watch the Lionesses in the Arnold Clark Cup For some of those enjoying this summer's Euros, it is the impact on their children they are relishing. Mark Reid, from Derby, says the amount of coverage has brought ""an importance to women's football"" which has been really beneficial to his two daughters, who both play for grassroots teams. ""I love the shift from talking about the players in men's teams, and instead now talking about names from women's teams. It feels like a genuine change of role models that I hope inspires my daughters."" Ian Baker, a teacher from Brighton, says the Euros have allowed him to share his lifelong passion for football with his daughter Daisy, 24, who has special needs, and wasn't interested until she watched her first women's game at Brighton in the WSL in 2019. ""The Euros have really deepened her love of women's football. Daisy knows all the players' names - her understanding of the game has increased hugely and it's been a joy to share it with her."" Ian Baker took his daughter Daisy, 24, to England v Spain, which he says was one of the best football games he has been to in terms of atmosphere and experience When it comes to the legacy of the tournament, it will take time to see how much effect it has had on the numbers of girls playing football. Sophie, the club secretary of a grassroots team in Brixton, south London, says more women have been messaging them after the Lionesses' win, wanting to join the team. Mark Grinter, who runs a girls' section of a football club in Bristol, says the number of girls getting involved has grown rapidly since he started offering them coaching in 2018, and he expects the Euros to boost numbers further. ""We have gone from a few girls to six teams and over 100 girls every week."" He says they had a boost in numbers after Covid and ""this has gone from strength to strength - we are now getting around three to five girls a week joining"". ""We are lucky that the facilities we have will allow us to expand and we would like to have a girls team in all age groups in the next three years, with a women's team as well. ""The only stumbling block is finding enough coaches, and we would love more female coaches."" Mark Grinter's girls' club - Fry Club JFC in Bristol - has grown massively in recent years Baz Moffat, from London, says: ""Inspiring moments in sport can be an incredible catalyst for change. But they only do this if backed up by a strategy to support girls and women."" The question of resources is one that concerns Rachel, from Windsor, who asks ""will the infrastructure be in place to cope with the increase in demand?"" She says her five-year-old daughter has always enjoyed football and ""having seen the Euros she has certainly had this interest further ignited"". ""It seems there is such a shift in televised sport towards more equality between the sexes, and it's a really exciting time to be bringing up a little girl."" However, Rachel says they have struggled to find clubs offering sessions ""exclusively for girls"", which she favours, in their local area. ""You can tell a lot by club websites, where the main photos are all of boys playing, or where there is no reference to girls' teams. This is what I mean by lack of infrastructure and opportunity. Are the local clubs ready to ride on the coat tails of the Lionesses' success?"" BBC Sport Euro 2022 Uefa Euro 2022 Why is frustration growing at Arteta's Arsenal?

"Octopus Energy is seeking Â£1bn in taxpayer funding to take over collapsed rival Bulb from the UK government. Bulb has been bailed out by the state and is being run by an administrator since going bust last November. The Â£1bn funding is part of a package being discussed where Octopus would also pay more than Â£100m for Bulb's customers as well as entering a profit-sharing deal with the government. The government declined to comment ""due to commercial sensitivity"". The state bailout of Bulb is already expected to cost the taxpayer around Â£2bn by next year. But the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's independent forecaster, said in March: ""Given the volatility in global energy markets, there remains uncertainty around the final cost."" It is understood that the additional Â£1bn being sought by Octopus,which was first reported by Sky News,external, would be paid back in full over time. It would be used to purchase energy in advance through a practice known as hedging. Octopus Energy declined to comment. Since Bulb's collapse in November, the price of wholesale gas has jumped by 78%, exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine and the Kremlin's decision to reduce energy supplies to Europe. Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? Martin Lewis says energy bills at 'desperate' point Since Ofgem took over the running of Bulb, it has not been hedging its purchases of wholesale energy which sources said has led to higher costs. Millions of UK households are bracing for a further steep rise in energy bills later this year. Ofgem had expected the typical household to see an Â£800 increase in energy bills to Â£2,800 a year. But it recently said it would be higher and energy industry analysts Cornwall Insight said the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October. Bulb was one of more than 30 energy companies that collapsed last year following a spike in wholesale gas prices. Bulb, with 1.6 million customers, was the biggest firm to go bust but Ofgem estimates that the cost of all the other energy companies which collapsed in 2021 could reach Â£2.7bn - or Â£94 per customer. It includes the cost of transferring customers from failed energy providers to new firms. The Â£2.7bn figure is in addition to the billions of pounds earmarked for Bulb which,according to the National Audit Office,external, has already seen the government spend Â£900m to keep the company running. Octopus was the only bidder for Bulb, which filed for administration last year, and if a deal is agreed, it would significantly boost Octopus's 3.1 million customer base. The government has announced that households in England, Scotland and Waleswill receive Â£400 to help with rising fuel bills in autumn. Tory leadership contenders Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have also promised to reduce household energy bills. Foreign Secretary Ms Truss said she would temporarily axe green energy taxes, which would save around Â£153 per year, while former chancellor Mr Sunak pledged to cut VAT on bills, a saving of around Â£160 per year.

"Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour must move away from being a ""party of protest"" in order to win elections and ""hand power to working people"". The Labour leader insisted he supports the right to strike, but that his focus is on getting into government. He added that he ""makes no apologies"" for seeking to turn Labour into an election-winning party. It comes after he was criticised over sacking a shadow minister who joined striking rail workers on a picket line. Writing inthe Sunday Mirror,external, Sir Keir said he completely understands ""why people are going on strike to secure better pay and better conditions"" and added that he supported their ""right to do so"". The Labour leader emphasised that he represented striking miners for free when he still worked as a lawyer, adding it was not just for ""sentiment and a photo op"" and that he backed his my words ""with action"". MP fired for making up policy on the hoof - Starmer Union anger at Labour over sacking of Sam Tarry Are we set for a general strike? Sir Keir wrote: ""I am now leading a Labour party that wants to change lives and give Britain the fresh start it needs. ""That means turning from a party of protest into a party that can win power - then hand that power to working people. I make no apologies for that."" His intervention comes as part of an ongoing debate between Labour's left and right wings about how to respond to the cost of living crisis, amid growing threats of further industrial action from public sector workers. Ongoingrail strikesfrom transport unions have disrupted travel in recent weeks, with union leaders calling for pay rises more in tune with soaring inflation levels. It comes as the rate at which prices rise hashit a 40-year high of 9.4%and is expected to grow further over the course of the year. Governmentpay offers to teachers, nurses, police officersand other key public sector industries have been rejected or condemned by unions as failing to address the crisis, with many in the process of or suggesting plans to consult their members on whether to strike later in the year. Labour receives significant funding from trades unions - with Unite and their over a million members being the largest single donor -  and unions also play a key role in internal party leadership elections. Unions and senior figures on Labour's left have reacted angrily to the sacking of shadow transport minister Sam Tarry from shadow cabinet, with one senior Union leader describing the party as ""becoming more and more irrelevant to ordinary working people"". Mr Tarry himself has said he was expressing ""solidarity"" with workers when he attended the protest at London's Euston station on Wednesday, despite Sir Keir telling frontbench MPs to stay away. But Sir Keir has said Mr Tarry was sacked for doing interviews ""without permission"" and ""making up policy on the hoof"", after he spoke to broadcasters from an RMT union picket line on Wednesday during last week's rail strike. The BBC understands Sir Keir objected to an interview Mr Tarry gave to Sky News in which he said workers should get pay rises in line with inflation, as the party's policy is that there should be ""fair"" rises through negotiation. Veteran Labour left-winger Diane Abbott has previously told the BBC that Mr Tarry was being unfairly treated, adding: ""Everybody knows Sam Tarry wasn't sacked for interviews, he was sacked for going on a picket line.""

"Sian Green-Lord says the image on the left was used without permission, and removed her prosthetic leg A British model says she was left furious after the Spanish government used her image without permission and edited out her prosthetic leg. The photo was used as part of abody positivity campaign launched by Spain's equality ministry. But Sian Green-Lord, 32, said she only found out about the campaign when friends messaged her about it. She is the second woman featured in the campaign to say her photos were used without permission. On Friday, Nyome Nicholas-Williams, from London, told the BBC thatan image from her Instagram page was used in the posterreleased by the Spanish Institute for Women. It features an illustration of five women - including one who has had a mastectomy - on a beach underneath the slogan ""summer is ours too"". Ms Green-Lord is seen at the bottom left of the image. Speaking in an Instagram story, she said she was left ""shaking with rage"" after she saw her photos had been edited to remove her prosthetic leg. She said her swimsuit had also been altered. ""I don't know how to even explain the amount of anger that I'm feeling right now,"" she said in the video. ""There's one thing using my image without my permission. But there's another thing editing my body."" ""I literally don't even know what to say but it's beyond wrong,"" Ms Green-Lord added. The influencer and mother-of-one's leg was amputated after she was hit by a taxi while on holiday in New York in 2013. She was walking with a friend in Manhattan when the vehicle mounted the kerb. On Thursday, the campaign's creator, Arte Mapache, issued an apology for using the images without permission. ""Given the - justified - controversy over the image rights in the illustration, I have decided that the best way to make amends for the damages that may have resulted from my actions is to share out the money I received for the work and give equal parts to the people in the poster,"" the artist said. ""I hope to be able to solve all this as soon as possible, I accept my mistakes and that is why I am now trying to repair the damage caused,"" she added.

"Conservative leadership hopeful Rishi Sunak has said he would introduce a Â£10 fine for patients who repeatedly miss GP or hospital appointments. Mr Sunak toldthe Sunday Telegraph,externalhe wanted to be ""transformational"" and ""do something brave and... different"". His rival Liz Truss meanwhile unveiled plans to ensure students who get top grades would automatically be invited to apply to Oxford or Cambridge. ""I can be trusted to deliver as the education prime minister,"" she said. The two final candidates for party leader - and prime minister - are setting out their policies and visions as Conservative members prepare to receive their ballots from Monday. Ms Truss has released a six-point plan targeting reform in the education sector, saying she wants to give ""every child the tools they need to succeed"". Among the foreign secretary's proposals is widening access to top universities, and putting less emphasis on predicted grades. Students would be allowed to apply to universities after receiving their A-level results, under a new post-qualification admissions system, Ms Truss has said. Truss v Sunak fact-checked How the new PM will be picked Truss courts Johnson loyalists as Sunak faces jibes A similar proposal from the Labour Party in 2019 was welcomed by the Sutton Trust as being potentially beneficial to disadvantaged students, who have lower predicted grades. But education leaders warned that the plan could require a rethink of the academic calendar. Ms Truss also said that students receiving top grades would be automatically invited to apply to Oxford and Cambridge. It was not clear how the plans would work in practice, and a source close Ms Truss said details would be reviewed if she became prime minister. James Turner, chief executive of the Sutton Trust, said it was the ""right aspiration"" to ensure bright students from every school have a route to Oxbridge. But he said it may be more effective to expand the use of contextual admissions - where universities reduce their grade requirements for disadvantaged students to reflect that they may be less likely to achieve top grades at school, but can still succeed in higher education. Ms Truss added that she wants to expand existing academy schools that are high performing, and replace failing establishments with free schools. She also indicated she would end a ban on new grammar schools in England. Mr Sunak, meanwhile, has set out plans to target NHS no-shows. He told the Sunday Telegraph patients would be given the ""benefit of the doubt"" the first time they missed an appointment without providing sufficient notice, but that further absences would incur a Â£10 charge. The system would be ""temporary"" as Covid backlogs were cleared, he said. The former chancellor gave few details of how the fine system would work, but said: ""If we have people who are now showing up and taking those slots away from people who need [them], that's not right. ""I'm all for a healthcare system that's free at the point of use, but not one that's free at the point of misuse."" A source close to Ms Truss said the policy would hit those who were ""already worse-off"", and give doctors extra work. Dr Gary Howsam, vice chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said that while patients missing appointments was ""frustrating"", charging for appointments was ""not the answer"" and was likely to impact vulnerable patients most. He added: ""It would fundamentally change the principle that the NHS is free at the point of need."" Mr Sunak's team said GPs and hospital trusts would be allowed to use their discretion to waive a fine in exceptional circumstances, for example if a patient had a personal emergency. As of February, six million people were on NHS waiting lists in England - one in nine of the population. Ministers have warned that the waiting list for hospital treatment will not begin to fall for two years. Separately, Mr Sunak has said he wants to reduce the number of empty shops on Britain's high streets and crack down on graffiti and littering. ""I want to slash the number of empty shops by 2025 and make sure that they are turned into thriving local assets, supporting skills, local businesses, economies and creating jobs,"" Mr Sunak said. ""They will be joined by vital public services - like police stations and job centres."" Both candidates have fired out a glut of policy announcements in recent days. This race still has weeks to run, but next week is key. Tory members get their ballots on Monday and both camps expect many members to vote early. So it's a competition for who can grab the attention of members with announcements like these. Not all have come with a huge amount of detail - would the school timetable change to accommodate Truss's post-qualification university admissions plans? What system would the NHS use to fine people? These are all things each side say they'd work out in government. With lots of new policies, both camps risk increasing pressure to call a general election and get a fresh mandate for them if elected. For all the talk of new ideas too, whoever wins will have many tasks to finish. Not least, helping people with the cost of living as bills are set to soar again in the autumn. Mr Sunak and Ms Truss are vying for No 10 after reaching the final stage of the Conservative party leadership contest. The party's membership will decide who will replace Boris Johnson, with the winner being announced on 5 September. During the contest, there have been noticeable clashes between the two candidates as they set out their rival visions for the UK's future. Earlier this month, they set out their plans for the economy andtraded barbs over one another's policies. Ms Truss is ahead of Mr Sunak in the race to become the next Tory leader,according to polls of party members. She received the backing of former Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis who told the Telegraph Ms Truss would restore power sharing at Stormont more quickly. And despite her apparent popularity among Tory members, Ms Trusstold the Sunday Times,externalthat she is unsure if her parents would vote for her in a general election. ""I think my mum will, I'm not sure about my dad,"" she said, adding that they disagreed with her about public spending and tax. How was the new UK prime minister chosen?

"A shake-up of Scotland's education system which would see a kindergarten stage for three to six-year-olds will be debated at the SNP's conference. Toni Guigliano, the party's policy convenor, said it would have a positive impact on young children. The move would bring Scotland into line with countries such as Finland, where formal education starts at seven. The Scottish government welcomed the debate but said it had no plans to raise the school age. Mr Guigliano told BBC Radio Scotland'sThe Sunday Showthe status quo was not working. Should the school starting age be raised to seven? School attainment gap 'still wide', watchdog warns Formal school lessons should start 'above age of five' He said: ""We are seeing more children with mental health problems. ""We are seeing more children with additional support needs and an attainment gap that is not narrowing at the scale that we would like. ""So what we are asking for is a culture shift in how we do early years education in this country."" Last year,Audit Scotland warnedthat the gap between what Scotland's poorest and richest young people were achieving in school ""remained wide"". Mr Guigliano said the system was ""designed to build a workforce"" but did not reflect the challenges of the digital age. He added: ""If we get early years right so many other things will fall into place."" The proposal would see a kindergarten stage for three to six-year-olds, which would amount to increasing early years education by 12 months. This would be followed by six years of primary education. Mr Guigliano said it would be ""fully funded"" and children would not lose a year of schooling. He said: ""The question is whether primary one sits with formal education or whether it sits with early years education. ""And if you listen to early years experts, parents, teachers they are very clear that no four or five-year-old should be subjected to the pressures of the formal school system."" Mr Guigliano said his proposal should be discussed as part of the Scottish government's national conversation on education, which was launched last month. He said: ""When your education standards are slipping you don't double down on reading and writing in the early years. ""You look at wellbeing. You look at development. That's the way to approach it."" The proposal does not include a timeframe as Mr Guigliano said there would have to be investment in staff and training. Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), told The Sunday Show he believed in a play-based approach to early years learning. But he said ""insufficient resources"" had been put in place in the current system. Mr Flanagan said: ""We are not opposed to a strategy of kindergarten stage but you would have to look at resources, you would have to look at the training for staff. ""And we are very clear that you have to look at a very firm role for teachers within that continuum because we don't want a kindergarten stage which is disconnected from formal primary education."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""While the government does not have plans to change the school age it is welcome that there is an active debate on these issues and all such contributions will form as part of the national discussion on education. ""That discussion will inform plans to reform the education system to deliver change and improve outcomes for learners."" The issue will be debated at the SNP conference which is being held in Aberdeen from 8-10 October.

"Richard Hawkes was one of five people exonerated in July A public inquiry into the Post Office scandal is putting pressure on the company and the government to speed up compensation payments to victims. Chair Sir Wyn Williams will publish a progress report in the coming weeks. If he is unhappy that the Post Office and the government are not acting on its recommendations, he will issue a formal report to Parliament. The scandal is described as the most widespread miscarriage of justice in UK history. A public inquiry, led by the retired judge, has been examining the treatment of thousands of sub-postmasters who were made to pay their own money to cover shortfalls in accounts when a faulty IT system made it look like money was missing from their branches. More than 700 individuals were given criminal convictions. So far, 81 people have had their convictions quashed. Interim payments of Â£100,000 have been made to most, but not all, of those who have been exonerated. No-one has yet received a full and final settlement and thousands more left out of pocket are seeking redress. Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Post Office scandal victims to get more money Former sub-postmaster Richard Hawkes was one of five people who were exonerated in July, 18 years after being convicted of false accounting. ""Now the weight has been lifted, as your character is back as it should be,"" the 75 year-old told the BBC. But while the fight to clear his name is over, Mr Hawkes is only just beginning the process of claiming compensation. After completing community service, Mr Hawkes eventually managed to find a job cleaning laboratory equipment, where he worked until he was 71 years old. ""Somehow we managed to hang onto the house,"" he said, although he still has a mortgage. It was only at the start of this year that he finally paid his brother back for a sum of money lent to cover debts the Post Office claimed he owed them. Some 15 months ago, the Post Office, and the government as its sole shareholder, apologised to sub-postmasters and promised swift and fair compensation. However, many are still waiting. Sharon Brown, a former sub-postmaster in Sunderland and mother-of- two, was accused of theft by the Post Office in 2012 and is furious that her compensation hasn't arrived yet. Former sub-postmaster Sharon Brown is still waiting for compensation She told the BBC she has only survived thanks to the financial support of relatives, including her sister-in-law who took out a loan on her behalf. At one stage, she had to rely on credit cards to buy food for her family. ""I want my life back,"" she said. ""I want to be able to walk about and hold my head up and say finally 'I got compensation because they did me wrong'. ""They've ruined so many people's lives, it's heart-breaking."" A Post Office spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to ensure that there is meaningful compensation for victims and that such events can never happen again."" The public inquiry into the Post Office scandal, which began hearing evidence in February 2021, was set up to examine who was to blame for the wrongful prosecutions and why nothing was done to prevent them. However, Sir Wyn became so concerned about the slow progress of compensation for sub-postmasters that he took special evidence at hearings in July. Sir Wyn has now decided to publish a progress update in the coming weeks, and will issue a formal report to Parliament if he's not happy those recommendations are being acted on. It seemed as though that pressure was bearing fruit earlier this summer, followinggood news at the end of June for more than 500 sub-postmasterswho had previously been excluded from compensation. The then-Postal Affairs Minister Paul Scully said a scheme worth Â£19.5m had been arranged to ensure they did not miss out. But since then it's been all change in the Cabinet. There's now a new minster for Postal Affairs - and victims are worried it qill be yet another delay on their route to compensation. Jane Hunt, who replaced Paul Scully as minister for postal affairs, declined an interview but she said she looked forward ""to continuing [Scully's] excellent work in delivering compensation for postmasters"". A former supreme court justice has been asked to give advice to try and break the impasse between victims and the Post Office over how much should be paid. During the inquiry hearings the Post Office admitted that it had anticipated hundreds of applications for compensation, but had ultimately received thousands. The Post Office said it did not have enough staff to process the volume of claims, and had so far dealt with only the more straightforward claims of lower value.

"Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour must move away from being a ""party of protest"" in order to win elections and ""hand power to working people"". The Labour leader insisted he supports the right to strike, but that his focus is on getting into government. He added that he ""makes no apologies"" for seeking to turn Labour into an election-winning party. It comes after he was criticised over sacking a shadow minister who joined striking rail workers on a picket line. Writing inthe Sunday Mirror,external, Sir Keir said he completely understands ""why people are going on strike to secure better pay and better conditions"" and added that he supported their ""right to do so"". The Labour leader emphasised that he represented striking miners for free when he still worked as a lawyer, adding it was not just for ""sentiment and a photo op"" and that he backed his my words ""with action"". MP fired for making up policy on the hoof - Starmer Union anger at Labour over sacking of Sam Tarry Are we set for a general strike? Sir Keir wrote: ""I am now leading a Labour party that wants to change lives and give Britain the fresh start it needs. ""That means turning from a party of protest into a party that can win power - then hand that power to working people. I make no apologies for that."" His intervention comes as part of an ongoing debate between Labour's left and right wings about how to respond to the cost of living crisis, amid growing threats of further industrial action from public sector workers. Ongoingrail strikesfrom transport unions have disrupted travel in recent weeks, with union leaders calling for pay rises more in tune with soaring inflation levels. It comes as the rate at which prices rise hashit a 40-year high of 9.4%and is expected to grow further over the course of the year. Governmentpay offers to teachers, nurses, police officersand other key public sector industries have been rejected or condemned by unions as failing to address the crisis, with many in the process of or suggesting plans to consult their members on whether to strike later in the year. Labour receives significant funding from trades unions - with Unite and their over a million members being the largest single donor -  and unions also play a key role in internal party leadership elections. Unions and senior figures on Labour's left have reacted angrily to the sacking of shadow transport minister Sam Tarry from shadow cabinet, with one senior Union leader describing the party as ""becoming more and more irrelevant to ordinary working people"". Mr Tarry himself has said he was expressing ""solidarity"" with workers when he attended the protest at London's Euston station on Wednesday, despite Sir Keir telling frontbench MPs to stay away. But Sir Keir has said Mr Tarry was sacked for doing interviews ""without permission"" and ""making up policy on the hoof"", after he spoke to broadcasters from an RMT union picket line on Wednesday during last week's rail strike. The BBC understands Sir Keir objected to an interview Mr Tarry gave to Sky News in which he said workers should get pay rises in line with inflation, as the party's policy is that there should be ""fair"" rises through negotiation. Veteran Labour left-winger Diane Abbott has previously told the BBC that Mr Tarry was being unfairly treated, adding: ""Everybody knows Sam Tarry wasn't sacked for interviews, he was sacked for going on a picket line.""

"Mick Antoniw (left) has just got back from Ukraine A Welsh politician has revealed that a Ukrainian relative has died in the war against Russia. Mick Antoniw said his cousin's husband died in the battle for Snake Island, adefining early moment in the war. The PontypriddMember of the Seneddhas been delivering aid to Ukraine and said its people continually heard about ""atrocities, torture, concentration camps, liquidation squads"". ""There is a new fascism in Europe that has to be defeated,"" he said, The Labour MS spoke about the loss as he joined about 100 others at a pro-Ukraine rally in Cardiff. 'My guilt at leaving Ukraine on eve of invasion' Ukraine's shadow army ""My cousin's husband was a helicopter pilot, he was shot down by a Russian rocket, he was 24 years old,"" he said. ""This was at the beginning of the conflict, the first month of the conflict he died, along with many others."" ""It was a battle over the Black Sea for Snake Island, an area that has gone down in history"", he said. ""He is a hero of Ukraine, the funeral was attended by the entirety of his village.

"Sian Green-Lord says the image on the left was used without permission, and removed her prosthetic leg A British model says she was left furious after the Spanish government used her image without permission and edited out her prosthetic leg. The photo was used as part of abody positivity campaign launched by Spain's equality ministry. But Sian Green-Lord, 32, said she only found out about the campaign when friends messaged her about it. She is the second woman featured in the campaign to say her photos were used without permission. On Friday, Nyome Nicholas-Williams, from London, told the BBC thatan image from her Instagram page was used in the posterreleased by the Spanish Institute for Women. It features an illustration of five women - including one who has had a mastectomy - on a beach underneath the slogan ""summer is ours too"". Ms Green-Lord is seen at the bottom left of the image. Speaking in an Instagram story, she said she was left ""shaking with rage"" after she saw her photos had been edited to remove her prosthetic leg. She said her swimsuit had also been altered. ""I don't know how to even explain the amount of anger that I'm feeling right now,"" she said in the video. ""There's one thing using my image without my permission. But there's another thing editing my body."" ""I literally don't even know what to say but it's beyond wrong,"" Ms Green-Lord added. The influencer and mother-of-one's leg was amputated after she was hit by a taxi while on holiday in New York in 2013. She was walking with a friend in Manhattan when the vehicle mounted the kerb. On Thursday, the campaign's creator, Arte Mapache, issued an apology for using the images without permission. ""Given the - justified - controversy over the image rights in the illustration, I have decided that the best way to make amends for the damages that may have resulted from my actions is to share out the money I received for the work and give equal parts to the people in the poster,"" the artist said. ""I hope to be able to solve all this as soon as possible, I accept my mistakes and that is why I am now trying to repair the damage caused,"" she added. The Spanish government has yet to comment on the controversy. But in a statement earlier this week, Spain'sInstitute of Women,externalsaid the campaign was a response to the ""fatphobia, hatred and the questioning of non-normative bodies - particularly those of women, something that's most prevalent in the summertime.""

"Mick Antoniw (left) has just got back from Ukraine A Welsh politician has revealed that a Ukrainian relative has died in the war against Russia. Mick Antoniw said his cousin's husband died in the battle for Snake Island, adefining early moment in the war. The PontypriddMember of the Seneddhas been delivering aid to Ukraine and said its people continually heard about ""atrocities, torture, concentration camps, liquidation squads"". ""There is a new fascism in Europe that has to be defeated,"" he said, The Labour MS spoke about the loss as he joined about 100 others at a pro-Ukraine rally in Cardiff. 'My guilt at leaving Ukraine on eve of invasion' Ukraine's shadow army ""My cousin's husband was a helicopter pilot, he was shot down by a Russian rocket, he was 24 years old,"" he said. ""This was at the beginning of the conflict, the first month of the conflict he died, along with many others."" ""It was a battle over the Black Sea for Snake Island, an area that has gone down in history"", he said. ""He is a hero of Ukraine, the funeral was attended by the entirety of his village. ""But it's not just him, there are so many others who lost their lives in this way."" Attending the same rally as Mr Antoniw with her baby son is Daryna - her father died last week last week in Ukraine and her husband remains in the country ""My heart goes out to family members who now live this life, but particularly those in the east of Ukraine,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement. Residents living in parts of eastern Donetsk have been told to evacuate the area. Mr Antoniw said there was ""unity"" among the Ukrainian people because ""there is no alternative, there is no negotiation"". He said: ""I was in Kyiv until the day before the invasion actually started in Ukraine, I managed to meet for a couple of hours some family members of mine. ""But of course, I have others who are serving in the east, who are in the forces - we've lost one family member already. ""It is the day-to-day continual, repetitive information about atrocities, torture, concentration camps, liquidation squads."" The MS, who also serves as the counsel general for Wales, has just returned from the country delivering supplies donated by trade unions. This photo was taken in Kramatorsk, in the Donetsk region by the Donetsk Regional Military Administration, of a residential home destroyed in a missile strike Mr Antoniw said Ukrainian miners' union members were asking for pick up vehicles to deliver people to the front lines. They had delivered ""an enormous amount of medical supplies"", including tourniquets and trauma bandages, he said. ""Gas supplies no longer exist in Donetsk - they will face a very very cold winter.

"Matt Walls went over the barriers and into the crowd as he tried to avoid a crash 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. England cyclist Matt Walls has been released from hospital after he was involved in a crash in which both he and his bike flew into the crowd. The 24-year-old Olympic champion has ""stitches in his forehead, scrapes and bruises"" but no major injuries, said Team England. He was treated in the stands at Lee Valley VeloPark for 40 minutes. The Isle of Man's Matt Bostock and Canada's Derek Gee were also taken to hospital for tests. Spectators were also injured, with one taken away in a wheelchair. The rest of the session was abandoned and spectators were asked to leave while Walls was having treatment. A Team England statement said:  ""Following medical treatment in hospital, Matt Walls has been discharged with stitches in his forehead, scrapes and bruises but thankfully no major injuries."" Walls later tweeted,externalto thank people for their messages of support, adding: ""I've somehow come away with no serious injures, just a few stitches and pretty banged up. ""I really hope everyone else involved is OK, including the spectators that may have been injured."" This video can not be played 'Could have been an awful lot worse' - details shared on Walls cycling crash The crash happened in the final lap of the men's scratch race qualifying as eight riders collided on the track. Walls had been trying to avoid riders who had fallen in an incident that began on the entrance to the corner. The stricken pair of New Zealander George Jackson and Australia's Josh Duffy were sliding up the banking, forcing Walls up on to the barrier and then over it into the crowd. Footage from the race showed Walls colliding with several spectators. Gee also surfed the top of the barrier but managed to avoid following Walls into the stands. A Birmingham 2022 spokesperson said: ""Three cyclists and two spectators have been treated by the on-site medical team. ""The three cyclists have been taken to hospital. The two spectators did not require hospital treatment."" Walls won omnium gold and madison silver for Team GB at last summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo. Canadian Mathias Guillemette was disqualified from the race for causing the initial crash. Walls' crash came just a day after England team-mate Joe Truman was knocked unconscious and suffered a broken collarbone in a collision in the keirin. On Sunday, England's Laura Kenny said both Walls' and Truman's crashes had had an effect on her. ""I messaged Jason [Kenny - her husband] and said, 'I'm not sure I want to do this',"" she said. ""It puts everything into perspective when something like that happens. ""We all know it's a dangerous sport so when you're not feeling physically fit to put yourself at the front of it you can't help but think, 'why am I doing this?'."" She added: ""I think the crashes are getting worse and it's because the speeds are getting higher, the positions [on the bike] are getting more extreme. ""At some point [cycling governing body] the UCI are going to have to put a cap on these positions. Maybe there should be screens because Matt should not have been able to go over the top and into the crowd, that's pretty damn dangerous. ""It's the third time now I've been in a velodrome and witnessed someone go over the top. ""[Matt] was laughing and making jokes with the paramedics, which is brilliant to hear but if he'd [not gone over] he would have done less damage."" Sir Chris Hoy, former Olympic, Commonwealth and world champion, speaking to BBC Sport This was a direct result of not having some form of barrier at the top of the fencing. It might seem strange that there is nothing to stop riders going over the fence. It's very rare for it to happen but it has over the years - maybe half a dozen times over 20 years. Personally I think it's preventable if you put a plexiglass screen around like they do in ice hockey. Look at motorsport and its catch fencing and the lengths they go to protect the crowd and also the athletes. I didn't want to see the video, I have seen a shot of it, and it was horrendous to see but on the whole it's a very safe sport. All you can do is learn from mistakes and think: How can we make the velodrome safer for athletes and spectators? I hope the people in power look at this and think something really has to be done before something genuinely serious happens in the future.

"Andy Barr watched a 50-acre field of barley on his farm go up in flames People are being urged to take extra care to avoid causing fires in the countryside during hot weather, with some farmers saying they have lost thousands of pounds worth of crops. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said fires were one of the biggest risks faced by farmers during heatwaves. One farmer told the BBC he lost around Â£40,000 worth of crops when one of his fields went up in flames last week. Englandhas experienced the driest start to the year since 1976. Thehottest ever temperature in the UK was recorded last Tuesday, with thermometers hitting 40.3C in Lincolnshire and more than 30 places reaching temperatures above the previous record. David Exwood, vice president of the NFU, said even as the weather gets cooler, the lack of rain has increased the risk of field fires. ""There needs to be extreme care when people are out in the countryside because anything can catch fire in this weather,"" he said. Heatwave to push up price of chips, say farmers UK cities warned to prepare for more wildfires Andy Barr, who owns an 800-acre farm in Lenham, Kent, had a 50-acre field of barley destroyed by a fire last Saturday. Although he is hoping to claim on insurance, Mr Barr said the crop was worth around Â£40,000. This video can not be played Watch: Fire rages in Kent field He said it was a huge shock to watch his hard work go up in flames. ""You spend a year growing it and you really like to see the fruits of your labour this time of year. So that was very disappointing,"" he said. ""But I have got over the shock now and we've just got the slightly concerning times to see what the insurers come up with."" Mr Barr was also grateful to the firefighters and neighbours who helped stop the fire spreading further by ploughing crops that had not yet gone up in flames to make a fire break. Rural insurer NFU Mutual said the majority of farmers insured their buildings, machinery and crops, and said it had seen a ""marked rise"" in claims for farm fires during the heatwave in recent weeks. Last year it estimated the cost of farm fire claims to be in excess of Â£70m. It urged people not to drop used matches or cigarettes, not to use disposable barbecues on grass or moorland and not to drop litter as discarded bottles can focus sunlight and start a fire. The fire in Lenham destroyed nearly 50 acres of barley The NFU's David Exwood said the dry, hot weather was also leading to reduced yields and quality of some crops such as potatoes, sugar beet and maize. He said this could lead to shortages of some products on shop shelves in the short term and increased prices for customers. The longer the dry weather continues, the greater the impact, he added. On his own farm in Sussex, Mr Exwood said his maize was struggling due to the lack of rain and he expected a ""dramatically reduced yield"", which could cost him tens of thousands of pounds. Hannah Buisman's family farm grows oats, wheat and barley Hannah Buisman, who works on her parents' farm near St Albans in Hertfordshire, said they had also seen reduced yields of hay and cereal crops due to the heat. She said this was hitting the farm financially, at a time when costs for things like energy were going up. Ms Buisman said the family had also put off combining crops last week because they felt it was too dangerous in the hot weather. If combines hit a bottle left in a field or flint it can strike a flame and cause a fire, she explained. She urged people not to leave litter in fields, adding that a neighbouring farm had lost 240 acres of crops in a fire. ""It's a worst nightmare, especially in years as volatile as these,"" she said.

""We all know it's a dangerous sport so when you're not feeling physically fit to put yourself at the front of it you can't help but think, 'why am I doing this?'."" She added: ""I think the crashes are getting worse and it's because the speeds are getting higher, the positions [on the bike] are getting more extreme. ""At some point [cycling governing body] the UCI are going to have to put a cap on these positions. Maybe there should be screens because Matt should not have been able to go over the top and into the crowd, that's pretty damn dangerous. ""It's the third time now I've been in a velodrome and witnessed someone go over the top. ""[Matt] was laughing and making jokes with the paramedics, which is brilliant to hear but if he'd [not gone over] he would have done less damage.""

Personally I think it's preventable if you put a plexiglass screen around like they do in ice hockey. Look at motorsport and its catch fencing and the lengths they go to protect the crowd and also the athletes. I didn't want to see the video, I have seen a shot of it, and it was horrendous to see but on the whole it's a very safe sport. All you can do is learn from mistakes and think: How can we make the velodrome safer for athletes and spectators?

"Matt Walls went over the barriers and into the crowd as he tried to avoid a crash 2022 Commonwealth Games Hosts:BirminghamDates:28 July to 8 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV with extra streams on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport mobile app; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra; live text and clips online. England cyclist Matt Walls has been released from hospital after he was involved in a crash in which both he and his bike flew into the crowd. The 24-year-old Olympic champion has ""stitches in his forehead, scrapes and bruises"" but no major injuries, said Team England. He was treated in the stands at Lee Valley VeloPark for 40 minutes. The Isle of Man's Matt Bostock and Canada's Derek Gee were also taken to hospital for tests. Spectators were also injured, with one taken away in a wheelchair. The rest of the session was abandoned and spectators were asked to leave while Walls was having treatment. A Team England statement said:  ""Following medical treatment in hospital, Matt Walls has been discharged with stitches in his forehead, scrapes and bruises but thankfully no major injuries."" Walls later tweeted,externalto thank people for their messages of support, adding: ""I've somehow come away with no serious injures, just a few stitches and pretty banged up. ""I really hope everyone else involved is OK, including the spectators that may have been injured."" This video can not be played 'Could have been an awful lot worse' - details shared on Walls cycling crash The crash happened in the final lap of the men's scratch race qualifying as eight riders collided on the track. Walls had been trying to avoid riders who had fallen in an incident that began on the entrance to the corner. The stricken pair of New Zealander George Jackson and Australia's Josh Duffy were sliding up the banking, forcing Walls up on to the barrier and then over it into the crowd. Footage from the race showed Walls colliding with several spectators. Gee also surfed the top of the barrier but managed to avoid following Walls into the stands. A Birmingham 2022 spokesperson said: ""Three cyclists and two spectators have been treated by the on-site medical team. ""The three cyclists have been taken to hospital. The two spectators did not require hospital treatment."" Walls won omnium gold and madison silver for Team GB at last summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo. Canadian Mathias Guillemette was disqualified from the race for causing the initial crash. Walls' crash came just a day after England team-mate Joe Truman was knocked unconscious and suffered a broken collarbone in a collision in the keirin. On Sunday, England's Laura Kenny said both Walls' and Truman's crashes had had an effect on her. ""I messaged Jason [Kenny - her husband] and said, 'I'm not sure I want to do this',"" she said. ""It puts everything into perspective when something like that happens.

"This video can not be played Watch: President Zelensky's message to civilians in Donetsk region: ""We will help you, we are not Russia"" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has told all civilians still living in parts of eastern Donetsk region under Ukrainian control to evacuate. Speaking during a late-night address from Kyiv, Mr Zelensky said fighting in the region was intense. ""The more people leave Donetsk region now, the fewer people the Russian army will have time to kill,"" he said. The region has seen heavy clashes amid a slow advance by Russian forces, who already control large parts of it. ""We will use all available opportunities to save as many lives as possible and to limit Russian terror as much as possible,"" the president added. It is not the first time the Ukrainian authorities have told people to leave the area. Between 200,000 and 220,000 civilians still live in the unoccupied area of Donetsk, according to Ukrainian estimates. An evacuation notice from the government warned the coming winter would make thing worse, especially for children. ""They need to be evacuated, you cannot put them in mortal danger in the winter without heating, light, without the ability to keep them warm,"" Kyiv's Ministry of Reintegration of Temporarily Occupied Territories said. The president's intervention comes as Russia invited UN and Red Cross officials to investigate the deaths of 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in another part of Donetsk region held by Russian-backed separatists. The troops were killed in unclear circumstances during an attack on a prison in Olenivka, with both sides trading blame. Speaking on Saturday evening, Russian defence officials said Moscow would welcome an ""objective investigation"" into the incident. Relatives of troops who defended Azovstal rallied against Russia in Kyiv on Saturday The Red Cross said on Friday it was asking for access to the Russian-run detention facility and to surviving prisoners - but no permission was immediately forthcoming. Its deputy head of delegation in Ukraine, Daniel Bunnskog, said granting access to POWs was an obligation under the Geneva Conventions. The Olenivka prison camp is controlled by the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR). What happened there on Friday remains unclear. Unverified Russian video footage of the aftermath shows a tangle of wrecked bunk beds and badly charred bodies. On Saturday, Russia published a list of what it said were the 50 POWs killed in the strike. Moscow says the attack was carried out by Ukraine using a US-made HIMARS artillery system. Kyiv denies carrying out the strike and has alleged that Russia fired on the facility to cover up evidence of war crimes. This video can not be played From 2022: Ros Atkins on... Putinâs false Nazi claims about Ukraine Elsewhere, Ukrainian officials labelled Russia a ""terrorist state"" after Moscow's UK embassy tweeted that Ukrainian Azov battalion soldiers deserved a ""humiliating death"" by hanging. Twitter acknowledged that the post from the Russian embassy violated the social media company's ""rules about hateful conduct"" - but added that it might be in the public interest to keep it accessible. The tweet sent out on Friday night said that Azov ""militants deserve execution, but death not by firing squad but by hanging, because they're not real soldiers. They deserve a humiliating death"". The tweet included a video clip showing a couple in a wrecked building, accusing Azov troops of having shelled their home. The embassy's call for execution repeats what the man in the video says. Azov troops were forced to lay down weapons in May after fiercely defending for weeks Azovstal, a giant steelworks in the south-eastern port of Mariupol that was eventually captured by Russia. The Azov Regiment is a nationalist group with far-right links when it was set up in 2014. It was later incorporated into Ukraine's National Guard. Russia has long accused the regiment of being neo-Nazis and war criminals, as part of the Kremlin's propaganda campaign to justify its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022.

"Three former health secretaries have called on the government to urgently pay compensation to victims of the contaminated blood scandal. The chairman of the public inquiry into the scandal, Sir Brian Langstaff,has recommendedthat each victim should receive a provisional sum of Â£100,000. One woman who developed hepatitis C from infected blood told the BBC the news was ""incredibly significant"". The government has said it will urgently consider any recommendations. Former health secretaries Andy Burnham, Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock told the BBC it was important to act quickly because the life expectancy of many victims had been shortened by infections they had contracted. A lawyer representing about 15,000 claimants also argued that victims should receive compensation ""immediately"". Des Collins said payment must be made within ""days or weeks"", and he would step up pressure from Monday. The school where dozens died in NHS blood scandal Explained: Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood Pay-outs ignore some families - victim's son Thousands of people contracted HIV or hepatitis C in the 1970s and 80s afterbeing given a new treatment called factor VIII or IX. More than 2,400 have died as a result, and it has been estimated that one person affected by the scandal dies every four days. At the time, the medication was imported from the US where it was made from the pooled blood plasma of thousands of paid donors, including some in high-risk groups, such as prisoners. If a single donor was infected with a blood-borne virus such as hepatitis or HIV, then the whole batch of medication could be contaminated. An unknown number of UK patients were also exposed to hepatitis B or C though a blood transfusion after childbirth or surgery. This video can not be played Video statements were played at the start of the public inquiry in September 2018 Labour's Andy Burnham called on ministers to act quickly, telling BBC Breakfast many victims had ""not got long left"". He added that governments had not ""been truthful about this matter because of the fear about the financial exposure"". Mr Burnham claimed that successive health ministers - including himself - had been misled by officials, adding there ""may be a case for corporate manslaughter"". Conservative MP Jeremy Hunt, another former health secretary who now chairs the health select committee, said the issue must not be ""kicked into the long grass"". Like Mr Burnham, he acknowledged failings of previous governments in their support for victims of the scandal. Giving evidence to the inquiry in 2021, then health secretary Matt Hancock said ""of course"" compensation would be paid to victims and their families if the public inquiry formally called for it. On Saturday, Mr Hancock told the BBC he was confident the government would deliver pay-outs to victims and that it was its ""moral duty"" to do so. Mr Hancock went on to say that compensation had not been paid yet because ""in government, when a recommendation comes in like this, you do need to then check with each department"". Ros Cooper welcomed the judge's recommendation of compensation Ros Cooper, who was infected with hepatitis C after being given blood-clotting products as a baby, welcomed the recommendation of interim compensation. Ms Cooper called the judge's words ""incredibly significant"", telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her disease had been ""the controlling factor"" in her life. Currently, victims and families get an annual financial support payment but have not been compensated for loss of earnings, care costs and other lifetime losses. Sir Brian Langstaff said on Friday that more than 4,000 individuals who currently qualify for the government's existing offering of financial support - including some bereaved partners of those killed - should now receive the pay-outs. Jason Evans, whose father died in 1993 after contracting HIV and hepatitis C from infected blood, said he was concerned he would need to continue to campaign to get pay-outs ""over the line"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he described the ""terrible"" stigma his family had faced during his father's illness. He said his mother lost her job at a bakery because the manager thought customers would worry about being served by someone whose husband might develop Aids. Mr Evans, who was four when his father died, was also bullied at school as a result of his father's infection. Jason Evans said his family had faced stigma after his father contracted HIV and hepatitis C Mr Evans criticised shortcomings in the existing government support scheme for victims, saying this hadcreated a ""situation where some victims' lives matter and others' don't"". He said some bereaved family members would be ineligible to receive support under Sir Brian's recommendation - for example, if a victim's relationship had broken down, meaning that their ex-spouse had no longer been living with the victim at the time they died. Over the years, the government has put in place a number of schemes offering victims financial support without any admission of liability but, unlike in the Republic of Ireland and some other countries, compensation has never been paid to individuals or families affected. Compensation would be intended to fund immediate bills and care needs, with final recommendations on compensation for a wider group of people expected when the inquiry concludes next year. An independent study commissioned by the government,published last month,external, said victims should eventually be compensated for physical and social injury, the stigma of the disease, the impact on family and work life, and the cost of care. Partners, children, siblings and parents of those who have been infected should be eligible for payments too, the study recommended. If the inquiry and then the government accept those proposals then it is possible a final bill could be more than a billion pounds. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise how important this will be for people infected and affected across the UK, and can confirm that the government will consider Sir Brian's report and the recommendations of Sir Robert Francis QC with the utmost urgency, and will respond as soon as possible.""
