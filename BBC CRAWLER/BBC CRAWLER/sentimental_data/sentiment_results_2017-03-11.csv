"Will Smith (left) moved on from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air - but Alfonso Ribeiro has struggled It's every budding actor's dream - a starring role in a TV show or film that becomes a major hit. But then they try to move on - and find that their iconic character just won't let them. The latest actor to complain about being shackled to his famous alter ego is Alfonso Ribeiro. You may know him better as Will Smith's highfalutin cousin Carlton Banks from 1990s sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. He's said being overshadowed by his character has ""stopped me from being able to be an actor"". The 45-year-oldtold Metro,external: ""It has forced ME to be my character, hosting game shows and America's Funniest Videos. ""I would like to try some stuff that is different from how the world sees me, just sink my teeth intoâ¦ shoot, I could be a deranged killer! ""But I doubt someone would automatically think of me when they go, 'We need to cast a killer, let's get the dude who played Carlton.'"" He did also say the role was ""rewarding in many ways"" - and you could argue that an actor is lucky to get one part in a hit show in their career. Here are some other actors who have found it impossible to leave their most famous parts behind - and some who have managed to reinvent themselves. Perhaps the ultimate example of an actor known for one role, Hamill (above right) is and always will be Luke Skywalker. His non-Star Wars films remained relatively low-key so he went to Broadway, taking the title role in Amadeus in 1983. But when director Milos Forman made a big screen version, he is reported to have rejected Hamill, saying: ""I don't want Luke Skywalker in this film."" Hamill got around the typecasting by becoming a successful voice actor, including as The Joker in the Batman animated series. The force also remained strong for Hamill's co-star, whose performance as Princess Leia became iconic. Fisher had other roles - like in When Harry Met Sally and Hannah and Her Sisters - and wrote novels. Butshe said,externalbeing most closely associated with Leia had been ""great"". ""She's a very proactive character and gets the job done. So if you're going to get typecast as something, that might as well be it for me."" Van Der Beek (second left) has struggled to shed the memory of teenage heart-throb Dawson, whose Creek was so admired by teen viewers from 1998-2003. ""It did hold me back,""he said in 2014,external, adding that movie directors would think he was too recognisable and not take him seriously. ""But at the end of the day, it just makes you work that much harder."" He has also parodied his own fame - even playing a bitter version of himself as an actor trying to revive his career in 2012 sitcom Don't Trust The B in Apartment 23. This could apply to any of the cast of Friends to be honest. In fact, Aniston has arguably done better than the rest - she's been in lots of middle-ranking rom-coms and got a Golden Globe nomination for 2014 drama Cake. But who are we kidding - she's still Rachel. ""It's really hard to be cast in [a dramatic film like Cake],""she said in 2015,external. Especially if ""you're someone who is battling a persona. Sometimes it's hard to disappear from it in a role."" And sometimes it's hard to get away from a certain haircut. The star of the original four Superman movies in the 1970s and '80s, Reeve later battled to ""escape the cape"". He took a wide variety of roles on film, TV and stage before a riding accident left him paralysed in 1995. Only his later real-life role as a campaigner for spinal cord injury research came close to eclipsing that of the Man of Steel. Starring in The Fresh Prince of Bel Air didn't seem to hold Will Smith back. In fact, it led to a string of hit films including Bad Boys, Independence Day, Men in Black and Ali, not to mention two Oscar nominations. And, presumably to Ribeiro's chagrin, he has even played a killer - as Deadshot in Suicide Squad. Perhaps he should be typecast a bit more. He can do comedy, action or drama - as long as he's an indomitable, smart-talking, high-energy hero. Films where he plays more sombre roles tend to tank. Having proved it possible to break out of the Star Wars universe, Harrison Ford isn't just the bloke who played Han Solo. Perhaps he was lucky in that he made two more major films - Raiders of the Lost Ark and Blade Runner - before The Return of the Jedi could trap him in that particular pigeonhole. Or perhaps there's another explanation - maybe he's a better actor than his Star Wars co-stars. Of the main Harry Potter cast, Emma Watson is probably the one where you think ""oh it's that one from Harry Potter"" least often. She's done a few half-decent grown-up films and we'll see how her biggest post-Potter movie, Beauty and the Beast, performs next week. But more than that - she's positioned herself as a serious social commentator. Daniel Radcliffe, too, is desperately trying to be a proper actor. But, perhaps because he played Harry himself, it might take a bit longer for us to shake off the image of the kid with wand and glasses.

"When soldiers went searching for militants in Myanmar's Rakhine state last October, the result for members of the Rohingya minority was disastrous. Villages were burned, men were killed, women were sexually abused. And when one woman complained of rape, she was accused of lying by the office of the country's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and hounded by vengeful soldiers. Sitting cross-legged on the floor, 25-year-old Jamalida Begum tells me what happened in the days after her husband was shot dead in the village of Pyaung Pyaik, north-western Myanmar. Jamalida fled with her two children and watched from a distance as the army set houses in the village on fire. Satellite images confirm that at least85 buildings were destroyed,external. Five days later she returned with some of her neighbours to find her belongings and home destroyed.  They sheltered together in one of the few homes that had survived - but at dawn the next day the soldiers came back. ""They chose 30 women. Half were young girls aged between 12 and 15,"" says Jamalida. The soldiers took them to the village school. ""Then they chose four from among the 30,"" Jamalida says. ""It was me and three teenage girls. Then we were separated. The army took me to the east of the school near the pond. Another seven soldiers took the other three girls to the hill to the south of the school. ""They shouted at me to open my shirt and mythami(wrap-around skirt). When I refused they started beating me, grabbed my clothes and pushed me to the ground. Three soldiers raped and tortured me for an hour. Blood came out of my lower part and my legs got cramped. They punched me into the eyes saying I was staring at them. It turned my eyes red like fire coal. They left me bleeding and drove away in their Jeeps."" The soldiers were sent into northern Rakhine state to conduct ""clearance operations"" after militants from Jamalida's ethnic group, the Rohingya, launched an attack on three Burmese police posts on 9 October last year - killing nine officers and seizing guns and ammunition. This video can not be played Myanmar: Who are the Rohingya? A wave of reports of human rights abuses followed, including scores of allegations of rape. For weeks Myanmar's human rights icon turned leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, denied the allegations, insisting soldiers were adhering to the law, while at the same time refusing to allow independent journalists or observers to access the area. Freedom and Fear in Myanmar is broadcast on Our World on the BBC News Channel from 11 March - clickherefor transmission times or to catch up later on iPlayer (UK only) Clickherefor transmission times on BBC World News But as the outcry grew she set up an investigation team, and on 11 December it reached Pyaung Pyaik. Though initially reluctant, Jamalida was persuaded to speak by the only woman on the team, Dr Thet Thet Zin, the chairman of Myanmar's Women's Affairs Federation. ""She said we won't harm you, bring us the raped and tortured women,"" Jamalida says. ""So I went there and told her everything and they recorded it."" Jamalida's interaction with the investigation team was filmed and several minutes of it broadcast on television. It is extraordinary footage, not just because of the way Jamalida is browbeaten by the translators, but because the Burmese state broadcaster didn't translate what Jamalida is saying to the investigators in the Rohingya language. Once fully translated, it's clear that Jamalida is describing strong circumstantial evidence that rape has taken place. She tells them she saw three young Rohingya women being taken off into the bushes by soldiers. ""Did you see if those women were raped or not?"" the translator asks. ""I did not,"" Jamalida replies. ""So, it isn't true,"" the translator fires back. ""Yes and no,"" Jamalida says. ""They were bleeding directly from here"". She points between her legs. ""Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that they are bleeding, just say whether you've seen rape or not,"" the translator replies. The translator tells the investigators that Jamalida did not see the women being raped. Jamalida is also asked directly whether she herself was raped. She tells the investigators that soldiers took her away, stripped her naked and molested her, but says it was ""hands only"" and not rape. The translator says: ""She wasn't raped."" Here things get complicated. Ten days later Jamalida is filmed again. This time, a group of handpicked journalists have been brought by the government to Pyaung Pyaik. Initially none of the Rohingya want to speak to them so someone goes to get Jamalida. She tells the journalists the same story of army abuse again, except this time it changes and she says she was raped. This discrepancy, between being stripped and molested and being raped, was immediately seized on by Aung San Suu Kyi's office, which was at the time running an aggressive campaign rubbishing foreign and social media reports of atrocities in Rakhine State as ""fake news"". Jamalida's face was suddenly on Burmese television and state media once again, now paraded as a liar. Aung San Suu Kyi's Facebook pagecalled her story an example of ""Fake Rape"",externalin a big picture banner. Banner on the Facebook page of Myanmar's State Counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi So what's the truth? When I speak to Jamalida her testimony is detailed and convincing. It matches what she told the journalists and what she said to the investigators apart from that one detail. I believe her when she says she was raped. I ask Jamalida about the difference in her accounts 10 days apart. She insists that she did tell the government investigators she was raped but that one of the translators was shouting and threatening to beat her. If she did tell the investigators this, it's possible Burmese TV chose not to broadcast this part of her testimony. ""I know they told everyone we weren't raped, tortured or anything,"" says Jamalida. ""We do not have justice in our own country."" The promise made by Thet Thet Zin that no-one would face reprisals for speaking out, turned out to be hollow. When soldiers came looking for her, she fled to a different village. Then, after speaking to the journalists, she realised it was not safe even there. ""The military were searching for me by getting all the women together in the yard and then showing them my picture,"" says Jamalida. ""I was so scared I hid in the jungle."" Unable to take it any longer, the young widow fled across the River Naf into Bangladesh - one of more than 70,000 Rohingya to have arrived in the last few months. I spoke to Thet Thet Zin on the phone. She said that although she couldn't remember meeting Jamalida, the soldiers must have been searching for her to protect rather than harass her. She added that she had seen no conclusive evidence of rape and that she doubted it had happened, as it went against Buddhist culture and tradition. (While the Rohingya are Muslim, most of Myanmar's soldiers are Buddhist.) Bangladesh is now the best place to go to learn what is happening in northern Rakhine state, which is closed to journalists.  Even the UN's special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, Yanghee Lee, has had very limited access. ""I didn't think that I would say this out loud, that it's crimes against humanity,"" she says, when we meet in the airport at Cox's Bazaar. ""I think that the military needs to bear [responsibility] but at the end of the day it is the civilian government that has to answer and respond to these massive cases of horrific torture and very inhumane crimes that they have committed against their own people."" On Monday Yanghee Lee will urge the UN Human Rights Council to set up a Commission of Inquiry to investigate theabuses against the Rohingya,external. As dusk began to fall at the Kutupalong refugee camp, where I met Jamalida Begum, I ask her what she thinks of Aung San Suu Kyi. Aung San Suu Kyi ""She is doing nothing at all for us,"" she says. ""If she was good, we wouldn't have to suffer so much in that country.  Since she is in power Myanmar is hell for us."" Suu Kyi's power to stop the army abuses is limited, under the terms of the constitution drafted by the military. The spokesman for her party told me the UN claims were ""an exaggeration"" and the Rohingya issue was ""an internal affair"". But Aung San Suu Kyi hasn't been to northern Rakhine State, and has never visited a Rohingya camp. In short, Myanmar's Nobel peace prize winner has given no indication to the Rohingya that she really cares.

"Brian Vigneault had been playing for more than 20 hours continuously when he died The death of a prominent gamer has led to a debate about whether gaming marathons are hazardous to health. Brian Vigneault was a 35-year-old father of three from Virginia, USA who gamed under the alias Poshybrid. In February he took on a 24-hour-long gaming marathon, playing World of Tanks to raise money for charity. The marathon was streamed to a live audience on the websiteTwitch, which describes itself as ""the world's leading video platform and community for gamers"". Twenty two hours in, Vigneault reportedly went outside to take a cigarette break. He didn't return to the screen - and later died. Vigneault's exact cause of death has not yet been established, or conclusively linked to his streaming marathon. But his friend Jessica Gebauer, who spoke to him on the night he died, told BBC Trending that he looked ""extremely tired"" and was falling asleep during the stream. Since Vigneault's death, Gebauer, who is a fellow streamer, says she has questioned the health implications of continuous live-stream gaming. She is not the only one. Hear this story in fullon the BBC World Service, ordownload our podcast Joe Marino is a ""professional"" Twitch user, who makes money from subscriptions to his gaming channel. He told BBC Trending that he thinks all streaming platforms should set up limits on how long streamers can stream. Marino, who says he developed Type 2 diabetes after spending a year streaming on Twitch 12 hours a day, seven days a week, said: ""The reason you don't move around on Twitch is because you're live, so if you get up and move you've potentially lost a portion of your audience. ""Viewers equal money."" Following the death of Vigneault, Marino penned awarning article,externalwarning about the health risks of his streaming career. It received comments from gamers who said they too experienced health issues following marathon gaming sessions. Joe Marino in front of his gaming setup Founded in 2011 and bought by Amazon in 2014, Twitch is a huge community of gamers and game watchers. The company estimates that each day close to 10 million people visit the site to watch fellow gamers and talk about video games, and users can also donate money to more than 2 million streamers. Twitch and other similar sites host tournaments where seasoned players stay continuously online for several hours - or longer - and gaming marathons are becoming more and more common. Well-known streamers such as ManVsGame have frequently taken part in marathon streams exceeding 24 hours - and in 2015 hespoke,externalabout taking drugs to supplement his marathon sessions. Visit theTrending Facebook page,external While deaths as a result of video game streaming are incredibly rare, there have been other incidents including the death of a 24-year-old man in Shanghai 2015 who died after playing World of Warcraft for 19 hours, and the death in 2012 of a teenager in Taiwan who reportedly died at an Internet cafe playing Diablo 3 for 40 hours straight. Twitch is a live streaming social video platform for gamers. The site say they have more than 9 million daily active users Cam Adair, who is founder ofGame Quitters,external- the largest online support community for people with gaming addiction - says Twitch and other streaming platforms have a duty of care to their users: ""I'm not saying that companies need to be policing their users, but they could simply reach out and say 'Hey, I've seen you've been playing 15 hours today which is different to what was going on before. Are you OK?'"" However, for professional Twitch streamer Ben Broman, who has taken part in 11 24-hour gaming marathons, imposing health guidelines on Twitch streamers would be too restrictive. ""Twitch, much like any other creative career, involves risk taking and any artist will tell you that it's very important for them to be able to go about creating it in whatever way they see fit,"" he told BBC Trending. Another streamer on Reddit said: ""Not intending to speak ill of the dead, but he made the choice to do this... I understand there is pressure to produce, but obviously some things come before that. I don't think we should impose restrictions."" Twitch said they are ""greatly saddened"" at the passing of one of their users, but the company has not responded to suggestions that they should be taking a more active approach in ensuring the health of their users.

"If you're buying a new car, these changes could affect you The way we pay road tax will change significantly from 1 April and it is something to consider if you're going to be buying a new car. Crucially, it is those buying cars with low CO2 emissions that face the highest relative rise in the tax. Currently many such vehicles don't incur the charges, known formally as Vehicle Excise Duty (VED). But for cars registered on or after 1 April 2017 there will be a first year of charges linked to carbon emissions. After that there will be three bands - zero, standard and premium - determining how much you will pay as a car owner each year. Importantly, if you have a car already, these rule changes do not apply and you will continue to pay VED under the existing rates. The changes,announced in the July 2015 Budget, reflect the fact that car manufacturers have cut many car models' CO2 emissions. This means their owners benefit from the existing VED bands that tax lower-emissions vehicles more lightly. Many more expensive cars will see a smaller relative hike in VED rates As more cars get cleaner, the existing rules have cut back the Treasury's income - hence these changes. From 1 April onwards, only newly registered cars with zero emissions will escape VED - so that means electric and hydrogen cars only. There is a sliding scale of charges for the first year of ownership and after that petrol or diesel vehicles are subject to a ""standard"" rate of Â£140 a year. For those buying cars costing more than Â£40,000 there will be an additional Â£310 ""premium"" levy for the first five years of ownership. Cars registered before 1 April, 2017 are not affected by the VED changes - so for existing car owners, you will pay as before. If your vehicle was registered before 1 March 2001 then the engine size is what determines how much you pay If your car has an engine capacity of less than 1549cc (about 1.5 litres), then you will still pay Â£145 (if you pay upfront). If you car has a bigger engine, then the annual charge is Â£235. Both these figures rise slightly if you pay in instalments. You can get a detailed breakdownhere,external. If your vehicle was registered after 1 March 2001, then it is emissions that determine how much you currently pay. Vehicles have to be in Band D (emitting 121-130g/km of CO2) before you pay any significant annual road tax - in the case of Band D it is Â£110 a year. The VED changes do not apply to cars that are already on the road, so if you're buying a second-hand car then your vehicle will be taxed under the old system. However, one wrinkle to bear in mind is that since the end of the paper tax disc in 2014 it is no long possible to transfer this tax between car owners. You'll need to tax your new car yourself As soon as the car is sold the seller should complete the ""new keeper"" bit of the car's registration document - the V5C certificate - and send it to the DVLA. You, as the new owner, keep hold of the green bit. You can tax the car immediately online or over the phone with theDVLA,external, or at a post office.  The seller gets a refund of unused tax from the DVLA. It all depends what type of car you are thinking of buying, but in general it is the most economical vehicles which face the biggest percentage rise in road taxes. Current charges are closely linked to a vehicle's CO2 emissions For a small car like a Ford Fiesta 1.0T Ecoboost with CO2 emissions of 99g/km, you pay no Vehicle Excise Duty if you buy before 1 April. If you buy after that you pay up to Â£120 in the first year and Â£140 annually thereafter. For a mid-range car, like the Honda Civic 1.4 i-VTEC Sport, with a higher CO2 emissions figure of 131g/km you currently pay Â£130 in the first year and then a standard annual rate - also Â£130. If you buy on or after 1 April you'll pay Â£200 in the first year and Â£140 thereafter. For a top-end car like the Jaguar XE 2.0i R-Sport with CO2 emissions of 179g/km you currently pay Â£355 in the first year and Â£230 after that. If you buy on or after 1 April you will pay Â£800 in the first year, but your annual bill will then come down to Â£140. From 1 April, only newly registered cars with zero emissions will escape VED - so that means electric and hydrogen cars only. Only electric and hydrogen cars will escape paying VED under the rules changes Cars with low CO2 emissions of up to 100g/km will pay between Â£10-Â£120 in the first year. After the first year of registration, alternative fuel vehicles such as hybrids, or those using bi-ethanol and liquid petroleum gas will pay Â£130 a year. So if you are considering buying a low-emissions car using an alternative fuel, it may make sense to bring forward your purchase to March. The money raised for this will be paid into a roads fund to help towards the upkeep of the UK's motorway and roads network. Motoring groups have given a mixed reaction to the changes. ""While zero-emission cars will, on the whole, remain exempt from VED, the new regime will disincentivise take-up of low-emission vehicles,"" said Tamzen Isacsson of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Car prices have been falling in real terms for some time ""For example, new technologies such as plug-in hybrid - the fastest growing ultra-low emission vehicle segment - won't benefit from long-term VED incentive, threatening the ability of the UK and the automotive sector to meet ever stricter CO2 targets. ""The introduction of a surcharge on premium cars also risks undermining growth in UK manufacturing and exports, which helps to support some 814,000 jobs in the UK."" The RAC said that while costs would rise for many drivers, the fact that new car prices had been dropping in real terms over many years would help offset this. It also welcomed the fact that money raised from VED would be ring-fenced for road investments.

"Earlier this month, a relic from World War Two intruded into daily life in north London. A 500lb Luftwaffe bomb was discovered by builders excavating in the leafy suburb of Brondesbury. Local homes were evacuated, local train services were closed down.Eventually the weapon was made safeand finally removed to be detonated on an army range. This relic of a war that ended more than 70 years ago set me thinking. World War Two - just like the Great War that preceded it - was a total war. The fates of all the countries involved were in the balance. Ordinary soldiers were largely not professionals but were conscripted citizens. The whole of society - its energies and industrial might - were mobilised for the conflict. Once the war was over, many of its constraints inevitably lingered - the rationing of food, for example. War-ravaged cities also bore their scars. Army bomb disposal experts made the Brondesbury device safe As a child I remember the temporary homes - the rectangular ""prefabs"" or prefabricated houses - that dotted many of the bomb sites in east London near my grandparents' home. My childhood was dominated by films and documentaries about the war. I lose track of the number of plastic Spitfire model kits I must have built to battle with their Messerschmitt equivalents. Iraq and Afghanistan wars memorial unveiled Nato chief says alliance 'does not want new Cold War' But whatever the memories and cultural obsessions, the conflict was definitively over. There was, in short, a clear distinction between war and peace. Thankfully the so-called Cold War of the 1950s and 60s remained just that: in Europe, at least, it never went hot. War and peace were two separate states of affairs. Fast forward to today. This week, in London, a memorial was unveiled to the service personnel and civilians who lost their lives in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. On the government's own website it is described as the Iraq and Afghanistan Memorial. In the West, at least, the Cold War never became hot In the lengthy press release that follows there is no mention of the word ""war"", except to say that the new memorial stands close to monuments to World War Two and the Korean War. There is rightly, of course, mention of the lives lost and the medals won. There is, too, appreciation for those who ""put themselves in harm's way"" - an Americanism that has intruded itself into the public debate on armed conflict. But there you have it. These were undoubtedly armed conflicts far from our shores. But in what sense were they wars? Well of course they were, I hear you say, this is all semantic argument. Well, they were certainly wars for the Afghans and the Iraqis who were in some cases willing, and in many cases, unwilling participants in the struggles. They were certainly wars for those actually engaged in combat. From my very limited experience under fire, it matters little if it is a skirmish or a fully-fledged battle if it is you on the spot where the bullets are flying. The Queen unveiled the Iraq and Afghanistan memorial in London But were Britain, the United States or their many allies who have contributed troops to these conflicts really ""at war""? To what extent were their societies adapted or mobilised for the struggle? In some senses, very little. But in others, perhaps, more than we would like to admit. None of their economies was on a war footing and the fighting was done largely by regular professional troops or volunteer reservists. Boots on the ground were combined with the signature style of the modern Western military campaign: lashings of air power along with the use of sophisticated armed drones. Paradoxically, the primary impact of these wars was on the home front: the political obsession with terrorism which has had an impact on policing, community relations and security legislation and created an atmosphere in which debate about ""fear of the other"" has become an increasingly important factor in democratic elections and referendums. It has also led increasingly to a militarisation of foreign policy - the idea that the military has an answer for most of the world's problems. And, in the midst of this, the former US Pentagon official and academic Rosa Brooks has mused eloquently on this theme in a book cogently titled How Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything. Her message, that the blurring of the boundaries of war and peace has consequences for all our lives, is one that seems to resound with ever more people around the globe.

"Little chance of a quiet cuppa in some Beijing cafes There are some societies where people are expected to avoid being noisy in public and they behave accordingly. Then there's China. This country that I love is many things, but quiet is not one of them. There are plenty of bustling cities - rammed with millions of people - where you could be frowned upon for disrupting others with a raised voice: Seoul, London, Tokyoâ¦ especially Tokyo. China does not have those cities. The word most often used here to describe a great restaurant is not ""moody"" nor ""intimate"" nor ""tasteful"" but ""renao"". To be ç­é¹ is to be bustling with noise and excitement. After all, who'd want to go to one of those fussy, dull joints where you couldn't bring kids or laugh too loud or spill a beer? Laughter is often part of the noise Now, given that I've lived in Beijing for 12 years, you would think that outbursts in public would be as nothing to this hardened correspondent, fully enmeshed in the ways of the Middle Kingdom, yet China can always turn on a surprise. So there I am at a cafe nearby, feeling all urbane with a light caffeine buzz on: newspaper; some other reading material; Chet Baker's mournful trumpet floating around the room at just the right level; I can't help noticing a smart-looking beautiful woman across the other side of the room talking to her friend andâ¦ ""Weeiiii""!!! [Hello!] Somebody starts a phone call at the top of their voice in full-flight pirate-sounding Beijing dialect. Anyone who has heard a Beijing taxi driver on the phone to the family at home will know exactly how this sounds. ""Naaaarrrrrr? Bu shirrrrrr baaaaa."" [Where? No it isn't.] A cafe in Japan on the other hand, is likely to be an oasis of calm At this point a Chinese farmer walks in carrying the fake and/or stolen watches he's been selling on the street. He's carrying his flask of tea, has no intention of buying anything at the cafe and sits on a stool with best view out of the window, next to his mate who also has no intention of buying anything but is very interested in showing the purveyor of watches an awesome new video game on his phone. Woooshhhh! Bam! Bam! Ba-doing!!! The two of them crack up laughing and they keep playing. Just as the first conversation is getting heated, a young convert to Christianity sits down next to me and starts praying before diving into her diary-style, each-day-a-new-lesson, introduction to Jesus. Many countries are densely populated but they respond to the squeeze in different ways Nearby, phone conversation number two kicks in: ""Weeeeeiiiiiii"" Game, argument, praying, talk, game, laughter, talk... ""Look at the starsâ¦ Look how they shine for youâ¦"" A hippie looking Chinese bloke has booted up his laptop and Coldplay starts belting out of the speakers. ""And everything you do. Yeah they were all yellow."" He has his eyes closed and is gyrating in the seat as he sings along to himself. I look around the cafe and, amidst this cacophony of chaos, nobody but me has reacted as if this is anything but completely normal. Some people are chatting amongst themselves, others reading or sending messages on mobile phones but they've not even glanced up to pay attention to the activities around them. The Big Apple - and unlikely ally to China when it comes to bustle The other place in the world I've seen this phenomenon is New York. I went to a diner there once which had an open plan kitchen. It was packed for the morning rush hour. I was preparing to take in the New York Times over breakfast when one of the cooks started ribbing his workmate and the tension was building. At least I thought so. Then the cook being hassled turned to the other and said in a pretty menacing tone: ""Yeah keep talkin' funny guy!"" At this point I was considering the possible uses of a spatula as a weapon. Then the diner owner called out at the top of his voice from the payment counter by the door: ""Heh, Pauly, go downstairs and get me some of those ******* strawberries!!!"" Nobody. Even. Flinched. The whole country feels like it's on the move There is something incredible about the way in which societies, cities, subcultures find their level in terms of acceptable public volume. If a megacity has its own disruptive sound maybe you have to speak up to get over it? But with what noise does a Chinese farmer have to compete in the field? Maybe you have to speak up in order to be heard amongst a huge population? Yet most Chinese people in recent years grew up with no brothers or sisters and had only their parents at home for evening conversations. Back in the cafe, Mr Coldplay has packed up his laptop, the game boys have gone and only the first woman is still speaking on the phoneâ¦ but now much more quietly: she's crying. Her call has been more important than I had given her credit for. ""I've been there,"" I thought. Loudly playing Coldplay songs in public does not go down well everywhere I can remember being in London many years ago on a backpacking trip when I got the news that a good friend, a brilliant young doctor, had died back in Sydney. I didn't know what to do so I went to a cafe and wrote her a letter to say goodbye. I was crying my eyes out in a public place and people were looking at me but not disapprovingly. They just didn't know how to take it. When I told a BBC colleague I was going to write this piece she laughed: ""What? An Australian talking about noisy people?"" Maybe we are. I hadn't thought about it. Is that why I fit in here? Will censorship kill Chinese filmmaking? China's 'free and daring' young women.

"This year's South by Southwest (SXSW) has a lot of focus on artificial intelligence (AI) When I think of having an assistant, I'm always drawn to that slightly Hollywood portrayal of a top chief executive, pouring himself a stiff drink, leaning back in his leather chair and pressing the intercom. ""Mary,"" he'll say. ""Please handle my calls. Only disturb me if it's urgent."" It's a bygone era, sure - and a gender stereotype, no doubt - but that dream of having an assistant, one that truly helps you out with daily tasks, is still prevalent. In fact, we're told it's the future of computing - with all the top companies firing up their research divisions to work on the concept. So far, it's Siri, Alexa, Google and Cortana leading the way. But none of those assistants actually assist you, do they? Not in a ""take this load off my mind"" kind of way, at least. This week I'm lucky enough to be at South by Southwest - SXSW - a three-part festival that deals with tech, music and film. Much of the focus this year will be on artificial intelligence - AI - and how it needs to evolve to become more useful and accepted. The sessions will look at how AI can be smart enough to help us achieve more and more. But really, all I want is for new tech to help me do less. Have you ever counted how many notifications you get on your smartphone on a typical day? I have. It's horrifying. More than 100 interruptions a day from Facebook likes, Instagram comments, tweet replies, news alerts, text messages, WhatsApp messages, Slack messagesâ¦ oh my. I can't get a word in edgeways round here, and it's all my fault. Or is it? I may have sleepwalked into this notification hell, but I was having my hand held throughout it all by the companies desperate for my attention. Every social network, large or small, is after for one thing: engagement. More users, more of the time. And notifications is their surefire way of dragging you back into their apps, time and time again. It's a lucrative strategy - part of Snapchat's popularity with investors right now is not because of how much money it's making (none) or how many users it has (not that many), but because of incredible statistics that show the average Snapchat user opens the app at least 10 times a day. Apps can end up sending dozens of notifications a day in an attempt to get users attention And it's no fluke. In the dark arts of nudging users to breaking point, Snapchat is the Grand High Witch. By default, not only does it tell you when you have a message, it also tells you when you're about to be sent one. ""Dave is typingâ¦"" it will beep - as if being up-to-date these days requires you to know about messages before they even exist. Naturally, you open the app; up goes their engagement, and down goes your concentration, your focus, your social etiquette. Snapchat isn't the only one, of course, and you can turn off notifications manually should you want. But it's at this point your sense of FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out - goes into overdrive. It's a deliberate, emotional tug pulled by app makers, and many push you into a choice between getting all notifications, or none. Of course one solution to this overwhelming feeling is what people like to refer to as a ""digital detox"" - a clumsy, cliched term most often pushed by PR companies trying to get clients on to morning radio shows or, worse, from journalists sorely lacking in ideas. I've always found the outcomes to be pointlessly predictable. You gave up Facebook for a week, you say? Big whoop. Have a sticker. But this week I read arefreshing view on this issue from Alex Wood,external. Alex's approach was not to go cold turkey, but instead to implement a few tweaks here and there to regulate use. I'd suggest reading his piece if you want to learn what software he used and other interesting tips. Snapchat is popular with investors because of how much users open the app By the time he concluded his piece, he'd managed to disconnect himself sufficiently to feel liberated - but not to the point of being cut off from his friends or profession. It's an issue also dealt with by another reporter, Kristen Brown, who last year held a panel at an event organised by Fusion, the tech news and culture site that has recently (sadly) been swallowed up into Gizmodo. One ofher suggestions,externalwas to hide all the apps on your smartphone into a big folder, so the only practical way to access the was to use the search function. This added step in theory made you focus on what you really needed to do - and put an end to that habit of just idly tapping from app to app. But what stood out - for both Kristen and Alex - was how difficult the process was. Given technology constantly provides us with smart user interfaces and automation, turning off notifications remains a frustrating manual task - an intentionally fiddly process of ducking through menus, and then, assuming you want them back at some point, going through those menus once again, hopefully remembering what exactly it was you turned off. If digital assistants go the way of notifications, we're in even more trouble. Notifications won't just be buzzing our pockets, but filling our air with noise. There is value in that, but after pondering the struggle Alex went through to temporarily silence his digital life, I feel a truly intelligent assistant would be more like Mary, the Hollywood chief exec's assistant. Why can't I tell Alexa that I want to focus right now, and it should instruct my social networks to chill out - notifications will stop, messages will be reduced. Dave Lee hopes to find a company to make his life easier at SXSW Today, asking Siri to ""handle my calls"" prompts it to bring up a call history. Perhaps instead it should be able to intercept my incoming calls, ask the caller if it's urgent, and only then disturb me if needed. The iPhone already has a Do Not Disturb function, but it's a bit of a blunt instrument when it comes to filtering out - or letting in - things that are truly worth your time. There are a smattering of apps that help you regulate your time on networks or websites. But it's too cumbersome, and only gets the job half done. Sadly, it's not in any tech firm's interests to lessen the amount of time you spend interacting with your technology - so progress in this area may be slow. But as I take on the corridors of SXSW this week, I'll be cheering on any company that wants to genuinely make my life easier. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,externaland on Facebook.

"Earlier this month, a relic from World War Two intruded into daily life in north London. A 500lb Luftwaffe bomb was discovered by builders excavating in the leafy suburb of Brondesbury. Local homes were evacuated, local train services were closed down.Eventually the weapon was made safeand finally removed to be detonated on an army range. This relic of a war that ended more than 70 years ago set me thinking. World War Two - just like the Great War that preceded it - was a total war. The fates of all the countries involved were in the balance. Ordinary soldiers were largely not professionals but were conscripted citizens. The whole of society - its energies and industrial might - were mobilised for the conflict. Once the war was over, many of its constraints inevitably lingered - the rationing of food, for example. War-ravaged cities also bore their scars. Army bomb disposal experts made the Brondesbury device safe As a child I remember the temporary homes - the rectangular ""prefabs"" or prefabricated houses - that dotted many of the bomb sites in east London near my grandparents' home. My childhood was dominated by films and documentaries about the war. I lose track of the number of plastic Spitfire model kits I must have built to battle with their Messerschmitt equivalents. Iraq and Afghanistan wars memorial unveiled Nato chief says alliance 'does not want new Cold War' But whatever the memories and cultural obsessions, the conflict was definitively over. There was, in short, a clear distinction between war and peace. Thankfully the so-called Cold War of the 1950s and 60s remained just that: in Europe, at least, it never went hot. War and peace were two separate states of affairs. Fast forward to today. This week, in London, a memorial was unveiled to the service personnel and civilians who lost their lives in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. On the government's own website it is described as the Iraq and Afghanistan Memorial. In the West, at least, the Cold War never became hot In the lengthy press release that follows there is no mention of the word ""war"", except to say that the new memorial stands close to monuments to World War Two and the Korean War. There is rightly, of course, mention of the lives lost and the medals won. There is, too, appreciation for those who ""put themselves in harm's way"" - an Americanism that has intruded itself into the public debate on armed conflict. But there you have it. These were undoubtedly armed conflicts far from our shores. But in what sense were they wars? Well of course they were, I hear you say, this is all semantic argument. Well, they were certainly wars for the Afghans and the Iraqis who were in some cases willing, and in many cases, unwilling participants in the struggles. They were certainly wars for those actually engaged in combat. From my very limited experience under fire, it matters little if it is a skirmish or a fully-fledged battle if it is you on the spot where the bullets are flying. The Queen unveiled the Iraq and Afghanistan memorial in London But were Britain, the United States or their many allies who have contributed troops to these conflicts really ""at war""? To what extent were their societies adapted or mobilised for the struggle? In some senses, very little. But in others, perhaps, more than we would like to admit. None of their economies was on a war footing and the fighting was done largely by regular professional troops or volunteer reservists. Boots on the ground were combined with the signature style of the modern Western military campaign: lashings of air power along with the use of sophisticated armed drones.
