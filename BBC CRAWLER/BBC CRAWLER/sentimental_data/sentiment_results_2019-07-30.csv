"Shana Grice was murdered by her ex-boyfriend who stalked her An ex-PC committed misconduct by failing to investigate a teenager's claims she was being harassed by a former boyfriend who later killed her. Trevor Godfrey told a disciplinary panel he believed Shana Grice's accusations against Michael Lane were a ""smokescreen"" to hide their affair. The 19-year-old reported Lane to Sussex Police five times in the months before she was murdered in Brighton in 2016. The panel found Mr Godfrey had not committed gross misconduct. The former officer, who retired in 2017, issued the teenager with a warning for wasting police time and decided to take no further action against Lane. He was told he would not have been sacked if he was still serving. Ms Grice's parents said the misconduct charge was ""a joke and the hearing a sham"". The panel found Mr Godfrey failed to adequately investigate allegations of harassment and stalking, and that he failed to treat Ms Grice as a victim, in a breach of police rules. Chairwoman Victoria Goodfellow said: ""While clearly serious matters, they are not enough to mean gross misconduct."" She added: ""We do not attribute any blame on Shana."" The hearing in Lewes had been told Miss Grice had initiallyfailed to disclose she and Lane had been in a relationship. But Sarah Green, of the Independent Office for Police Conduct, said Mr Godfrey had failed in his ""duties and responsibilities to Shana,"" adding: ""Those close to Shana have testified that his actions affected her confidence in the police and may have prevented her from reporting Lane's continued harassment."" A report commissioned after Miss Grice's death foundstalking and harassment offences were not being properly investigated by Sussex Police. The panel was told she had an affair with Lane while seeing someone else and Mr Godfrey said there had been no sign of harassment, despite her making accusations to the contrary. Michael Lane was convicted of murdering Ms Grice in 2017 The ex-officer said she had admitted that on one occasion, Lane was outside her house at the time of an alleged assault because she had arranged the meeting behind her then-boyfriend's back. He said: ""She would be signing her texts [to Lane] with five kisses. This is not harassment. It was a smokescreen to disguise her affair."" There was therefore ""no reason"" to supply Ms Grice with safety advice because ""there was nothing there to suggest she was in any form of danger whatsoever,"" he added. Mark Aldred, representing Mr Godfrey, said his client was right to consider Ms Grice's misleading statement when deciding to recommend no further action be taken against Lane after he allegedly grabbed her phone and pulled her hair. In a statement, Ms Grice's parents, Sharon Grice and Richard Green, said: ""We can barely believe what we have witnessed these past two days. The panel allowed a wholesale character assassination of our daughter, who is obviously not here to defend herself."" They said Mr Godfrey's testimony ""proved his discriminatory attitude, even accusing Shana of coercing Lane"". Lane, 27, was jailed for a minimum of 25 years in 2017 for murdering Ms Grice. Assistant Chief Constable Jon Savell apologised for the ""failures that have been highlighted in this and other misconduct hearings"" and said the force was learning lessons about how it deals with stalking, harassment and domestic abuse. Correction Wednesday 21 July 2019: An earlier version of this story stated Mr Godfrey would have been sacked due to his misconduct. This has been amended.

"El Shafee Elsheikh (left) and Alexanda Kotey were captured by Syrian Kurdish forces British investigators have enough evidence to prosecute two of the so-called Islamic State ""Beatles"" in the UK, the Supreme Court has been told. El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey are accused of belonging to an IS cell which is thought to have kidnapped and murdered Western hostages in Syria. They are currently being held in northern Syria. The US wants to use evidence amassed by British investigators to put both men on trial there. However, Washington is refusing to give the UK a standard assurance that neither man would be executed if convicted. Mr Elsheikh's mother, Maha Elgizouli, is trying to block the government from handing over the information - after it decided to help the US. It has emerged that she also wants to take the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to court for failing to put her son on trial in the UK. The pair, who are from London, are accused of being members of an IS cell - dubbed ""The Beatles"" because of their British accents - which also included Mohammed Emwazi, known as Jihadi John, who was killed in a US air strike in 2015, and Aine Davis, who has been jailed in Turkey. Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? Mother loses 'IS' evidence challenge Opening Mrs Elgizouli's challenge before seven of the UK's most senior judges, Edward Fitzgerald QC said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had held ""very substantial evidence"" since 2016 to charge Mr Kotey with five murders and eight counts of hostage-taking. The Director of Public Prosecutions had also acknowledged there may be sufficient evidence to charge Mr Elsheikh with membership of a banned terrorist organisation. No steps had been taken to launch prosecutions because of legal obstacles to asking Kurdish forces to hand over the men, both of whom have been stripped of British nationality. In contrast, Ben Wallace, the former security minister and now defence secretary, told MPs in July 2018 that the UK did not have evidence to try either of the men in the UK - and a US trial was the only solution. ""Mrs Elgizouli is solely concerned to protect her son from the death penalty,"" said Mr Fitzgerald. ""She recognises the enormity of the crimes alleged against her son, Shafee Elsheikh, and against his alleged accomplice, Alexanda Kotey. She recognises they should face justice. But she submits that they should face justice in this country, the country of their past citizenship."" The court heard that the US government asked the UK as early as 2015 to help build a case against Mr Elsheikh and Mr Kotey. Theresa May, when she was home secretary in 2015, told Washington the UK would only hand over evidence after receiving a categorical guarantee that neither man would be executed. The UK has long sought and obtained such a death penalty assurance from the United States. That position was reiterated by Mrs May's successor, Amber Rudd, but then reversed after Sajid Javid entered the Home Office in April 2018. Both Theresa May and Amber Rudd said the UK would only hand over evidence after receiving a categorical guarantee that neither man would be executed Sir Kim Darroch, the then British ambassador to Washington, warned him that US President Donald Trump would be wound up if the UK kept insisting on a death penalty assurance. ""They already feel that we are dumping on them a problem for which we should take responsibility,"" he wrote. Mr Javid subsequently offered to share with the Americans as many as 600 witness statements, without seeking any kind of guarantee that Mr Elsheikh and Mr Kotey would not be put to death. Mr Fitzgerald said the UK's policy of refusing to provide evidence that could lead to the death chamber was so clear to the world that it was part of the nation's common law. ""[Mrs Elgizouli] is asking no more than that the home secretary should apply the settled policy,"" he told the justices. ""Behind that policy lies a long and honourable tradition on the part of this country of rejecting the death penalty as morally wrong in all circumstances. ""We have maintained a firm policy of refusing extradition or deportation to countries that impose the death penalty, no matter how serious the offence and no matter how repellent the offender."" Mrs Elgizouli is appealing against a High Court ruling made in January by two leading judges, who concluded that Mr Javid's decision was not unlawful. Meanwhile, a senior US counter-terrorism official has told BBC Newsnight the UK should be repatriating British IS fighters and prosecuting them at home, arguing that its failure to do so is a""dereliction of responsibility"".

"An elderly woman has been taken to hospital after a suspected gas explosion in Shetland. A house in the village of Brae on Mainland was largely destroyed by the blast which happened at about 14:15. The Scottish Ambulance Service said it was called to a property at Ockragarth, a cul-de-sac in the village. A woman in her 80s was taken to Gilbert Bain Hospital in Lerwick. Her condition is not known. Her grandson was also in the house. Neighbours Phil Smith and his daughter Georgia heard the explosion. Ms Smith told BBC Scotland: ""We were sat in the back garden and heard this ginormous bang. My dad instantly thought 'gas'. ""I came running round and saw what was left of the house. The young chap was upstairs in his bedroom. He came rolling out, covered in everything."" He told her his grandmother was in the house. ""She was in the kitchen,"" she said. ""A couple of people were in there treating her. It looks like she took the brunt of it."" Mr Smith added: ""I couldn't believe what I saw. I didn't expect to see that.""

"This video can not be played ""We will look after the farming sector"" The prime minister has said it is ""up to the EU, this is their call"" if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Boris Johnson made his first visit to Wales as PM on Tuesday, seeking support from farmers for his Brexit plans. He held talks with Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford, who said there was a ""deeply concerning lack of detail"" from the new prime minister. Mr Johnson said: ""We're not aiming for a no-deal Brexit, we don't think that's where we'll end up."" ""This is very much up to our friends and partners across the channel,"" he added. A Welsh farmer called on Mr Johnson to stop ""playing Russian roulette"" with the lamb industry over the threat of a no-deal Brexit. It followed the Farmers' Union of Wales president warning of""civil unrest"" in rural areasif no agreement is struck. Earlier, the prime minister had his first phone call withIrish leader Leo Varadkarsince taking office. Boris Johnson wants renewal of 'ties that bind UK' No-deal Brexit: What you need to know What happens next? The visit to Wales came as the Conservatives fight to holdBrecon and Radnorshire in a by-electionon Thursday. Mr Johnson visited a chicken farm in St Brides Wentlooge, near Newport, before travelling to online retailer BVG Group in Brecon. He later attended a meeting in the Welsh Assembly with Mark Drakeford, where he was booed by a group of protesters on arrival. In a news conference afterwards, Mr Drakeford said they had an ""engaged discussion"" on Brexit. The Welsh Labour leader said he pressed Mr Johnson to explain the path to a deal with the EU but did not get a ""clear sense"" from him of what the plan would be. This video can not be played What is the food and farming sector worth to Wales? Here is a quick video guide. Mr Drakeford said he emphasised the ""catastrophic effect"" a no-deal Brexit would have on the Welsh economy, and said the PM provided assurances of support for manufacturing and agriculture in such a scenario. ""But asked to describe the nature of that support, I'm afraid that there is a deeply concerning lack of detail that is available to people whose livelihood is on the line,"" Mr Drakeford said. The first minister said the PM told him there would be many new opportunities for Welsh agriculture and businesses, but he had ""no sense again"" there was detailed thinking behind what ""otherwise becomes vacuous optimism"". Mr Drakeford said he warned Mr Johnson ""the future of the UK is more at risk today than at any other point in his political lifetime"", and said he had put ideas to him on how the Union could be ""reinvented"". A Downing Street spokeswoman said the two spoke about the importance of the union and support for farmers in Wales. She added: ""The PM set out how the UK will be leaving the EU on October 31st, come what may, and said he would seek to work with the Welsh Government and other devolved administrations, to make sure communities across the UK are ready to maximise on the opportunities that Brexit will bring."" Boris Johnson is seeking to reassure farmers about his Brexit plans Many Welsh farmers are heavily reliant on free trade with the EU. If the UK leaves without a deal many would face significant tariffs on their exports to EU countries. The prime minister did not give any television interviews to Welsh broadcasters on Tuesday. However, during the farm visit, he told reporters the agriculture sector will ""have the support they need"" in the event of no-deal. ""We will make sure that they have the support that they need, if there are markets that are going to be tricky that we help them to find new markets, we have interventions that aim to support them and their incomes,"" Mr Johnson said. ""The most important point is that we don't want tariffs and we don't envisage they will be necessary. ""And I think common sense would dictate it would be better and massively in the interests of our EU friends to have a zero-tariff, zero-quota regime of the kind we currently have."" Mr Johnson suggested funds for ""export refunds"" would be made available for the Welsh Government to administer. Asked how the system would work, given agriculture is devolved, he said: ""It will be up to the Welsh Government to administer it. We will make sure the funds are available."" A Welsh Government source said they were surprised by the nature of the announcement. Helen Roberts called on Boris Johnson to stop playing ""Russian roulette"" with the lamb industry The farming industry is worth more than Â£6bn to the Welsh economy and supports 14,000 businesses, 45,000 jobs and about 25,000 farmers. Welsh lamb will face at least 40% tariffs in a no-deal scenario, prompting a sheep farmer to call for Mr Johnson ""to stop playing Russian roulette with the industry as he appears to be doing at the moment"". ""If we do go out with a no deal, it will be absolutely catastrophic even if it is just for a few months,"" Helen Roberts, who is also development officer for the National Sheep Association in Wales, told Radio 4'sToday programme. She said her members would protest against a no-deal Brexit, adding: ""I think it's time to come and stand up for ourselves, and be counted."" On Monday, the prime minister said there was ""every chance"" a Brexit deal with the EU could be struck,but the existing agreement with the EU has ""got to go"". However senior minister Michael Gove, who has been put in charge of preparing for no deal, has saidthe UK government was working on the assumptionthe UK would leave the EU without an agreement. Boris Johnson was booed by protesters as he arrived at the National Assembly for Wales on Tuesday Ahead of his meeting with Mr Johnson, Mr Drakefordtweeted,externalBrexit ""will decimate our agricultural and manufacturing sectors and risks ripping the Union apart"". ""The PM must stop playing fast and loose with our country,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns suggested new global markets, including in Japan, will be available to sheep meat producers. Mr Cairns told the BBC: ""We are now looking to the growth that will come from right around the world, 90% of global growth will come from outside of the EU, ""But we don't want to close our back on the European market either and that's why working hard to get a deal is important, but of course there needs to be a shift in attitude and a positive response to the cause that we're making."" Reality check: Can farmers send lamb to Japan after Brexit? Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts pointed out via Twitter the Japanese market had been opened up to Welsh lamb by the EU-Japan trade deal. Mr Cairns added farmers ""can be guaranteed that the same money will be available to ensure that we are protecting this sector"". By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor Mark Drakeford told a press conference there was a ""deeply concerning lack of detail"" from Boris Johnson It is clear there was no meeting of minds between Mark Drakeford and Boris Johnson. As well as having ""fundamentally different views"" on Brexit, the two leaders are very different characters. The first minister is a details man - after Brexit he wants to know what support will be on offer to Welsh manufacturing and agriculture, when it'll be available and how long for. But the prime minister paints in bold colours, and he knows that despite concerns over the impact of a no-deal exit in Wales, voters here chose to leave the EU in 2016. This is the first of many meetings between the two leaders - whether they can find common ground remains to be seen.

"Apple posted a small gain in sales for the third quarter of the year. While iPhone sales dipped, the company made up the difference in higher revenues in services such as its software store and music service. Sales rose 1% to $53.8bn (Â£44.3bn), while net profit dropped 13% to $10bn. The company stemmed some of its drop in sales to China. The results beat Wall Street estimates and shares gained 3.5% to $216.10 in after-hours trading. For first time since 2012, iPhone sales represent less than half of company's overall sales. Sales of the device are down by $741m on this period last year. In China, sales fell 4% to $9.16bn, after a drop of 22% in the second quarter. Exchange rates have made the iPhone expensive for Chinese customers. Apple forecast sales of between $61bn and $64bn for the final three months of its financial year. You'll hear critics often say that Apple has failed too come up with anything interesting since the iPhone. And that Tim Cook, the man who took over from Steve jobs, is yet to come up with anything interesting at all. But that criticism is increasingly untrue, at least when it comes to Apple inventing new areas of business. This quarter underlines that: despite iPhone sales continuing to shrink, the firm's revenues are up, thanks to booming success with its Wearables, Home and Accessories category (so: Apple Watch, mostly, and AirPods) and continued growth of it Services (App Store, Apple Pay, Apple TV, Apple Music etc). The number of people paying Apple for some kind of subscription has risen by 55% in the past year to 420m. Apple expects that number to go up fairly dramatically over the next year thanks to the launch of its big-budget subscription TV service, Apple TV+. Even China brought somewhat good news for Apple this quarter. Sales were down 4% in the country, which the company is seeing as being much better as it could have been given the extreme turbulence created by the US-China trade war. If you remove the iPhone from the China figures, Apple's revenues there grew by 17%. That suggests a slowing upgrade cycle, but users still keen to use the iPhones they have and access Apple services. In short, Apple is in good health. The iPhone is a product in decline, and as a result, the company's profits have taken a hit. Investors understand that this is a firm in a transition, and so far it is going well.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump, who is teetotal, explained his preference for US wine over French last week The French agriculture minister has called US President Donald Trump's threat to tax French wine ""completely moronic"" and ""absurd"". Mr Trump made the threat last weekin response to French plans to tax multinational firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon. He also stated that the US makes better wine than the French. In a rant on French TV, Didier Guillaume called Mr Trump's rationale ""completely stupid"". ""It's absurd, in terms of having a political and economic debate, to say that if you tax the 'GAFAs', I'll tax wine. It's completely moronic,"" Mr Guillaume told BFM TV, in reference to Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple. ""This is the third time the US president has threatened a tax, the third time in a year. We'll see if he goes through with it,"" he said. ""American wine is not better than French wine,"" he added. The French tech tax upsetting the US Facebook quizzed in court on EU-US data transfers Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained Mr Trump last week accused French President Emmanuel Macron of ""foolishness"" after France became the first major economy to impose a tax on the companies. French authorities argue that the firms pay little or no corporate tax in countries where they are not based, but Mr Trump has said the tax unfairly targets US tech giants. ""France just put a digital tax on our great American technology companies. If anybody taxes them, it should be their home Country, the US,"" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter. ""We will announce a substantial reciprocal action on Macron's foolishness shortly. I've always said American wine is better than French wine!""

"Apple's iMessage service allows users to send texts, photos and videos to each other A team of bug-hunters at Google have shared details of five flaws in Apple's iMessage software that could make its devices vulnerable to attack. In one case, the researchers said the vulnerability was so severe that the only way to rescue a targeted iPhonewould be to delete all the data off it,external. Another example, they said, could be used to copy files off a device without requiring the ownerto do anything to aid the hack,external. Apple released fixes last week.

"This video can not be played Captain: I don't know why so much force was used The captain of a tanker seized while carrying Iranian oil has said Royal Marines used ""brute force"" in detaining his ship. Earlier this month, UK forces helped authorities in Gibraltar who believed the tanker was carrying oil to a Syrian refinery in breach of EU sanctions. The captain said marines made his unarmed crew kneel on the deck at gunpoint. The MoD said the seizure complied with ""international rules and norms"". On 4 July, about 30 marines from 42 Commando were flown from the UK to Gibraltar to help detain the tanker and its cargo, at the request of the Gibraltar government. Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained What's so important about a ship's flag? UK sends second warship to Gulf The vessel's captain, an Indian national who asked not to be named, said he was radioed a police request to board his ship and lowered his ladder. But before anyone could board, a military helicopter landed on the ship in a ""very dangerous"" move, he said. Royal Marines landed in their helicopter on Grace 1 He told the BBC he identified himself as the captain but the marines ignored him and instead pointed their guns and shouted ""look forward, look forward"". He said: ""They didn't care whether I was masterâ¦ there was no regulationsâ¦ we had 28 unarmed crew. I was in a state of shock, everybody was in a state of shock. ""How do you come on a ship like this with armed forces and such brute force. For what reason?"" He said the marines could have boarded the ship and simply told him he had been arrested. The captain agreed to speak to the BBC on condition his name was not used, saying he and his crew had been advised by Indian High Commission officials to remain anonymous while legal proceedings were ongoing. Asked whether he felt there was anything illegitimate about his ship or the cargo, he said he had ""followed company procedures"", adding he did not know about the EU sanctions against Syria. The captain has since been arrested and bailed by authorities in Gibraltar. The MoD said the operation on Grace 1 was a ""standard boarding"" and that British armed forces were ""held to the highest standards of professionalism"". Royal Gibraltar Police said the marines had acted in support of its officers and applied ""the minimum use of force"" to ensure officers could get on board, deal with the crew and take control of the vessel. It added that the ship's four senior officers had been interviewed under caution. The Gibraltar government said it had evidence which contradicted statements made by the captain and would release its own statement soon. It said it had reason to believe the ship was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in Syria, which theEU says,externalprovides financial support to the Syrian government. The refinery has been subject to EU sanctions since 2014. Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? Iran-UK radio exchanges as ship seized Is this the world's most important waterway? The seizure of the tanker sparked a diplomatic crisis between the UK and Iran, which has escalated over the past four weeks. On 19 July, British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero was seized by Iran's Revolutionary Guard in the key shipping route, the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran said the vessel was ""violating international maritime rules"" but the UK called the incident an example of ""state piracy"". Both British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Iran's ambassador to the UK have ruled out an exchange of the two seized ships. Mr Raab said: ""This is not about some kind of barter. This is about international law and the rules of the international legal system being upheld."" Iranian diplomat Hamid Baedinejad tweeted it was ""impossible to advance a quid pro quo or barter exchange"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Shana Grice was murdered by her ex-boyfriend who stalked her An ex-PC committed misconduct by failing to investigate a teenager's claims she was being harassed by a former boyfriend who later killed her. Trevor Godfrey told a disciplinary panel he believed Shana Grice's accusations against Michael Lane were a ""smokescreen"" to hide their affair. The 19-year-old reported Lane to Sussex Police five times in the months before she was murdered in Brighton in 2016. The panel found Mr Godfrey had not committed gross misconduct. The former officer, who retired in 2017, issued the teenager with a warning for wasting police time and decided to take no further action against Lane. He was told he would not have been sacked if he was still serving. Ms Grice's parents said the misconduct charge was ""a joke and the hearing a sham"". The panel found Mr Godfrey failed to adequately investigate allegations of harassment and stalking, and that he failed to treat Ms Grice as a victim, in a breach of police rules. Chairwoman Victoria Goodfellow said: ""While clearly serious matters, they are not enough to mean gross misconduct."" She added: ""We do not attribute any blame on Shana."" The hearing in Lewes had been told Miss Grice had initiallyfailed to disclose she and Lane had been in a relationship. But Sarah Green, of the Independent Office for Police Conduct, said Mr Godfrey had failed in his ""duties and responsibilities to Shana,"" adding: ""Those close to Shana have testified that his actions affected her confidence in the police and may have prevented her from reporting Lane's continued harassment."" A report commissioned after Miss Grice's death foundstalking and harassment offences were not being properly investigated by Sussex Police. The panel was told she had an affair with Lane while seeing someone else and Mr Godfrey said there had been no sign of harassment, despite her making accusations to the contrary. Michael Lane was convicted of murdering Ms Grice in 2017 The ex-officer said she had admitted that on one occasion, Lane was outside her house at the time of an alleged assault because she had arranged the meeting behind her then-boyfriend's back. He said: ""She would be signing her texts [to Lane] with five kisses. This is not harassment. It was a smokescreen to disguise her affair."" There was therefore ""no reason"" to supply Ms Grice with safety advice because ""there was nothing there to suggest she was in any form of danger whatsoever,"" he added. Mark Aldred, representing Mr Godfrey, said his client was right to consider Ms Grice's misleading statement when deciding to recommend no further action be taken against Lane after he allegedly grabbed her phone and pulled her hair. In a statement, Ms Grice's parents, Sharon Grice and Richard Green, said: ""We can barely believe what we have witnessed these past two days. The panel allowed a wholesale character assassination of our daughter, who is obviously not here to defend herself."" They said Mr Godfrey's testimony ""proved his discriminatory attitude, even accusing Shana of coercing Lane"". Lane, 27, was jailed for a minimum of 25 years in 2017 for murdering Ms Grice. Assistant Chief Constable Jon Savell apologised for the ""failures that have been highlighted in this and other misconduct hearings"" and said the force was learning lessons about how it deals with stalking, harassment and domestic abuse. Correction Wednesday 21 July 2019: An earlier version of this story stated Mr Godfrey would have been sacked due to his misconduct. This has been amended.

"Greggs is to launch a pilot of extended opening hours in a selection of its shops across the UK. Some branches already stay open late, with one in Westminster closing at 23:00 and another in Newcastle opening until 20:30 or 21:00. The bakery chain's announcement came as it reported a strong rise in sales and profits, partly due to the popularity of its new vegan sausage roll. Profits in the first half of the year jumped to Â£36.7m from Â£24.1m. Total sales rose 15% to Â£546m, while like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of store openings and closures - in company-managed shops were up 10.5%. Greggs said its new vegan sausage roll had proved extremely popular and was already one of its top sellers. Traditional bakery favourites have continued to sell well, alongside a growth in Fairtrade coffee, breakfast and new hot food options. The firm has also trialled click and collect services and delivery. Chief executiveRoger Whiteside told the Today Programme:""We've converted ourselves from a traditional bakery business to a modern food-on-the-go brand with new shops, extended seating, extended trading hours, wi-fi, better products, better value and we're more in touch with where the customers are today."" The company has been opening about 100 new shops a year and hopes to open store number 2,000 in the next few weeks. It is aiming for 2,500 shops, but new ones are more likely to be in transport hubs and office parks, rather than High Streets. Dale Farm wins Greggs cheese contracts Greggs vegan sausage roll boosts sales Greggs: How its vegan sausage roll stormed social media A total of 38% of its shops now serve catchment areas away from traditional shopping locations and the aim is to increase this figure to more than 50% in the long term. In its results statement,,externalMr Whiteside also said that the chain was preparing for Brexit given ""the potential impact that a disorderly exit might have on supply chains, tariffs, exchange rates and consumer demand"".

""Merchant ships must be free to travel lawfully and trade safely, anywhere in the world."" Mr Wallace added the Royal Navy will continue to provide a safeguard for UK vessels ""until this is the reality"". HMS Duncan is a Type 45 Destroyer which the Royal Navy describes as ""among the most advanced warships ever built"". Earlier this month, British Royal Marineshelped seize Iranian tanker Grace 1near Gibraltar which was suspected of breaking EU sanctions, infuriating Iran. In response,Tehran threatened to capturea British oil tanker. On 19 July,British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero was seizedby Iran's Revolutionary Guard in the key shipping route. A second British-linked tanker, the MV Mesdar, was also boarded by armed guards but was released. Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained Are we heading for a new tanker war? Iran-UK radio exchanges as ship seized Tehran said the Stena Impero was ""violating international maritime rules"". HMS Montrose was alerted but it was too far away to stop the seizure. Iran's state-run IRNA news agency said the tanker was captured after it collided with a fishing boat and failed to respond to calls from the smaller craft. But the then foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was seized in Omani waters in ""clear contravention of international law"" and then forced to sail into Iran. Thetanker's Swedish owners, Stena Bulk,external, said it had been complying with regulations and had been in international waters. Stena Bulk said the 23 crew members, who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino, are in good health and have met with officials from their respective countries. The then foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt called the seizure of the Stena Impero ""state piracy"". But he insisted: ""Our priority continues to be to find a way to de-escalate the situation."" Speaking to the BBC, former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith described the UK-flagged ship's capture as a ""major failure"" by the UK. The then defence minister Tobias Ellwood told Sky News ""it is impossible simply to escort each individual vessel"".

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has indicated the Stena Imepero could be released if the UK returns the Grace 1.

"Sheikha Latifa photographed alongside Mary Robinson, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Photographs have been released of an Arab princess who was feared missing. Sheikha Latifa, the daughter of Dubai's ruler, reportedly tried to escape abroad in March. Witnesses said she was allegedly taken from a yacht near India and forcibly returned. The United Arab Emirates has denied the reports, and says she has been living at home with her family. The incident caused concern among international human rights groups, who asked authorities to prove her safety. On Monday, the UAE's foreign ministry said it had sent a communiquÃ© regarding Sheikha Latifa to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights' Office of Special Procedures. In a statement, it said the message ""responds to and rebuts false allegations"" about the princess. The images it released show Sheikha Latifa alongside Mary Robinson, the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and former president of Ireland, and were purportedly taken on 15 December in Dubai. ""Photographs taken during the afternoon they spent together have been shared, with their consent,"" the UAE's statement said. ""During her visit to Dubai, Mary Robinson was reassured that HH Sheikha Latifa is receiving the necessary care and support she requires."" United Arab Emirates profile Call for clarity on status of Sheikha Latifa The United Nations has not yet responded to the statement. This video can not be played What happened to Dubai's Sheikha Latifa? Sheikha Latifa - the daughter of Dubai's ruler - is said to have tried to flee in an attempt to live a freer life abroad. The 33-year-old was reportedly helped in her attempt to escape by Herve Jaubert, a former French spy. His yacht she was travelling on, the Nostromo, was then reportedly intercepted less than 80 km (50 miles) from the Indian coast. Mr Jaubert alleges the princess was then then taken onto a helicopter and forcibly returned, despite professing her will to seek asylum abroad. After she allegedly went missing, a video was released showing her discussing a planned effort to escape. ""If you're watching this video, it's not such a good thing. Either I'm dead or I'm in a very very very bad situation,"" she said near the beginning of the 40-minute clip. In the video, she alleges she and her family ""did not have freedom of choice"" in their lives, and discussed an earlier effort to leave the country aged 16. She alleges she was imprisoned for three years and tortured repeatedly on her return. Earlier this month, the UAE's government released its first statement about her apparent disappearance in which it said it was ""deeply saddened by the continued media speculation"" about Sheikha Latifa. In it, they said she was ""adored and cherished"" by her family, who were looking forward to celebrating her birthday with her.

"Jeremy Corbyn has been speaking to anti-fracking protesters outside Preston New Road fracking site Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has joined anti-fracking protesters to call for an immediate ban on the practice. He said fracking was ""dangerous"" to the environment as he met protesters at the UK's only active shale gas extraction site in Preston New Road, Lancashire. Labour said the UK risks missing net-zero carbon targets by 2050 if it continues to exploit gas reserves. The government said shale gas extracted from fracking has the potential to be ""a new domestic energy source"". Mr Corbyn spoke to about 100 anti-fracking protesters outside the Preston New Road fracking site, which has been the focus of long-running protests by environmental groups. He said Labour would ban fracking and instead focus on creating a ""green industrial revolution"", which would includeinvestment in tidal power. ""We need urgent action to tackle the climate emergency, and that means the Prime Minister immediately banning fracking once and for all,"" he said. Phil McCann, BBC North West political reporter The torrential downpours didn't deter the campaigners who've been holding protests here for five years. Nor did they deter Mr Corbyn from staking out a key difference between Labour and the Conservatives. Mr Corbyn's message was music to their ears, but it's not the first time he has promised to ban fracking. His words perhaps now have more currency, coming after the government pledged to cut the UK's emissions by 80% to fight climate change, a pledge that Labour says can't be kept if fracking is permitted across the country. Their figures are questioned by the industry and the government - both of whom point to the independent Committee on Climate Change which forecasts the UK will still use 70% of the gas it currently uses by the year 2050. The question they ask Labour: if we don't want to continue to rely on foreign gas and we don't want to extract our own from the ground, where will it all come from? Jeremy Corbyn has been speaking to anti-fracking protesters outside Preston New Road fracking site Cuadrilla, which operates Preston New Road, said it had invited Mr Corbyn ""to chat to our local workforce as well as [protesters] at the gates"" and have a tour of the site. It said later in a tweet that the Labour leader ""left without taking up our offer of an on-site brew with some local people"". The firm's chief executive Francis Egan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier it was ""astonishing... the Labour Party is saying we should be offshoring our jobs"". Energy firm plans to resume fracking What is fracking? Fracking halted after earthquake The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""Independent climate experts have recognised natural gas has a role to play as we meet our 2050 net zero emissions target - now firmly set in law. ""Exploring the potential of a new domestic energy source is not only compatible with these world-leading climate goals, it could also deliver substantial economic benefits, through the creation of well paid, high-quality jobs."" Fracking at the Preston New Road site is expected to resume next month The Preston New Road site began fracking in October butoperations were haltedon a number of occasions due to underground tremors. Cuadrilla said it expects to resume fracking by the end of August. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique to extract gas and oil from the earth Liquid is pumped underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil within The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says shale gas ""has the potential to be a new domestic energy source"" Governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have said they will oppose fracking until further research is completed into its environmental impact Corbyn backs Â£3.5bn Mersey tidal power project Energy firm plans to resume fracking Fracking tsar resigns over 'ridiculous' rules No appeal against fracking refusal Fracking halted after earthquake Cuadrilla aims to raise fracking threshold 'First' shale gas flow at fracking site What is fracking and why is it controversial?

"Of patients admitted to hospital, 10% are alcohol dependent Massive cuts to alcohol rehab services mean a ""national epidemic"" of alcohol-related problems is not being tackled, King's College London researchers say. And people with drink problems in England are less than half as likely to receive the right help as those in Scotland and Wales. More than Â£100m has been cut since services in England were reorganised in 2012, the study found. Councils in England say central government grant cuts are to blame. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, found that, on average, drug and alcohol services in England had lost approximately 30% of their budgets since 2013-14, when they were handed over to local authority control. In Scotland and Wales, where there has been investment in alcohol treatment services, people with alcohol dependency are 2.5 times more likely to have access to specialist treatment than those in England, where hospital admissions for alcohol-related conditions have risen 17% in the past decade. Council axes drink and drugs rehab Cuts to drug and alcohol service linked to 26% rise in deaths This video can not be played ""I used to drink a litre of vodka a day"" For Catherine Maxwell, from Liverpool, it is the little things that count - like just waking up in the morning and not having a hangover. The first couple of months without a drink ""were awful"", she says. ""I didn't feel physically that bad, but it was the emotional side of not knowing if I felt depressed I could just drink myself into oblivion."" But with the support she received from the alcohol care team at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, she discovered the advantages of not drinking. ""Just going for a walk around the park and looking at the flowers. I know that sounds corny, but just seeing things that are beautiful and noticing them and appreciating it,"" she says. Last Christmas was her first without a drink. She remembers Christmases in the past when she ""just couldn't wait to get home to carry on the drinking"". ""I just look back at the way my life was and the way it is now and I compare the two and I'd just say it's so much better now,"" she says. Nurse consultant Lynn Owens with Catherine Maxwell ""I haven't enjoyed life in this way for decades - you know, if I think about it, because I was always slightly not quite alive."" Last year, the alcohol care team at Royal Liverpool University Hospital - one of the first to be established in England, over a decade ago - saw more than 2,500 people in their clinics. The team are alerted by colleagues in the accident and emergency department if they suspect a patient's underlying problem is alcohol related. ""What we do is take an opportunity to explain to patients why alcohol might have contributed to or caused their admission,"" nurse consultant Lynn Owens told BBC News. The team can then prescribe the person some anti-craving medication, to help them overcome the initial withdrawal symptoms, and can then work with them over the course of the following months to help them stay sober. ""Treatment for alcohol-related problems in this country is poor,"" she says. ""The more respect you show a patient, and the more dignity you afford them, the more likely you are to increase their motivation to change."" Catherine's liver scan shows her body is recovering from decades of alcohol abuse Further analysis by King's College revealed the inpatient detox support had been cut by 54% since 2011-12, while specialist community support had been reduced by 22% since 2013-14. ""The services that are being cut have a strong evidence base of effectiveness and cost effectiveness,"" says Colin Drummond, professor of addiction services at King's. ""For every Â£1 you spend on treatment, you save over Â£3 in NHS and social care costs, so cutting these services is a false economy."" In separate research published earlier this month, the same team found alcohol-related conditions in NHS hospitals were approximately 20-30 times higher than official government statistics suggested. NHS England announced earlier this year that as part of its 10-year plan for the NHS, it wanted to create alcohol care teams (ACTs) in the 25% of hospitals with the highest rates of alcohol-related admissions - but Prof Drummond says that is not nearly ambitious enough ""in tackling what is evidently a national epidemic"". ""Given the prevalence of these conditions within NHS hospitals across England, as a first step an ACT in every hospital would appear warranted, not merely the top 25%."" Prof Drummond told BBC News: ""While it's great that the government is to invest more in alcohol care teams in acute hospitals, which is really needed, there is not much point in having a Rolls-Royce hospital-based service when you have a Reliant Robin with a flat tyre waiting in the community to pick you up."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, called on the new prime minister to use the upcoming spending review to reverse cuts to local authority budgets. In particular, the LGA says, public health grants, which, among other things, fund community drug and alcohol services, have been reduced by Â£700m in real terms since 2015-16. Ian Hudspeth, who chairs LGA's community wellbeing board, said: ""Councils are committed to ensuring that those people affected by alcohol and drug problems get the right support and treatment. So, providing well-funded, targeted and effective substance misuse services is vital. ""However, cuts to councils' public health grant by central government have consequences. ""Leaving councils to pick up the bill for treating new and increasing numbers of users while having fewer resources cannot be an option. ""It is therefore essential that the new prime minister uses the upcoming spending review to reverse these reductions to the public health grant and provides councils with the money needed to invest in cost-effective prevention and recovery work.""

"This video can not be played Earlier this year, the BBC was given exclusive access to Afghan ambulance workers Afghan and US forces have killed more civilians in Afghanistan in the first half of 2019 than insurgents did, UN figures show. The unprecedented figures for January to June come amid a ferocious US air campaign against the Taliban. Some 717 civilians were killed by Afghan and US forces, compared to 531 by militants, the UN said. The latest data has been revealed as Washington and the Taliban continue negotiations over US troop withdrawals. Air strikes, mostly carried out by American warplanes, killed 363 people, including 89 children, in the first six months of the year,according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama).,external The US military has rejected Unama's findings, saying its own collection of evidence was more accurate and that its forces in Afghanistan ""always work to avoid harm to civilian non-combatants"". But it did not give its own figures for civilian casualties. Who are the Taliban? What could peace in Afghanistan look like? The Afghan women determined not to lose out in Taliban talks It comes after a report by the UN in April, which reached a similar conclusion for the first three months of 2019. The latest data shows that this unprecedented trend is continuing. Ground engagements remained the leading cause of civilian casualties overall, accounting for one-third of the total, followed by improvised explosive bombings and aerial operations. However the UN says that total civilian casualties are down. There were 3,812 deaths and injuries in the first six months of 2019, the lowest total for the first half of a year since 2012. Despite the decrease in casualties, the toll on civilians remains ""shocking and unacceptable,"" Unama said. It documented 985 civilian casualties (deaths and injuries) from insurgent attacks that had deliberately targeted civilians from 1 January to 30 June. ""Parties to the conflict may give differing explanations for recent trends, each designed to justify their own military tactics,"" said Richard Bennett, Unama's head of human rights. ""The fact remains that only a determined effort to avoid civilian harm, not just by abiding by international humanitarian law but also by reducing the intensity of the fighting, will decrease the suffering of civilian Afghans,"" he added. Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said civilians were paying a ""terrible price"" as a result of air strikes and night raids that appeared meant to pressure the Taliban in negotiations. The number of civilians killed by air strikes more than doubled in the same period in 2018 ""Although US military officers in Kabul repeatedly claim to take civilian casualties seriously, they do not conduct adequate investigations to determine accurate numbers or understand targeting errors,"" she told the BBC, adding that Afghan government investigations were ""even worse"". ""The usual claim - that the Taliban hide among civilians - is not an excuse for killing and injuring civilians in such numbers, and in any case is no excuse for what in some cases may amount to war crimes."" The Afghan government said in a statement that protecting civilians and providing aid to the injured and displaced was a priority. Fighting continues with daily violence around the country. The US and the Taliban have been holding peace talks in the Gulf state of Qatar, but the American military is simultaneously carrying out an intense air campaign against the militant group. The Taliban, who were driven from power by US forces in 2001, are refusing to formally negotiate with the Afghan government until a timetable for the US  withdrawal is agreed upon. Can Taliban and Afghan leaders share peace? Why Afghanistan is so dangerous Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan On Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo revealed that President Donald Trump wants forces in Afghanistan reduced by the 2020 US presidential election. The existence of an unofficial deadline has deepened fears in Kabul that Washington may rush into a deal with the Taliban in a bid to win over US voters, and ignore any concerns from its Afghan government partners.

"This video can not be played ""We will look after the farming sector"" The prime minister has said it is ""up to the EU, this is their call"" if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Boris Johnson made his first visit to Wales as PM on Tuesday, seeking support from farmers for his Brexit plans. He held talks with Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford, who said there was a ""deeply concerning lack of detail"" from the new prime minister. Mr Johnson said: ""We're not aiming for a no-deal Brexit, we don't think that's where we'll end up."" ""This is very much up to our friends and partners across the channel,"" he added. A Welsh farmer called on Mr Johnson to stop ""playing Russian roulette"" with the lamb industry over the threat of a no-deal Brexit. It followed the Farmers' Union of Wales president warning of""civil unrest"" in rural areasif no agreement is struck. Earlier, the prime minister had his first phone call withIrish leader Leo Varadkarsince taking office. Boris Johnson wants renewal of 'ties that bind UK' No-deal Brexit: What you need to know What happens next? The visit to Wales came as the Conservatives fight to holdBrecon and Radnorshire in a by-electionon Thursday. Mr Johnson visited a chicken farm in St Brides Wentlooge, near Newport, before travelling to online retailer BVG Group in Brecon. He later attended a meeting in the Welsh Assembly with Mark Drakeford, where he was booed by a group of protesters on arrival. In a news conference afterwards, Mr Drakeford said they had an ""engaged discussion"" on Brexit. The Welsh Labour leader said he pressed Mr Johnson to explain the path to a deal with the EU but did not get a ""clear sense"" from him of what the plan would be. This video can not be played What is the food and farming sector worth to Wales? Here is a quick video guide. Mr Drakeford said he emphasised the ""catastrophic effect"" a no-deal Brexit would have on the Welsh economy, and said the PM provided assurances of support for manufacturing and agriculture in such a scenario. ""But asked to describe the nature of that support, I'm afraid that there is a deeply concerning lack of detail that is available to people whose livelihood is on the line,"" Mr Drakeford said. The first minister said the PM told him there would be many new opportunities for Welsh agriculture and businesses, but he had ""no sense again"" there was detailed thinking behind what ""otherwise becomes vacuous optimism"". Mr Drakeford said he warned Mr Johnson ""the future of the UK is more at risk today than at any other point in his political lifetime"", and said he had put ideas to him on how the Union could be ""reinvented"". A Downing Street spokeswoman said the two spoke about the importance of the union and support for farmers in Wales. She added: ""The PM set out how the UK will be leaving the EU on October 31st, come what may, and said he would seek to work with the Welsh Government and other devolved administrations, to make sure communities across the UK are ready to maximise on the opportunities that Brexit will bring."" Boris Johnson is seeking to reassure farmers about his Brexit plans Many Welsh farmers are heavily reliant on free trade with the EU. If the UK leaves without a deal many would face significant tariffs on their exports to EU countries. The prime minister did not give any television interviews to Welsh broadcasters on Tuesday. However, during the farm visit, he told reporters the agriculture sector will ""have the support they need"" in the event of no-deal. ""We will make sure that they have the support that they need, if there are markets that are going to be tricky that we help them to find new markets, we have interventions that aim to support them and their incomes,"" Mr Johnson said. ""The most important point is that we don't want tariffs and we don't envisage they will be necessary. ""And I think common sense would dictate it would be better and massively in the interests of our EU friends to have a zero-tariff, zero-quota regime of the kind we currently have."" Mr Johnson suggested funds for ""export refunds"" would be made available for the Welsh Government to administer. Asked how the system would work, given agriculture is devolved, he said: ""It will be up to the Welsh Government to administer it. We will make sure the funds are available."" A Welsh Government source said they were surprised by the nature of the announcement. Helen Roberts called on Boris Johnson to stop playing ""Russian roulette"" with the lamb industry The farming industry is worth more than Â£6bn to the Welsh economy and supports 14,000 businesses, 45,000 jobs and about 25,000 farmers. Welsh lamb will face at least 40% tariffs in a no-deal scenario, prompting a sheep farmer to call for Mr Johnson ""to stop playing Russian roulette with the industry as he appears to be doing at the moment"". ""If we do go out with a no deal, it will be absolutely catastrophic even if it is just for a few months,"" Helen Roberts, who is also development officer for the National Sheep Association in Wales, told Radio 4'sToday programme. She said her members would protest against a no-deal Brexit, adding: ""I think it's time to come and stand up for ourselves, and be counted."" On Monday, the prime minister said there was ""every chance"" a Brexit deal with the EU could be struck,but the existing agreement with the EU has ""got to go"". However senior minister Michael Gove, who has been put in charge of preparing for no deal, has saidthe UK government was working on the assumptionthe UK would leave the EU without an agreement. Boris Johnson was booed by protesters as he arrived at the National Assembly for Wales on Tuesday Ahead of his meeting with Mr Johnson, Mr Drakefordtweeted,externalBrexit ""will decimate our agricultural and manufacturing sectors and risks ripping the Union apart"". ""The PM must stop playing fast and loose with our country,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns suggested new global markets, including in Japan, will be available to sheep meat producers. Mr Cairns told the BBC: ""We are now looking to the growth that will come from right around the world, 90% of global growth will come from outside of the EU, ""But we don't want to close our back on the European market either and that's why working hard to get a deal is important, but of course there needs to be a shift in attitude and a positive response to the cause that we're making."" Reality check: Can farmers send lamb to Japan after Brexit? Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts pointed out via Twitter the Japanese market had been opened up to Welsh lamb by the EU-Japan trade deal. Mr Cairns added farmers ""can be guaranteed that the same money will be available to ensure that we are protecting this sector"". By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor Mark Drakeford told a press conference there was a ""deeply concerning lack of detail"" from Boris Johnson It is clear there was no meeting of minds between Mark Drakeford and Boris Johnson. As well as having ""fundamentally different views"" on Brexit, the two leaders are very different characters. The first minister is a details man - after Brexit he wants to know what support will be on offer to Welsh manufacturing and agriculture, when it'll be available and how long for. But the prime minister paints in bold colours, and he knows that despite concerns over the impact of a no-deal exit in Wales, voters here chose to leave the EU in 2016. This is the first of many meetings between the two leaders - whether they can find common ground remains to be seen.

"This video can not be played Who is ASAP Rocky and why is he on Trump's radar? ASAP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to assault in Stockholm. The US rapper, real name Rakim Mayers, is on trial accused of assaulting a 19-year-old Afghan refugee in the Swedish capital a month ago. Two members of the 30-year-old's entourage are also on trial and have pleaded not guilty. ASAP Rocky and the two other suspects, who've been held in prison after a fight that took place on 30 June, claim they were acting in self-defence. The trial - which is in its first day - was delayed starting due to the massive media and fan interest in the case. There were issues getting in and out of the court and some fans had to be turned away from the public gallery as it quickly filled up. The prosecution are going through a detailed 522-page preliminary report, which contains extensive photographs of injuries the alleged victim suffered. The alleged victim, who is not being named by media, has claimed damages of roughly Â£12,000 (139,700 Swedish Krona). They allege that ASAP Rocky used a weapon - claiming the injuries are consistent with the use of a bottle or a similar blunt object. Injuries on the alleged victim's body - which prosecutors claim are consistent with use of a bottle A lawyer for one of the rapper's co-defendants claims he has completely new evidence that he believes will ensure the trio are found not guilty of assault - but would not yet reveal what type of evidence it is. It's expected that evidence will be shown to the court on Thursday. Maddy Savage, BBC News Sat in the front row, ASAP Rocky has appeared really engaged throughout the hearing.

"Of patients admitted to hospital, 10% are alcohol dependent Massive cuts to alcohol rehab services mean a ""national epidemic"" of alcohol-related problems is not being tackled, King's College London researchers say. And people with drink problems in England are less than half as likely to receive the right help as those in Scotland and Wales. More than Â£100m has been cut since services in England were reorganised in 2012, the study found. Councils in England say central government grant cuts are to blame. The study, published in the British Medical Journal, found that, on average, drug and alcohol services in England had lost approximately 30% of their budgets since 2013-14, when they were handed over to local authority control. In Scotland and Wales, where there has been investment in alcohol treatment services, people with alcohol dependency are 2.5 times more likely to have access to specialist treatment than those in England, where hospital admissions for alcohol-related conditions have risen 17% in the past decade. Council axes drink and drugs rehab Cuts to drug and alcohol service linked to 26% rise in deaths This video can not be played ""I used to drink a litre of vodka a day"" For Catherine Maxwell, from Liverpool, it is the little things that count - like just waking up in the morning and not having a hangover. The first couple of months without a drink ""were awful"", she says. ""I didn't feel physically that bad, but it was the emotional side of not knowing if I felt depressed I could just drink myself into oblivion."" But with the support she received from the alcohol care team at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, she discovered the advantages of not drinking. ""Just going for a walk around the park and looking at the flowers. I know that sounds corny, but just seeing things that are beautiful and noticing them and appreciating it,"" she says. Last Christmas was her first without a drink. She remembers Christmases in the past when she ""just couldn't wait to get home to carry on the drinking"". ""I just look back at the way my life was and the way it is now and I compare the two and I'd just say it's so much better now,"" she says. Nurse consultant Lynn Owens with Catherine Maxwell ""I haven't enjoyed life in this way for decades - you know, if I think about it, because I was always slightly not quite alive."" Last year, the alcohol care team at Royal Liverpool University Hospital - one of the first to be established in England, over a decade ago - saw more than 2,500 people in their clinics. The team are alerted by colleagues in the accident and emergency department if they suspect a patient's underlying problem is alcohol related. ""What we do is take an opportunity to explain to patients why alcohol might have contributed to or caused their admission,"" nurse consultant Lynn Owens told BBC News. The team can then prescribe the person some anti-craving medication, to help them overcome the initial withdrawal symptoms, and can then work with them over the course of the following months to help them stay sober. ""Treatment for alcohol-related problems in this country is poor,"" she says. ""The more respect you show a patient, and the more dignity you afford them, the more likely you are to increase their motivation to change."" Catherine's liver scan shows her body is recovering from decades of alcohol abuse Further analysis by King's College revealed the inpatient detox support had been cut by 54% since 2011-12, while specialist community support had been reduced by 22% since 2013-14. ""The services that are being cut have a strong evidence base of effectiveness and cost effectiveness,"" says Colin Drummond, professor of addiction services at King's. ""For every Â£1 you spend on treatment, you save over Â£3 in NHS and social care costs, so cutting these services is a false economy."" In separate research published earlier this month, the same team found alcohol-related conditions in NHS hospitals were approximately 20-30 times higher than official government statistics suggested. NHS England announced earlier this year that as part of its 10-year plan for the NHS, it wanted to create alcohol care teams (ACTs) in the 25% of hospitals with the highest rates of alcohol-related admissions - but Prof Drummond says that is not nearly ambitious enough ""in tackling what is evidently a national epidemic"". ""Given the prevalence of these conditions within NHS hospitals across England, as a first step an ACT in every hospital would appear warranted, not merely the top 25%."" Prof Drummond told BBC News: ""While it's great that the government is to invest more in alcohol care teams in acute hospitals, which is really needed, there is not much point in having a Rolls-Royce hospital-based service when you have a Reliant Robin with a flat tyre waiting in the community to pick you up."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, called on the new prime minister to use the upcoming spending review to reverse cuts to local authority budgets. In particular, the LGA says, public health grants, which, among other things, fund community drug and alcohol services, have been reduced by Â£700m in real terms since 2015-16. Ian Hudspeth, who chairs LGA's community wellbeing board, said: ""Councils are committed to ensuring that those people affected by alcohol and drug problems get the right support and treatment. So, providing well-funded, targeted and effective substance misuse services is vital. ""However, cuts to councils' public health grant by central government have consequences. ""Leaving councils to pick up the bill for treating new and increasing numbers of users while having fewer resources cannot be an option. ""It is therefore essential that the new prime minister uses the upcoming spending review to reverse these reductions to the public health grant and provides councils with the money needed to invest in cost-effective prevention and recovery work.""

"The pound has continued to fall on currency markets as the government insists that the UK is prepared to leave the EU without a deal. Sterling hit a fresh two-year low of $1.2120 against the dollar on Tuesday, before recovering some ground. The currency also slid against the euro, falling to â¬1.0881 at one point. The fall in the value of the pound means UK tourists heading abroad could face a ""horrendous summer"", according to one currency expert. Five holiday destinations where a weak pound still goes far Tourists facing travel money 'shock' this summer The pound's fall: A tale of two cities How does Brexit affect the pound? Under new Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the government has toughened its stance on a no-deal Brexit, which it has said is ""now a very real prospect"". The pound - which was trading at about $1.50 against the dollar before the EU referendum in June 2016 - has dropped by 2.4% since Monday, when a spokeswoman for Downing Street said that the UK would not enter talks with Europe unless the so-called Irish backstop is scrapped. She said that because the EU has said it is not willing to renegotiate on this point, ""we must assume there will be a no-deal Brexit on 31 October."" It follows comments at the weekend by Michael Gove, who wrotein the Sunday Times,externalthat the government was now ""working on the assumption"" of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Johnson appeared to strike a slightly softer tone on Monday afternoon, when he said he would ""hold out the hand"" and ""go the extra thousand miles"" to strike a new Brexit deal. However, it was not enough to stop the slide in sterling. Seema Shah, senior global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: ""If it looks like this juggernaut cannot be stopped, we do expect sterling to keep falling."" She said that the pound could drop as low as $1.18 against the dollar, but added: ""There is a widespread view that a no-deal Brexit will be stopped."" The former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Lord Jim O'Neill, told the BBC's World at One programme that in addition to the risks of a no-deal Brexit, the markets were also ""looking at a government that might be leaning on an independent central bank, possibly including the choice of its new governor"" and the policy plans that suggest the government is going to increase spending. The combination of these factors is ""essentially pointing one way for the pound"", Lord O'Neill said. However, he added that he thought the pound looked ""very cheap"", and if there was a Brexit deal, then sterling could recover ""very sharply"". Tourist rates are based on trading levels on the international currency markets, which is bad news for UK holiday makers heading abroad. ""Unfortunately holiday makers are going to experience a pretty horrendous summer,"" James Hickman, commercial manager at FairFX, told the BBC. ""If they are visiting Europe they could be getting less than parity for their pounds when buying euros, and they will be getting a poor dollar rate if going to the USA."" ""It is going to get worse,"" he adds. ""The market is digesting the news that it is almost inevitably going to be a hard Brexit. ""For anyone going abroad in August, it is going to be a very expensive time."" Those that buy euros at the airport can currently expect to receive as little as 97 euro cents for their pound. Better rates can be found by buying in advance, with the Post Office offering a sliding scale from â¬1.0663 to â¬1.0712 to the pound, depending on how much cash is ordered. In its branches it is offering â¬1.0630. That's still a long way from the summer of 2015, when tourists were getting at least â¬1.32 for their pound. The big fall came in 2016 after the UK voted to leave the European Union. Analysis by Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Currency experts say holidaymakers should never wait until they reach the airport to exchange money, as bureaux in the airport complex usually have the worst rates. The timing of when to exchange cash can be tricky - it is difficult to predict how the value of the pound will move, so one common suggestion is to change half of your holiday money weeks in advance of departure, and the rest just before, to hedge your bets. Ordering currency online in advance and then collecting the cash in person can also secure a better rate. Cash exchange is not the only option. Carrying a wad of notes can be dangerous and not always covered by travel insurance. The market for specialist pre-loaded currency cards is growing, and banks are competing on the rates and deals for overseas use that they offer to current account holders. So doing your homework on charges and shopping around is advisable. In general, using a regular debit card can be expensive, owing to the extra charges, and remember to let your bank know if you are going away to avoid being locked out by anti-fraud processes. If you do use a card on your holiday, shops, restaurants and cash machines will usually ask if you want to pay in pounds rather than the local currency. Always choose the latter. Tourists can lose up to 10% by paying in sterling rather than the domestic currency.

"Miniature toiletries are to be removed from all hotels run by InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) for environmental reasons - making it the first global hotel brand to undertake such a move. The UK-based owner of Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotels has pledged to take the small plastic bottles out of its 843,000 rooms by 2021. The move has already happened in about a third of its estate. The change means that bulk items are replacing the individual toiletries. IHG chief executive Keith Barr said: ""We collectively as an industry have to lead where governments are not necessarily giving the leadership to make a difference. ""Five years ago it was a tick-the-box exercise. Today it's follow-up meetings going through in detail what we are doing about our carbon footprint."" How the plastic in your beauty regime could be harming the environment Last year, IHG said it would stop using plastic straws by the end of 2019. Mr Barr added that ""the next big thing to tackle"" would be the plastic plates and cutlery used for its breakfast service. In addition, the company has teamed up with artificial intelligence firm Winnow on a pilot to monitor waste across breakfast buffets in some of its hotels. IHG has committed to reducing its carbon footprint per occupied room by 6% by next year. Its high-end resort brand Six Senses has said it will go plastic-free across its whole supply chain by 2022. The move was welcomed by Greenpeace, with the environmental group's Fiona Nicholls saying: ""Just as shoppers have shown they're happy to bring their own bags to supermarkets, hotel guests are absolutely able to adapt and start bringing their own toiletries."" Richard Clarke, an analyst at research company Bernstein, said: ""Rather than reacting to customer outcry over straws, IHG are trying to be proactive and say that they can use this as a differentiator if they can get ahead on it.""

"This video can not be played ""We will look after the farming sector"" The prime minister has said it is ""up to the EU, this is their call"" if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Boris Johnson made his first visit to Wales as PM on Tuesday, seeking support from farmers for his Brexit plans. He held talks with Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford, who said there was a ""deeply concerning lack of detail"" from the new prime minister. Mr Johnson said: ""We're not aiming for a no-deal Brexit, we don't think that's where we'll end up."" ""This is very much up to our friends and partners across the channel,"" he added. A Welsh farmer called on Mr Johnson to stop ""playing Russian roulette"" with the lamb industry over the threat of a no-deal Brexit. It followed the Farmers' Union of Wales president warning of""civil unrest"" in rural areasif no agreement is struck. Earlier, the prime minister had his first phone call withIrish leader Leo Varadkarsince taking office. Boris Johnson wants renewal of 'ties that bind UK' No-deal Brexit: What you need to know What happens next?

Mr Johnson visited a chicken farm in St Brides Wentlooge, near Newport, before travelling to online retailer BVG Group in Brecon. He later attended a meeting in the Welsh Assembly with Mark Drakeford, where he was booed by a group of protesters on arrival. In a news conference afterwards, Mr Drakeford said they had an ""engaged discussion"" on Brexit. The Welsh Labour leader said he pressed Mr Johnson to explain the path to a deal with the EU but did not get a ""clear sense"" from him of what the plan would be. This video can not be played What is the food and farming sector worth to Wales? Here is a quick video guide. Mr Drakeford said he emphasised the ""catastrophic effect"" a no-deal Brexit would have on the Welsh economy, and said the PM provided assurances of support for manufacturing and agriculture in such a scenario. ""But asked to describe the nature of that support, I'm afraid that there is a deeply concerning lack of detail that is available to people whose livelihood is on the line,"" Mr Drakeford said. The first minister said the PM told him there would be many new opportunities for Welsh agriculture and businesses, but he had ""no sense again"" there was detailed thinking behind what ""otherwise becomes vacuous optimism"". Mr Drakeford said he warned Mr Johnson ""the future of the UK is more at risk today than at any other point in his political lifetime"", and said he had put ideas to him on how the Union could be ""reinvented"". A Downing Street spokeswoman said the two spoke about the importance of the union and support for farmers in Wales. She added: ""The PM set out how the UK will be leaving the EU on October 31st, come what may, and said he would seek to work with the Welsh Government and other devolved administrations, to make sure communities across the UK are ready to maximise on the opportunities that Brexit will bring."" Boris Johnson is seeking to reassure farmers about his Brexit plans Many Welsh farmers are heavily reliant on free trade with the EU. If the UK leaves without a deal many would face significant tariffs on their exports to EU countries. The prime minister did not give any television interviews to Welsh broadcasters on Tuesday. However, during the farm visit, he told reporters the agriculture sector will ""have the support they need"" in the event of no-deal. ""We will make sure that they have the support that they need, if there are markets that are going to be tricky that we help them to find new markets, we have interventions that aim to support them and their incomes,"" Mr Johnson said. ""The most important point is that we don't want tariffs and we don't envisage they will be necessary. ""And I think common sense would dictate it would be better and massively in the interests of our EU friends to have a zero-tariff, zero-quota regime of the kind we currently have."" Mr Johnson suggested funds for ""export refunds"" would be made available for the Welsh Government to administer. Asked how the system would work, given agriculture is devolved, he said: ""It will be up to the Welsh Government to administer it. We will make sure the funds are available."" A Welsh Government source said they were surprised by the nature of the announcement. Helen Roberts called on Boris Johnson to stop playing ""Russian roulette"" with the lamb industry The farming industry is worth more than Â£6bn to the Welsh economy and supports 14,000 businesses, 45,000 jobs and about 25,000 farmers. Welsh lamb will face at least 40% tariffs in a no-deal scenario, prompting a sheep farmer to call for Mr Johnson ""to stop playing Russian roulette with the industry as he appears to be doing at the moment"". ""If we do go out with a no deal, it will be absolutely catastrophic even if it is just for a few months,"" Helen Roberts, who is also development officer for the National Sheep Association in Wales, told Radio 4'sToday programme. She said her members would protest against a no-deal Brexit, adding: ""I think it's time to come and stand up for ourselves, and be counted."" On Monday, the prime minister said there was ""every chance"" a Brexit deal with the EU could be struck,but the existing agreement with the EU has ""got to go"". However senior minister Michael Gove, who has been put in charge of preparing for no deal, has saidthe UK government was working on the assumptionthe UK would leave the EU without an agreement. Boris Johnson was booed by protesters as he arrived at the National Assembly for Wales on Tuesday Ahead of his meeting with Mr Johnson, Mr Drakefordtweeted,externalBrexit ""will decimate our agricultural and manufacturing sectors and risks ripping the Union apart"". ""The PM must stop playing fast and loose with our country,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns suggested new global markets, including in Japan, will be available to sheep meat producers. Mr Cairns told the BBC: ""We are now looking to the growth that will come from right around the world, 90% of global growth will come from outside of the EU, ""But we don't want to close our back on the European market either and that's why working hard to get a deal is important, but of course there needs to be a shift in attitude and a positive response to the cause that we're making."" Reality check: Can farmers send lamb to Japan after Brexit? Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts pointed out via Twitter the Japanese market had been opened up to Welsh lamb by the EU-Japan trade deal. Mr Cairns added farmers ""can be guaranteed that the same money will be available to ensure that we are protecting this sector"". By Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor Mark Drakeford told a press conference there was a ""deeply concerning lack of detail"" from Boris Johnson It is clear there was no meeting of minds between Mark Drakeford and Boris Johnson. As well as having ""fundamentally different views"" on Brexit, the two leaders are very different characters. The first minister is a details man - after Brexit he wants to know what support will be on offer to Welsh manufacturing and agriculture, when it'll be available and how long for. But the prime minister paints in bold colours, and he knows that despite concerns over the impact of a no-deal exit in Wales, voters here chose to leave the EU in 2016. This is the first of many meetings between the two leaders - whether they can find common ground remains to be seen.

"This video can not be played Captain: I don't know why so much force was used The captain of a tanker seized while carrying Iranian oil has said Royal Marines used ""brute force"" in detaining his ship. Earlier this month, UK forces helped authorities in Gibraltar who believed the tanker was carrying oil to a Syrian refinery in breach of EU sanctions. The captain said marines made his unarmed crew kneel on the deck at gunpoint. The MoD said the seizure complied with ""international rules and norms"". On 4 July, about 30 marines from 42 Commando were flown from the UK to Gibraltar to help detain the tanker and its cargo, at the request of the Gibraltar government. Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained What's so important about a ship's flag? UK sends second warship to Gulf The vessel's captain, an Indian national who asked not to be named, said he was radioed a police request to board his ship and lowered his ladder. But before anyone could board, a military helicopter landed on the ship in a ""very dangerous"" move, he said. Royal Marines landed in their helicopter on Grace 1 He told the BBC he identified himself as the captain but the marines ignored him and instead pointed their guns and shouted ""look forward, look forward"". He said: ""They didn't care whether I was masterâ¦ there was no regulationsâ¦ we had 28 unarmed crew. I was in a state of shock, everybody was in a state of shock. ""How do you come on a ship like this with armed forces and such brute force. For what reason?"" He said the marines could have boarded the ship and simply told him he had been arrested. The captain agreed to speak to the BBC on condition his name was not used, saying he and his crew had been advised by Indian High Commission officials to remain anonymous while legal proceedings were ongoing. Asked whether he felt there was anything illegitimate about his ship or the cargo, he said he had ""followed company procedures"", adding he did not know about the EU sanctions against Syria. The captain has since been arrested and bailed by authorities in Gibraltar. The MoD said the operation on Grace 1 was a ""standard boarding"" and that British armed forces were ""held to the highest standards of professionalism"". Royal Gibraltar Police said the marines had acted in support of its officers and applied ""the minimum use of force"" to ensure officers could get on board, deal with the crew and take control of the vessel. It added that the ship's four senior officers had been interviewed under caution. The Gibraltar government said it had evidence which contradicted statements made by the captain and would release its own statement soon. It said it had reason to believe the ship was carrying Iranian crude oil to the Baniyas Refinery in Syria, which theEU says,externalprovides financial support to the Syrian government. The refinery has been subject to EU sanctions since 2014. Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? Iran-UK radio exchanges as ship seized Is this the world's most important waterway? The seizure of the tanker sparked a diplomatic crisis between the UK and Iran, which has escalated over the past four weeks. On 19 July, British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero was seized by Iran's Revolutionary Guard in the key shipping route, the Strait of Hormuz. Tehran said the vessel was ""violating international maritime rules"" but the UK called the incident an example of ""state piracy"". Both British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and Iran's ambassador to the UK have ruled out an exchange of the two seized ships. Mr Raab said: ""This is not about some kind of barter. This is about international law and the rules of the international legal system being upheld."" Iranian diplomat Hamid Baedinejad tweeted it was ""impossible to advance a quid pro quo or barter exchange"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Andy Howard runs a project to plant 600,000 new trees but found it ""painful"" to get approval Significant rises in tree planting in the UK ""need to happen quickly"" if other targets to cut carbon are not met, government advisers have warned. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommends 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted annually, more than double the new trees planted last year. And it said this may have to rise to 50,000 hectares if other carbon reduction targets are not achieved. The government said it planned to ""rapidly grow forest cover"". It has signed up to theCCC's goal,externalof the UK of cutting all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 -so-called net zero. The committee - made up of experts in science, economics, and business - said this required woodland to increase from 13% of land in the UK to 17%. Charity the Woodland Trust said this would be equivalent to about 1.5 billion new trees and that future generations would be ""let down"" by poorer air quality and rising ""urban heat"" if the committee's targets were not met. The CCC said 30,000 hectares (116 sq miles) of new trees are needed per year until 2050. This is equivalent to filling more than 46,000 standard football pitches or a space about three-quarters the size of the Isle of Wight every year. Tree planting: Your questions answered Can I plant trees anywhere? Ewa Kmietowicz, the CCC's transport and agriculture team leader, said: ""The government needs to develop a strategy to meet the 30,000-hectare target and it needs to happen quickly."" However, the CCC said tree planting may need to increase further - to 50,000 hectares per year - if other sectors of the economy including industry and transport do not reduce emissions enough. Ms Kmietowicz added: ""It takes time for trees to grow and absorb carbon. There are many high upfront costs to planting trees. ""The government needs to get farmers engaged in this."" The CCC said it had not worked out the point at which tree planting may have to increase to 50,000 hectares per year but ""it would depend on all that is happening across the wider economy"". Figures show almost 13,400 hectares (51.7 sq miles) were planted between April 2018 and March 2019 with the vast majority - 11,210 hectares -in Scotland. England planted about 1,420 hectares, Wales 520 and Northern Ireland 240. Although planting has increased in the past four years, the last time the UK planted 30,000 hectares of trees in one year was in 1989, as the timber industry pushed to increase the country's lumber supply. The first trees were planted on the Doddington North Moor site in March 2018 Landowners in England can apply for up toÂ£6,800 of funding,externalper hectare of land for planting projects andanother scheme providing Â£10m for 130,000 ""urban trees"",externalin towns and cities has been announced. Andy Howard, who runs a company that finds places for new woodland, found it was easier to get approval in Scotland than in England. The 47-year-old said a project in Scotland took 10 months to gain approval, while a similar initiative to plant 600,000 new trees in Doddington, Northumberland, was ""utterly painful"" and took two years to approve. ""There's often significant pushback from the Forestry Commission on the visual impact of woodland on the landscape,"" he said. What is being done around the world to plant trees? Greta Thunberg to sail Atlantic for climate conferences Should I offset my summer holiday flights? The Doddington North Moor site, near Wooler, will be used for mountain bike trails and education as well as timber supply. Mr Howard said woodland was a ""safe, growing investment"" which would take about 20 years to return when trees are cut down, the timber sold and replacements planted. Stuart Goodall, the chief executive of Confor - which represents the forestry and sawmilling sector across the UK - said applications for planting could be ""bogged down"" for years. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the minimum planting site size had been reduced from 30 hectares (300,000 sq metres) to 10 to encourage people with smaller plots of land. The scheme is open to applications all year round. There are separate schemes for land in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. About 15 million trees have been planted in England with government funding between 2010 and 2018 - but rates vary widely and many urban areas did not have any. More than a quarter were planted in just five areas - Northumberland, Stratford-upon-Avon, Eden, Carlisle and County Durham. Havering was the only London borough with new government-funded trees, with 19,100 planted between 2010 and 2018. Defra said a number of the places that had received no funding - including Liverpool, Bristol, Croydon and Leicester - were ""major metropolitan areas"" such as cities or smaller places with ""little land available for planting"". Climate change: UK government 'like Dad's Army' Trees 'most effective solution' for warming Attenborough: Climate change risks Africa turmoil Data on planting comes from the Forestry Commission and does not include trees funded by councils, those restocked after being chopped down, or those funded entirely privately. In Wales over the past three years more than three million trees were planted under Glastir Woodland Creation and Plant! schemes. Local authority level figures are not available for Scotland or Northern Ireland. This video can not be played The effects of air pollution on human health Steve Marsh from the Woodland Trust said trees help reduce health problems caused by air pollution and ""urban heat"" -including respiratory illnesses,external. ""Trees are the lungs of the earth, in our towns and cities you'll be able to feel the difference in air quality if we don't plant more,"" he said. He said while air quality was expected to improve as more people switched to electric vehicles, more trees were needed to tackle the urban heat generated by buildings and concrete that absorb heat during the day and release it at night. Dr Jennifer Allan, who lectures in environmental politics at Cardiff University, said: ""Trees help buffer against storms, safeguard water quality and protect soils in agricultural areas."" She added they were not a ""complete solution"". A Defra spokesman said: ""Since 2010 we have planted over 15 million trees [in England] and we have a clear commitment through our 25-year Environment Plan to grow woodland cover further."" He added the department would consult on an ""English tree strategy"" which would set out how it would ""rapidly grow forest cover"". The Scottish Government's current goal is to plant 15,000 hectares of trees per year by 2025 and the Welsh Government has set a target of planting 2,000 hectares each year from 2020. Officials in Northern Ireland say they want to increase the country's forest areas from 8% of land to 12% by the middle of the century.

"This video can not be played Harland and Wolff: 'The shipyard is my life' The UK government has said that the crisis at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast is ""ultimately a commercial issue"". Unions say the yard is at imminent risk of closure and have called for it to be nationalised. A government spokesperson said there was ""every sympathy for the workers"". They added that the government will ""do all it can"" to offer support. It is understood administrators are now expected to arrive on Monday. 'Unacceptable' losses at Harland and Wolff Concern over Belfast shipyard future The firm's Norwegian parent company Dolphin Drilling is having serious financial problems and put Harland and Wolff up for sale late last year. There were exclusive negotiations with a potential buyer but they cooled in the last two weeks. A rally in support of the shipyard workers took place in east Belfast on Tuesday On Monday, workers said they had taken control of the site and established a rota to ensure their protest continues around the clock. The yard employs about 130 people, specialising in energy and marine engineering projects. They said they would continue the protest until a solution is found. More than 100 workers attended a rally in east Belfast on Tuesday in support of the shipyard workers. On Tuesday, a UK government spokesperson said that the government has ""every sympathy for the Harland and Wolff workers at a time of great personal uncertainty"". They added: ""We will work with partners in Northern Ireland and in Westminster to understand the situation and do all we can to support, but it is ultimately a commercial issue. ""The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, has had conversations with Invest NI and ministers across government as a matter of urgency."" Trade unions have called on the government to renationalise the shipyard The Unite union said workers decided to take the action ahead of the expected arrival of administrators. Trade unions have been hoping that the yard could benefit from plans to build moreRoyal Navy ships in the UK. But now there is a risk it will not survive for long enough to benefit. They have demanded Boris Johnson's government renationalise the yard and save their jobs. BBC News NI Business Reporter Richard Morgan Staff have been here since Monday afternoon, they took control of the shipyard in protest at its imminent collapse. They remain here on Tuesday, they stayed throughout the night and they plan to do the same again tonight. They want the government to intervene to renationalise the shipyard to prevent it from collapse. More than 100 people attended a rally in support of the shipyard workers on Tuesday. Bombardier staff also attended. Dr Esmond Birnie, senior economist at Ulster University, believes the government will be reluctant to renationalise the yard. ""The shipyard was nationalised in the 1970s, and remained in public ownership until 1989 when the Norwegian firm purchased it,"" he said. ""That was a period when a very substantial amount of public subsidy was put into it, so I think they will be reluctant, they will be cautious about going back down that route."" Workers closed the shipyard's gates on Monday Harland and Wolff is one of Northern Ireland's best known businesses and its two huge cranes dominate the east Belfast skyline. It was founded in 1861 and at the height of production during World War Two employed around 35,000 people. Its best known vessel is the Titanic, which was built at the yard between 1909 and 1911. Paul Beattie, who has worked for Harland and Wolff for more than 30 years, was on the picket line on Tuesday morning. He told BBC Radio Ulster that workers ""are here for the long haul"". He added: ""We sat back for too long and left it in the hands of the politicians and management within the company and now we are two days from closure. ""So we have decided to take action and try to force our politicians into a position where they are no longer hiding behind the fact that Stormont is not running."" Gavin Robinson was at the shipyard on Tuesday morning DUP MP Gavin Robinson told BBC News NI that he ""understands and shares the concerns"" and he is trying to work towards a solution. He said: ""The next number of days are critical for the shipyard and we are working towards a solution so I understand entirely their frustrations."" Mr Robinson added: ""There have been talks with intended bidders- the people have a vision for this shipyard, the people want to see a renaissance in shipbuilding in Belfast.""

"Miniature toiletries are to be removed from all hotels run by InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) for environmental reasons - making it the first global hotel brand to undertake such a move. The UK-based owner of Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotels has pledged to take the small plastic bottles out of its 843,000 rooms by 2021. The move has already happened in about a third of its estate. The change means that bulk items are replacing the individual toiletries. IHG chief executive Keith Barr said: ""We collectively as an industry have to lead where governments are not necessarily giving the leadership to make a difference. ""Five years ago it was a tick-the-box exercise. Today it's follow-up meetings going through in detail what we are doing about our carbon footprint."" How the plastic in your beauty regime could be harming the environment Last year, IHG said it would stop using plastic straws by the end of 2019. Mr Barr added that ""the next big thing to tackle"" would be the plastic plates and cutlery used for its breakfast service. In addition, the company has teamed up with artificial intelligence firm Winnow on a pilot to monitor waste across breakfast buffets in some of its hotels. IHG has committed to reducing its carbon footprint per occupied room by 6% by next year. Its high-end resort brand Six Senses has said it will go plastic-free across its whole supply chain by 2022. The move was welcomed by Greenpeace, with the environmental group's Fiona Nicholls saying: ""Just as shoppers have shown they're happy to bring their own bags to supermarkets, hotel guests are absolutely able to adapt and start bringing their own toiletries."" Richard Clarke, an analyst at research company Bernstein, said: ""Rather than reacting to customer outcry over straws, IHG are trying to be proactive and say that they can use this as a differentiator if they can get ahead on it.""

"British Gas owner Centrica's chief executive Iain Conn is to step down from his post and retire from the company's board next year. He told the Today programme it was ""a natural time for me to hand over"". Centrica reported a pre-tax loss of Â£446m in the six months to June. It made a Â£704m profit this time in 2018. The firm is also cutting its dividend and selling its investment in oil and gas exploration and production, but is launching a new partnership with Ford. Profit at the company's consumer division, which includes British Gas, was down 44% to Â£240m. It said the decline reflected the impact of the government's price cap, which was brought in at the start of 2019. Profit at Centrica's business division fell 89% to Â£11m, which it blamed on warm weather and outages at its nuclear power stations. The company's shares fell by 19%. Mr Conn said: ""The most difficult thing has been the price cap coming in. It cost British Gas Â£300m in profits this year, ""All the current price cap has done is actually delayed the issues rather than solve them, and I'm hoping a new fresh look by this new government may make changes. ""It's always been said that the price cap is going to be temporary and we look forward to the day when it's rolled back."" Centrica boss gets 44% pay rise after 'challenging year' Centrica call centre in Glasgow earmarked for closure Centrica in legal challenge to energy price cap He added: ""We are finishing the journey to becoming a customer-facing energy and solution company. Once we have done that, it is the right time for me to hand over to a successor - a natural moment. ""We have been shifting a company to one in tune with a lower carbon economy. ""We grew consumer accounts in the first half of the year in the UK. We did lose 178,000 energy accounts, but we more than made up for it in the accounts in the other businesses. ""What seems to be happening is when we get close to being in the top five on a price comparison website, people prefer us ""We are bundling energy with services and we make money out of both. It's early days, but I'm very encouraged by what's happened in the first half of the year."" Last year,Mr Conn was given a 44% rise in his payto Â£2.4m. Investors love companies with big market shares in industries where competitors find it hard to secure a foothold - and a decade ago that was Centrica. Through British Gas it had a one-fifth share of the British household energy market, where competition was limited, and a fast-growing business in America. A previous flourishing of competition among energy retailers had been killed off when wholesale prices had risen quickly. But those market dynamics have now been tipped on their head. New technology and new government regulations have made it much easier for people to change their supplier, and generating power has proved to be a marginal and often loss-making game. Ian Conn arrived just as this new reality was dawning, and there were much greater headwinds awaiting. Theresa May's cap on energy prices has cut about Â£300m off its annual retail profits, and nimble competitors have eaten away at its cosy retail dominance. Mr Conn has raced to try and keep up, but those once loyal shareholders have always been ahead of him. The share price was north of 300p when he joined - now it is just 81p. Before his departure he has made the final big steps in the step away from capital-intensive power-generation assets, putting both the nuclear power and oil and gas interests up for sale. It will be up to his successor to convince markets that this strategy is the right one. GMB union national secretary Justin Bowden said Mr Conn was leaving Centrica ""in the last chance saloon"". British Gas lost 742,000 customers last year and Mr Bowden added: ""British Gas has to stop haemorrhaging customers and rewarding boardroom failure. ""Blessed with a loyal workforce, a top-class brand and the biggest customer base in the country it now needs the right leadership and a properly implemented strategic vision."" Centrica also announced it was launching a partnership with Ford, as the carmaker seeks to expand its range of electric vehicles. Under the deal, Centrica will deliver a dedicated home charging installation service for the next five years. There will be special electric vehicle tariffs from British Gas and Bord GÃ¡is Energy, which will allow Ford customers to benefit from lower energy prices for overnight charging.

"Miniature toiletries are to be removed from all hotels run by InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) for environmental reasons - making it the first global hotel brand to undertake such a move. The UK-based owner of Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza hotels has pledged to take the small plastic bottles out of its 843,000 rooms by 2021. The move has already happened in about a third of its estate. The change means that bulk items are replacing the individual toiletries. IHG chief executive Keith Barr said: ""We collectively as an industry have to lead where governments are not necessarily giving the leadership to make a difference. ""Five years ago it was a tick-the-box exercise. Today it's follow-up meetings going through in detail what we are doing about our carbon footprint."" How the plastic in your beauty regime could be harming the environment Last year, IHG said it would stop using plastic straws by the end of 2019. Mr Barr added that ""the next big thing to tackle"" would be the plastic plates and cutlery used for its breakfast service. In addition, the company has teamed up with artificial intelligence firm Winnow on a pilot to monitor waste across breakfast buffets in some of its hotels. IHG has committed to reducing its carbon footprint per occupied room by 6% by next year. Its high-end resort brand Six Senses has said it will go plastic-free across its whole supply chain by 2022. The move was welcomed by Greenpeace, with the environmental group's Fiona Nicholls saying: ""Just as shoppers have shown they're happy to bring their own bags to supermarkets, hotel guests are absolutely able to adapt and start bringing their own toiletries."" Richard Clarke, an analyst at research company Bernstein, said: ""Rather than reacting to customer outcry over straws, IHG are trying to be proactive and say that they can use this as a differentiator if they can get ahead on it.""

"The alleged hacker was arrested on Monday The personal details of about 106 million individuals across the US and Canada were stolen in a hack targeting financial services firm Capital One, the company has revealed. The alleged hacker, Paige Thompson, was arrested on Monday after reportedly boasting about the breach online. Capital One said the data included names, addresses and phone numbers of people who applied for its products. But the hacker did not gain access to credit card account numbers, it said. The data breach is believed to be one of the largest in banking history. Capital One is a major credit card issuer in the US and also operates retail banks. Thefirm said in a statement released on Monday,externalthat the breach affected approximately 100 million individuals in the US and six million people in Canada. The statement added that about 140,000 social security numbers and 80,000 linked bank account numbers were compromised in the US. In Canada, about one million social insurance numbers belonging to Capital One credit card customers were also compromised. The hack was identified on 19 July. Capital One said the hacker was able to ""exploit"" a ""configuration vulnerability"" in the company's infrastructure. Aside from names and dates of birth, the hacker also managed to obtain credit scores, limits, balances, payment history and contact information. Capital One said it was unlikely the information was used for fraud but it would continue to investigate the breach. The company will notify those affected and will provide them with free credit monitoring and identity protection. Chairman Richard Fairbank said in a statement: ""While I am grateful that the perpetrator has been caught, I am deeply sorry for what has happened. ""I sincerely apologise for the understandable worry this incident must be causing those affected and I am committed to making it right. "" The US justice department has confirmed it has arrested a former Seattle technology company software engineer in connection with the breach. Ms Thompson, 33, was arrested on Monday on charges of computer fraud and abuse. She made an initial appearance in federal court in Seattle. A hearing has been scheduled for 1 August. Court documents claim she boasted about the data breach on an online forum. A statement by the US attorney's office in Washington said: ""On July 17 2019, a GitHub user who saw the post alerted Capital One to the possibility it had suffered a data theft."" Ms Thompson faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 (Â£204,713) fine.

"The gap in achievement is closing so slowly it would take 500 years for poorer pupils to catch up Progress to close the achievement gap for poorer pupils in England's secondary schools is almost at a ""standstill"", say researchers. The Education Policy Institute says disadvantaged pupils are on average 18 months behind the rest of the class in academic achievement by the age of 16. At the current rate, the study says it will take 500 years to close the gap. The Department for Education said Â£2.4bn per year was dedicated to supporting poorer pupils. The report looks at the progress of disadvantaged pupils - defined asthose eligible for free school meals.,external It's not going to surprise anyone that deprived youngsters tend to do less well in school - but what might be unexpected is the huge scale of the regional differences. The 10 areas in which the achievement gap is narrowest are all in London, many with high levels of deprivation. By the age of 16, disadvantaged pupils in Westminster are less than four months behind the national average - but in Blackpool they are more than two years behind, which is pretty disastrous for GCSE courses, which only last two years, and means all the doors opened by GCSEs, A-levels, college and university are likely to stay closed. The gap between disadvantaged pupils and the rest is six times wider in Blackpool than in Westminster It's not a simple North-South gap. Many of the places where disadvantaged youngsters achieve the lowest results are in the North, such as Knowsley, Rotherham and Hartlepool. But they're also struggling in Portsmouth, Kent and Peterborough. This suggests it could be another facet of the deep-rooted underachievement of white working class youngsters, one of the biggest ungrasped nettles facing the education system. London has a hugely diverse population, served by schools that have received a lot of investment, and debates about the educational success of the capital have often struggled to separate the active ingredients - how much it is the impact of schools and how much the intake of pupils. Funding is another factor, as London schools also tend to receive the highest level of per pupil spending. The new prime minister has promised extra cash for schools - and this latest study will raise questions about where it should be spent. ""For the first time in several years, the gap between poorer pupils and their peers at GCSE has stopped closing,"" says report author Jo Hutchinson. There were some improvements between 2011 and 2015 - but this has slowed and at secondary levels is showing signs of going backwards. David Laws, Education Policy Institute chairman and former education minister, says: ""We are now witnessing a major setback for social mobility in our country. Recent progress on narrowing the education gap between poor children and the rest has ground to a halt."" Child poverty cash handed back to Europe unspent Five generations 'before poor would reach average pay' Private school and Oxbridge dominate top jobs The report also shows the difference in achievement between ethnic groups. The highest achieving group are Chinese pupils, on average more than two years ahead of white British pupils - the biggest group, which is not broken down into wealthy or poorer teenagers. Indian and white Irish pupils are also significantly ahead, but Pakistani and black Caribbean pupils have lower results than white British. Julie McCulloch, of the ASCL head teachers' union, said the ""report makes for grim reading and should be sounding alarm bells in Whitehall"". She blamed the stalling in progress on ""severe financial pressures"" that meant schools had to ""cut back on individual support"". ""Schools and colleges need an immediate multibillion-pound emergency investment,"" said Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers. Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ""This is the latest evidence that inequality continues to rise under the Tories, with the most disadvantaged students losing out."" But School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said that the gap for both primary and secondary schools was narrower than in 2011. ""During that time this government has delivered a range of reforms to ensure every child, regardless of their background, gets a high-quality education. ""We are investing Â£2.4bn this year alone through the pupil premium to help the most disadvantaged children.""

"Andy Howard runs a project to plant 600,000 new trees but found it ""painful"" to get approval Significant rises in tree planting in the UK ""need to happen quickly"" if other targets to cut carbon are not met, government advisers have warned. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) recommends 30,000 hectares of woodland should be planted annually, more than double the new trees planted last year. And it said this may have to rise to 50,000 hectares if other carbon reduction targets are not achieved. The government said it planned to ""rapidly grow forest cover"". It has signed up to theCCC's goal,externalof the UK of cutting all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 -so-called net zero. The committee - made up of experts in science, economics, and business - said this required woodland to increase from 13% of land in the UK to 17%. Charity the Woodland Trust said this would be equivalent to about 1.5 billion new trees and that future generations would be ""let down"" by poorer air quality and rising ""urban heat"" if the committee's targets were not met. The CCC said 30,000 hectares (116 sq miles) of new trees are needed per year until 2050. This is equivalent to filling more than 46,000 standard football pitches or a space about three-quarters the size of the Isle of Wight every year. Tree planting: Your questions answered Can I plant trees anywhere? Ewa Kmietowicz, the CCC's transport and agriculture team leader, said: ""The government needs to develop a strategy to meet the 30,000-hectare target and it needs to happen quickly."" However, the CCC said tree planting may need to increase further - to 50,000 hectares per year - if other sectors of the economy including industry and transport do not reduce emissions enough. Ms Kmietowicz added: ""It takes time for trees to grow and absorb carbon. There are many high upfront costs to planting trees. ""The government needs to get farmers engaged in this."" The CCC said it had not worked out the point at which tree planting may have to increase to 50,000 hectares per year but ""it would depend on all that is happening across the wider economy"". Figures show almost 13,400 hectares (51.7 sq miles) were planted between April 2018 and March 2019 with the vast majority - 11,210 hectares -in Scotland. England planted about 1,420 hectares, Wales 520 and Northern Ireland 240. Although planting has increased in the past four years, the last time the UK planted 30,000 hectares of trees in one year was in 1989, as the timber industry pushed to increase the country's lumber supply. The first trees were planted on the Doddington North Moor site in March 2018 Landowners in England can apply for up toÂ£6,800 of funding,externalper hectare of land for planting projects andanother scheme providing Â£10m for 130,000 ""urban trees"",externalin towns and cities has been announced. Andy Howard, who runs a company that finds places for new woodland, found it was easier to get approval in Scotland than in England. The 47-year-old said a project in Scotland took 10 months to gain approval, while a similar initiative to plant 600,000 new trees in Doddington, Northumberland, was ""utterly painful"" and took two years to approve. ""There's often significant pushback from the Forestry Commission on the visual impact of woodland on the landscape,"" he said. What is being done around the world to plant trees? Greta Thunberg to sail Atlantic for climate conferences Should I offset my summer holiday flights? The Doddington North Moor site, near Wooler, will be used for mountain bike trails and education as well as timber supply. Mr Howard said woodland was a ""safe, growing investment"" which would take about 20 years to return when trees are cut down, the timber sold and replacements planted. Stuart Goodall, the chief executive of Confor - which represents the forestry and sawmilling sector across the UK - said applications for planting could be ""bogged down"" for years. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the minimum planting site size had been reduced from 30 hectares (300,000 sq metres) to 10 to encourage people with smaller plots of land. The scheme is open to applications all year round. There are separate schemes for land in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. About 15 million trees have been planted in England with government funding between 2010 and 2018 - but rates vary widely and many urban areas did not have any. More than a quarter were planted in just five areas - Northumberland, Stratford-upon-Avon, Eden, Carlisle and County Durham. Havering was the only London borough with new government-funded trees, with 19,100 planted between 2010 and 2018. Defra said a number of the places that had received no funding - including Liverpool, Bristol, Croydon and Leicester - were ""major metropolitan areas"" such as cities or smaller places with ""little land available for planting"". Climate change: UK government 'like Dad's Army' Trees 'most effective solution' for warming Attenborough: Climate change risks Africa turmoil Data on planting comes from the Forestry Commission and does not include trees funded by councils, those restocked after being chopped down, or those funded entirely privately. In Wales over the past three years more than three million trees were planted under Glastir Woodland Creation and Plant! schemes. Local authority level figures are not available for Scotland or Northern Ireland. This video can not be played The effects of air pollution on human health Steve Marsh from the Woodland Trust said trees help reduce health problems caused by air pollution and ""urban heat"" -including respiratory illnesses,external. ""Trees are the lungs of the earth, in our towns and cities you'll be able to feel the difference in air quality if we don't plant more,"" he said. He said while air quality was expected to improve as more people switched to electric vehicles, more trees were needed to tackle the urban heat generated by buildings and concrete that absorb heat during the day and release it at night. Dr Jennifer Allan, who lectures in environmental politics at Cardiff University, said: ""Trees help buffer against storms, safeguard water quality and protect soils in agricultural areas."" She added they were not a ""complete solution"". A Defra spokesman said: ""Since 2010 we have planted over 15 million trees [in England] and we have a clear commitment through our 25-year Environment Plan to grow woodland cover further."" He added the department would consult on an ""English tree strategy"" which would set out how it would ""rapidly grow forest cover"". The Scottish Government's current goal is to plant 15,000 hectares of trees per year by 2025 and the Welsh Government has set a target of planting 2,000 hectares each year from 2020. Officials in Northern Ireland say they want to increase the country's forest areas from 8% of land to 12% by the middle of the century.

"UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove said it was important to maintain ""perspective and calmness"" There could be ""civil unrest"" in rural Wales if the next prime minister takes a no-deal Brexit, it has been claimed. The Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) predicted protests, while NFU Cymru said it would not rule out campaigning to stop Brexit entirely. Meat Promotion Wales said the impact of no deal would be ""off the Richter scale"". UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove said they should focus on persuading MPs to support an ""orderly"" Brexit. Mr Gove also said he wanted to stay as environment secretary under either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt following the result of theConservative Party leadership election, which is announced tomorrow. They were speaking at the start of the 100th Royal Welsh Agricultural Show in Llanelwedd, Powys. Both Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt have made it clear they would take the UK out of the EU without a deal, if necessary. But there was ""a possibility of some civil unrest"" if that happens, FUW president Glyn Roberts said. ""If the farming community have their backs against the wall, the only way they're going to get from there is fighting their way through,"" he added. Speaking at the Royal Welsh, NFU Cymru criticised those who dismissed Brexit concerns as ""scaremongering"" NFU Cymru president John Davies said the organisation would ""rule nothing out"" in avoiding a no-deal Brexit. He criticised politicians who had been ""quick to dismiss our well-founded concerns as scaremongering"". Others argued leaving without a deal at the end of October was ""the worst possible timing for farmers"". A new report, commissioned by the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), Quality Meat Scotland and Meat Promotion Wales suggests exports to Europe, which is currently the destination for more than nine-tenths of overseas trade for Welsh producers, could fall by about 92%. The report estimates this would lead to a 24% fall in the price of lamb at a time of year when thousands of lambs are coming on to the market every day. Meat Promotion Wales' chairman Kevin Roberts said research showed farming leaders would have to do all they can to avoid this scenario. ""We need a seamless and stable solution,"" he added. Mr Gove said: ""I've been very clear that if we have a no deal situation there will be unique challenges... We in the UK government are ready for any eventuality - we've taken steps to ensure that we have contingencies in place. ""Our aim as a government is to ensure we have a good deal. ""I think it's... important for us in UK government to maintain our perspective and calmness - we believe that a deal is possible, overwhelmingly likely - and therefore we have to ensure that we keep a focus on getting that deal and securing benefits of being outside EU."" On financial support for farms, he said there would be no way that ""Wales will be anything other than a stronger position in the future"". Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths said there was a lot of concern about how Brexit might end The prospect of the UK leaving without a deal is an ""increasing probability"" which is causing ""a great deal of unrest"", Welsh Government Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths said. ""We've said all along that there has to be a deal. We thought we were leaving at the end of March, people geared up for that and now we're asking companies to gear up again for the end of October,"" she added. ""It's so much uncertainty and clearly people are really very concerned."" The Duchess of Cornwall and the Prince of Wales were treated to a Zulu military display Also attending the show was the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. They joined the King and Queen of Zulu, marking the 140th anniversary of the Anglo Zulu War. Charles was also celebrating his 50th anniversary as the Prince of Wales. Charles, Camilla, King Goodwill Zwelithini and Queen Pumi were treated to a military display by members of a Zulu ""impi"" regiment, dressed in traditional leopard skin uniform. The prince remarked to the Zulu King: ""You haven't aged a bit."" They last met in South Africa in November 2011.

"Shana Grice was murdered by her ex-boyfriend who stalked her An ex-PC has defended his decision to warn a teenager for wasting police time, weeks before she was murdered by her ex-boyfriend. Trevor Godfrey told a misconduct panel that he found inconsistencies in Shana Grice's account of being harassed by Michael Lane. The 19-year-old reported Lane to police five times in the months before she was murdered in Brighton in 2016. Mr Godfrey is accused of failing to adequately investigate. He retired from Sussex Police in 2017 after 29 years. A report commissioned after Miss Grice's death found thatstalking and harassment offences were not being properly investigated by Sussex Police. Mr Godfrey told a hearing in Lewes he had taken the ""lenient view"" of issuing Miss Grice with a formal warning after it emerged she initially failed to disclose the pair had been in a relationship. He said it was ""a bit of a bombshell"" when Lane told him the pair had been in a sexual relationship for several months. He said messages between the two also revealed the reason he was in an alleyway next to her home in February 2016, after previously being warned by police to stay away from her, was because he was summoned there by Miss Grice. Michael Lane was convicted of murdering Miss Grice in 2017 Mr Godfrey told the hearing: ""Absolutely, she did waste my time. I arrested someone as a result of her evidence on a false allegation. She had committed a criminal offence."" He said his colleague took the decision to issue Miss Grice with a Â£90 fine. ""His decision, which I don't disagree with, was that she should not be able to get away with making false statements."" The misconduct hearing is due to resume on Tuesday.

"Lil Nas X, right, recently released a remix of his song with Billy Ray Cyrus, left Old Town Road, the viral rap song by Lil Nas X, has become the longest-running number one in US chart history. The song has now topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 17 weeks, overtaking Luis Fonsi's Despacito and Mariah Carey's One Sweet Day, which both spent 16 weeks at number one. It had 72.5 million streams and 46,000 downloads in the past seven days,external. Carey sent ""love and congratulations"",externalto Lil Nas X, after hearing her 26-year-old record had been smashed. The rapper, a college dropout from Atlanta, whose real name is Montero Hill, recorded the song last October, using a backing track he bought online for $30 (Â£24.70). With its blend of country music and trap beats, it achieved notoriety on the social media app TikTok, where thousands of people filmed themselves lip-syncing to the song in cowboy boots and ten-gallon hats. By March, he had signed a deal with Columbia Records, and the song gained early press coverage afterBillboard banned it from their country charts, for allegedly failing to ""embrace enough elements of today's country music"". The decision attracted criticism over the conservatism of the country establishment, as well as accusations of racism. Billboard denied that race played any part in its ruling. Allow YouTube content?

Nonetheless, the added attention helped Old Town Road rise up the main charts, eventually hitting number one in April. Its tenure at the top has been extended by the astute tactic of releasing remixes and alternate videos to top up its streaming numbers. The most popular remix features country star Billy Ray Cyrus, while other versions contain cameos from Young Thug and RM of the K-pop band BTS. And while the original video was created using footage from the Wild West video game Red Dead Redemption, the ""official"" clip - released in the seventh week of its chart reign - is a big-budget production featuring cameos from Chris Rock, Diplo, Vince Staples and Rico Nasty. All the different versions of the song are close enough to the original, and so count towards one single total in the US charts. This video can not be played Lil Nas X told BBC Breakfast he felt like he was ""opening doors for more people"" On hearing that he'd toppled the Billboard record, Lil Nas Xposted a long essay,externalexplaining the origins of his song. ""I went looking for beats on YouTube... when suddenly I came across a country-trap-sounding masterpiece,"" he wrote, ""I immediately knew I would make something special out of it. ""I jokingly/seriously saw myself as a loner cowboy, needing to run away from it all. I went out on my sister's porch and listened to the beat over and over. Then it came to me!"" He added: ""This song has changed my life and the way I see the world around me in less than a year. ""I'm so thankful this blessing has been placed upon me."" The rapper also shared a few photos documenting the rise of Old Town Road, including a short video of him andBilly Ray Cyrus,externalin the studio,on his Instagram account,external. During the star's 17 weeks at number one, seven separate songs have peaked at number two - most notably Billie Eilish's Bad Guy, which has spent seven weeks in the  runners-up position. Old Town Road has also clocked up 18 weeks on the UK singles chart,external, two of them in the top spot. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
