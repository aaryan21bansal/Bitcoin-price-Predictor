"This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has defied calls from the public, the army and his own party to resign, vowing to stay in power for several weeks. His televised address on Sunday triggered an avalanche of comments across social media. Responding to another user's comments, constitutional lawyer and human rights activist Tendai Biti argued that Mr Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since 1980, would never quit. Allow Twitter content?

"As the world waits to see what happens next after Robert Mugabe refused to resign despite pressure from the army and the ruling Zanu-PF party, we look at some of the key things you should know about the country and its current situation. Zimbabwe has gone from one economic crisis to another over the last decade. Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary, butthe country's biggest trade union claims the jobless rate was as high as 90% earlier this year,external. Zimbabwe has struggled with hyperinflation, which peaked in 2008 with an official rate of 231 million per cent. The country wasforced to abandon its own currency at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1, adopting the use of foreign cash. Because of a continuing chronic shortage of hard money, the government issued their own version of dollars called bond notes, but they have rapidly lost their value. People with money stored electronically in banks are unable to access it, or are subject to strict limits on what they can withdraw. Because of this, crypto-currencies that are traded online have risen in popularity. Following the news of the military takeover, Bitcoin prices in Harare surged on Wednesday. Zimbabwe crisis in 10 numbers The 93-year-old leader has confounded his critics by staying in power for so long. Sometimes dismissed as a cartoon figure abroad, he was viewed in Zimbabwe, at least originally, as a revolutionary hero who fought against white minority rule, and stillenjoys respect as the ""father of the nation"". But he and his supporters have used violence to keep a tight grip on power, using the machinery of the state to bolster his party and himself. His party says it is fighting capitalism and colonialism, but the country's economic problems have tested even his most ardent supporters. He has often said he would only step down when his ""revolution"" was complete, but also wants to handpick his successor - something that led to the current crisis. Robert Mugabe - Revolutionary hero or the man who wrecked Zimbabwe? Aged 93 and in visible decline, the battle to succeed him intensified in recent months. The ruling party split into two factions - one backing his wife Grace, 40 years his junior, and the other his long-time ally, Emmerson Mnangagwa. When he sacked Mr Mnangagwa, it was obvious that he was backing his wife to take power. She was deeply unpopular, partly because of her love of shopping, which led to her nickname ""Gucci Grace"". Mr Mnangagwa fought in the 1970s war of independence which brought Mr Mugabe to power and retains close ties with many other former comrades, who occupy senior positions across the top of all of Zimbabwe's security forces. So when he was ousted, they intervened on his behalf. Who is Grace Mugabe? If the ousted Mr Mnangagwa does succeed Mr Mugabe as president, he is cut from the same cloth. He has featured prominently in all of the atrocities and attacks on opposition supporters which have been carried out since Mr Mugabe came to power. However, he has hinted that he may introduce some economic reforms, and even work with the opposition in some form of transitional government. Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back The military certainly intervened, however they have not replaced the president - yet. In a statement on television, the military said it had temporarily taken control to ""target criminals"" around the head of state, not Mr Mugabe himself, and still referred to him as ""commander-in-chief"". The army wants a veneer of constitutionality to be preserved, and certainly none of his former comrades wants to arrest him, or worse, as often happens to leaders when the military takes over. The army wants a political process to play out - Mr Mugabe to resign and Zanu-PF to name a new leader. And the military encouraged a public march to increase pressure on him, and show that their actions had the popular support. So far, however, he is refusing to play ball, even though the ruling Zanu-PF party has sacked him as its leader, and so parliament may have to impeach him. However, on Sunday, Mr Mugabe vowed to remain as president until the Zanu-PF congress, due in December, so it is far from clear what happens next.

"This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" Zimbabwe's embattled leader Robert Mugabe has vowed to stay in power for several weeks, despite mounting calls for him to stand down now. In a live TV address, Mr Mugabe said he would preside over the ruling party's congress in December. Zanu-PF earlier sacked him as party leader, and gave him less than 24 hours to resign as president or be impeached. His grip on power has weakened since the military intervened on Wednesday, in a row over who should succeed him. The crisis began when the 93-year-old president sacked his deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, two weeks ago, angering army commanders who saw it as an attempt to position his wife as his successor. Five things about Zimbabwe crisis Zimbabwe's next likely leader Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? Crowds had gathered in Harare to watch the speech, with Mr Mugabe widely expected to resign. Instead though, flanked by military generals, he said ""the [ruling Zanu-PF] party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over its processes"". President Mugabe acknowledged criticism from Zanu-PF, the military and public, and stressed the need to return Zimbabwe to normality. ""Whatever the pros and cons of how they [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns,"" he said, in reference to the army's move last week to take over the state broadcaster. The BBC's Africa Editor, Fergal Keane, said his understanding of the situation was that Mr Mugabe had agreed to resign, but then changed his mind. By Andrew Harding, BBC Southern Africa correspondent In his stumbling, 20-minute address, Robert Mugabe made no mention of the deafening calls, from the public and from his own party, to resign as president. Instead, he declared that the military had done nothing wrong, by seizing power, and placing him under house arrest earlier in the week. The 93-year-old, reading from notes, and often losing his place, then implied he would remain Zimbabwe's leader at least until next month's Zanu-PF congress, ignoring the fact that earlier he was stripped of any official role within the party. He did acknowledge failings, and factionalism in the government and party but made no mention of his wife, Grace, who was expelled from the party. Quite where this leaves the political stalemate here is unclear. Zanu-PF has vowed to impeach Mr Mugabe if he doesn't resign by noon (10:00 GMT) on Monday. Mr Mugabe is clearly playing for time. But Zimbabwe's military leadership is now at odds with the newly purged governing party. Public frustration is growing. And a dangerously unpredictable standoff has now been prolonged. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Mnangagwa was named as Zanu-PF's new leader and candidate for the 2018 general elections. At the same party meeting, Mr Mugabe's 52-year-old wife, Grace, was expelled, alongside a number of other senior officials. After the Mugabes, which African dynasties remain? Zimbabwe in 10 numbers It is not entirely clear how Robert Mugabe can preside over Zanu-PF's congress next month, following his dismissal as party leader. Party positions are officially decided at the congress and Emmerson Mnangagwa may officially take over leading the country then. Mr Mnangagwa, a former state security chief, is nicknamed ""the crocodile"" for his perceived shrewdness. He fled Zimbabwe after his sacking a fortnight ago, but has since reportedly returned. The head of the influential War Veterans Association, which used to back Mr Mugabe but now demands his resignation, told AFP they would call for further protests. ""That speech has nothing to do with realities. We will go for impeachment and we are calling people back to the streets,"" said Chris Mutsvangwa. This video can not be played Zimbabwe reacts: ""We need him to resign... our lives are terrible right now"" Impeaching the president would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of Zimbabwe's parliament, which is due to resume on Tuesday. The opposition MDC-T party has tried unsuccessfully to impeach Mr Mugabe in the past, but this time the ruling party - which has an overwhelming majority in both houses - is likely to go against him. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said he was ""baffled"" by the president's address. ""He's playing a game. He has let the whole nation down,"" he told Reuters news agency. Mr Mugabe has been leader of Zimbabwe for 37 years, having led the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1980.

Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally There is uncertainty over the whereabouts of Emmerson Mnangagwa whose sacking as vice-president triggered the military takeover in Zimbabwe. Several media reports say he returned to Zimbabwe last week having fled the country after he was fired. The263Chat news site,externalis reporting that his handlers are keeping him away from the public to guarantee his security. The site quotes a Zanu-PF official Patrick Chinamasa saying Mr Mnangagwa, who is nicknamed the crocodile, will be seen in public when his security is guaranteed. âWe have mapped a clear road map for the smooth transfer of power and Mnangagwa will come back to assume that leading role. We donât know where his is but he is on his way back,â Mr Chinamasa said. Another party official Obert Mpofu told a media briefing yesterday that Mr Mnangagwa's absence shows he has self control: âHe is a disciplined cadre and has been under attack from negative forces but kept quiet, traits he got from the war. it is that quietness that has bore some good fruits into all this saga"". Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally, 263Chat reports. Read:Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Mr Mugabe defied expectations that he would resign in his TV speech One curious part of Robert Mugabe's speech yesterday was his declaration that he planned to preside over the Zanu-PF congress next month. Zimbabwean constitutional lawyer Alex Magaisa told BBC Focus on Africa that maybe he knew that the process of impeachment could take a long time: People underestimate that old man. He thinks far more than the people dealing with him. He already knows what is coming. He will delay this process as much as possible to ensure it gets to congress.""  We reported earlieron the complex process that lies ahead. Zanu-PF's
representative in the UK has been talking to the BBC, giving some insight into why Robert Mugabe has not resigned yet: As we all know, President Mugabe is a very stubborn man. In his mindset he believes that the British came for him, and he defied them. The Americans tried through sanctions and he defied, the European Union he defied.  So he has defied everybody and he believes his own, as he calls them, boys, would not be able to make him to do what superpowers have failed to do.""  Nick Mangwana was speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World At One: This video can not be played Zanu-PF's UK representative says the case to impeach the President is a 'fait accompli' MPs from Zimbabwe's main opposition party, MDC, will meet to decide on whether to support a push to impeach President Robert Mugabe. The party's chief whip told Reuters news agency that lawmakers will meet on Tuesday to discuss the plan. Reuters reports that the governing Zanu-PF has the requisite two-thirds needed to trigger impeachment, but that opposition support would boost the process of removing Mr Mugabe. People anticipated a resignation One of the key questions today is: Why has Robert Mugabe not resigned as president of Zimbabwe? There is one theory that the plan was for Mr Mugabe to resign in a televised speech last night but there was a last minute change-of-heart. We reported earlier that people are sharing video which they claimappears to show the speech being switched. Two political sources told Reuters news agency that Mr Mugabe had actually agreed to resign but the ruling party Zanu-PF did not want him to quit in front of the military because that would have made its intervention on Wednesday look like a coup. We said earlier that Reuters was reporting that the ex-Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda has been sent to Zimbabwe to convince President Robert Mugabe to resign. So we looked into it. Our colleague talked to Mr Kaunda's son who told her he was next to him watching the events unfold on TV and had not been asked to go to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF has shared its draft impeachment motion with Reuters news agency. The draft motion reportedly says President Robert Mugabe is a ""source of instability"", has shown disrespect for
the rule of law and is to blame for an unprecedented economic
tailspin over the past 15 years. Parliament is expected to debate impeaching Mr Mugabe when it next meets, on Tuesday. Zimbabwe's dollar became worthless under Mr Mugabe's rule An official of the governing Zanu-PF has called on Zimbabweans to join another planned protest against President Robert Mugabe. Nick Mangwana, who heads the party's office in the UK, has shared a poster for Wednesday's planned march.

Despite a show of public defiance against President Mugabe people are still afraid The BBC's Andrew Harding has been speaking to Zimbabweans on the streets of the capital Harare. He reports that there is a feeling of growing frustration after President Robert Mugabe failed to resign last night as had been expected. He says people feel confused and impatient. A taxi driver told him that he had expected Mr Mugabe to leave office last night: He was supposed to be looking after his family... [he should] stay in Singapore, Malaysia where he has assets.""  Others said that despite Saturday's public show of defiance as people rallied to urge President Mugabe to go, they were still afraid. Harare resident Lydia Gombe told our reporter that after years of repressive rule, many Zimbabweans still fear that they might get into trouble if they speak out against the government: The level of fear that these people have instilled in us as a nation is unbelievable. And it is just simple things. WhatsApp texts can get you arrested. A conversation in the bus can get you arrested.""  She adds that it would take time for people to lose their fear of speaking out. The deadline set by the governing Zanu-PF party for President Robert Mugabe to resign has passed without any significant development. As we all wait to see what happens next in Zimbabwe, here's a look back at the extraordinary events of the past week, in this two-minute-long video: This video can not be played We are getting reports in that the governing Zanu-PF party will proceed to discuss the impeachment of President Robert Mugabe after his resignation deadline lapsed. The party's chief whip Lovemore Matuke told Reuters news agency the party's MPs had planned to meet today.

Reuters has a faster estimate - saying that, because of the overwhelming support for the removal of Mr Mugabe, it could take a day. It quotes John Makamure from the Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust saying the move could take 24 hours: ""They can fast-track it. It can be done in a matter of a

"Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, the man known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political cunning, achieved a long-held ambition to succeed Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's president in November last year. He has now won a disputed presidential election to legitimise his rule, promising voters his efforts to woo foreign investors will bring back the economy from the brink of collapse. Mr Mugabe resigned following a military takeover and mass demonstrations - all sparked by his sacking of Mr Mnangagwa as his vice-president. ""The crocodile"", who lived up to his name and snapped back, may have unseated Zimbabwe's only ruler, but he is also associated with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since independence in 1980. One veteran of the liberation struggle, who worked with him for many years, once put it simply: ""He's a very cruel man, very cruel."" But his children see him as a principled, if unemotional, man. His daughter, Farai Mlotshwa - a property developer and the eldest of his nine children by two wives - told BBC Radio 4 that he was a ""softie"". As if to reinforce this softer image of the new leader, a cuddly crocodile soft toy was passed among the Zanu-PF supporters who welcomed him back to the country after Mr Mugabe's resignation. Emmerson Mnangagwa is known as ""Ngwena"", the Shona word for crocodile And what he lacks in charisma and oratory prowess, he makes up for in pragmatism, says close friend and Zanu-PF politician Josiah Hungwe. ""Mnangagwa is a practical person. He is a person who recognises that politics is politics but people must eat,"" he told the BBC, adding that reforming Zimbabwe's disastrous economy will be the focus of his leadership. This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa: Who is the man known as the âcrocodileâ? Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF faction is ""Lacoste"" Received military training in China and Egypt Tortured by Rhodesian forces after his ""crocodile gang"" staged attacks Helped direct Zimbabwe's war of independence in the 1960s and 1970s Became the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed, but has denied any role in the massacres Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election Says he will deliver jobs, and seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on Mugabe supporters Find out more on BBC Radio 4's Profile. The exact year of Mr Mnangagwa's birth is not known - but he is thought to be 75, which would make him nearly 20 years younger than his predecessor who left power aged 93. Born in the central region of Zvishavane, he is a Karanga - the largest clan of Zimbabwe's majority Shona community. Some Karangas felt it was their turn for power, following 37 years of domination by Mr Mugabe's Zezuru clan, though Mr Mnangagwa was accused of profiting while under Mr Mugabe. According to a United Nations report in 2001, he was seen as ""the architect of the commercial activities of Zanu-PF"". This largely related to the operations of the Zimbabwean army and businessmen in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zimbabwean troops intervened in the DR Congo conflict on the side of the government and, like those of other countries, were accused of using the conflict to loot some of its rich natural resources such as diamonds, gold and other minerals. More recently military officials - many behind his rise to power -have been accused of benefiting from the rich Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe, with reports of killings and human rights abuses there. Despite his money-raising role, Mr Mnangagwa, a lawyer who grew up in Zambia, was not always well-loved by the rank and file of his own party. A Zanu-PF official posed an interesting question when asked about Mr Mnangagwa's prospects: ""You think Mugabe is bad, but have you thought that whoever comes after him could be even worse?"" The opposition candidate who defeated Mr Mnangagwa in the 2000 parliamentary campaign in Kwekwe Central, Blessing Chebundo, might agree. During a bitter campaign, Mr Chebundo escaped death by a whisker when the Zanu-PF youths who had abducted him and doused him with petrol were unable to light a match. Those who fought in Zimbabwe's war of independence have long monopolised power Mr Mnangagwa's fearsome reputation was made during the civil war which broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo. As national security minister, he was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu. Thousands of civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed in a campaign known as Gukurahundi, before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF. Among countless other atrocities carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade of the army, villagers were forced at gunpoint to dance on the freshly dug graves of their relatives and chant pro-Mugabe slogans. Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres, but the wounds are still painful and many party officials, not to mention voters, in Matabeleland might find it hard to back Mr Mnangagwa. He does enjoy the support of many of the war veterans who led the campaign of violence against the white farmers and the opposition from 2000. They remember him as one of the men who, following his military training in China and Egypt, directed the fight for independence in the 1960s and 1970s. He also attended the Beijing School of Ideology, run by the Chinese Communist Party. Mr Mnangagwa's official profile says he was the victim of state violence after being arrested by the white-minority government in the former Rhodesia in 1965, when the ""crocodile gang"" he led helped blow up a train near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo). ""He was tortured, severely resulting in him losing his sense of hearing in one ear,"" the profile says. ""Part of the torture techniques involved being hanged with his feet on the ceiling and the head down. The severity of the torture made him unconscious for days."" As he said he was under 21 at the time, he was not executed but instead sentenced to 10 years in prison. ""He has scars from that period. He was young and brave,"" a close friend of Mr Mnangagwa once said, asking not to be named. ""Perhaps that explains why he is indifferent. Horrible things happened to him when he was young."" Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return Snapping at the heels of Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' The age factor His ruthlessness, which it could be argued he learnt from his Rhodesian torturers, is said to have been seen again in 2008 when he reportedly masterminded Zanu-PF's response to Mr Mugabe losing the first round of the president election to long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. The military and state security organisations unleashed a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands from their homes. Mr Tsvangirai then pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe was re-elected. Mr Mnangagwa has not commented on allegations he was involved in planning the violence, but an insider in the party's security department later confirmed that he was the political link between the army, intelligence and Zanu-PF. He was seen as Mr Mugabe's right-hand man - that is until the former first lady Grace Mugabe became politically ambitious and tried to edge him out. Their rivalry took a bizarre turn when he fell ill in August 2017 at a political rally led by former President Mugabe and had to be airlifted to South Africa. Grace Mugabe (right) bit off more than she could chew by taking on Mr Mnangagwa His supporters suggested that a rival group within Zanu-PF had poisoned him and appeared to blame ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy firm. In his first words to cheering supporters after Mr Mugabe's resignation, he spoke about this plot and another plan to ""eliminate"" him. He has also blamed a group linked to the former first lady for an explosion in June at a Zanu-PF rally in Bulawayo in which two people died. But in a BBC interview, he said the country was safe, told foreign investors not to worry and sought to dispel his ruthless reputation: ""I am as soft as wool. I am a very soft person in life."" This video can not be played Mnangagwa: Criminal will be hounded down, but Zimbabwe is safe His youngest son, a Harare DJ known as St Emmo, blames his reticence for his fearsome reputation. ""He was a good father, very very strict. He doesn't say much and I think that's what frightens people - like: 'What is he thinking?'"" Nick Mangwana, Zanu-PF representative in the UK, accepts that the Zimbabwe's new leader is ""not the most eloquent"". ""He's not pally-pally but more of a do-er, more of a technocrat."" But in his six months in power he has fully embraced Twitter and Facebook - after the Bulawayo blast he posted a message reiterating the strength his Christian faith gives him.

"The army is upset about recent purges in the ruling party The military in Zimbabwe has taken control of the country, putting veteran President Robert Mugabe under house arrest and announcing it was targeting ""criminals"" around him. It has denied it is staging a coup, while Mr Mugabe, 93, has been pictured smiling beside army chiefs and left the house for a scheduled appearance on Friday. However on Sunday,Mr Mugabe was removed as the leader of Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF partyand ex-vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa, who had been fired by Mr Mugabe two weeks before, was appointed in his place. Military officials had feared Mr Mugabe was planning to install his wife, Grace, as his successor. So what does this mean for Mr Mugabe and the country he has led since independence in 1980? Here is what we know. Do you have a question about the situation in Zimbabwe?haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Military vehicles were spotted on roads leading to Harare on Tuesday, sparking rumours that something was afoot. Later, soldiers seized the headquarters of Zimbabwe's national broadcaster ZBC and explosions and gunfire were heard. Maj-Gen Sibusiso Moyo then read out a statement on national television, assuring the nation that President Mugabe and his family were safe. This video can not be played Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo read out a statement on national TV early on Wednesday The military was only targeting what he called ""criminals"" around the president, he said, denying that there had been a coup. ""As soon as we have accomplished our mission we expect that the situation will return to normalcy,"" he added. President Mugabe was being held at his home and was ""fine"", according to a statement by South Africa's President Jacob Zuma, who spoke to him on Wednesday. On Thursday,he was pictured taking part in talks with Gen Constantino Chiwengaand South African government ministers at State House. The South African envoy has been trying to help the two sides reach a deal on Mr Mugabe's future, but sources suggest he may be resisting pressure to resign. On Friday, the president gave out degrees at a university of which he is chancellor, thereby meeting a prior commitment. The military said on Friday that they had detained some ""criminals"", but they did not give names. On Saturday, tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets of Harare to urge Mr Mugabe to go. It was led by veterans of the country's war of independence, who last year turned against him. ""There's no going back about Mugabe,"" said veterans leader Christopher Mutsvangwa. ""He must leave."" On Sunday, Zanu-PF sacked Mr Mugabe as its leader. Meanwhile main opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who has been receiving cancer treatment in South Africa, returned to Zimbabwe amid suggestions that his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) could form part of a possible transitional government. There has not been any official government response to events. Nor have we heard directly from President Mugabe or his wife Grace which, according to analysts, suggests they have lost control. When Mr Mugabe spoke at the university on Friday, he did not make any political comment. And there are no reports of any members of the security forces who remain loyal to Mr Mugabe intervening to defend him. Zimbabwe takeover: Five things you should know SA delegation tries to find resolution This is all about the leadership succession, as Mr Mugabe's powers finally falter. The people who fought in the 1970s guerrilla war against white minority rule still dominate Zimbabwe's government, and especially its security forces, and they are worried about losing that power, and the wealth it generates. Last week, the army chief Gen Chiwenga warned the military could intervene to halt purges of the governing Zanu-PF that were ""clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background"". This video can not be played Who is Grace Mugabe? This was obviously a reference to the sacking last week of Mr Mnangagwa, Mr Mugabe's once loyal deputy and a former defence minister, spy chief and veteran of the war of independence. Mrs Mugabe's supporters are known as ""Generation 40"" or ""G40"" - a name which signals a changing of the guard in Zimbabwe, at least partially, 37 years after independence. So this military action is the old guard reasserting its authority. Mr Mugabe was the political leader of the guerrilla war so the army has always professed loyalty to him, until he explicitly came out in favour of his wife taking over from him. The rise of Grace Mugabe Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Most observers think so. The army's denial it was carrying out a coup has been mocked on social media. The BBC's southern Africa correspondent Andrew Harding called the move an ""extraordinary gamble"". He sees it as an internal power struggle within Zanu-PF ""and whoever emerges victorious can expect a newly purged party to fall obediently into line"". He says it is important to remember that Mr Mugabe is not being challenged by Western governments, or by Zimbabwe's political opposition, or by a mass uprising against economic hardship. How can you tell a coup is happening? There appears to have been no dramatic effect on normal life. People say shops have opened as normal. The military thanked the public ""for remaining patient and peaceful as they carry out the operation"". Some Zimbabweans told the BBC that they welcomed the news, with one man expressing his thanks to the army for ""taking out the tyrant"". This video can not be played Zimbabweans react to the news that troops had taken control One resident of Harare though told the Press Association: ""I don't think I see how anything could possibly be different. If we wanted to see any change we would have to assassinate about 5,000 people all feeding from the same trough."" The head of the key regional bloc the African Union, Guinea's president Alpha Conde, said that the crisis ""seems like coup"". He said the AU demanded that ""constitutional order be restored immediately"". In his statement, South Africa's President Zuma said that he was sending a delegation to Zimbabwe to meet President Mugabe and the Zimbabwean Defence Force. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has urged ""respect for the constitution"", and said every attempt should be made to save the country from ""political instability"". The leaders of Botswana and the Ivory Coast called on Mr Mugabe to leave his post, both focusing on his age and the amount of time he had been president. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called for a ""quick return to civilian rule"" and the UK - Zimbabwe's former colonial ruler - said it hoped elections scheduled for 2018 would take place as planned.

"With Robert Mugabe's hopes of handing power to his wife in Zimbabwe over, which political dynasties are still going strong elsewhere in Africa? Since the 1990s, multi-party elections and peaceful transfers of power have become far more common on the continent but quite a few current leaders have succeeded their fathers, or are planning to hand power to their sons. (Daughters seem to be less favoured.) Some dynasties have established themselves through assassinations, coups, and rebellions, while in Zimbabwe's neighbour, South Africa, President Jacob Zuma is hoping to hand power to his ex-wife in the coming years. Most Togolese have lived under only one family's rule A former French colony, it has been ruled by the Eyadema family for the last 50 years, making it the dynasty that has been in power for the longest period. And of all the governments currently in power in Africa, it is under the greatest threat of being overthrown in a mass uprising. Crowds of up to 800,000 have repeatedly taken to the streets since August, demanding an end to dynastic rule in the country of 6.6 million. Protesters accuse the government of tinkering with the constitution so that President Faure GnassingbÃ© can remain in power until 2030. The government denies this, insisting that it will introduce a two-term presidential limit ahead of elections in 2020. With the backing of the military, Mr GnassingbÃ© became president in 2005 after the unexpected death of his father, GnassingbÃ© Eyadema, at the age of 69. Later, he won two elections, which were denounced by the opposition  as a sham. Faure has shared, or has tried to share, the spoils of power with his family. He appointed his half-brother, Kpatcha, to the all-important post of defence minster after taking office. However, the two fell-out, and Kpatcha was sacked as defence minister in 2007. Voters have returned President Faure GnassingbÃ© to power in two elections Faure accused him of trying to dethrone him. Kpatcha, in turn, accused the president of plotting to assassinate him. Faure won the power-struggle, had his half-brother arrested, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. But his reputation for ruthlessness is nothing compared to that of his late father. As a 28-year-old army sergeant, Eyadema was widely suspected to have fired the shots which killed Togo's first post-independence president.  Then, on 13 January 1967, the third anniversary of the assassination, Eyadema himself seized power in a bloodless coup. When he died, he held the title of Africa's longest-serving ruler. He had been on the political throne for 38 years. Gabon's ruler Ali Bongo Ondimba (R) hosted football star Lionel Messi in 2015 Also a former French colony, it has Africa's second oldest political dynasty. A Christian convert to Islam, Omar Bongo took power 11 months after Eyadema, and ruled for nearly 42 years until his death in 2009. He left his son Ali Bongo Ondimba, a fortune worth millions of dollars, and the country. He did win an election, although the opposition said it was rigged. After France launched a corruption investigation against the family, the president of the oil-rich nation announced in 2015 that he would spend his entire inheritance on development projects, including starting a university and a youth foundation. French police investigations identified that Bongo family assets included 39 properties in France, located in affluent areas of Paris and on the French Riviera, as well as nine luxury cars, including Ferraris and Mercedes. Rights groups say the Bongos have turned Gabon into a ""kleptocratic regime"", which loots its natural resources, oil wealth and rainforests - an allegation the family strongly denies. In 2015 Argentinean football star Lionel Messi came under heavy criticism for visiting the Central African state. He laid the first stone at the construction site of a football stadium for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. Bongo denied giving Messi money to visit Gabon, saying: ""When I was in Barcelona a few years ago, I met Messi who had told me that he would come to visit me in Libreville,"" he said. ""It's a promise he made me. He is a man of honour who just kept his word."" The president's son, Teodorin Obiang, has been convicted of embezzlement in France A former Spanish colony, it currently has Africa's longest-serving ruler, Theodoro Obiang Nguema. Said to be one of Africa's most brutal leaders, he seized power in 1979 after overthrowing independence leader President Francisco Macias Nguema, his uncle, and having him executed. According to campaign group Human Rights Watch, the ''dictatorship under President Obiang has used an oil boom to entrench and enrich itself further at the expense of the country's people''. The president's 48-year-old son, Teodorin Obiang, is his deputy, putting him in pole position to inherit power. Known for his flamboyant lifestyle, Teodorin is a fugitive from justice. In October, a French court convicted him in absentia of embezzlement. It ordered the seizure of his assets in France, including a $29m (Â£22m) mansion. He also boasted 18 luxury cars in France, artworks, jewellery and expensive designer fashions, The Paris judge found that the president's son had used his position as agriculture and forestry minister to siphon off payments from timber firms who were exporting from Equatorial Guinea. In November, Swiss prosecutors seized 11 luxury cars belonging to Mr Obiang junior. They said he had plundered his country's oil wealth to buy luxuries, including a private jet and Michael Jackson memorabilia. Teodorin denies all allegations of wrongdoing. President Yoweri Museveni is accused of wanting to be life president A former British colony, it is ruled by ex-rebel leader Yoweri Museveni. He seized power in 1986, won a fifth term in 2016, may run for a sixth term and could eventually hand power to his son. In January, the speculation gained impetus when Mr Museveni promoted Maj Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, his eldest son, to become a special presidential adviser in a reshuffle of army commanders. Having graduated from British Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 2000, Maj Gen Kainerugaba rose rapidly within the military. Last year, he was promoted from brigadier to major general. Others believe that Mrs Museveni's wife also harbours presidential ambitions. Having served in government since 2009, she is currently the minister of education and sports in her husband's cabinet. For now though, there is a push to give Mr Museveni, 76, another term. Uganda's ruling party wants parliament to scrap the presidential age limit of 75, a move that could allow Mr Museveni to stand for re-election in 2021. It has led to ruling and opposition MPs brawling in parliament, as emotions rise over the plan. The move has not come as a surprise. In 2013, renegade army General David Sejusa accused Mr Museveni of ""playing God"" in Uganda. ""The central issue is a political monarchy - a life presidency and then transiting [to] a political monarchy,"" he said. ""It is a terribly common African story. There is nothing strange about it,"" the renegade general added at the time. After just four years in power, Laurent Kabila handed power to his son A former Belgian colony, the Democratic Republic of Congo has been ruled by the Kabila family since 1997, when Laurent Kabila stormed the capital, Kinshasa, with the backing of regional armies, ending the 32-year rule of Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila was assassinated in 2001 by his bodyguards, resulting in the military installing his son, Joseph, as president. After serving two elected terms, Joseph was supposed to step down in 2016 as the constitution bars the president from running for a third term. However, the electoral commission says it will be ready to hold an election only next year, leaving Mr Kabila in power until then, despite massive opposition protests and international condemnation. His sister, Jaynet, and brother, Zoe, are MPs, The family has built a huge business empire, with a stake in banks, farms, airline operators, a road builder, hotels, a pharmaceutical supplier, travel agencies, boutiques and nightclubs, according to Bloomberg news agency. South African President Jacob Zuma (L) is backing his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (C), over his deputy, Cyril Rampahosa (R) A beacon of hope in Africa during anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela's rule, it could be the next African country to have a dynastic succession, of sorts. Its polygamous President Jacob Zuma is campaigning for his ex-wife, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, to succeed him as leader of the governing African National Congress (ANC) at its conference next month, and as president in 2019. Ms Dlamini-Zuma deeply resents being described as President Zuma's ex-wife, and has complained about such headlines. She insists that she is a politician in her own right who took part in the anti-apartheid struggle, served in various ministerial posts since the advent of democracy in 1994, and became the chairwoman of the African Union (AU) commission before joining the presidential race. Her critics say this may well be the case, but Mr Zuma has chosen her as his political heir because she is unlikely to put him - the father of their children - in jail. Mr Zuma has been accused of widespread corruption, with the Supreme Court of Appeal ruling that he should be tried on 18 counts of corruption, racketeering, money laundering and bribery - all of which he denies. His critics say he also needs his ex-wife in power so that his favourite son from another wife, Duduzane Zuma, is safe from prosecution. Critics allege that he is abusing his relationship with his father to win government contracts for himself, and his business partners, the wealthy Gupta family. They all deny the allegations, insisting that they are not corrupt. Ms Dlamini-Zuma's main challenger is Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a former business tycoon and trade unionist. His supporters are hoping that the Zimbabwean crisis will boost his chances of winning, as ANC members grasp the dangers of a dynastic rule.

"Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe resigned last year after almost four decades in power. Now, the country is approaching its first post-Mugabe election, with his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa and MDC Alliance candidate Nelson Chamisa the two front-runners in a field of 23 candidates. Here are 10 numbers that will help you understand how the country got to where it is now. Robert Mugabe, who led the country's liberation movement, was in power from independence in 1980 until he was ousted in November last year at the age of 93. His years in office, first as prime minister until the switch to a presidential system in 1987, were marked by economic turmoil and the crushing of dissent. Both Robert Mugabe (L) and Emmerson Mnangagwa (R) are from the ruling Zanu-PF party Emmerson Mnangagwa is his successor - nicknamed the ""crocodile"" because of political cunning. Once a Mugabe loyalist, he promises to revive the shattered economy and hopes to win elections on 30 July to legitimise his presidency. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? The 'crocodile' who snapped back Zimbabwe's political crusader Zimbabwe's economy has struggled since a controversial land reform programme was introduced in 2000. The programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless black Zimbabweans - and those with good political connections - led to sharp falls in production. As the country's central bank printed money to try to get out of the crisis, rampant inflation took hold. Although the World Bank does not have figures for 2008 and 2009, numbers from Zimbabwe's central bank showed annual inflation reached 231 million % in July 2008. Officials gave up reporting monthly statistics when it peaked at just under 80 billion % in mid-November 2008. The country was forced to abandon its own currency a year later at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1. More on post-Mugabe Zimbabwe: The political crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The political and economic crises between 2000 and 2008 nearly halved Zimbabwe's GDP -the biggest contraction in a peacetime economy, according to the World Bank.,external A brief period of recovery between 2009 and 2012 has now faltered and the economy faces serious challenges, says the World Bank. Growth has slowed sharply from an average 8% from 2009 to 2012, caused by shifts in trade and a series of major droughts. Mr Mugabe always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return The country's political and economic crises have resulted in high poverty rates. The hard years between 2000 and 2008 saw poverty rates increase tomore than 72%, according to the World Bank.,externalIt also left a fifth of the population in extreme poverty. Extreme poverty, estimated to have fallen from 2009 to 2014, is now projected to have risen again substantially. About 27% of children under the age of five suffer stunted growth, with 9% severely stunted because of poor nutrition, the2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey report revealed.,external But poverty in Zimbabwe is still lower than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, where about41% of the population were living on less than $1.90 a day,externalin 2013, World Bank data suggests. Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary wildly. The World Bank's modelled estimates, based on International Labour Organisation data, puts the figureas low as 5% in 2016,external, while Zimbabwe's biggest trade union claimedthe jobless rate was as high as 90% last year.,external Many people try to make a living by vending as they cannot find employment However, the World Bank's definition only covers those actively seeking work. Many of those not counted may not seek a job despite wanting one because they ""view job opportunities as limited, or because they have restricted labour mobility, or face discrimination, or structural, social or cultural barriers"". The CIA World Factbook estimates the rate was95% in 2009, but says current figures are not known.,external Thanks to large investments in education since independence, Zimbabwe has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa, with89% of the adult population literate,external, according to World Bank data from 2014. Globally, the literacy rate stood at 86% in 2016, while in sub-Saharan Africa it was 64%. Almost all women and men aged 15-49 have had at least some primary education,according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.,externalMore than 70% of people aged 15-49 have also attended secondary school. Zimbabwe has the sixth highest HIV prevalence rate in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.3 million people living with HIV in 2016,according to UNAids.,external However, after a peak in 1997, rates are declining. According to the UN, this is a result of successful campaigns encouraging condom use as well as programmes preventing the transmission of infection from mother to child. Treatment and support services have also improved. Making decent burials affordable Life expectancy fell in the 1990s, with the HIV/Aids epidemic a major killer. It dropped from a high of just under 61 years in 1986 to 44.1 years in 2003. It is now steadily improving again, but with unemployment and poverty endemic and HIV/Aids rates still high, it remained at just 60 in 2015, according to World Bank data. Will age be a factor in Zimbabwe's poll? Mobile devices are the leading communication tool for Zimbabweans. But while most have a mobile phone, only 43% of households have a radio, 37% have a television and 10% have a computer,according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.,external After a growth spurt after independence in 1980, a decline in birth rates and a rise in death rates saw population growth slide downwards. With high outward migration rates also high, the population has not recovered its post-independence growth. Written and produced by Lucy Rodgers. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain?

"Schoolchildren formed this mosaic of Robert Mugabe at independence day celebrations in April President Robert Mugabe's non-resignation speech will have puzzled many - why didn't the army just force him to resign at the barrel of a gun, or arrest him? It tells us two things. Firstly, this was political theatre. Everyone involved is desperate to preserve a veneer of constitutionality about the whole process, so they want him to step down and hand power to his successor, presumablyEmmerson Mnangagwa. But it was also more than spectacle. President Mugabe's opponents want to treat the elder statesman with dignity. This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" As in much of Africa, respecting your elders is ingrained in Zimbabwe's culture. And 93-year-old Robert Mugabe, a liberation fighter who became the country's leader at independence in 1980, is seen as the father of the nation. It explains the respectful tone used by opposition leader and bitter rival Morgan Tsvangirai when calling for President Mugabe's resignation. He said Mr Mugabe should step down ""in line with the national expectation and sentiment, taking full regard of his legacy and contribution to Zimbabwe pre and post-independence"". By Kim Chakanetsa, BBC Focus on Africa There is a great weight placed on respecting your elders in Shona culture, which is Zimbabwe's biggest ethnic group.  It is one of the fundamental values. At a young age you are taught to greet, speak and interact with elders in a particular manner. For example, when arriving at someone's house, an exchange of greetings will be led by the younger party, who must enquire about the health of every adult present. For girls or women, this could involve kneeling and clapping, then asking each individual in turn about their health. Boys and men will do much the same, but crouching. Failing to do so is frowned upon, and taken as a sign of a poor upbringing or lack of respect. Within the household, grandparents wield considerable influence. This reverence for elders extends beyond your family. Any older woman or man is to be treated in the same way. President Mugabe still commands the respect of the army leadership because of his liberation war credentials in the fight against white-minority rule in the 1960s and 1970s. His government's early achievements in improving access to healthcare and raising literacy rates were feted in the 1980s. But in recent years the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy, the violent crackdowns on political opposition and raids on white-owned farms have severely damaged Mr Mugabe's reputation. This is especially true in the international community, where some see him as nothing more than a despot. But while Zimbabweans have been the ones to suffer first-hand, many still feel a lingering respect for the man who delivered them independence.

"This video can not be played Mugabe: From war hero to resignation Robert Mugabe, the man who became synonymous with Zimbabwe, has resigned as president after 37 years in power. For some, he will always remain a hero who brought independence and an end to white-minority rule. Even those who forced him out blamed his wife and ""criminals"" around him. But to his growing number of critics, this highly educated, wily politician became the caricature of an African dictator, who destroyed an entire country in order to keep his job. In the end, it was the security forces, who had been instrumental in intimidating the opposition and keeping him in power, who made him go. They were incensed when he sacked his long-time ally, Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, paving the way for his much younger wife Grace to succeed him, fearing it meant the end for them as the powers behind the throne. He had survived numerous previous crises and predictions of his demise but with his powers failing at the age of 93, his former comrades-in-arms turned on him, favouring Mr Mnangagwa. Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Before the 2008 elections, Mr Mugabe said: ""If you lose an election and are rejected by the people, it is time to leave politics."" But after coming second to Morgan Tsvangirai, Mr Mugabe displayed more characteristic defiance, swearing that ""only God"" could remove him from office. And just to be sure, violence was unleashed to preserve his grip on power. In order to save the lives of his supporters, Mr Tsvangirai pulled out of the second round and although Mr Mugabe was forced to share power with his long-time rival for four years, he remained president. He even won another election, in 2013, as Mr Tsvangirai had lost a lot of credibility during his years working with Mr Mugabe. The key to understanding Mr Mugabe is the 1970s guerrilla war where he made his name. President Mugabe (L) has given his support to his wife Grace (R) for the vice-presidency 1924:Born Later trained as a teacher 1964:Imprisoned by Rhodesian government 1980:Wins post-independence elections 1996:Marries Grace Marufu 2000:Loses referendum, pro-Mugabe militias invade white-owned farms and attack opposition supporters 2008:Comes second in first round of elections to Tsvangirai who pulls out of run-off amid nationwide attacks on his supporters 2009:Amid economic collapse, swears in Tsvangirai as prime minister, who served in uneasy government of national unity for four years 2017:Sacks long-time ally Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa, paving the way for his wife Grace to succeed him. Army intervenes and forces him to step down Grace Mugabe profile: Who is Zimbabwe's first lady? Zimbabwe under Mugabe - in 10 numbers Even after 37 years in power, Mr  Mugabe still maintained the same worldview - the patriotic socialist forces of his Zanu-PF party were still fighting the twin evils of capitalism and colonialism. Any critics were dismissed as ""traitors and sell-outs"" - a throwback to the guerrilla war, when such labels could be a death sentence. Robert Mugabe (L), seen here in 1960, was greatly influenced by pan-Africanist ideals He always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. His critics firmly blamed him, saying he had no understanding of how a modern economy worked. He always concentrated on the question of how to share out the national cake, rather than how to make it grow. Protesters in 2016 burn worthless currency in a show of defiance against the introduction of new bond notes Mr Mugabe once famously said that a country could never go bankrupt - with the world's fastest-shrinking economy and annual inflation of 231 million per cent in July 2008, it seemed as though he was determined to test his theory to the limit. Professor Tony Hawkins of the University of Zimbabwe once observed that with Zimbabwe's former leader: ""Whenever economics gets in the way of politics, politics wins every time."" In 2000, faced with a strong opposition for the first time, he wrecked what was one of Africa's most diversified economies in a bid to retain political control. He seized the white-owned farms which were the economy's backbone and scared off donors but in purely political terms, Mr Mugabe outsmarted his enemies - he remained in power for another 17 years. And the tactics he and his supporters used were straight from the guerrilla war. After he suffered the first electoral defeat of his career, in a 2000 referendum, Mr Mugabe unleashed his personal militia - the self-styled war veterans, backed by the security forces - who used violence and murder as an electoral strategy. Mr Mugabe says he is fighting for the rights of black Zimbabweans Eight years later, a similar pattern was followed after Mr Mugabe lost the first round of a presidential election to his long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. When needed, all the levers of state - the security forces, civil service, state-owned media - which are mostly controlled by Zanu-PF, were used in the service of the ruling party. The man who fought for one-man, one-vote introduced a requirement that potential voters prove their residence with utility bills, which the young, unemployed opposition core electorate were unlikely to have. In fact, the signs of his attitude to opposition were there from the early 1980s, when members of the North-Korea trained Fifth Brigade of the army were sent to Matabeleland, home to his then rival, Joshua Nkomo. Thousands of civilians were killed before Mr Nkomo agreed to share power with Mr Mugabe - a precursor of what happened with Mr Tsvangirai. One of the undoubted achievements of the former teacher's 33 years in power was the expansion of education. Zimbabwe still has one of the highest literacy rates in Africa, at 89% of the population. The now deceased political scientist Masipula Sithole once said that by expanding education, the president was ""digging his own grave"". Mr Mugabe has not been afraid to use violence to stay in power The young beneficiaries were able to analyse Zimbabwe's problems for themselves and most blamed government corruption and mismanagement for the lack of jobs and rising prices. He often claimed to be fighting on behalf of the rural poor but much of the land he confiscated ended up in the hands of his cronies. Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said that Zimbabwe's long-time president had become a cartoon figure of the archetypal African dictator. During the 2002 presidential campaign, he started wearing brightly coloured shirts emblazoned with his face - a style copied from many of Africa's authoritarian rulers. For the preceding 20 years, this conservative man was only seen in public with either a stiff suit and tie or safari suit. Robert Mugabe celebrated his 93rd birthday earlier this year He professes to be a staunch Catholic, and worshippers at Harare's Catholic Cathedral were occasionally swamped by security guards when he turned up for Sunday Mass. However, Mr Mugabe's beliefs did not prevent him from having two children by Grace, then his secretary, while his popular Ghanaian first wife, Sally, was dying from cancer. But it was his second wife Grace, 40 years his junior, who ultimately proved his downfall. Although Mr Mugabe outlived many predictions of his demise, the increasing strain of recent years took its toll and his once-impeccable presentation has begun to look rather worn at times. In 2011, a US diplomatic cable released byWikileaks suggested that he was suffering from prostate cancer,external. Wife Grace said Mr Mugabe woke at 05:00 for his exercise But he certainly led a healthy lifestyle. Grace once said that he woke up at 05:00 for his daily exercises, including yoga. He did not drink alcohol or coffee and was largely vegetarian. Mr Mugabe was 73 when she gave birth to their third child, Chatunga. If nothing else, Mr Mugabe has always been an extremely proud man. He often said he would only step down when his ""revolution"" was complete. He was referring to the redistribution of white-owned land but he also wanted to hand-pick his successor, who would of course have had to come from the ranks of Zanu-PF. Didymus Mutasa, once one of Mr Mugabe's closest associates but who has since fallen out with him, once told the BBC that in Zimbabwean culture, kings were only replaced when they die ""and Mugabe is our king"". But even his closest allies were not ready for Zimbabwe to be turned into a monarchy, with power retained by a single family.

"Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, the man known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political cunning, achieved a long-held ambition to succeed Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's president in November last year. He has now won a disputed presidential election to legitimise his rule, promising voters his efforts to woo foreign investors will bring back the economy from the brink of collapse. Mr Mugabe resigned following a military takeover and mass demonstrations - all sparked by his sacking of Mr Mnangagwa as his vice-president. ""The crocodile"", who lived up to his name and snapped back, may have unseated Zimbabwe's only ruler, but he is also associated with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since independence in 1980. One veteran of the liberation struggle, who worked with him for many years, once put it simply: ""He's a very cruel man, very cruel."" But his children see him as a principled, if unemotional, man. His daughter, Farai Mlotshwa - a property developer and the eldest of his nine children by two wives - told BBC Radio 4 that he was a ""softie"". As if to reinforce this softer image of the new leader, a cuddly crocodile soft toy was passed among the Zanu-PF supporters who welcomed him back to the country after Mr Mugabe's resignation. Emmerson Mnangagwa is known as ""Ngwena"", the Shona word for crocodile And what he lacks in charisma and oratory prowess, he makes up for in pragmatism, says close friend and Zanu-PF politician Josiah Hungwe. ""Mnangagwa is a practical person. He is a person who recognises that politics is politics but people must eat,"" he told the BBC, adding that reforming Zimbabwe's disastrous economy will be the focus of his leadership. This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa: Who is the man known as the âcrocodileâ? Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF faction is ""Lacoste"" Received military training in China and Egypt Tortured by Rhodesian forces after his ""crocodile gang"" staged attacks Helped direct Zimbabwe's war of independence in the 1960s and 1970s Became the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed, but has denied any role in the massacres Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election Says he will deliver jobs, and seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on Mugabe supporters Find out more on BBC Radio 4's Profile. The exact year of Mr Mnangagwa's birth is not known - but he is thought to be 75, which would make him nearly 20 years younger than his predecessor who left power aged 93. Born in the central region of Zvishavane, he is a Karanga - the largest clan of Zimbabwe's majority Shona community. Some Karangas felt it was their turn for power, following 37 years of domination by Mr Mugabe's Zezuru clan, though Mr Mnangagwa was accused of profiting while under Mr Mugabe. According to a United Nations report in 2001, he was seen as ""the architect of the commercial activities of Zanu-PF"". This largely related to the operations of the Zimbabwean army and businessmen in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zimbabwean troops intervened in the DR Congo conflict on the side of the government and, like those of other countries, were accused of using the conflict to loot some of its rich natural resources such as diamonds, gold and other minerals. More recently military officials - many behind his rise to power -have been accused of benefiting from the rich Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe, with reports of killings and human rights abuses there. Despite his money-raising role, Mr Mnangagwa, a lawyer who grew up in Zambia, was not always well-loved by the rank and file of his own party. A Zanu-PF official posed an interesting question when asked about Mr Mnangagwa's prospects: ""You think Mugabe is bad, but have you thought that whoever comes after him could be even worse?"" The opposition candidate who defeated Mr Mnangagwa in the 2000 parliamentary campaign in Kwekwe Central, Blessing Chebundo, might agree. During a bitter campaign, Mr Chebundo escaped death by a whisker when the Zanu-PF youths who had abducted him and doused him with petrol were unable to light a match. Those who fought in Zimbabwe's war of independence have long monopolised power Mr Mnangagwa's fearsome reputation was made during the civil war which broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo. As national security minister, he was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu. Thousands of civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed in a campaign known as Gukurahundi, before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF. Among countless other atrocities carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade of the army, villagers were forced at gunpoint to dance on the freshly dug graves of their relatives and chant pro-Mugabe slogans. Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres, but the wounds are still painful and many party officials, not to mention voters, in Matabeleland might find it hard to back Mr Mnangagwa. He does enjoy the support of many of the war veterans who led the campaign of violence against the white farmers and the opposition from 2000. They remember him as one of the men who, following his military training in China and Egypt, directed the fight for independence in the 1960s and 1970s. He also attended the Beijing School of Ideology, run by the Chinese Communist Party. Mr Mnangagwa's official profile says he was the victim of state violence after being arrested by the white-minority government in the former Rhodesia in 1965, when the ""crocodile gang"" he led helped blow up a train near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo). ""He was tortured, severely resulting in him losing his sense of hearing in one ear,"" the profile says. ""Part of the torture techniques involved being hanged with his feet on the ceiling and the head down. The severity of the torture made him unconscious for days."" As he said he was under 21 at the time, he was not executed but instead sentenced to 10 years in prison. ""He has scars from that period. He was young and brave,"" a close friend of Mr Mnangagwa once said, asking not to be named. ""Perhaps that explains why he is indifferent. Horrible things happened to him when he was young."" Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return Snapping at the heels of Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' The age factor His ruthlessness, which it could be argued he learnt from his Rhodesian torturers, is said to have been seen again in 2008 when he reportedly masterminded Zanu-PF's response to Mr Mugabe losing the first round of the president election to long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. The military and state security organisations unleashed a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands from their homes. Mr Tsvangirai then pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe was re-elected. Mr Mnangagwa has not commented on allegations he was involved in planning the violence, but an insider in the party's security department later confirmed that he was the political link between the army, intelligence and Zanu-PF. He was seen as Mr Mugabe's right-hand man - that is until the former first lady Grace Mugabe became politically ambitious and tried to edge him out. Their rivalry took a bizarre turn when he fell ill in August 2017 at a political rally led by former President Mugabe and had to be airlifted to South Africa. Grace Mugabe (right) bit off more than she could chew by taking on Mr Mnangagwa His supporters suggested that a rival group within Zanu-PF had poisoned him and appeared to blame ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy firm. In his first words to cheering supporters after Mr Mugabe's resignation, he spoke about this plot and another plan to ""eliminate"" him. He has also blamed a group linked to the former first lady for an explosion in June at a Zanu-PF rally in Bulawayo in which two people died. But in a BBC interview, he said the country was safe, told foreign investors not to worry and sought to dispel his ruthless reputation: ""I am as soft as wool. I am a very soft person in life."" This video can not be played Mnangagwa: Criminal will be hounded down, but Zimbabwe is safe His youngest son, a Harare DJ known as St Emmo, blames his reticence for his fearsome reputation. ""He was a good father, very very strict. He doesn't say much and I think that's what frightens people - like: 'What is he thinking?'"" Nick Mangwana, Zanu-PF representative in the UK, accepts that the Zimbabwe's new leader is ""not the most eloquent"". ""He's not pally-pally but more of a do-er, more of a technocrat."" But in his six months in power he has fully embraced Twitter and Facebook - after the Bulawayo blast he posted a message reiterating the strength his Christian faith gives him.

"Winston Churchill described the royal couple's wedding in 1947 as 'a flash of colour on the hard road we travel' Three more portraits of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been released to commemorate their platinum wedding anniversary. On Monday it will be 70 years since their marriage at Westminster Abbey. The church's bells will ring for more than three hours to mark the occasion. The couple will celebrate at a private dinner in Windsor Castle. Queen Elizabeth is the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary. The images are part of a seriesby celebrity photographer Matt Holyoak, whose first portrait of them was revealed on Saturday. The Queen wears a cream dress designed by Angela Kelly, her dressmaker for the last 15 years. Her golden ""Scarab"" brooch was a gift from Prince Philip in 1966. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are the first royal couple to celebrate the milestone When they married, the monarch was 21 and the Duke a 26-year-old sailor who had served in the Royal Navy. Winston Churchill summed up the occasion in 1947 as ""a flash of colour on the hard road we travel"". Prince Philip is the nation's longest serving consort and the Queen its most enduring monarch. The pair will welcome their sixth great-grandchild in April. Although the Queen continues with many of her duties as head of state, Prince Philip, 96, has retired from royal duties. The Royal Mail has issued a set of six commemorative stamps for the occasion that feature the couple's engagement and wedding.

"Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe resigned last year after almost four decades in power. Now, the country is approaching its first post-Mugabe election, with his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa and MDC Alliance candidate Nelson Chamisa the two front-runners in a field of 23 candidates. Here are 10 numbers that will help you understand how the country got to where it is now. Robert Mugabe, who led the country's liberation movement, was in power from independence in 1980 until he was ousted in November last year at the age of 93. His years in office, first as prime minister until the switch to a presidential system in 1987, were marked by economic turmoil and the crushing of dissent. Both Robert Mugabe (L) and Emmerson Mnangagwa (R) are from the ruling Zanu-PF party Emmerson Mnangagwa is his successor - nicknamed the ""crocodile"" because of political cunning. Once a Mugabe loyalist, he promises to revive the shattered economy and hopes to win elections on 30 July to legitimise his presidency. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? The 'crocodile' who snapped back Zimbabwe's political crusader Zimbabwe's economy has struggled since a controversial land reform programme was introduced in 2000. The programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless black Zimbabweans - and those with good political connections - led to sharp falls in production. As the country's central bank printed money to try to get out of the crisis, rampant inflation took hold. Although the World Bank does not have figures for 2008 and 2009, numbers from Zimbabwe's central bank showed annual inflation reached 231 million % in July 2008. Officials gave up reporting monthly statistics when it peaked at just under 80 billion % in mid-November 2008. The country was forced to abandon its own currency a year later at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1. More on post-Mugabe Zimbabwe: The political crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The political and economic crises between 2000 and 2008 nearly halved Zimbabwe's GDP -the biggest contraction in a peacetime economy, according to the World Bank.,external A brief period of recovery between 2009 and 2012 has now faltered and the economy faces serious challenges, says the World Bank. Growth has slowed sharply from an average 8% from 2009 to 2012, caused by shifts in trade and a series of major droughts. Mr Mugabe always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return The country's political and economic crises have resulted in high poverty rates. The hard years between 2000 and 2008 saw poverty rates increase tomore than 72%, according to the World Bank.,externalIt also left a fifth of the population in extreme poverty. Extreme poverty, estimated to have fallen from 2009 to 2014, is now projected to have risen again substantially. About 27% of children under the age of five suffer stunted growth, with 9% severely stunted because of poor nutrition, the2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey report revealed.,external But poverty in Zimbabwe is still lower than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, where about41% of the population were living on less than $1.90 a day,externalin 2013, World Bank data suggests. Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary wildly. The World Bank's modelled estimates, based on International Labour Organisation data, puts the figureas low as 5% in 2016,external, while Zimbabwe's biggest trade union claimedthe jobless rate was as high as 90% last year.,external Many people try to make a living by vending as they cannot find employment However, the World Bank's definition only covers those actively seeking work. Many of those not counted may not seek a job despite wanting one because they ""view job opportunities as limited, or because they have restricted labour mobility, or face discrimination, or structural, social or cultural barriers"". The CIA World Factbook estimates the rate was95% in 2009, but says current figures are not known.,external Thanks to large investments in education since independence, Zimbabwe has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa, with89% of the adult population literate,external, according to World Bank data from 2014. Globally, the literacy rate stood at 86% in 2016, while in sub-Saharan Africa it was 64%. Almost all women and men aged 15-49 have had at least some primary education,according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.,externalMore than 70% of people aged 15-49 have also attended secondary school. Zimbabwe has the sixth highest HIV prevalence rate in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.3 million people living with HIV in 2016,according to UNAids.,external However, after a peak in 1997, rates are declining. According to the UN, this is a result of successful campaigns encouraging condom use as well as programmes preventing the transmission of infection from mother to child. Treatment and support services have also improved. Making decent burials affordable Life expectancy fell in the 1990s, with the HIV/Aids epidemic a major killer. It dropped from a high of just under 61 years in 1986 to 44.1 years in 2003. It is now steadily improving again, but with unemployment and poverty endemic and HIV/Aids rates still high, it remained at just 60 in 2015, according to World Bank data. Will age be a factor in Zimbabwe's poll? Mobile devices are the leading communication tool for Zimbabweans. But while most have a mobile phone, only 43% of households have a radio, 37% have a television and 10% have a computer,according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.,external After a growth spurt after independence in 1980, a decline in birth rates and a rise in death rates saw population growth slide downwards. With high outward migration rates also high, the population has not recovered its post-independence growth. Written and produced by Lucy Rodgers. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain?

"Schoolchildren formed this mosaic of Robert Mugabe at independence day celebrations in April President Robert Mugabe's non-resignation speech will have puzzled many - why didn't the army just force him to resign at the barrel of a gun, or arrest him? It tells us two things. Firstly, this was political theatre. Everyone involved is desperate to preserve a veneer of constitutionality about the whole process, so they want him to step down and hand power to his successor, presumablyEmmerson Mnangagwa. But it was also more than spectacle. President Mugabe's opponents want to treat the elder statesman with dignity. This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" As in much of Africa, respecting your elders is ingrained in Zimbabwe's culture. And 93-year-old Robert Mugabe, a liberation fighter who became the country's leader at independence in 1980, is seen as the father of the nation. It explains the respectful tone used by opposition leader and bitter rival Morgan Tsvangirai when calling for President Mugabe's resignation. He said Mr Mugabe should step down ""in line with the national expectation and sentiment, taking full regard of his legacy and contribution to Zimbabwe pre and post-independence"". By Kim Chakanetsa, BBC Focus on Africa There is a great weight placed on respecting your elders in Shona culture, which is Zimbabwe's biggest ethnic group.  It is one of the fundamental values. At a young age you are taught to greet, speak and interact with elders in a particular manner. For example, when arriving at someone's house, an exchange of greetings will be led by the younger party, who must enquire about the health of every adult present. For girls or women, this could involve kneeling and clapping, then asking each individual in turn about their health. Boys and men will do much the same, but crouching. Failing to do so is frowned upon, and taken as a sign of a poor upbringing or lack of respect. Within the household, grandparents wield considerable influence. This reverence for elders extends beyond your family. Any older woman or man is to be treated in the same way. President Mugabe still commands the respect of the army leadership because of his liberation war credentials in the fight against white-minority rule in the 1960s and 1970s. His government's early achievements in improving access to healthcare and raising literacy rates were feted in the 1980s. But in recent years the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy, the violent crackdowns on political opposition and raids on white-owned farms have severely damaged Mr Mugabe's reputation. This is especially true in the international community, where some see him as nothing more than a despot. But while Zimbabweans have been the ones to suffer first-hand, many still feel a lingering respect for the man who delivered them independence.

Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally There is uncertainty over the whereabouts of Emmerson Mnangagwa whose sacking as vice-president triggered the military takeover in Zimbabwe. Several media reports say he returned to Zimbabwe last week having fled the country after he was fired. The263Chat news site,externalis reporting that his handlers are keeping him away from the public to guarantee his security. The site quotes a Zanu-PF official Patrick Chinamasa saying Mr Mnangagwa, who is nicknamed the crocodile, will be seen in public when his security is guaranteed. âWe have mapped a clear road map for the smooth transfer of power and Mnangagwa will come back to assume that leading role. We donât know where his is but he is on his way back,â Mr Chinamasa said. Another party official Obert Mpofu told a media briefing yesterday that Mr Mnangagwa's absence shows he has self control: âHe is a disciplined cadre and has been under attack from negative forces but kept quiet, traits he got from the war. it is that quietness that has bore some good fruits into all this saga"". Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally, 263Chat reports. Read:Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Mr Mugabe defied expectations that he would resign in his TV speech One curious part of Robert Mugabe's speech yesterday was his declaration that he planned to preside over the Zanu-PF congress next month. Zimbabwean constitutional lawyer Alex Magaisa told BBC Focus on Africa that maybe he knew that the process of impeachment could take a long time: People underestimate that old man. He thinks far more than the people dealing with him. He already knows what is coming. He will delay this process as much as possible to ensure it gets to congress.""  We reported earlieron the complex process that lies ahead. Zanu-PF's
representative in the UK has been talking to the BBC, giving some insight into why Robert Mugabe has not resigned yet: As we all know, President Mugabe is a very stubborn man. In his mindset he believes that the British came for him, and he defied them. The Americans tried through sanctions and he defied, the European Union he defied.  So he has defied everybody and he believes his own, as he calls them, boys, would not be able to make him to do what superpowers have failed to do.""  Nick Mangwana was speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World At One: This video can not be played Zanu-PF's UK representative says the case to impeach the President is a 'fait accompli' MPs from Zimbabwe's main opposition party, MDC, will meet to decide on whether to support a push to impeach President Robert Mugabe. The party's chief whip told Reuters news agency that lawmakers will meet on Tuesday to discuss the plan. Reuters reports that the governing Zanu-PF has the requisite two-thirds needed to trigger impeachment, but that opposition support would boost the process of removing Mr Mugabe. People anticipated a resignation One of the key questions today is: Why has Robert Mugabe not resigned as president of Zimbabwe? There is one theory that the plan was for Mr Mugabe to resign in a televised speech last night but there was a last minute change-of-heart. We reported earlier that people are sharing video which they claimappears to show the speech being switched. Two political sources told Reuters news agency that Mr Mugabe had actually agreed to resign but the ruling party Zanu-PF did not want him to quit in front of the military because that would have made its intervention on Wednesday look like a coup. We said earlier that Reuters was reporting that the ex-Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda has been sent to Zimbabwe to convince President Robert Mugabe to resign. So we looked into it. Our colleague talked to Mr Kaunda's son who told her he was next to him watching the events unfold on TV and had not been asked to go to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF has shared its draft impeachment motion with Reuters news agency. The draft motion reportedly says President Robert Mugabe is a ""source of instability"", has shown disrespect for
the rule of law and is to blame for an unprecedented economic
tailspin over the past 15 years. Parliament is expected to debate impeaching Mr Mugabe when it next meets, on Tuesday. Zimbabwe's dollar became worthless under Mr Mugabe's rule An official of the governing Zanu-PF has called on Zimbabweans to join another planned protest against President Robert Mugabe. Nick Mangwana, who heads the party's office in the UK, has shared a poster for Wednesday's planned march. He says that people should march to Mr Mugabe's residence in the capital which is known as Blue Roof: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Despite a show of public defiance against President Mugabe people are still afraid The BBC's Andrew Harding has been speaking to Zimbabweans on the streets of the capital Harare. He reports that there is a feeling of growing frustration after President Robert Mugabe failed to resign last night as had been expected. He says people feel confused and impatient. A taxi driver told him that he had expected Mr Mugabe to leave office last night: He was supposed to be looking after his family... [he should] stay in Singapore, Malaysia where he has assets.""  Others said that despite Saturday's public show of defiance as people rallied to urge President Mugabe to go, they were still afraid. Harare resident Lydia Gombe told our reporter that after years of repressive rule, many Zimbabweans still fear that they might get into trouble if they speak out against the government: The level of fear that these people have instilled in us as a nation is unbelievable. And it is just simple things. WhatsApp texts can get you arrested. A conversation in the bus can get you arrested.""  She adds that it would take time for people to lose their fear of speaking out. The deadline set by the governing Zanu-PF party for President Robert Mugabe to resign has passed without any significant development. As we all wait to see what happens next in Zimbabwe, here's a look back at the extraordinary events of the past week, in this two-minute-long video: This video can not be played We are getting reports in that the governing Zanu-PF party will proceed to discuss the impeachment of President Robert Mugabe after his resignation deadline lapsed. The party's chief whip Lovemore Matuke told Reuters news agency the party's MPs had planned to meet today. Our previous post points out that legal advisers to Zimbabwe's parliament say the impeachment could take several days to complete. Reuters has a faster estimate - saying that, because of the overwhelming support for the removal of Mr Mugabe, it could take a day. It quotes John Makamure from the Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust saying the move could take 24 hours: ""They can fast-track it. It can be done in a matter of a
day."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.5605468
"The unnamed police officer was reportedly stationed in Paris A French policeman shot three people dead on a street near Paris in an apparent domestic dispute, before killing himself, media reports say. His girlfriend, as well as her mother and her sister, were wounded in the incident, which occurred late on Saturday in the town of Sarcelles. Those killed are said to be the girlfriend's father and two passers-by. The mayor of Sarcelles, north of Paris, said the woman had recently told the policeman she was breaking up with him. The officer first killed two people with his service weapon on the street, Le Monde newspaper says. ""They were local residents - I knew them well because I lived on this street for 10 years,"" Sarcelles Mayor FranÃ§ois Pupponi told AFP new agency, adding that they had no connection with the policeman. The 31-year-old then shot his girlfriend in the face as she was sitting in a car, the reports say. He also fired on her mother, father and sister, before turning the gun on himself. His body was found in the front garden of a nearby house.

"Inspectors will question girls who wear hijab in primary school to find out why they do so, head of Ofsted Amanda Spielman has said. She said creating an environment where Muslim children are expected to wear the headscarf ""could be interpreted as sexualisation of young girls"". The hijab is traditionally worn as a sign of modesty once a girl reaches puberty. But the Muslim Council of Britain said Ofsted's policy was ""deeply worrying"". The announcement comes after Ms Spielman met campaigners from the Social Action and Research Foundation think tank on Friday. In September, the foundation's head, Amina Lone,co-ordinated a letter to the Sunday Times,externalfrom campaigners arguing that the hijab has ""no place in our primary schools"", and demanding action as Muslim girls as young as five were ""increasingly veiled"". ""This is an affront to the historical fight for gender equality in our secular democracy and is creating a two-tiered form of non-equality for young Muslim girls,"" the letter said. Why wear a hijab? What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? Why catwalk Hijabs are upsetting some Muslim women Explaining her decision to act, Ms Spielman said: ""While respecting parents' choice to bring up their children according to their cultural norms, creating an environment where primary school children are expected to wear the hijab could be interpreted as sexualisation of young girls. ""In seeking to address these concerns, and in line with our current practice in terms of assessing whether the school promotes equality for their children, inspectors will talk to girls who wear such garments to ascertain why they do so in the school."" She urged parents concerned about fundamentalist groups influencing school policy or breaching equality law to complain to the school or to Ofsted. But Muslim Council of Britain secretary general Harun Khan said: ""It is deeply worrying that Ofsted has announced it will be specifically targeting and quizzing young Muslim girls who choose to wear the headscarf. ""It sends a clear message to all British women who adopt this that they are second-class citizens, that while they are free to wear the headscarf, the establishment would prefer that they do not."" He said many British Muslims who wear the headscarf have done ""extremely well"" in education. ""It is disappointing that this is becoming policy without even engaging with a diverse set of mainstream Muslim voices on the topic,"" he said. Mr Khan urged Ms Spielman to reverse the decision and said it risked being ""counter-productive"" to Ofsted's promise to uphold British values.

"This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" Zimbabwe's embattled leader Robert Mugabe has vowed to stay in power for several weeks, despite mounting calls for him to stand down now. In a live TV address, Mr Mugabe said he would preside over the ruling party's congress in December. Zanu-PF earlier sacked him as party leader, and gave him less than 24 hours to resign as president or be impeached. His grip on power has weakened since the military intervened on Wednesday, in a row over who should succeed him. The crisis began when the 93-year-old president sacked his deputy, Emmerson Mnangagwa, two weeks ago, angering army commanders who saw it as an attempt to position his wife as his successor. Five things about Zimbabwe crisis Zimbabwe's next likely leader Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? Crowds had gathered in Harare to watch the speech, with Mr Mugabe widely expected to resign. Instead though, flanked by military generals, he said ""the [ruling Zanu-PF] party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over its processes"". President Mugabe acknowledged criticism from Zanu-PF, the military and public, and stressed the need to return Zimbabwe to normality. ""Whatever the pros and cons of how they [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns,"" he said, in reference to the army's move last week to take over the state broadcaster. The BBC's Africa Editor, Fergal Keane, said his understanding of the situation was that Mr Mugabe had agreed to resign, but then changed his mind. By Andrew Harding, BBC Southern Africa correspondent In his stumbling, 20-minute address, Robert Mugabe made no mention of the deafening calls, from the public and from his own party, to resign as president. Instead, he declared that the military had done nothing wrong, by seizing power, and placing him under house arrest earlier in the week. The 93-year-old, reading from notes, and often losing his place, then implied he would remain Zimbabwe's leader at least until next month's Zanu-PF congress, ignoring the fact that earlier he was stripped of any official role within the party. He did acknowledge failings, and factionalism in the government and party but made no mention of his wife, Grace, who was expelled from the party. Quite where this leaves the political stalemate here is unclear. Zanu-PF has vowed to impeach Mr Mugabe if he doesn't resign by noon (10:00 GMT) on Monday. Mr Mugabe is clearly playing for time. But Zimbabwe's military leadership is now at odds with the newly purged governing party. Public frustration is growing. And a dangerously unpredictable standoff has now been prolonged. Earlier on Sunday, Mr Mnangagwa was named as Zanu-PF's new leader and candidate for the 2018 general elections. At the same party meeting, Mr Mugabe's 52-year-old wife, Grace, was expelled, alongside a number of other senior officials. After the Mugabes, which African dynasties remain? Zimbabwe in 10 numbers It is not entirely clear how Robert Mugabe can preside over Zanu-PF's congress next month, following his dismissal as party leader. Party positions are officially decided at the congress and Emmerson Mnangagwa may officially take over leading the country then. Mr Mnangagwa, a former state security chief, is nicknamed ""the crocodile"" for his perceived shrewdness. He fled Zimbabwe after his sacking a fortnight ago, but has since reportedly returned. The head of the influential War Veterans Association, which used to back Mr Mugabe but now demands his resignation, told AFP they would call for further protests. ""That speech has nothing to do with realities. We will go for impeachment and we are calling people back to the streets,"" said Chris Mutsvangwa. This video can not be played Zimbabwe reacts: ""We need him to resign... our lives are terrible right now"" Impeaching the president would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of Zimbabwe's parliament, which is due to resume on Tuesday. The opposition MDC-T party has tried unsuccessfully to impeach Mr Mugabe in the past, but this time the ruling party - which has an overwhelming majority in both houses - is likely to go against him. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said he was ""baffled"" by the president's address. ""He's playing a game. He has let the whole nation down,"" he told Reuters news agency.

"Singer Aled Jones has said he is ""deeply sorry"" for any upset caused after allegations about his behaviour, but denied any ""inappropriate contact"". Responding to newspaper claims of inappropriate ""messages"", his spokesman said the Songs of Praise star accepted his behaviour more than a decade ago had been ""occasionally juvenile"". The spokesman said he had ""voluntarily agreed not to go on the BBC whilst the matter is investigated"". The BBC is not commenting on the story. Mr Jones's spokesman added that the allegations from a single female complainant of inappropriate messages and contact, reported in the Sun, did not relate to any broadcast work, and related to a matter more than 10 years ago. The 46-year-old father-of-two continues to present his Sunday morning show on Classic FM. The statement said: ""Whilst he accepts that his behaviour over a decade ago was occasionally juvenile, as was that of others, he never intended to harass or distress and he strongly denies any inappropriate contact. ""He is, however, deeply sorry for any upset caused and hopes this matter is resolved soon.""

"Gaia Pope was last seen in Swanage on 7 November There were no injuries to suggest ""any other person was involved"" in the death of missing teenager Gaia Pope, police have said. The 19-year-old's body was found on Saturday in a field near Swanage, 11 days after she was last seen. Dorset Police is treating her death as ""unexplained"" pending toxicology results. Three people were arrested on suspicion of murder as part of the investigation and released under investigation. Det Supt Paul Kessell said: ""The post-mortem examination has not identified any injuries to suggest any other person was involved in her death. ""The cause of death is undetermined, pending toxicology. The coroner is involved in the oversight of these examinations but at this time this remains an investigation into an unexplained death."" Some items of clothing that Miss Pope was wearing on the day she went missing were found on Thursday Miss Pope, who had severe epilepsy, had not been seen since 7 November. Her disappearance prompted a massive campaign from family and friends who spent days scouring the town. Items of clothing she was wearing on the day she went missing were found on Thursday, close to where her remains were found near a coastal path. Police thanked volunteers for their help in searching for the teenager, but have asked people to stay away from the site due to safety concerns. Det Supt Kessell added: ""I reiterate this area is steep and slippery in an exposed area close to sea cliffs. The area is covered in dense undergrowth and gorse and can present a hazard. ""The area where the body was located is likely to remain cordoned off for some time while forensic examinations and searches are concluded."" Miss Pope went missing in Swanage on 7 November Flowers have been left in Miss Pope's memory at a Swanage monument Earlier, Miss Pope's twin sister, Maya, spoke of her heartbreak and vowed to ""make her [sister] so proud"". On Facebook, she added: ""Can't find any words right now. Gaia is my everything and I am heartbroken. I thank everyone who was involved in searching for my beautiful twin."" Her elder sister, Clara Pope-Sutherland, said the 19-year-old was the ""light of my life"" and ""intelligent, beautiful and emotionally wise"". People in the town came together at the church to say prayers and light candles on Sunday night A church service was held at St Mary's Church in Swanage with candles lit in memory of Miss Pope on Sunday night. Team rector, the Very Reverend John Mann, said: ""When you see the candles together it brings that sense of unity. ""There were police and people who had been out searching at the service - that added to the sense this was a community together, we were there together."" Floral tributes have begun to be left on the Alfred Monument, next to the sea front. Family friend Sheri Carr, who organised the Find Gaia social media campaign thanked the public for its support. ""We are absolutely devastated, and unable to put into words our feeling of loss,"" she wrote on social media. The public has been asked to stay away from the site due to safety concerns On the day she went missing, Miss Pope was seen at about 15:00 GMT buying an ice cream at St Michael's Garage, having been driven there by a relative. She was then spotted an hour later on CCTV in Manor Gardens, off Morrison Road. Rosemary Dinch, 71; her 49-year-old son Paul Elsey; and 19-year-old grandson Nathan Elsey - all of whom were known to Miss Pope - were questioned by detectives and released under investigation.

"Simon Speirs is believed to have drowned after he was swept overboard during rough seas. A sailor has died after being swept overboard in a ""tragic"" accident during an international yacht race. Simon Speirs, 60, from Bristol, was taking part in the Clipper Round the World Race leg from South Africa to Australia. Organisers said the retired solicitor, who was wearing a life jacket, was washed over the side during gale force winds on Saturday. Mr Speirs, described a sensible and popular chap, has been buried at sea. Race co-founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston described him as an experienced sailor and said that ""it is absolutely tragic to lose someone like this"". ""I just feel for his family. Here he was fulfilling his dream and then it has turned into a nightmare for them,"" he added. According to astatement,externalfrom Clipper, Mr Speirs was sailing for Great Britain on board the CV30, which was in sixth place and had reached the Indian Ocean. The sailor, who had more than 40 years' dinghy experience, was washed off the deck by the wind. Mr Speirs then became separated from the boat which was in the Southern Ocean, in what were rough seas with 20 knots of wind and gusts at 40. The rest of the crew is believed to be safe and heading for Fremantle in Australia. Clipper said an investigation would be carried out. The 12 racing yachtsset off from Liverpoolin August. The death of Mr Speirs is the third in the 21-year history of the Clipper race. During the last race in 2015, Andrew Ashman, 49, from Kent, died from a fatal neck injury. His death was the first in the race's history. It was followed in April last year by the death of Sarah Young, 40, from London, who was un-tethered and washed off the deck.

But she's insulting civil servants, the vice-president at public rallies.  They are denigrating the army.  One of the major charges are that he refused to implement the constitution of Zimbabwe.

Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally There is uncertainty over the whereabouts of Emmerson Mnangagwa whose sacking as vice-president triggered the military takeover in Zimbabwe. Several media reports say he returned to Zimbabwe last week having fled the country after he was fired. The263Chat news site,externalis reporting that his handlers are keeping him away from the public to guarantee his security. The site quotes a Zanu-PF official Patrick Chinamasa saying Mr Mnangagwa, who is nicknamed the crocodile, will be seen in public when his security is guaranteed. âWe have mapped a clear road map for the smooth transfer of power and Mnangagwa will come back to assume that leading role. We donât know where his is but he is on his way back,â Mr Chinamasa said. Another party official Obert Mpofu told a media briefing yesterday that Mr Mnangagwa's absence shows he has self control: âHe is a disciplined cadre and has been under attack from negative forces but kept quiet, traits he got from the war. it is that quietness that has bore some good fruits into all this saga"". Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally, 263Chat reports. Read:Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Mr Mugabe defied expectations that he would resign in his TV speech One curious part of Robert Mugabe's speech yesterday was his declaration that he planned to preside over the Zanu-PF congress next month. Zimbabwean constitutional lawyer Alex Magaisa told BBC Focus on Africa that maybe he knew that the process of impeachment could take a long time: People underestimate that old man. He thinks far more than the people dealing with him. He already knows what is coming. He will delay this process as much as possible to ensure it gets to congress.""  We reported earlieron the complex process that lies ahead. Zanu-PF's
representative in the UK has been talking to the BBC, giving some insight into why Robert Mugabe has not resigned yet: As we all know, President Mugabe is a very stubborn man. In his mindset he believes that the British came for him, and he defied them. The Americans tried through sanctions and he defied, the European Union he defied.  So he has defied everybody and he believes his own, as he calls them, boys, would not be able to make him to do what superpowers have failed to do.""  Nick Mangwana was speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World At One: This video can not be played Zanu-PF's UK representative says the case to impeach the President is a 'fait accompli' MPs from Zimbabwe's main opposition party, MDC, will meet to decide on whether to support a push to impeach President Robert Mugabe. The party's chief whip told Reuters news agency that lawmakers will meet on Tuesday to discuss the plan. Reuters reports that the governing Zanu-PF has the requisite two-thirds needed to trigger impeachment, but that opposition support would boost the process of removing Mr Mugabe. People anticipated a resignation One of the key questions today is: Why has Robert Mugabe not resigned as president of Zimbabwe? There is one theory that the plan was for Mr Mugabe to resign in a televised speech last night but there was a last minute change-of-heart. We reported earlier that people are sharing video which they claimappears to show the speech being switched. Two political sources told Reuters news agency that Mr Mugabe had actually agreed to resign but the ruling party Zanu-PF did not want him to quit in front of the military because that would have made its intervention on Wednesday look like a coup. We said earlier that Reuters was reporting that the ex-Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda has been sent to Zimbabwe to convince President Robert Mugabe to resign. So we looked into it. Our colleague talked to Mr Kaunda's son who told her he was next to him watching the events unfold on TV and had not been asked to go to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF has shared its draft impeachment motion with Reuters news agency. The draft motion reportedly says President Robert Mugabe is a ""source of instability"", has shown disrespect for
the rule of law and is to blame for an unprecedented economic
tailspin over the past 15 years. Parliament is expected to debate impeaching Mr Mugabe when it next meets, on Tuesday. Zimbabwe's dollar became worthless under Mr Mugabe's rule An official of the governing Zanu-PF has called on Zimbabweans to join another planned protest against President Robert Mugabe.

Despite a show of public defiance against President Mugabe people are still afraid The BBC's Andrew Harding has been speaking to Zimbabweans on the streets of the capital Harare. He reports that there is a feeling of growing frustration after President Robert Mugabe failed to resign last night as had been expected. He says people feel confused and impatient. A taxi driver told him that he had expected Mr Mugabe to leave office last night: He was supposed to be looking after his family... [he should] stay in Singapore, Malaysia where he has assets.""  Others said that despite Saturday's public show of defiance as people rallied to urge President Mugabe to go, they were still afraid. Harare resident Lydia Gombe told our reporter that after years of repressive rule, many Zimbabweans still fear that they might get into trouble if they speak out against the government: The level of fear that these people have instilled in us as a nation is unbelievable. And it is just simple things. WhatsApp texts can get you arrested. A conversation in the bus can get you arrested.""  She adds that it would take time for people to lose their fear of speaking out. The deadline set by the governing Zanu-PF party for President Robert Mugabe to resign has passed without any significant development. As we all wait to see what happens next in Zimbabwe, here's a look back at the extraordinary events of the past week, in this two-minute-long video: This video can not be played We are getting reports in that the governing Zanu-PF party will proceed to discuss the impeachment of President Robert Mugabe after his resignation deadline lapsed. The party's chief whip Lovemore Matuke told Reuters news agency the party's MPs had planned to meet today. Our previous post points out that legal advisers to Zimbabwe's parliament say the impeachment could take several days to complete. Reuters has a faster estimate - saying that, because of the overwhelming support for the removal of Mr Mugabe, it could take a day. It quotes John Makamure from the Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust saying the move could take 24 hours: ""They can fast-track it. It can be done in a matter of a
day."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.8930523
"Most of the victims were women and elderly people At least 15 people have been killed and five others wounded in a stampede in Morocco while food aid was distributed. The incident occurred in the town of Sidi Boulaalam in Essaouira province. The aid was being handed out by a private local charity. Some reports indicate that up to 40 people were injured in the crush. Local media reported that most of the victims were women and elderly people. Pictures on social media showed bodies of women laid out on the ground. Witnesses told local media that this year's annual food aid distribution at a local market in Sidi Boulaalam, an impoverished town with just over 8,000 inhabitants, attracted a larger crowd than usual. ""This year there were lots of people, several hundred people,"" a witness who asked to remain anonymous told AFP news agency. ""People shoved, they broke down the barriers,"" he said, adding that the injured had been evacuated to a hospital in Marrakesh. Morocco's interior ministry said that King Muhammed VI had instructed the local authorities to help those affected, adding that he would personally cover all medical and funeral costs. An unverified video shot by a bystander before the incident showed a large crowd gathered at the open-air market, waiting for the food distribution.

Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show ahead ofWednesday's Budget,external, the chancellor also said: ""There are no unemployed people""while discussing the threat to jobs posed by technological change - when pressed later, he said the government hadn't forgotten the 1.4m who are unemployed The government was ""on the brink"" of making ""some serious movement forward"" in the Brexit negotiations Ministers would not withdraw a controversial bid to enshrine the exact Brexit date in law The health service will not face ""Armageddon"" if it is not given a Â£4bn funding boost demanded by the boss of NHS England The shortage of housing is expected to be one of the themes of the Budget, with Mr Hammond under pressure to ease the difficulties faced by first-time buyers trying to get a deposit. He said it was ""not acceptable"" that young people find it so hard to buy a home, and promised to set out how the government would keep its ""pledge to the next generation"". He did not commit to the Â£50bn reportedly being demanded by Communities Secretary Sajid Javid to finance a house-building drive, but committed to the target of 300,000 new homes in England. He insisted the government was delivering new homes at record levels, with 217,350 ""additional dwellings"" in England last year, but acknowledged more needed to be done. Javid: Borrow more to build houses Kuenssberg: The Tories' housing debates The Budget: What we know already Focusing on sites where planning permission has been granted, he said the government would use the ""powers of state"" to get ""missing homes built"". It also plans to pay to clean up polluted industrial sites for house building, get town hall bosses to allocate small pockets of land to small developers and guarantee loans by banks to small house builders. This video can not be played ""There are no unemployed people. We've created 3.5 million new jobs since 2010."" Most of the announcements will be saved for Wednesday, but they are also expected to include: Â£75m for artificial intelligence Â£400m for electric car charge points Â£100m to boost clean car purchases Â£160m for next-generation 5G mobile networks across the UK Â£100m for an additional 8,000 fully-qualified computer science teachers supported by a new National Centre for Computing A retraining partnership between the TUC (Trade Union Congress), CBI (Confederation of British Industry) and the government Â£76m to boost digital and construction skills The chancellor is also expected to announce regulation changes to allow developers to apply to test driverless vehicles - and revealed he would be testing one out in the West Midlands on Monday. The government is aiming for fully driverless cars - with no safety attendant on board - to be on the road in four years. ""Some would say that's a bold move but I believe we have to embrace these technologies, we have to take up these challenges, if we want to see Britain leading the next industrial revolution,"" Mr Hammond added. Driverless cars 'on UK roads by 2021' Tories, Labour and the big Budget battle lines Challenged on the impact of wider automation on people's jobs, Mr Hammond went on to say: ""I remember 20 years ago we were worrying about what was going to happen to the million shorthand typists in Britain as the personal computer took over. ""Well nobody has a shorthand typist these days, but where are all these unemployed people? ""There are no unemployed people."" Asked to clarify his remark later in the interview, he said the government was ""getting people into work at a remarkable rate"" and that it had not forgotten the 1.4m unemployed people in the UK. In a later interview with ITV's Peston, he said: ""The point I was making is previous waves of technological change have not resulted in millions of people being long-term unemployed."" Also appearing on Marr, Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell defended his own plans to borrow Â£250bn over 10 years to invest in capital projects and renationalise several key industries, saying his proposals would allow the UK to ""compete in a global market"". ""When you invest those sums you get a return on that investment that covers any cost of borrowing,"" he said.

But she's insulting civil servants, the vice-president at public rallies.  They are denigrating the army.  One of the major charges are that he refused to implement the constitution of Zimbabwe.

Jonathan Moyo tweeted that he is ""relatively fine"". The tweet has however been deleted but we manged to get a screengrab of it: Mr Moyo, who is also the minister for higher education, is among party officials that were pushing for Mrs Mugabe to take over from her husband. Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally There is uncertainty over the whereabouts of Emmerson Mnangagwa whose sacking as vice-president triggered the military takeover in Zimbabwe. Several media reports say he returned to Zimbabwe last week having fled the country after he was fired. The263Chat news site,externalis reporting that his handlers are keeping him away from the public to guarantee his security. The site quotes a Zanu-PF official Patrick Chinamasa saying Mr Mnangagwa, who is nicknamed the crocodile, will be seen in public when his security is guaranteed. âWe have mapped a clear road map for the smooth transfer of power and Mnangagwa will come back to assume that leading role. We donât know where his is but he is on his way back,â Mr Chinamasa said. Another party official Obert Mpofu told a media briefing yesterday that Mr Mnangagwa's absence shows he has self control: âHe is a disciplined cadre and has been under attack from negative forces but kept quiet, traits he got from the war. it is that quietness that has bore some good fruits into all this saga"". Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally, 263Chat reports. Read:Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Mr Mugabe defied expectations that he would resign in his TV speech One curious part of Robert Mugabe's speech yesterday was his declaration that he planned to preside over the Zanu-PF congress next month. Zimbabwean constitutional lawyer Alex Magaisa told BBC Focus on Africa that maybe he knew that the process of impeachment could take a long time: People underestimate that old man. He thinks far more than the people dealing with him. He already knows what is coming. He will delay this process as much as possible to ensure it gets to congress.""  We reported earlieron the complex process that lies ahead. Zanu-PF's
representative in the UK has been talking to the BBC, giving some insight into why Robert Mugabe has not resigned yet: As we all know, President Mugabe is a very stubborn man. In his mindset he believes that the British came for him, and he defied them. The Americans tried through sanctions and he defied, the European Union he defied.  So he has defied everybody and he believes his own, as he calls them, boys, would not be able to make him to do what superpowers have failed to do.""  Nick Mangwana was speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World At One: This video can not be played Zanu-PF's UK representative says the case to impeach the President is a 'fait accompli' MPs from Zimbabwe's main opposition party, MDC, will meet to decide on whether to support a push to impeach President Robert Mugabe. The party's chief whip told Reuters news agency that lawmakers will meet on Tuesday to discuss the plan. Reuters reports that the governing Zanu-PF has the requisite two-thirds needed to trigger impeachment, but that opposition support would boost the process of removing Mr Mugabe. People anticipated a resignation One of the key questions today is: Why has Robert Mugabe not resigned as president of Zimbabwe? There is one theory that the plan was for Mr Mugabe to resign in a televised speech last night but there was a last minute change-of-heart. We reported earlier that people are sharing video which they claimappears to show the speech being switched. Two political sources told Reuters news agency that Mr Mugabe had actually agreed to resign but the ruling party Zanu-PF did not want him to quit in front of the military because that would have made its intervention on Wednesday look like a coup. We said earlier that Reuters was reporting that the ex-Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda has been sent to Zimbabwe to convince President Robert Mugabe to resign. So we looked into it. Our colleague talked to Mr Kaunda's son who told her he was next to him watching the events unfold on TV and had not been asked to go to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF has shared its draft impeachment motion with Reuters news agency. The draft motion reportedly says President Robert Mugabe is a ""source of instability"", has shown disrespect for
the rule of law and is to blame for an unprecedented economic
tailspin over the past 15 years. Parliament is expected to debate impeaching Mr Mugabe when it next meets, on Tuesday. Zimbabwe's dollar became worthless under Mr Mugabe's rule An official of the governing Zanu-PF has called on Zimbabweans to join another planned protest against President Robert Mugabe. Nick Mangwana, who heads the party's office in the UK, has shared a poster for Wednesday's planned march. He says that people should march to Mr Mugabe's residence in the capital which is known as Blue Roof: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Despite a show of public defiance against President Mugabe people are still afraid The BBC's Andrew Harding has been speaking to Zimbabweans on the streets of the capital Harare. He reports that there is a feeling of growing frustration after President Robert Mugabe failed to resign last night as had been expected. He says people feel confused and impatient. A taxi driver told him that he had expected Mr Mugabe to leave office last night: He was supposed to be looking after his family... [he should] stay in Singapore, Malaysia where he has assets.""  Others said that despite Saturday's public show of defiance as people rallied to urge President Mugabe to go, they were still afraid. Harare resident Lydia Gombe told our reporter that after years of repressive rule, many Zimbabweans still fear that they might get into trouble if they speak out against the government: The level of fear that these people have instilled in us as a nation is unbelievable. And it is just simple things. WhatsApp texts can get you arrested. A conversation in the bus can get you arrested.""  She adds that it would take time for people to lose their fear of speaking out. The deadline set by the governing Zanu-PF party for President Robert Mugabe to resign has passed without any significant development. As we all wait to see what happens next in Zimbabwe, here's a look back at the extraordinary events of the past week, in this two-minute-long video: This video can not be played We are getting reports in that the governing Zanu-PF party will proceed to discuss the impeachment of President Robert Mugabe after his resignation deadline lapsed. The party's chief whip Lovemore Matuke told Reuters news agency the party's MPs had planned to meet today. Our previous post points out that legal advisers to Zimbabwe's parliament say the impeachment could take several days to complete. Reuters has a faster estimate - saying that, because of the overwhelming support for the removal of Mr Mugabe, it could take a day. It quotes John Makamure from the Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust saying the move could take 24 hours: ""They can fast-track it. It can be done in a matter of a
day."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,3.321773e-11

"Simon Speirs is believed to have drowned after he was swept overboard during rough seas. A sailor has died after being swept overboard in a ""tragic"" accident during an international yacht race. Simon Speirs, 60, from Bristol, was taking part in the Clipper Round the World Race leg from South Africa to Australia. Organisers said the retired solicitor, who was wearing a life jacket, was washed over the side during gale force winds on Saturday. Mr Speirs, described a sensible and popular chap, has been buried at sea. Race co-founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston described him as an experienced sailor and said that ""it is absolutely tragic to lose someone like this"". ""I just feel for his family. Here he was fulfilling his dream and then it has turned into a nightmare for them,"" he added. According to astatement,externalfrom Clipper, Mr Speirs was sailing for Great Britain on board the CV30, which was in sixth place and had reached the Indian Ocean. The sailor, who had more than 40 years' dinghy experience, was washed off the deck by the wind. Mr Speirs then became separated from the boat which was in the Southern Ocean, in what were rough seas with 20 knots of wind and gusts at 40. The rest of the crew is believed to be safe and heading for Fremantle in Australia. Clipper said an investigation would be carried out. The 12 racing yachtsset off from Liverpoolin August. The death of Mr Speirs is the third in the 21-year history of the Clipper race. During the last race in 2015, Andrew Ashman, 49, from Kent, died from a fatal neck injury. His death was the first in the race's history. It was followed in April last year by the death of Sarah Young, 40, from London, who was un-tethered and washed off the deck.

"Michelle O'Neill said it was an ""emotional but exciting time"" for republicanism Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill has ruled herself out of replacing Gerry Adams as party leader. Mrs O'Neill told BBC's Sunday Politics programme that she had ""enough to do"" in her current role. Mr Adams announced at Sinn FÃ©in's ard fhÃ©is (party conference) on Saturday that he would stand down as the party's leader next year. ""Leadership means knowing when it's time for change and that time is now,"" said the 69-year-old. Profile: Gerry Adams Is Sinn FÃ©in leadership a one-horse race? Mr Adams has been party president since 1983, but told the conference it would be his last as leader. Sinn FÃ©in may hope that Mr Adams' decision not to stand in the next Irish election will make any talks about a future coalition in Dublin more straightforward. But Fianna FÃ¡il Leader Micheal Martin has repeated his view that Sinn Fein remains unacceptable as a partner in government. Whatever the future brings, there's no doubt Gerry Adams' move marks an historic change as a leader who oversaw the republican movement's journey between violence and peace gives way to another politician who will pursue Irish unity through more conventional parliamentary politics. Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald is the front-runner to replace him. It is expected that a special party conference will be held next year to elect a new president. Mrs O'Neill was appointed Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader in January, after former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness retired. She said she would not be entering the Sinn FÃ©in leadership race and would be concentrating on dealing ""with the problems in the north"". She added that it was an ""emotional, but also an exciting, time for republican politics"". ""We will see who puts their name forward and then I will obviously make my decision on who I'd support that time."" She added that the election of a new president will be a ""very health process"". Meanwhile, Mrs O'Neill has called on both government to take a bigger role in breaking the ongoing political deadlock in Northern Ireland. Gerry Adams at Sinn FÃ©in's party conference, with Michelle O'Neill (right) The power-sharing government at Stormont collapsed in Januaryand several rounds of talks to restore the institutions between Sinn FÃ©in and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) have failed. Mrs O'Neill said that she was sure the parties would return to a ""talks process of some description but it has to be meaningful - we can't keep going around the hamster wheel"". She added that she will tell Prime Minister Theresa May when they meet on Tuesday that the Conservative Party have not sufficiently encouraged the DUP to strike a deal because of their Westminster pact. On Saturday, she called on the Irish government to appoint a minister with responsibility for advancing Irish unity. At Sinn FÃ©in's party conference, she said that a parliamentary committee in the Republic of Ireland should also be formed to look at a united Ireland. On Saturday, delegates at the ard fhÃ©is voted to liberalise the party's policy on abortion. Party members voted in favour of allowing abortions where a pregnancy poses a risk to a woman's health, including mental health. There will be a referendum on abortion law in the Republic of Ireland next May or June. Sinn FÃ©in's previous position supported allowing terminations when a baby is expected to die in the womb or shortly after birth, and in cases of rape or incest. Currently, the law in the Republic of Ireland only permits abortion when there is a real and substantial risk to a woman's life. In Northern Ireland, terminations are only legal when continuing with a pregnancy poses a serious or permanent risk to a woman's health. Is Sinn FÃ©in leadership a one-horse race?

"The unnamed police officer was reportedly stationed in Paris A French policeman shot three people dead on a street near Paris in an apparent domestic dispute, before killing himself, media reports say. His girlfriend, as well as her mother and her sister, were wounded in the incident, which occurred late on Saturday in the town of Sarcelles. Those killed are said to be the girlfriend's father and two passers-by. The mayor of Sarcelles, north of Paris, said the woman had recently told the policeman she was breaking up with him. The officer first killed two people with his service weapon on the street, Le Monde newspaper says. ""They were local residents - I knew them well because I lived on this street for 10 years,"" Sarcelles Mayor FranÃ§ois Pupponi told AFP new agency, adding that they had no connection with the policeman. The 31-year-old then shot his girlfriend in the face as she was sitting in a car, the reports say. He also fired on her mother, father and sister, before turning the gun on himself. His body was found in the front garden of a nearby house.

"The vessel is the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet Signals have been detected that are thought to have come from an Argentine submarine that went missing with 44 crew on board, officials say. The defence ministry is now trying to trace the location of the seven failed satellite calls received on Saturday. Argentina has stepped up the search in the South Atlantic for the ARA San Juan submarine, with a Nasa research plane joining in. The diesel-electric vessel disappeared 430km (267 miles) off the coast. Britain and countries in the region have offered assistance. The US Navy is flying deep water rescue modules to Argentina to be deployed if the submarine is found on the sea floor. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The task of the rescuers has been complicated by heavy winds and high waves. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, to its base at Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires. Its last contact with the navy command was on Wednesday morning. An Argentine destroyer and two corvettes are conducting a search around the area of the sub's last known position off the south-eastern Valdez peninsula. But so far there are no clues about its whereabouts. It is thought that the submarine may have had communication difficulties caused by a power cut. Navy protocol dictates that a vessel should come to the surface if communication has been lost.

"Simon Speirs is believed to have drowned after he was swept overboard during rough seas. A sailor has died after being swept overboard in a ""tragic"" accident during an international yacht race. Simon Speirs, 60, from Bristol, was taking part in the Clipper Round the World Race leg from South Africa to Australia. Organisers said the retired solicitor, who was wearing a life jacket, was washed over the side during gale force winds on Saturday. Mr Speirs, described a sensible and popular chap, has been buried at sea. Race co-founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston described him as an experienced sailor and said that ""it is absolutely tragic to lose someone like this"". ""I just feel for his family. Here he was fulfilling his dream and then it has turned into a nightmare for them,"" he added. According to astatement,externalfrom Clipper, Mr Speirs was sailing for Great Britain on board the CV30, which was in sixth place and had reached the Indian Ocean. The sailor, who had more than 40 years' dinghy experience, was washed off the deck by the wind. Mr Speirs then became separated from the boat which was in the Southern Ocean, in what were rough seas with 20 knots of wind and gusts at 40. The rest of the crew is believed to be safe and heading for Fremantle in Australia. Clipper said an investigation would be carried out. The 12 racing yachtsset off from Liverpoolin August. The death of Mr Speirs is the third in the 21-year history of the Clipper race. During the last race in 2015, Andrew Ashman, 49, from Kent, died from a fatal neck injury.

"Gen John Hyten (left): ""If you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail."" The top nuclear commander in the US says he would resist any ""illegal"" presidential order to launch a strike. Air Force Gen John Hyten, said as head of the US Strategic Command he provided advice to a president and expected that a legal alternative would be found. His comments come just days after US senators discussed a president's authority to launch a nuclear attack. Some of them expressed concern that President Donald Trump might irresponsibly order such a strike. Others though said a president must have the authority to act without meddling from lawyers. It was the first such hearing in more than 40 years. In August,Mr Trump vowedto unleash ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" on North Korea if it threatened the US. Last month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Republican chairman, Senator Bob Corker, accused the president of setting the US ""on a path to World War Three"". Senate committee questions Trump nuclear authority Trump and the nuclear codes Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada, Gen Hyten said: ""We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?"" As for the legality of a strike, the general said that he had studiedUS laws of armed conflict,externalfor many years which stipulates key criteria the president must consider before launching any attack: Necessity Distinction Proportionality Unnecessary suffering The armed conflict report quotesan International Court of Justice ruling,externalwhich states that while the threat or use of nuclear weapons is not prohibited by international law, ""the use of such weapons seems scarcely reconcilable with respect for the requirements of the law applicable in armed conflict"". While Senators and expert witnesses agree the president has full authority to defend the nation, commentators have pointed out that because there is no all-encompassing definition of ""imminent attack"", the president is not given an entirely free hand. ""I provide advice to the president, he will tell me what to do,"" Gen Hyten said. ""And if it's illegal, guess what's going to happen? I'm going to say: 'Mr President, that's illegal.' And guess what he's going to do? He's going to say, 'What would be legal?' And we'll come up with options, of a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that's the way it works. ""It's not that complicated,"" Gen Hyten added. This video can not be played Would the US military disobey a nuclear order from President Trump? He added: ""If you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail. You could go to jail for the rest of your life."" President Trump has not publicly commented on Gen Hyten's remarks. Senate questions Trump's nuclear powers Would military disobey Trump?

"Critics say the tech behind driverless cars still needs a lot of work Driverless cars could be on UK roads within four years under government plans to invest in the sector. Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC the objective was to have ""fully driverless cars"" without a safety attendant on board in use by 2021. ""Some would say that's a bold move, but we have to embrace these technologies if we want the UK to lead the next industrial revolution,"" he said. However, the chancellor admitted he had yet to use a driverless car himself. Driverless cars on UK roads by 2021 - really? ""I'm promised to go in one when we visit the West Midlands tomorrow,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. Mr Hammond is due to announce regulation changes in Wednesday'sBudget,externalwhich will allow developers to apply to test driverless vehicles on UK roads. Asked about the potential loss of jobs for drivers, he said the country could not ""hide from change"" and the government had to equip people with the skills ""to take up new careers"". The chancellor admitted he had yet to experience a driverless car himself The chancellor is also expected to detail proposals to build 300,000 new homes in the UK a year, as well as extra money for NHS nurses' pay. The Budget: What we know already What to watch for in the Budget,external Tories, Labour and the big Budget battle lines Chancellor defends employment record - BBC News Will you need a driving licence in the age of self-driving cars? Mr Hammond's announcement comes after the UK's biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover,began testing driverless cars on public roads. The trials, which rely on sensors that allow the cars to detect traffic, pedestrians and signals, took place in Coventry city centre over several weeks. Jaguar said a human was on board to react to emergencies. The government said the industry would be worth Â£28bn to the UK economy by 2035 and will support 27,000 jobs. Labour quipped that under the Tories it would not only be the cars with no-one in the driving seat. Critics have warned the technology necessary for driverless cars to succeed is a long way from being ready. Former Top Gear host and now Grand Tour presenter Jeremy Clarkson said he was recently in a self-driving car which made two mistakes which could have killed him in just 50miles. Writing in the Sunday Times magazine, Mr Clarkson said the incidents convinced him the technology was still ""a very long way off"", adding: ""For now, we're miles away from it."" In the Budget, Mr Hammond is also expected to announce: Â£75m for artificial intelligence Â£400m for electric car charge points Â£100m to boost clean car purchases Â£160m for next-generation 5G mobile networks across the UK Â£100m for an additional 8,000 fully-qualified computer science teachers supported by a new National Centre for Computing A retraining partnership between the TUC (Trade Union Congress), CBI (Confederation of British Industry) and the government Â£76m to boost digital and construction skills Funding for 5G technology will go towards the National Cyber Security Centre to ensure the security of the mobile network, as well as testing on roads to help provide the network needed for driverless cars. A further Â£35m will be used to give rail passengers reliable mobile connections and ""lightning-speed"" internet during journeys. Trials are due to begin on the Trans-Pennine route, which connects Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool. Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Budget needed to show a ""genuine, decisive change of course"" and not ""empty promises"".

"""We are the builders"". It feels a very long time since George Osborne made that claim for the Conservative Party and the record of the government since then has not really borne that out. But right now, in some parts of the Tories there is a definite sense that unless they come up with an effective offer - politicians' term, not mine - on housing, they are on course to lose the next election. There is tangible pressure then, not just on the Communities Secretary, Sajid Javid, but more to the point, the chancellor. Next week the political expectation is that Philip Hammond's Budget will provide at least part of the answer to that political quandary. Later today, there will be a tentative step in that direction, with Prime Minister Theresa May and Mr Javid donning hard hats to try to show they care, and announcing that housing associations' financial status will change. Borrowing boost for social housing McDonnell demands 'emergency budget' But beyond what is announced this week there is, insiders suggest, a wider three-way fight going on over the best way to proceed. The Department for Communities and Local Government, which Mr Javid heads, is said to be pushing not just for more money to build new houses, but also for more loosening up of the planning rules and more power to get building going on publicly-owned land. The chancellor, sources suggest, is more focused on marginal changes to the market, as a traditional Conservative, to make the conditions more conducive for business to get building, rather than any bold intervention. But inside No 10, it is not just the prime minister who is all too aware of the political pressure on housing, but her chief of staff Gavin Barwell- a former housing minister - who I'm told is ""beating up on Hammond"" to go further than he is willing so far to move. Right now in the immediate run-up to the announcement no minister or government official would acknowledge on the record exactly what's going on. But these pre-Budget announcements, while important, are far from the end of the story. There is a live argument, that relates to the kind of government Theresa May really wants to run - intervene in markets significantly with all the opportunity and the risk that presents, or tweak round the edges and hope to influence the wider economy's instincts. In housing, as in much of her decision making, it just isn't clear which direction Theresa May really wants to go.

"Gen John Hyten (left): ""If you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail."" The top nuclear commander in the US says he would resist any ""illegal"" presidential order to launch a strike. Air Force Gen John Hyten, said as head of the US Strategic Command he provided advice to a president and expected that a legal alternative would be found. His comments come just days after US senators discussed a president's authority to launch a nuclear attack. Some of them expressed concern that President Donald Trump might irresponsibly order such a strike. Others though said a president must have the authority to act without meddling from lawyers. It was the first such hearing in more than 40 years. In August,Mr Trump vowedto unleash ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" on North Korea if it threatened the US. Last month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Republican chairman, Senator Bob Corker, accused the president of setting the US ""on a path to World War Three"". Senate committee questions Trump nuclear authority Trump and the nuclear codes Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum in Canada, Gen Hyten said: ""We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?"" As for the legality of a strike, the general said that he had studiedUS laws of armed conflict,externalfor many years which stipulates key criteria the president must consider before launching any attack: Necessity Distinction Proportionality Unnecessary suffering The armed conflict report quotesan International Court of Justice ruling,externalwhich states that while the threat or use of nuclear weapons is not prohibited by international law, ""the use of such weapons seems scarcely reconcilable with respect for the requirements of the law applicable in armed conflict"". While Senators and expert witnesses agree the president has full authority to defend the nation, commentators have pointed out that because there is no all-encompassing definition of ""imminent attack"", the president is not given an entirely free hand. ""I provide advice to the president, he will tell me what to do,"" Gen Hyten said. ""And if it's illegal, guess what's going to happen? I'm going to say: 'Mr President, that's illegal.' And guess what he's going to do? He's going to say, 'What would be legal?' And we'll come up with options, of a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that's the way it works. ""It's not that complicated,"" Gen Hyten added. This video can not be played Would the US military disobey a nuclear order from President Trump? He added: ""If you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail. You could go to jail for the rest of your life."" President Trump has not publicly commented on Gen Hyten's remarks. Senate questions Trump's nuclear powers Would military disobey Trump?

"This video can not be played Zimbabweans rallied to celebrate the army's takeover of the country President Robert Mugabe's closest allies in the party he founded are calling on him to step down, as pressure on him intensifies following a military intervention and protests. Senior Zanu-PF officials have begun talks on whether to dismiss Zimbabwe's veteran leader from the party leadership. The party's Youth League, previously loyal to him, has turned against him. Military leaders are set to meet Mr Mugabe later on Sunday. They are expected to make a further attempt to persuade him to resign. Mediation will be led by a Catholic priest, state TV said. The Newsday newspaper reported,externalon Sunday that a senior Zanu-PF member had called Mr Mugabe the ""outgoing president"" in his opening remarks to the party meeting. Journalists have now been excluded. In a statement the Zanu-PF Youth League condemned Mr Mugabe's allies for ""looting and plundering"" and his wife Grace for ""vulgar, cunning and unruly behaviour"", and called on him to stand down and to ""rest as an elder statesman"". Why Mugabe still commands respect What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe? What we know so far Nine of 10 Zanu-PF party chapters say Mr Mugabe should step down and their decision is likely to be endorsed at Sunday's meeting of the party's top body, the central committee. The head of the influential War Veterans Association, Chris Mutsvangwa, predicted to Reuters before the meeting that Mr Mugabe would be removed from the party leadership, and his wife would lose her position as head of its women's league. He then threatened to ""bring back the crowds and they will do their business"" if Mr Mugabe did not step down. Mr Mugabe has largely been confined to his house since the army took over on Wednesday. A cross-section of society took to the streets to press Mr Mugabe to go The army took control of the country after Mr Mugabe, 93, fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa. Mr Mnangagwa's dismissal made Mr Mugabe's wife Grace front runner to become next president. Mr Mnangagwa is likely to be reinstated as vice-president when Zanu-PF convene. Mr Mugabe has led Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980. Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans, including people from the ruling party and the opposition, took to the streets on Saturday to celebrate the army's takeover and to urge Mr Mugabe to quit. A historic day - BBC correspondents report They tore up pictures of the president and marched to his office and residence. He may face impeachment in parliament next week if he refuses to step down. The BBC's Andrew Harding in Harare says the situation appears to be getting out of Zanu-PF's control and there could be a broad push to introduce a transitional government that includes the opposition. Analysis by Anne Soy, BBC News, Harare It is understood that President Mugabe has so far insisted that he cannot step down and so legitimise a coup. The military maintains this is not a coup and there is international pressure to use constitutional means to resolve the political crisis. Negotiators are poring through Zimbabwe's laws to find a legal way out. Saturday's call for civilians to take to the streets looks choreographed to lend some legitimacy to the transition process being discussed. President Mugabe's support base has continued to crumble. Independence war veterans, who fought alongside him against colonial rule, have also called on their former leader to leave. But the biggest blow yet to Mr Mugabe could be delivered by the central committee of his ruling Zanu-PF on Sunday. Their meeting could see Robert Mugabe dismissed as party leader.

"This video can not be played ""It is not acceptable to us that so many fewer young Britons are able to own a home"" Philip Hammond says next week's Budget will set out how the government will build 300,000 new homes a year. But the chancellor said there was no ""single magic bullet"" to increase housing supply and the government would not simply ""pour money in"". Ministers want to speed up developments where planning permission has been granted and give more help to small building firms, he added. Labour says ministers ""still have no plan to fix the housing crisis"". Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show ahead ofWednesday's Budget,external, the chancellor also said: ""There are no unemployed people""while discussing the threat to jobs posed by technological change - when pressed later, he said the government hadn't forgotten the 1.4m who are unemployed The government was ""on the brink"" of making ""some serious movement forward"" in the Brexit negotiations Ministers would not withdraw a controversial bid to enshrine the exact Brexit date in law The health service will not face ""Armageddon"" if it is not given a Â£4bn funding boost demanded by the boss of NHS England The shortage of housing is expected to be one of the themes of the Budget, with Mr Hammond under pressure to ease the difficulties faced by first-time buyers trying to get a deposit. He said it was ""not acceptable"" that young people find it so hard to buy a home, and promised to set out how the government would keep its ""pledge to the next generation"". He did not commit to the Â£50bn reportedly being demanded by Communities Secretary Sajid Javid to finance a house-building drive, but committed to the target of 300,000 new homes in England. He insisted the government was delivering new homes at record levels, with 217,350 ""additional dwellings"" in England last year, but acknowledged more needed to be done. Javid: Borrow more to build houses Kuenssberg: The Tories' housing debates The Budget: What we know already Focusing on sites where planning permission has been granted, he said the government would use the ""powers of state"" to get ""missing homes built"". It also plans to pay to clean up polluted industrial sites for house building, get town hall bosses to allocate small pockets of land to small developers and guarantee loans by banks to small house builders. This video can not be played ""There are no unemployed people. We've created 3.5 million new jobs since 2010."" Most of the announcements will be saved for Wednesday, but they are also expected to include: Â£75m for artificial intelligence Â£400m for electric car charge points Â£100m to boost clean car purchases Â£160m for next-generation 5G mobile networks across the UK Â£100m for an additional 8,000 fully-qualified computer science teachers supported by a new National Centre for Computing A retraining partnership between the TUC (Trade Union Congress), CBI (Confederation of British Industry) and the government Â£76m to boost digital and construction skills The chancellor is also expected to announce regulation changes to allow developers to apply to test driverless vehicles - and revealed he would be testing one out in the West Midlands on Monday. The government is aiming for fully driverless cars - with no safety attendant on board - to be on the road in four years. ""Some would say that's a bold move but I believe we have to embrace these technologies, we have to take up these challenges, if we want to see Britain leading the next industrial revolution,"" Mr Hammond added. Driverless cars 'on UK roads by 2021' Tories, Labour and the big Budget battle lines Challenged on the impact of wider automation on people's jobs, Mr Hammond went on to say: ""I remember 20 years ago we were worrying about what was going to happen to the million shorthand typists in Britain as the personal computer took over. ""Well nobody has a shorthand typist these days, but where are all these unemployed people? ""There are no unemployed people."" Asked to clarify his remark later in the interview, he said the government was ""getting people into work at a remarkable rate"" and that it had not forgotten the 1.4m unemployed people in the UK. In a later interview with ITV's Peston, he said: ""The point I was making is previous waves of technological change have not resulted in millions of people being long-term unemployed."" Also appearing on Marr, Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell defended his own plans to borrow Â£250bn over 10 years to invest in capital projects and renationalise several key industries, saying his proposals would allow the UK to ""compete in a global market"". ""When you invest those sums you get a return on that investment that covers any cost of borrowing,"" he said.

The BBC's Andrew Harding in Harare says the situation appears to be getting out of Zanu-PF's control and there could be a broad push to introduce a transitional government that includes the opposition. Analysis by Anne Soy, BBC News, Harare It is understood that President Mugabe has so far insisted that he cannot step down and so legitimise a coup. The military maintains this is not a coup and there is international pressure to use constitutional means to resolve the political crisis. Negotiators are poring through Zimbabwe's laws to find a legal way out. Saturday's call for civilians to take to the streets looks choreographed to lend some legitimacy to the transition process being discussed. President Mugabe's support base has continued to crumble. Independence war veterans, who fought alongside him against colonial rule, have also called on their former leader to leave. But the biggest blow yet to Mr Mugabe could be delivered by the central committee of his ruling Zanu-PF on Sunday. Their meeting could see Robert Mugabe dismissed as party leader.

"Dyfed-Powys Police has told BBC Wales it received reports of historical sexual abuse perpetrated by a monk on Caldey Island in the 1970s and 1980s. The force investigated in 2014 and 2016 but could not prosecute as the monk, Father Thaddeus Kotik, died in 1992. The Guardian newspaperhas reported that Caldey Abbey has paid compensation to six women,externalwho were abused as children. BBC Wales has attempted to contact Caldey Abbey in Pembrokeshire. Court papers seen by The Guardian said Kotik carried out the abuse between 1972 and 1987 and the women, who were on holiday at the time, believe there may be many more victims. Kotik worked in the abbey's dairy and befriended families who regularly visited the island. After gaining the trust of parents he would babysit the children and sexually abuse them, the papers suggest. The women, who are not identified, said the abbey knew about the offences and failed to report Kotik to the police. In civil proceedings against the abbey, they said it was liable for the alleged assaults which occurred on its property by Kotik who was charged with the safekeeping and care of the children. The women said that Kotik ""terrified them into silence"" and said if they told anyone their parents would not want them and leave them on the island with him. In 2014, one of the women e-mailed the current abbot of Caldey Abbey, Brother Daniel van Santvoort, and told him that the effect of the abuse had been catastrophic. She said: ""Father Thaddeus' perversion has left me with ongoing feelings and experience of severe anxiety, fear, guilt and sadness. ""I have lived my life feeling a deep and misunderstood level of self-hatred and an inability to trust and believe in another person truly loving me."" The Guardian reports Brother Daniel had heard allegations previously about Kotik and in response he wrote: ""I have heard occasionally about this serious matter as regards Father Thaddeus."" He told her that the monastery knew about his offences and that he had been banned from contact with islanders and visitors in the 1980s but it had not been reported to the police. ""I am fully aware now of this terrible criminal offence and Father Thaddeus should have... been handed over to the police - something that never happened,"" he added. Brother Daniel forwarded the e-mails to Dyfed-Powys Police who asked for a formal statement which she submitted. In response, a Dyfed-Powys Police spokesman said: ""We can confirm that in 2014 and 2016 we received reports of non-recent sexual abuse that occurred at Caldey Island with the named offender being the deceased Thaddeus Kotik. ""These reports were recorded as crimes and victims contacted by police. ""During the investigation, information was obtained to confirm that the perpetrator was deceased and therefore a prosecution was not possible. Appropriate professional support was offered and the matter was drawn to a close. ""Dyfed-Powys Police always encourages anyone who has suffered abuse to come forward and report it by calling 101."" Brother Daniel apologised to the woman but, according to the Guardian, during the legal proceedings the abbey claimed it had no knowledge of the abuse. The Guardian reported it also argued there was an ""evidential disadvantage"" in that none of the monks at the abbey during the time of the allegations were still alive and claimed it was not liable as the priest was not employed by the abbey to provide care for children. The defence therefore required the claimants to prove each offence. According to the Guardian, it also argued that the victims were out of time to sue for damages and it was not possible for the abbey to have a fair trial. It is also reported that the abbey asked the court not to allow the claim because the seriousness of the allegations was likely to attract attention that may threaten the continued existence of the abbey. The women accepted what the Guardian describes as ""meagre"" compensation payments and received no apology. The solicitor representing the women, Tracey Emmott, told The Guardian: ""It took the issuing of court proceedings before the out of court settlements were offered and even then my client's request for a formal apology as part of the settlement package was never forthcoming.""

"This video can not be played Mr Adams said leadership means knowing when it's time for change Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams has revealed he plans to stand down as leader of the party next year. Mr Adams also said he will not stand for election to the Irish parliament (Dail) at the next election. Speaking at the Sinn FÃ©in ard fhÃ©is (party conference) in Dublin, Mr Adams said it would be his last as leader. ""Leadership means knowing when it's time for change and that time is now,"" the 69-year-old, who has been party president since 1983, said. Profile: Gerry Adams So the build-up was justified - to paraphrase one of Gerry Adams' most famous phrases, he is going away you know. The precise date will depend on the party's ard comhairle or ruling executive which is expected to meet within the next fortnight - they will in turn call an extraordinary ard fheis where a new leader will be elected. Sinn FÃ©in may hope that Mr Adams' decision not to stand in the next Irish election will make any talks about a future coalition in Dublin more straightforward. But the Fianna FÃ¡il Leader Micheal Martin has repeated his view that Sinn Fein remains unacceptable as a partner in government. Whatever the future brings, though, there's no doubt Gerry Adams' move marks an historic change as a leader who oversaw the republican movement's journey between violence and peace gives way to another politician who will pursue Irish unity through more conventional parliamentary politics. Mr Adams, the TD (member of the Irish parliament) for County Louth, said he would be asking the party leadership to agree a date in 2018 for a special party conference to elect a new leader. ""I have always seen myself as a team player, as a team builder,"" he said. ""I have complete confidence in the leaders we elected this weekend and in the next generation of leaders."" Mr Adams is surrounded by party colleagues after his announcement Mr Adams said the move was formulated along with party colleague Martin McGuinness before his death earlier this year. It has already seen Michelle O'Neill, 40, take the role of Sinn Fein's leader at Stormont. Earlier, delegates at the conference voted in favour of a motion to hold a special ard fhÃ©is three months after the departure of the party president. The motion will allow for a leadership contest once the vacancy arises. Delegates also voted to liberalise the party's policy on abortion. Party members voted in favour of allowing abortions where a pregnancy poses a risk to a woman's health, including mental health. The ard fhÃ©is (party conference) has been taking place in Dublin There will be a referendum on abortion law in the Republic of Ireland in May or June of next year. Sinn FÃ©in's previous position supported allowing terminations when a baby is expected to die in the womb or shortly after birth, and in cases of rape or incest. Currently, the law in the Republic of Ireland only permits abortion when there is a real and substantial risk to a woman's life. In Northern Ireland, terminations are only legal when continuing with a pregnancy poses a serious or permanent risk to a woman's health. Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader has called on the Irish government to appoint a minister with responsibility for advancing Irish unity. Michelle O'Neill told the party conference that a parliamentary committee in the Republic of Ireland should also be formed to look at a united Ireland.

"Critics say the tech behind driverless cars still needs a lot of work Driverless cars could be on UK roads within four years under government plans to invest in the sector. Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC the objective was to have ""fully driverless cars"" without a safety attendant on board in use by 2021. ""Some would say that's a bold move, but we have to embrace these technologies if we want the UK to lead the next industrial revolution,"" he said. However, the chancellor admitted he had yet to use a driverless car himself. Driverless cars on UK roads by 2021 - really? ""I'm promised to go in one when we visit the West Midlands tomorrow,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. Mr Hammond is due to announce regulation changes in Wednesday'sBudget,externalwhich will allow developers to apply to test driverless vehicles on UK roads. Asked about the potential loss of jobs for drivers, he said the country could not ""hide from change"" and the government had to equip people with the skills ""to take up new careers"". The chancellor admitted he had yet to experience a driverless car himself The chancellor is also expected to detail proposals to build 300,000 new homes in the UK a year, as well as extra money for NHS nurses' pay. The Budget: What we know already What to watch for in the Budget,external Tories, Labour and the big Budget battle lines Chancellor defends employment record - BBC News Will you need a driving licence in the age of self-driving cars? Mr Hammond's announcement comes after the UK's biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover,began testing driverless cars on public roads. The trials, which rely on sensors that allow the cars to detect traffic, pedestrians and signals, took place in Coventry city centre over several weeks. Jaguar said a human was on board to react to emergencies. The government said the industry would be worth Â£28bn to the UK economy by 2035 and will support 27,000 jobs. Labour quipped that under the Tories it would not only be the cars with no-one in the driving seat. Critics have warned the technology necessary for driverless cars to succeed is a long way from being ready. Former Top Gear host and now Grand Tour presenter Jeremy Clarkson said he was recently in a self-driving car which made two mistakes which could have killed him in just 50miles. Writing in the Sunday Times magazine, Mr Clarkson said the incidents convinced him the technology was still ""a very long way off"", adding: ""For now, we're miles away from it."" In the Budget, Mr Hammond is also expected to announce: Â£75m for artificial intelligence Â£400m for electric car charge points Â£100m to boost clean car purchases Â£160m for next-generation 5G mobile networks across the UK Â£100m for an additional 8,000 fully-qualified computer science teachers supported by a new National Centre for Computing A retraining partnership between the TUC (Trade Union Congress), CBI (Confederation of British Industry) and the government Â£76m to boost digital and construction skills Funding for 5G technology will go towards the National Cyber Security Centre to ensure the security of the mobile network, as well as testing on roads to help provide the network needed for driverless cars. A further Â£35m will be used to give rail passengers reliable mobile connections and ""lightning-speed"" internet during journeys. Trials are due to begin on the Trans-Pennine route, which connects Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool. Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the Budget needed to show a ""genuine, decisive change of course"" and not ""empty promises"".

"The vessel is the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet Signals have been detected that are thought to have come from an Argentine submarine that went missing with 44 crew on board, officials say. The defence ministry is now trying to trace the location of the seven failed satellite calls received on Saturday. Argentina has stepped up the search in the South Atlantic for the ARA San Juan submarine, with a Nasa research plane joining in. The diesel-electric vessel disappeared 430km (267 miles) off the coast. Britain and countries in the region have offered assistance. The US Navy is flying deep water rescue modules to Argentina to be deployed if the submarine is found on the sea floor. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The task of the rescuers has been complicated by heavy winds and high waves. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, to its base at Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires. Its last contact with the navy command was on Wednesday morning. An Argentine destroyer and two corvettes are conducting a search around the area of the sub's last known position off the south-eastern Valdez peninsula. But so far there are no clues about its whereabouts. It is thought that the submarine may have had communication difficulties caused by a power cut. Navy protocol dictates that a vessel should come to the surface if communication has been lost.

Addressing those people who had searched for Gaia, she added: ""I just want to tell everybody that every minute of your hard work has been absolutely worth it."" Gaia's cousin, Marienna Pope-Weidemann, said: ""We are absolutely devastated and unable to put those feelings of loss into words. ""Our little bird has flown, but she will always be with us."" Ms Pope-Weidemann added: ""We want to thank each and every one of you for everything you've done.

"This video can not be played Zimbabweans rallied to celebrate the army's takeover of the country President Robert Mugabe's closest allies in the party he founded are calling on him to step down, as pressure on him intensifies following a military intervention and protests. Senior Zanu-PF officials have begun talks on whether to dismiss Zimbabwe's veteran leader from the party leadership. The party's Youth League, previously loyal to him, has turned against him. Military leaders are set to meet Mr Mugabe later on Sunday. They are expected to make a further attempt to persuade him to resign. Mediation will be led by a Catholic priest, state TV said. The Newsday newspaper reported,externalon Sunday that a senior Zanu-PF member had called Mr Mugabe the ""outgoing president"" in his opening remarks to the party meeting. Journalists have now been excluded. In a statement the Zanu-PF Youth League condemned Mr Mugabe's allies for ""looting and plundering"" and his wife Grace for ""vulgar, cunning and unruly behaviour"", and called on him to stand down and to ""rest as an elder statesman"". Why Mugabe still commands respect What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe? What we know so far Nine of 10 Zanu-PF party chapters say Mr Mugabe should step down and their decision is likely to be endorsed at Sunday's meeting of the party's top body, the central committee. The head of the influential War Veterans Association, Chris Mutsvangwa, predicted to Reuters before the meeting that Mr Mugabe would be removed from the party leadership, and his wife would lose her position as head of its women's league. He then threatened to ""bring back the crowds and they will do their business"" if Mr Mugabe did not step down. Mr Mugabe has largely been confined to his house since the army took over on Wednesday. A cross-section of society took to the streets to press Mr Mugabe to go The army took control of the country after Mr Mugabe, 93, fired his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa. Mr Mnangagwa's dismissal made Mr Mugabe's wife Grace front runner to become next president. Mr Mnangagwa is likely to be reinstated as vice-president when Zanu-PF convene. Mr Mugabe has led Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980. Tens of thousands of Zimbabweans, including people from the ruling party and the opposition, took to the streets on Saturday to celebrate the army's takeover and to urge Mr Mugabe to quit. A historic day - BBC correspondents report They tore up pictures of the president and marched to his office and residence. He may face impeachment in parliament next week if he refuses to step down. The BBC's Andrew Harding in Harare says the situation appears to be getting out of Zanu-PF's control and there could be a broad push to introduce a transitional government that includes the opposition. Analysis by Anne Soy, BBC News, Harare It is understood that President Mugabe has so far insisted that he cannot step down and so legitimise a coup. The military maintains this is not a coup and there is international pressure to use constitutional means to resolve the political crisis. Negotiators are poring through Zimbabwe's laws to find a legal way out. Saturday's call for civilians to take to the streets looks choreographed to lend some legitimacy to the transition process being discussed. President Mugabe's support base has continued to crumble. Independence war veterans, who fought alongside him against colonial rule, have also called on their former leader to leave. But the biggest blow yet to Mr Mugabe could be delivered by the central committee of his ruling Zanu-PF on Sunday. Their meeting could see Robert Mugabe dismissed as party leader.

An army official, Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo, then read out a statement on national television, assuring the nation that President Mugabe and his family were safe. This video can not be played Why is Zimbabwe in such a bad way? The military was only targeting what he called ""criminals"" around the president, he said, denying that there had been a coup.

"The vessel is the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet Signals have been detected that are thought to have come from an Argentine submarine that went missing with 44 crew on board, officials say. The defence ministry is now trying to trace the location of the seven failed satellite calls received on Saturday. Argentina has stepped up the search in the South Atlantic for the ARA San Juan submarine, with a Nasa research plane joining in. The diesel-electric vessel disappeared 430km (267 miles) off the coast. Britain and countries in the region have offered assistance. The US Navy is flying deep water rescue modules to Argentina to be deployed if the submarine is found on the sea floor. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The task of the rescuers has been complicated by heavy winds and high waves. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, to its base at Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires. Its last contact with the navy command was on Wednesday morning. An Argentine destroyer and two corvettes are conducting a search around the area of the sub's last known position off the south-eastern Valdez peninsula. But so far there are no clues about its whereabouts. It is thought that the submarine may have had communication difficulties caused by a power cut. Navy protocol dictates that a vessel should come to the surface if communication has been lost.
