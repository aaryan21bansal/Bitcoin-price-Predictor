"In early 2012, Irish journalist Jonathan Spollen was visiting India - and then he vanished. In a series of interviews in the build-up to the anniversary of his disappearance, his friends and family have given their take on a case that has become no less mysterious over time. ""Some people say to me: 'Would it not be easier if you had closure?'"" Lynda Spollen says. ""But closure is my most hated word in the dictionary."" ""Closure"" is a way for people to ask her indirectly if she should move on, whether she should now give up hope of finding her son Jonathan. His last known conversation was on the phone with Lynda on 3 February 2012. She was in Dublin; he was travelling in northern India. They spoke for just under six minutes; not long, given the fact they could at times happily chat by phone for more than two hours. Jonathan told his mum he had changed his mind about travelling to Delhi. He would instead remain in Rishikesh, in the foothills of the Himalayas, to go on a short trek. He was reported missing on this date five years ago. Jonathan (left) with his cousins Will and Liz, who would later lead the search for him in India In school, Jonathan Spollen was a natural joker, perhaps compensating for his being shorter than most of those around him. But much to Lynda's surprise, he later turned into, they both acknowledged, ""a bit of a nerd"" - one who went on to take an interest in politics and Middle East affairs. When he went missing, aged 28, he had not had much of a break since school. From a politics degree in Dublin, he went on to a Masters in Middle Eastern Studies in London, before moving to work as a journalist in Cairo, Abu Dhabi (where I worked with him), then Hong Kong. It was only natural, perhaps, that he became a journalist - his curiosity towards the world was reflected in his writing, and his affability meant he had no problem getting people to talk to him. In 2010, in an article written after a visit to Indian-administered Kashmir, he expressed his fear he was idealising the simple life he had witnessed there. ""The whole experience, in fact, was as confounding to my world view as it was enjoyable,""he wrote,external, ""producing in me each day a lovely sort of confusion."" Jonathan aged two with his father David and mother Lynda Jonathan (L) with friends Robbie (C) and Jack Laffan (R), who both flew to India soon after he disappeared When people speak about Jonathan - people who knew him at different points in his life - they all mention his compassion. As a child growing up in Ranelagh, a middle-class suburb in the south of Dublin, he was especially caring towards his dying grandmother: as she hallucinated mice running along her curtains, he understood what he had to do, and carefully removed the invisible mice before putting them in a bin. While in Beirut airport in his mid-20s, he saw a Filipina maid being scolded by officials for bringing along too much luggage, so he paid her $300 fine on the spot. Later, when he had moved to Hong Kong, he encountered a woman sleeping on a park bench and in distress having lost her identity papers. Jonathan offered her his room without hesitation. Jonathan in Hong Kong in 2011 Jonathan and Hong Kong were not a great fit, and he left his job as a copy editor there late in 2011. As he travelled first to Nepal, then on a journey through India, he was contemplating what he would do next. ""This was very much a time for him to decide whether he was going to continue in print journalism or go into documentaries,"" Lynda says. ""Time to reassess things and make a plan."" By early February 2012, having been in the country a little more than two months, Jonathan's Indian visa was a few weeks from ending, and he was based in Rishikesh, a few hours north of Delhi. The fact that he disappeared here, of all places, may not have been pure chance. Rishikesh sells itself as the yoga capital of the world - and Westerners are among the biggest customers In early December 2011, Jonathan arrived in Rishikesh, a small, laid-back city of about 100,000 people surrounded by lush forests in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand. He was not alone - the state attracts more than 300,000 visitors a year, a third of whom come from abroad. Rishikesh, which pitches itself as the yoga capital of the world, is its most-visited city and is dotted with hundreds of yoga studios and ashrams. Its most famous visitors were The Beatles, in 1968, when they came to learn transcendental meditation under the Mahareshi Mahesh Yogi. The group's month in the city was one of the most creative periods in their history - while there, they wrote songs that later featured on The White Album and Abbey Road. Whether Jonathan was interested in a spiritual journey at this point in his life is one of the biggest questions at the centre of his case. Lynda is sure he was not going down this path; the subject never came up in their long conversations. Yes, Jonathan was interested in comparing different philosophies. Yes, he had once had a passing interest in Buddhism. But he had not expressed an interest to his mother in pursuing this journey in India, had not sought a guru, and had not been meditating, despite her encouraging him to do so. In their last conversation on 3 February 2012, he had told his mother he would be away on a short trek for a few weeks, one he wanted to do alone. ""I want to do it on my own, kind of a spiritual thing,"" he said, in a manner Lynda describes as lighthearted. About 35 minutes after they spoke, she texted him: She never heard from him again. When Jonathan failed to contact Lynda within two and a half weeks, she knew something was wrong. He was reported missing on 27 February, and those close to Jonathan began to mobilise. Among those to travel to India were his father David, who separated from Lynda when Jonathan was a few months old, Lynda's brother Eugene, cousins Will and Liz and assorted friends. On 11 March, police, led by detective Kundan Negi, discovered some of Jonathan's belongings. They were found in a woodland clearing a short walk from a small waterfall not far from Lakshman Jhula, a suspension bridge just outside Rishikesh. This video can not be played Policeman Kundan Negi explains where Jonathan's belongings were found A bag - not thought to be the main one he was carrying - appeared untouched, with his passport and money still inside. Nearby, Jonathan's sleeping bag was tidily laid out, with a book on top. Everything was wet, suggesting they may have been there more than just a few days. It all looked, in Lynda's words, ""as if he had just got up and left them there and walked away"". In the following days, some scrunched-up cards and papers, including his health card and Hong Kong travel pass, were found on a narrow trail a kilometre way. The discarded items appeared to point to one conclusion: Jonathan was doing what some spiritual tourists do in Rishikesh, deliberately shedding his possessions and his past life and renouncing who he was so he could follow a new path. Lynda seriously doubts the theory that her son was renouncing his past life. ""Knowing Jonathan, he would have had to be true to himself,"" she says. ""He would have done something wholeheartedly by throwing his passport away. Not doing that, for him, would have been fake."" He would, too, have insisted on communicating his thoughts had he been pursuing this path, Lynda says. The family learned what drives people who renounce by interviewing guests at ashrams in Rishikesh. ""One thing that comes across strongly is that you need to make peace with your family,"" Lynda says. ""That needs to be righted before you can go forward. Your family need to know where you are. There is no way he would just go off and not tell me, not contact me."" This video can not be played Members of the Parmath Niketan ashram in Rishikesh explain what the procedure is for renouncing one's life. On one hand, photocopies of articles on spiritual matters found in Jonathan's bag indicate this was something he was considering. But Lynda and others close to Jonathan say this fits his personality: he was interested in the world, in different experiences at the same time. One friend, Richard Pretorius, with whom he worked in Abu Dhabi and who joined the search, said his first instinct was that Jonathan had moved into an ashram. ""He was always seeking, learning, trying to be more human,"" Richard says. In one of Jonathan's last emails to Richard, on 27 December, he said ""the blinkers have really been removed on this trip"". ""The poverty here is astonishing and so much about the place is just an absolute mess,"" he wrote. Jonathan had been so moved by what he had seen in India, he had spoken of working with a charity to help those in need, Lynda says. Jonathan's cousin Liz McCauley, at the time a student in the Netherlands, was also part of the search team. ""As I gathered more and more information, the possibility he had maybe been seeking a spiritual journey, and the possibility that this was something he had chosen, started becoming more real,"" she says. ""Had he gone missing from any other city in the world, this whole spiritual journey wouldn't have come up. But you have to consider it."" Jonathan's uncle, Eugene Lane-Spollen, who also travelled to India, said: ""One of the problems is that, in our culture, the concept of simply being so crass as to disappear and not make at least phone calls, is just close to unthinkable. But in their culture, it isn't. ""We met people who had done that. Many people, in their younger years, do it and re-emerge having gone through some sort of retreat, a disappearance."" While Rishikesh has a sleepy pace not in keeping with much of India, the police there told the BBC there were risks that were not always obvious. ""Rules are not very strict about regulating tourism at the moment,"" said one police officer who asked not to be named. ""Many fake yoga centres end up registering themselves. A policy has to be made to check these fake yoga centres and gurus."" Not everyone in the city is who they appear to be, he added. ""People also have to be careful about not approaching any man with a long beard. That can be very dangerous."" Hundreds of people are reported missing every year from Rishikesh and the neighbouring city, Haridwar, police said. Jonathan disappeared in hilly terrain overlooking the Ganges river As it is, the possibility of a spiritual journey was one of many things that had to be considered. Other leads sent the search in different directions. Of concern was the fact an X-ray was found in Jonathan's bag, showing he had been suffering from kidney stones at one point - though they had probably passed by the time he disappeared. Oddly, given his closeness to his mum and how ill he had been, he had not mentioned his kidney stones to her. Had he perhaps received a wrong diagnosis, making him think he was more ill than he was? There were also reports that Jonathan had fallen and had been seen limping heavily at one point. He had lost weight too, and appeared frail, according to people who had seen him in the weeks leading up to his disappearance. How much could be read into the fact that a map to a doctor's surgery - drawn by someone other than Jonathan - was found? The high level of the Ganges river in Rishikesh at the time was also considered - Jonathan's family spent hours fruitlessly scrolling through a website that compiled snapshots of bodies fished from the river. While Jonathan's family and friends worked to gather more information across northern India, the events there felt very familiar to another family thousands of miles away in Australia. Ryan Chambers, right, with his friend and travel companion John Booker Ryan Chambers had already spent two months in India when he arrived in Rishikesh in August 2005, and he was getting ready to fly home to his parents near Adelaide. On 23 August, he was staying in an ashram in the city, but was restless all night. In the morning, the 21-year-old walked out of the building in only his shorts, leaving all his belongings behind. Almost 12 years later, Ryan's parents Jock and Di still do not know what happened to their son. Not long after Jock Chambers' third visit to Rishikesh, he got a call from a friend of Jonathan. The families then kept in contact; the Chambers' case offering a glimpse of how it feels to live with uncertainty for an even longer time. Lynda calls their ongoing efforts to find Ryan ""a constant source of inspiration"". ""You go from hoping that he is alive to, 'Hey, maybe we have wasted all this time and energy, and maybe he perished that night',"" Jock Chambers said. ""It's about keeping the right thoughts. You always have to think positively, but that's not always the case."" The theories persist - among them, the possibility that Lariam, an anti-malarial drug found in Ryan's bag that isknown to have caused suicidal thoughts, may have played a part. ""But at the end of the day,"" Jock says, ""it doesn't find him. It's another piece of evidence that is out there."" (There is no evidence Jonathan took Lariam during his India trip). The wall of 'Missing' posters in Rishikesh's police station makes clear Jonathan and Ryan's disappearances are not rare The Chambers family found their own way to deal with Ryan disappearing - Di told their two other sons it was crucial they carry on with their lives. As for Lynda Spollen, she developed a particular coping mechanism that has allowed her to focus completely on getting her son back. ""I feel things will hit me once I acknowledge Jonathan is missing,"" she says. ""The first thing that hit me was, 'He needs me now more than he has ever needed me in his whole life'. That was a very distinct sentence that came to me. As well as, 'I can't crack up now, I will do it when he comes home - and he can look after me'. ""There was Project Jonathan, and Jonathan the son. Project Jonathan became nearly like my mantra, and I lived for Project Jonathan for up to four years. ""There were little moments in those four years that were almost like a pressure cooker,"" Lynda says. ""I thought of Jonathan the baby, and I would let off a little cry. I was just afraid that if I allowed the emotional side through, I wouldn't be able to do Project Jonathan. I couldn't risk that, and I still can't, to a degree. ""But I have had to cope, because the reality, in the past nine months or so, has started to kick in. ""I found Project Jonathan protected me. It's like those stories you hear of people in crisis climbing Everest and managing to get down the mountain with no pain. They can get to the bottom and realise they have got there with a broken leg, before collapsing. It's like adrenaline. And that lasted for me."" Later on, Project Jonathan would be put under particular pressure by a strange development - one that linked Jonathan and Ryan's cases. Posters seeking information on Jonathan's disappearance had been distributed across Rishikesh and the wider area, and his case was drawing a lot of attention onan online forum,externalfor travellers in India, IndiaMike. Much of the information that made its way to Jonathan's family was vague - until one long message leaped out. It was written by a man named Babu, who said he was a dentist originally from India but now living in Australia. He said he had met Jonathan on a bus in Chennai (Madras), some 2,400km to the south of Rishikesh. Jonathan was well, Babu said, but was seeking a spiritual journey. He had been of great comfort to Babu on their journey, he added. The email volunteered great detail about Jonathan and his story, and was the most promising lead yet to his family. Lynda changed her travel plans and arranged to fly to Chennai and meet Babu. The search team in Rishikesh prepared to divert there to launch a major advertising campaign: Babu had given them their most promising lead yet. It was at this point that Liz McCauley, Jonathan's younger cousin, made an important discovery. ""We Googled his name and an email address that he had, and we didn't find anything,"" she says. But something had clicked for Liz, and she ventured back on to the website set up by Ryan Chambers' parents. ""We went through the guestbook there, and found a message from 'Babu', with the same email address saying, 'I met your son' - and we noticed it was basically the same story."" The mysterious 'Babu' was no more than a hoaxer. ""I rang Lynda and told her what we had found, which was devastating,"" Liz says. ""This guy had just been so incredibly legit - this one was so convincing."" The message left by 'Babu' on the website set up to find Ryan Chambers ""Had we not paid attention, we would have been spending a huge amount of money on advertising in an area that was irrelevant,"" Liz McCauley says. ""The practical implications would have been huge. It was hands-down the oddest lead we had, simply because of its believability."" Any hope that 'Babu' was for real was dispelled when a call was made to the hospital where he claimed to work. They didn't know him. The hoax was confirmed. As for the Chambers family, they spoke to 'Babu' by phone for an hour, but he backed out of plans to meet them. Some time later, they travelled to Chennai, but with no real hope they would find Ryan there. Their trip took a surreal turn when police tried to convince them an Indian boy they had found was, in fact, Ryan. Lynda Spollen did end up travelling to Chennai, and reported the strange email to police, in the hope it would prevent 'Babu' from repeating his trick with anyone else. She and Liz, perhaps surprisingly, feel some sympathy for the hoaxer. ""Maybe this is a guy who thinks he is just giving hope, a sense of comfort, by saying 'Your son is OK',"" Liz says. ""Strangely, I took strength from my encounter with him,"" Lynda says. ""It proved to me that this 'Project Jonathan' way of thinking that I had managed to adopt worked. ""I now know it was a traumatic stress response to the situation I found myself in - a type of survival strategy for me and, more importantly, my son."" The hoaxer did not respond when contacted by email by the BBC. Lynda Spollen says she ""might have to have a word"" with her son if he returns Since 2015, a year after leading a second major search for Jonathan, Kundan Negi has no longer been on the case. Despite that, he still puts up missing posters across the city, and he and his wife keep in contact with Lynda from thousands of miles away. While a missing person's case inevitably shakes those closest to them, it is easy to forget how the authorities at the centre of the fruitless search can be affected. ""Initially I gave my own phone number on the poster and my phone wouldn't stop ringing,"" Kundan Negi says. ""It was like swinging between hope and hopelessness every time my phone rang. People would spot any foreigner who resembled Jonathan and they would call me."" Those phone calls have now stopped. ""I know hope is fading with time, but I will not give up,"" Kundan Negi says. ""I strongly feel that he is alive, and I will continue to believe in it until somebody tells me otherwise."" There are no immediate plans for any of Jonathan's family and friends to travel to India again any time soon. Instead, like in Ryan Chambers' case, all the gaps in the story will be filled by theories. Lynda's best-case scenario is that her son has amnesia, was helped by somebody, and has started a new life, in which he is happy. ""There is absolutely nothing I would love better than to learn he had gone on a spiritual journey,"" she says. ""That would be wonderful for lots of reasons. I might have to have a word with him, but it would be amazing for him as a person, and for all of us who would love him to be OK. ""But I just know that if he could contact me, he would. That's something I have never doubted, not for a minute."" Additional reporting and video by Vikas Pandey in Rishikesh Find Jonathan Spollen Have you seen Jonathan Spollen?

"The 'Hitler phone', which Brigadier Sir Ralph Rayner brought home with him at the end of World War Two It was billed as arguably the most destructive weapon of all time when it went up for sale last week. Adolf Hitler's personal telephone, into which he was said to scream his orders from his bunker in Berlin, inscribed with his name and the Nazi swastika, is undoubtedly a much-prized collector's item. But then, the story was questioned. The material was wrong. The rotary dial was suspect. Why would it have been made by a British company? For Major Ranulf Rayner, the doubts - levelled by a telephone museum in the US, and a telephone expert in Germany - were a shock. After all, the relic had been in his family since 5 May 1945 - handed to his father, Brigadier Sir Ralph Rayner, by Soviet soldiers after he became the first Allied officer to enter the Fuehrerbunker, and quietly brought back home to Devon, along with an Alsatian dog statue that previously took pride of place on the dictator's desk. ""I'm just extremely angry,"" Maj Rayner told the BBC, following the publication of the claims in a British newspaper. A similar telephone can be seen in this picture of Adolf Hitler's bunker after the fall of Berlin (far left) Both Maj Rayner, then aged 10, and his sister Fleur can clearly remember their father's return from World War Two with the two extremely unusual items in his bag. And there was an equally remarkable story to go with how the items came to be in the family's possession. On 5 May 1945, Sir Ralph - then second-in-command of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's communications in 21st Army Group - was asked to make contact with his Soviet counterpart. After making the difficult journey through Berlin, Sir Ralph arrived at what remained of the Reich Chancellery. Here, he found a Soviet officer who, after agreeing that his general would meet Field Marshal Montgomery as soon as possible, offered to show him the bunker they had discovered three days earlier. A Russian soldier using Eva Braun's phone in her bedroom in Hitler's shelter in 1945 It was here, with the smell of burning flesh still hanging in the air, that he was shown to the private quarters of Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun. And then the Soviet officer - apparently eager to please his new friend - offered the black telephone which had sat on Braun's bedside table. However, Sir Ralph was more enthused by the red telephone near Hitler's bed, noting red was his favourite colour as he accepted the ""gift"", much to the delight of the Soviet officer. But that was not the only memento with which he left: he was also given a 12-inch model of an Alsatian by the Russians, taken from Hitler's desk after he told them he had an Alsatian at home. Sir Ralph's obituary in the local paper ran with a picture of him and the phone, taken in 1963 No one outside the immediate family was allowed to know about what Sir Ralph had brought back for many years. While Sir Ralph was in Berlin, Montgomery had decreed that anyone caught looting would be court martialed. It was only years later that Sir Ralph, Conservative Member of Parliament for Totnes from 1935 until 1955, felt he could show it off to the wider world. There is mention of it in German magazine Der Spiegel as far back as 1963. The family has spoken regularly of the telephone over the years. Indeed, the picture chosen for his obituary in the local newspaper in 1977 was one of Sir Ralph and the ""Hitler telephone"". However, when news of its auction broke two weeks ago, a number of people came forward to say they did not believe it was the real thing. Frank Gnegel, of the Frankfurt Museum of Communications,told the Daily Mail,externalthe fact the telephone had been painted red, instead of being made from red plastic, was suspect. The phone had Adolf Hitler inscribed on it He also queried why the handset had been made in Britain, and not by Siemens in Germany. Separately, The Telephone Museum, based in Lincoln, Massachusetts,raised its own concerns,externalabout the authenticity of the phone, as did a Dutch blogger. But Bill Panagopulos, who owns Alexander Historical Auctions, which sold the phone to an unnamed buyer for $243,000 (Â£195,744) last week, has dismissed their claims. ""Needless to say, we stand by the telephone's authenticity,"" he told the BBC, adding that the claims otherwise were ""insulting to the reputation and memory of a distinguished British officer and his family"". ""The only people who are making any claims about it are this guy in Frankfurt, a guy who runs a blog and a little museum in a shed,"" Mr Panagopulos said. ""Nobody else in the world has questioned it."" They cannot be certain about some things, but, most of the doubters' claims have been debunked by his or Maj Rayner's investigations. It has to be noted, both of them had a stake in the sale of the relic. But their arguments appear convincing. For example, when the phone was taken apart, it was revealed that even inside of had been carefully painted - indicating that it had been carefully crafted. Maj Rayner's own research - asking Peter von Siemens if he knew anything more about the phone - found Siemens did not produce a red phone at that time, perhaps explaining why it was painted. A porcelain figure of an Alsatian dog, which was owned by Hitler and later given to Sir Ralph He also asked a friend to write to Rochus Misch, who was a telephone operator in the Fuehrerbunker, to see if he recognised the phone in 1985. He did, saying it accompanied the Nazi leader everywhere for the last two years of the war. However, Mr Panagopulos concedes that, due to the passing of time, no one will ever be able to prove it beyond all shadow of a doubt. But, he says, the provenance of the phone and the sheer length of time it had been within the family, on top of the other evidence, helped him feel sure it was the real thing. ""Did it smell right to me? Absolutely,"" he told the BBC.

"Moonlight producers Jeremy Kleiner and Adele Romanski with director Barry Jenkins Even if the best picture announcement had happened smoothly and to plan, Moonlight's win would still have been regarded as one of the biggest Oscar stories and upsets of recent times. What could have helped it to victory over La La Land, the favourite heading into the ceremony? Well, there are various factors that might, just might have come into play. Firstly, of course, Moonlight is an exceptional piece of film-making. And it may well be that its coming-of-age theme, sumptuous photography and nuanced performances simply ended up resonating more strongly with voters than any of the rival films that were also nominated for best picture. Oscars 2017: Full coverage,external In 2016, after two years of #OscarsSoWhite, the Academy invited a large number of individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds to join and take part in voting. The Academy remains overwhelmingly white and male, although slightly less so than before. If it was a very close race, a somewhat more diverse membership may have been a factor. Jenkins on the Moonlight set with actor Mahershala Ali The Academy operates a preferential voting ballot. This means that one film could potentially receive the most votes as members' favourite film - which would give it victory in a first-past-the-post system of the kind employed by others, including Bafta - but still be beaten to the award by another film which had gained a significant proportion of second-favourite choices across the board. La La Land has led the race since it premiered at the Venice Film Festival last August to rave reviews. By the time many Oscar voters saw the movie, some may have felt that after months of superlative after superlative being heaped up on it, it had been excessively hyped. With the current political atmosphere in the United States, many Oscar voters may have thought that this was a time to honour a film that felt like a particularly important piece of work. Excellent as La La Land is, a win for the singing, dancing love letter to Los Angeles may have felt too frothy and self congratulatory. Moonlight tells the story of a boy struggling with poverty and his sexuality in Miami Moonlight, a film about acceptance and struggle, certainly feels like a movie that is more than a simple piece of entertainment. Moonlight wins best picture How did the mix-up happen? Diversity at the 2017 Oscars The Academy has around 6,500 members, and the reasons they will have voted the way that they did, of course, could and probably did vary wildly from voter to voter. The Academy doesn't release voting figures, so there's no way of knowing how emphatic Moonlight's victory was. It could have come down to one vote, it could have won by a landslide. But Moonlight winning against a film that seemed to be a runaway favourite is a huge achievement. And there's no doubt that Barry Jenkins' story following a character from childhood to manhood is a more than worthy winner of cinema's biggest prize.

"It takes one to know one. True, Sir John Major is not the only former Tory leader familiar with being pressured, perhaps held hostage by the Eurosceptics in his party. Or indeed, the only Conservative leader ever to have been challenged by his party's preponderance to ""bang on"" (to use David Cameron's phrase) about Europe. But arguably his experiences as the leader during bruising encounters with the ""bastards"" mean his words of warning might hold some value for the current prime minister. For Theresa May, also an unflashy leader who was propelled to No 10 by a surprising political moment, Europe will be defining in a way no others could even have anticipated. In Sir John's carefully calibrated speech tonight, there are plenty of messages for her, some of which may be welcome, some not. First off, having campaigned to stay in the European Union, with sober warnings particularly about the consequences for the Northern Irish peace process, it's no surprise that Sir John says that in his view, Brexit will be a ""historic mistake"". It is notable, although again not surprising, that he cautions that the UK will be a diminished diplomatic force in the world after we walk away from the EU, with a warning too that we will be less useful to our most important ally the US as a consequence. Also, even as the PM who lived through the Commons trauma of trying to deliver the Maastricht Treaty, it is logical that he calls for Parliament to have a full role in shaping the negotiations over our place in Europe. Follow live - Lords debate Brexit bill Sir John Major's warning during EU referendum campaign What may be harder for No 10 to dismiss is Sir John's obvious political concerns about how the public are being treated in the months after the referendum decision. Despite insisting he has no desire to be in politics now, he makes very pointed criticism of the atmosphere around the debate, warning that voters are essentially being misled saying: ""People have been led to expect a future that seems to be unreal and over-optimistic. ""Obstacles are brushed aside as of no consequence, whilst opportunities are inflated beyond any reasonable expectation of delivery."" In his first public comments since the vote, the former prime minister is offering what he describes as a ""reality check"". And he sounds alarm bells too about the tone of the debate, saying Brexit's ""cheerleaders"" have shown ""contempt"" to Remainers, shouting down dissent ""against our traditions of tolerance"". While he is not seeking to be unhelpful to the government, Sir John plainly has doubts about Number 10's handling of the process so far - the ""rosy confidence"" being offered to the British people. And in the depths of his speech there is another warning for Theresa May about the Tory MPs she has worked so hard to keep on side - ""today they may be allies of the prime minister, the risk is that tomorrow they may not"". Might Theresa May face her own ""bastards"" one day? In recent weeks, with Theresa May determined to keep the Tory party together, and Labour struggling to stay united, the momentum has most certainly been with those celebrating our journey toward the exit door. Ministers, even those who were ardent Remainers, privately sound increasingly optimistic about the prospects of doing a deal. But Sir John Major is not alone in having fundamental concerns. And his voice is harder for the government to dismiss, as they did Tony Blair a couple of weeks ago. One senior figure even told me some of the talks behind closed doors have been a shambles, and raised concern that the government, all of us, are a long way from understanding the full implications of the decision. Yet with almost the only political pressure on her coming from the right, Theresa May has decided to emphasise the opportunity, not the risks. The government is well aware that things could go wrong, but one minister told me ""we all have to discover the reality together, when the rubber hits the road"".

"The English language contains an alphabet soup of swear words. Those of a sweary disposition can draw upon the A-word, the B-word, the C-word, the F-word, the S-word, the W-word and many more. So here's a puzzle - if you see the F-word spelled out with all four letters, are you more offended than when you read F with asterisks? It seems many people are.  But why? After all, you presumably know what F with asterisks stands for.  It has the same meaning as the non-asterisked version. The BBC tries to avoid swear words whenever possible, but on the rare occasions that they are considered integral to the story, they are used without the asterisks.  Some other news outlets, such as The Times do adopt the asterisk convention and only print swear words when they are quoting other people. This reflects the view that using swear words is more offensive than merely mentioning them. The paper's journalists mention the swear words used by others, but do not use them themselves. But to understand why the full-frontal swear word might be considered worse than its pale asterisked imitator, we first need to define what a swear word is. By definition, swear words are offensive.  If a word, over time, ceases to be offensive, then it falls out of use as a swear word.  Offence alone is not enough, though, for we can offend with language without swearing.  The N-word, for example, is what is called a slur: it is a derogatory term about an entire group.  It is profoundly offensive, but it is not a swear word. Philosopher Rebecca Roache says that as well as the ingredient of offence, swear words tend to have a cluster of other characteristics.  We will often use swear words ""to vent some emotion"", she says. ""If you're angry or particularly happy, swearing is a catharsis.  Swearing also centres on taboos.  Around the world swear words will tend to cluster around certain topics: lavatorial matters, sex, religion."" There's also a paradoxical component to swearing, says Roache. ""As well as being taboo-breaking, swear words are taboo-breaking for the sake of taboo-breaking.  The whole point is that you're not allowed to use them, but they exist just for that rule to be broken."" Listen to thePhilosopher's Armson BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Monday 27 February Or catch up laterhere Words develop their power over time; it's a historical process.  In the past, many swear words were linked to religion.  But as countries like Britain have become increasingly secular, imprecations such as ""Damn"" and ""Jesus Christ"", have begun to lose their force. The Times leader writer, Oliver Kamm, author of Accidence Will Happen:  The Non-Pedantic Guide to English, says that the swearing lexicon now draws less from religion and more from body effluvia.  ""There's a hierarchy of effluvia, according to how disgusting we find them in public.  'Shit' is worse than 'piss' which is worse than 'fart' which is worse than 'spit' which is not a taboo word at all.  It's an interesting linguistic hypothesis that the taboos relate to how disease-ridden or dangerous or disgusting we find the effluvia themselves."" The emotional release from swearing has been measured in a variety of ways.  It turns out that swearing helps mitigate pain.  It is easier to keep an arm in ice-cold-water for longer if you are simultaneously effing and blinding.  And those who speak more than one language, report that swearing in their first language is more satisfying, carrying, as it does, a bigger emotional punch. Catharsis aside, swearing can boast other benefits.  The claim has been made that swearing is bonding: a few blue words, uttered in a good-natured way, indicates and encourages intimacy.  A very recent study suggests that people who swear are perceived as more trustworthy than those who are less potty-mouthed. But back to the conundrum.  If writing F with asterisks alleviates the offence of the full word why should this be?  Roache says swearing is best viewed as a breach of etiquette.  It is a little like putting your shoes on a table when you are the guest in someone's house.  If you know it would offend, and do it anyway, you are guilty of showing insufficient respect. ""It doesn't matter that it's a swear word.  Imagine meeting someone who has a fear of crisps, and who finds references to crisps traumatic.  If you carry on talking about crisps in their presence, even after discovering about their phobia, you are sending a signal that you don't respect them, you don't have any concern for their feelings."" Using the F-with-asterisks version acknowledges that we are taking the feelings of others into account.  By censoring the word we show respect. It's a view shared by Oliver Kamm, who endorses his newspaper's policy on asterisking swear words. Readers cannot help, he says, finding the full word ""involuntarily off-putting"". Like most people, I find exposure to too many swear words disconcerting.  So I'm off to wash my mouth out with soap. David Edmonds (@DavidEdmonds100) is the producer of The Philosopher's Arms.

"The claim:The government is planning to cut Â£3.7bn in funding for disabled people. Reality Check verdict:The government is not proposing a Â£3.7bn cut to disability benefits but it is trying to overturn a ruling that more people should be eligible. This will not affect the claims of current claimants. Last year, the government lost two cases in what is known as the Upper Tribunal - part of the courts system - about who should receive the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and how much they should receive. The PIP is for people who face additional costs because of a disability or long-term illness. It has two elements: the daily living component and the mobility component. PIP assessments are based on a system of points, which are awarded to claimants according to the seriousness of their conditions. The number of points an applicant receives determines whether they are eligible for either element of PIP and, if so, whether at the standard or higher rate. The tribunal's rulings covered the two elements. The first found that some claimants who require assistance to take medication or monitor a health condition should receive more points than the assessments currently give. The second found that claimants who suffer overwhelming psychological distress when taking journeys should receive more points. The effect of the rulings would be to increase the number of eligible applicants and increase the number of people who qualify for the higher rates. The Department for Work and Pensions estimates that the total cumulative cost of complying with the tribunal's decisions would be Â£3.7bn over the next four years. Disabilities minister Penny Mordauntreleased a written statement,externalon Thursday 23 February explaining that the government would seek to overturn the tribunal's decisions. That can be done using astatutory instrument,externalthat amends the Welfare Reform Act 2012. Labour opposes the reform and will seek to block the statutory instrument in the House of Lords and the House of Commons. If the government succeeds in getting the reform through, it will mean fewer people will receive PIPs in the future and fewer people will qualify for the higher rates. But it will not cut the awards of current claimants.

"Nantwich isn't the kind of place that sees many demos. On Monday morning, on a bitterly cold, damp day, more than 300 people gathered in the town's square to protest about school funding. Most were parents who turned up with their children and homemade banners. ""Am I worth less?"" read one damp cardboard placard clasped by a small girl. The parents I spoke to told me they wanted an amount spent on their children's education similar to that in other areas around the country. Until recently, many weren't aware this area was one of the lowest funded for schools. The protest in Nantwich shows just how politically difficult it is for ministers to embark on the biggest shake-up of school funding in England for a generation. There are limits to how much any school can gain or lose in the first couple of years - but that's barely taking the edge off the campaigns and protests bubbling up in areas such as this. Nantwich is in the relatively affluent local authority of East Cheshire, a low-funded area where many schools hoped to do slightly better under a new formula. As it turns out, some will get less in cash terms if the changes go ahead, because the new formula looks at deprivation at a local council area level. Not far away is Crewe, also in East Cheshire. It is a poor town where schools have coped with a growing number of children whose parents have moved from Poland and Slovakia. Like other schools across England, Sir Thomas More academy in Crewe will have to find money for extra pay, pensions and national insurance costs in the next few years. Despite school funding being at record levels, the bills are going up, so in real terms schools are feeling poorer. Head teacher Clare Hogg, tells me the combined effect in the next couple of years of the background financial pressures and the new funding formula will be a hole in her budget of Â£450,000  - roughly equivalent to 11 staff. The noise here is being echoed in some other counties, where every councillor is up for election in May and many of them are Conservative. Cheshire East has four Conservative MPs, who are all being lobbied intensely by their local parents and schools. As the Institute for Fiscal studies points out, this is also the first time schools in England have faced a real-terms funding squeeze for 20 years. Whether your local school is starting from the top of the funding pile or the bottom just depends on where you live. There is no easy solution, as it is the big cities that have received the most money over the past few decades. That is in recognition of some of the intense poverty and social challenges that exist within them. The new formula proposed would see cities such as Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham and Leeds losing, as some money is shifted towards counties such as Lincolnshire and Somerset. London is a big loser too, but starting from some of the highest levels of funding. The Core Cities Group, which speaks for big urban areas outside London, has already expressed concerns about the effect on schools. But there are no local elections in the cities this year. The political pressure from the counties may lead the government to tweak some of the finer details of the planned formula. The Education Secretary for England, Justine Greening, has been having a series of regional meetings with MPs, so she will be in no doubt that some are unhappy. Against the background pressures of funding per pupil going down, this was never going to be an easy ride. And after decades of campaigning for change, the counties also fear destroying the best chance they've had of getting some redistribution of money from the cities.

"The Brexit debate in the UK is focusing on the rights of EU migrants in the country, among them about 300,000 Germans. Many people are worried about what will happen to them after Brexit. But how are the 100,000 Brits in Germany feeling? The BBC's Damien McGuinness says many are hurrying to apply for citizenship. ""So, when are you becoming German?"" It's one of those questions that always seems to crop up when I'm chatting to British friends here in Berlin these days. Most are either applying for German citizenship or counting the days until they've spent enough time here to be eligible. That's because no-one knows what will happen to them once Britain leaves the EU. These are not the bronzed ""expats"" of the tabloid imagination - living it up in the sun, glass of gin in one hand, golf club in the other. They are young freelancers worried that if they need visas their work will dry up. Or pensioners living in rented flats, surviving on fixed incomes tied to a shrinking pound. Esme was the most organised of any of us. She made her first appointment with the German authorities the week before the referendum. She took the citizenship test, submitted all the documents, and a few weeks ago became German in a ceremony in her local town hall, in the Berlin district of Neukoelln. What surprised her was how emotional she felt about it. About 50 people, of 22 different nationalities were being granted German citizenship: Syrians, Americans, Iraqis, Turks, Italians, French - even a few other Brits. The local mayor gave a speech welcoming everyone, and reflected on the meaning ofHeimat, or homeland. And as she quoted from the German constitution, and talked about how all people were equal, regardless of gender, origin or ethnicity, Esme felt tears in her eyes. A cellist and a pianist played the 22 different national anthems of those present - by then, Esme was almost sobbing. And finally a singer came in to give a moving rendition of the European anthem, Beethoven's Ode to Joy - by which time Esme was in pieces. Not bad for an out-and-out liberal, who's usually pretty sceptical about flag-waving. ""It was the thought of the journeys that everyone had taken to get here,"" Esme explained to me afterwards. ""The wars that people had escaped from. And the efforts they had made to start a new life in Germany."" Some people had learned, off by heart, the declaration of allegiance to the German constitution, especially for the ceremony. Esme said it put her own worries into perspective. A citizenship ceremony in 2011 For Esme, and I suspect for a lot of the Brits who are now becoming German, what started out as a practical decision about visas and passports, is unexpectedly raising deeper questions about identity. Can you really be both German and British? And what does it mean to be German anyway? From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 BST and Saturdays at 11:30 BST Not so very long ago, saying to other Brits that you're becoming German would almost inevitably lead to some tired gag about Nazis or towels on sun loungers. And although some British headlines might still use those cliches - and you can expect a few more if Brexit talks get nasty - today, modern Germany is seen more often as a bastion of tolerant values: international, democratic and open to immigrants. Of course, there are people outside and inside Germany who criticise Angela Merkel's decision to allow so many foreigners in. But for those new British-Germans, themselves migrants, a country that  welcomes foreigners is attractive. Two new migrants learn German in Berlin In fact, being a German with a hyphen is a relatively new concept here. Traditionally German identity was an ethnic idea, related to bloodline rather than where you were born. So it used to feel as if Britain and America were rather better at accepting that people had layered identities - enabling you to be originally from one country, but a citizen of another. But over the past few decades Germany has been going through a difficult, and largely successful, process of redefining what it means to be German. Angela Merkel now refers to Germany as ""a country of immigration"" - an unimaginable statement for a centre-right chancellor until very recently. And today 20% of Germans are described as having a migrant background. Brexit-Britain and Trump's US, meanwhile, seem to be heading in the opposite direction. At least, that's what it looks like from here. As for me, my own citizenship status is a bureaucratic muddle. It's no doubt my own fault for moving around too much, but growing up in a globalising world I had thought passports, borders and notions of citizenship were losing their importance. Today though, as I scrabble together previously unheard of documents to avoid suddenly becoming an illegal alien, I can see I was wrong.

"Trevante Rhodes, Alex R Hibbert and Ashton Sanders share the lead role in Moonlight You might have missed itamid all the hubbub, but a film about a gay black man just won the best picture Oscar. Not only that, but one of Moonlight's stars - Mahershala Ali -became the first Muslim actorto win an Academy Award. And best supporting actress Viola Davis, star of Fences, made history as the first black woman to win an Oscar, an Emmy and a Tony for acting. Moonlight wins best picture - minutes after La La Land is accidentally announced List of winners in full Ceremony in pictures Diversity. It's a word that gets bandied around so much, and so often, it runs the risk of becoming meaningless. It's worth remembering, though, that only 12 months ago the #OscarsSoWhite controversy was all Hollywood was talking about. Two years of all-white line-ups in the four acting categories stung the Academy into takingconcerted measuresto broaden its membership's make-up. Viewed in that light, this year'slist of award winnersmakes for much more encouraging reading. Yet it wasn't just the winners who reflected the ""identity rainbow"" Jodie Foster spoke aboutat a pre-Oscars rally. Auli'i Cravalho performed How Far I'll Go, from Disney animation Moana From Loving's Ruth Negga to Moonlight's Naomie Harris to Lion's Dev Patel, the losers were a pretty diverse bunch too. Auli'i Cravalho, an actress of Chinese, Irish, Native Hawaiian, Portuguese and Puerto Rican descent, sang a song on stage. And Lion's Sunny Pawar, an eight-year-old boy who was born and raised in a Mumbai slum, got lifted aloft by Jimmy Kimmel, the ceremony's host. Fashion at the Oscars Oscar ceremony reviewed Highlights of winners' speeches Millions around the world were watching last night. President Trump, however, is not thought to be among them. Yet that didn't spare him a ribbing from Kimmel, or from being taken to task both obliquely and directly. Asghar Farhadi, the Iranian director of best foreign film The Salesman,stayed away in protestat the Trump administration's travel ban on immigrants. In his absence, a speech was read out that castigated the ""inhumane"" legislation for disrespecting his homeland and the six other countries it targeted. Katherine Johnson (seated) appeared with Janelle Monae, Taraji P Henson and Octavia Spencer There were many moments to cherish at this year's Oscars -some humorous, some moving and somedownright calamitous. Yet perhaps the most telling came when the stars of Hidden Figures arrived to announce the winner for best documentary feature. With them came Katherine Johnson, the 98-year-old African-American woman who was one of the real-life inspirations behind the space race drama. Could a woman born in 1918, who has lived through Jim Crow, segregation and the fight for civil rights, have ever dreamed of a day when her presence at the Oscars would generate a spontaneous standing ovation? La La Land may have won the most awards at this year's ceremony, but diversity was surely the biggest winner of all on Hollywood's glitziest night.

"This video can not be played The moment La La Land's producers realised Moonlight had won best picture With the wrong film being mistakenly named best picture at the Oscars - La La Land instead of Moonlight - lots of people are asking how this could have happened. Two people count the votes and know the winners in advance. Each has a full set of envelopes containing cards with the winners' names - just in case something happens to the other set. Those people - from accountancy firm PwC - stand on either side of the Oscars stage and hand the envelopes to the award presenters just before they step on stage. So after Emma Stone won best actress, the other best actress envelope was handed to Warren Beatty - who was presenting the best picture prize - by mistake. That explains why a confused Stone told reporters afterwards: ""I was holding my best actress in a leading role card that entire time."" Martha Ruiz and Brian Cullinan from Price Waterhouse Coopers (PwC) are the only two people who know the results in advance Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty with the red envelope at the centre of the confusion It looked like the veteran actor was fooling around when he opened the envelope, looked at the card, then looked inside the envelope again to see if there was another card inside. He checked again, then showed the envelope to his co-presenter Faye Dunaway. She read the words: ""La La Land."" Beatty explained: ""I want to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope, and it said Emma Stone, La La Land. That's why I took such a long look at Faye, and at you [the audience], I wasn't trying to be funny."" Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel said afterwards: ""He was confused because the card, which he showed to me by the way, said 'Emma Stone, La La Land' on it. ""So this was confusing obviously, we thought he was being coy and cute to make everybody suffer but in reality he was perplexed by why her name was on it.""

La La Land producer Fred Berger said: ""We lost by the way, but you know."" Fellow producer Jordan Horowitz then said: ""Guys, I'm sorry, no, there's a mistake. Moonlight, you guys won best picture."" And the third producer Marc Platt said: ""This is not a joke I'm afraid they read the wrong thing."" Horowitz added: ""This is not a joke, Moonlight has won best picture."" He then held the card up to the audience to prove his point, reading from it: ""Moonlight, best picture."" Cue bedlam.

"One of Germany's most senior banking executives has said the vote to leave the European Union should not be taken as an excuse to ""penalise"" the City. Dr Andreas Dombret, executive board member for the German central bank, the Bundesbank, said that the approach to Brexit should be ""pragmatic"". Although he said some jobs could be lost, London would remain ""the most important financial centre in Europe"". ""As there has been this vote, there will be a Brexit,"" he told the BBC. ""I see it as my job to make sure the transition is as smooth as possible, and we, I can promise, will be as pragmatic as possible."" Dr Dombret said he did not believe that Brexit was risk free. In a private meeting in Frankfurt earlier this month, hesaid that London's positionas the financial services ""gateway"" to the EU could be undermined. Further, trillions of pounds worth of euro currency transactions and insurance products - called clearing - would be likely to move to the continent from the City. Andreas Dombret, of the Bundesbank, says the Brexit negotiations will be a ""two way street"" But he made it clear that Germany saw Britain as an ally, particularly when it came to maintaining global regulatory standards. Dr Dombret said he did not want to see either the EU or the UK engaged in a ""regulatory rush to the bottom"" to try and gain competitive advantage. And he admitted that any risks to financial services were ""two-way"". ""I see risks not only for London; I see risks for Germany and for the rest of Europe, should there be an impact of Brexit on economic circumstances it will not be concentrated on Great Britain it will be also in the rest of Europe,"" he said. ""I see this as a two-way street. Of course there will be costs to such a development, but it is far too early to say what these costs will be and what kind of unintended costs we will have to face."" Asked how many jobs might relocate in the financial services sector after Britain has left the EU, Mr Dombret answered: ""It is very hard to put a number on it. ""They may not all necessarily go to Europe, maybe some of those job losses could go to the United States. ""I am not expecting those job losses from the UK point of view all to go to one city. ""[That] is also not that bad because then the risk is also diversified over several financial centres, I see some benefit in that too from a financial stability point of view."" Turning to the chances of a free trade deal for financial services between the UK and the EU, Dr Dombret admitted that there were a number of hurdles. ""I don't have 100% confidence this will work,"" he said, pointing out that the EU had never signed a free trade deal for financial services with a non-EU country. ""You have to have some scepticism. But, again, I know the government of the United Kingdom is very sincerely trying to negotiate this and we should be open, especially from the German point of view, to the EU 27, to everything in order to help Great Britain. ""By no means does it make sense to penalise the United Kingdom for having taken this view [Brexit]."" Mr Dombret says a number of banks have contacted Frankfurt about moving some services from London The Bundesbank has recently put information on its website for banks looking to move jobs to Frankfurt, the country's financial capital. ""This is only logical, if you as a bank are thinking of relocating part of your business to a city like Frankfurt, that you speak to potential future supervisors,"" Dr Dombret said. ""That is the most logical thing to do. ""So, I am not promoting Frankfurt as a financial centre, but of course I am willing to answer all questions and willing to entertain all meetings because it is only good for the stability of the financial system that there is as much transparency as possible and that all questions are being answered. ""It is just a service because so many banks are contacting us.""

"Teams sweep Kuala Lumpur airport for VX traces after the killing Only a few people know why VX was chosen - presumably by North Korea - as the chemical agent of Kim Jong-nam's assassination, and they're not talking. The (perhaps unwitting) women who smeared his face with the highly toxic oil are unlikely to know much about the substance. And the men who left the terminal in Kuala Lumpur for Dubai even as the victim staggered around seeking medical help are not about to share their secrets with anyone far from Pyongyang. But in South Korea, there is much speculation. Was it a deliberate signal from the North that nuclear isn't the only weapon of mass destruction just over the border? Or was it simply an effective way of killing a reclusive man in a public place? Re-tracing the killers' steps Who in North Korea could organise a VX murder? Unravelling the mystery of Kim Jong-nam's death It has certainly raised the temperature in South Korea. Monday's Joongang Daily says: ""The government must take steps immediately to protect the country from chemical weapons dangers."" The editorial raises the spectre of North Korea supplying terrorists with the substance (in the same way it may have helped Pakistan with nuclear technology and Syria with missile development). The editorial continues: ""North Korea is known to have chemical weapons from 3,000 tonnes to 5,000 tonnes. It could threaten the world if Pyongyang sells any of these weapons to Islamic militants or other extremists to secure hard cash."" There is no doubt that the attack has sent a tremor of fear through the defector community in South Korea. Fugitives who were previously easy to contact have gone to ground. Thae Yong-ho, the diplomat who defected from the London embassy last year, already had bodyguards as he went incognito around Seoul but they would not have been able to protect him against a seemingly innocent member of the public just coming up and smearing him with a speck of VX. South Korean TV coverage of the killing is watched intently at a restaurant in Pyeongchang Two years ago, the American ambassador in Seoul was lucky to survive when his face was slashed with a blade in public. How much easier it would be to kill someone with a mere trace of a chemical. The great advantage of poisoning for the assassin is that it can be perfectly targeted and it kills with little immediate fuss. Only scientific examination afterwards reveals the cause. Those behind Kim Jong-nam's killing watched, then left. Alexander Litvinenko, a fugitive spy from Russia, took tea with two former KGB agents in London in 2006 and died three weeks later of poisoning by radioactive polonium-210, believed to have been administered in the cup. The BBC producer, Georgi Markov, was murdered at a bus stop in central London in 1978 but his killer vanished in the crowd seconds after the victim felt the pin-prick from an umbrella used like a syringe to inject the fatal poison. He had been a thorn in the side of the Bulgarian communist government but so simple and bloodless was the killing that nobody was ever identified as the perpetrator. The efficiency of poison as a means of assassination is leading North Korea watchers in South Korea to think that there was no great intention to send a signal by using VX specifically. Koh Yu-hwan, of Dongguk University, thinks that VX was chosen because of its efficiency; North Korea - or at least leader Kim Jong-un - allegedly wanted Kim Jong-nam dead and VX offered certainty. It also offered the possibility that the death would pass as being from natural causes, at least for the time before a serious post-mortem scientific examination could take place. Chang Yong-seok, of Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies, adds: ""North Korea was already under immense pressure over its efforts to develop nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and also its human rights issues. Things will get even more complicated for Pyongyang if its chemical weapons issues are thrown into the mix."" There are benefits and costs to Pyongyang of being caught red-handed. On the one hand, it would send a signal to dissidents that there will be no escaping the regime's ruthlessness. On the other, it also says to North Koreans that the regime at the top is insecure and fratricidal. News from outside does get into North Korea and the revelation that one ruling Kim was allegedly having his half-brother bumped off could scarcely strengthen the regime in the people's eyes. There is speculation in the South about the role of the women involved As a columnist in Daily NK puts it: ""With the influx of information pouring into North Korea, more of its citizens are learning for the first time of Kim Jong-nam's existence, prompting them to speculate on the motive for the assassination."" There is some speculation in South Korea about the role of the two women suspected of carrying out the hit job. One researcher told the Associated Press news agency that the theory VX had been mixed from two innocuous chemicals into a deadly combination on the victim's face was unlikely. The expert said that VX could be produced in this way but not reliably.  It is more likely that it was applied in its deadly form by people wearing protective gloves. ""The security camera footage shows one of the women heading to the bathroom to wash her hands after attacking Kim. If she touched VX with her bare hands, she wouldn't have had the time to do even that,"" the researcher told AP. If the means of murder is causing debate, the motive is not. In dynasties with hereditary rule, brothers are rivals. The plot reads like a John le Carre novel or a Shakespeare history play, where those who share blood, spill blood.

"""Are you ready for honesty? Get constructive criticism from friends and colleagues, in total anonymity."" That's the promise of a new messaging service that has exploded in popularity across the Arab world. Sarahah is named after the Arabic word for ""honesty"" and allows users to send and receive messages anonymously from people in their social networks. It was created by a Saudi programmer, Zain al-Abidin Tawfiq, who says the site has garnered more than 270 million views and 20 million users in just a few weeks. Internet stats firm Alexa says the site is alreadyone of the most popular in Egypt,external. It has nearly 2.5 million Egyptian users, according to Al Jazeera, along with 1.7 million in Tunisia, 1.2 million in Saudi Arabia, and sizeable followings in Syria and Kuwait. Zain al-Abidin Tawfiq Visit theTrending Facebook page,external The popularity of the site, which launched in early February, has spilled over to less anonymous social networks, where users shared screenshots from the messages they received on Sarahah. The messages include confessions of romantic attraction, scathing remarks on people's personalities, and declarations of homosexuality. Users across the Arab world have been confessing their secrets using Sarahah There has also been an active online debate about the site. One Twitter user, Omar Ashraf, put the appeal of Sarahah down to hypocrisy: ""We have to hide behind anonymity to be honest with each other,""he tweeted,external. But another tweeter, Joseph Alfred,was touched,externalby the notes being swapped: ""I wish people who have sent sincere messages could make themselves known, so we could recognise their value in our lives."" Tawfiq, the developer, said that he had the business market in mind when he first created the website. He noticed that company employees had difficulty giving their bosses feedback. ""There are several obstacles [to open discussion] such as differences in age or rank, so in some cases anonymity makes presenting criticism more comfortable,"" he told Al Jazeera. Tawfiq said that though he ""did not at all"" expect the website to become so popular so quickly, he was happy with how things have turned out so far.

"Moonlight editor Joi McMillon looked on, with award presenter Warren Beatty in the foreground It looked like it was going to be the least exciting Oscars ever. In the end, it turned out to be the craziest. When La La Land's name was read out as the winner of the prize for best picture, that seemed to confirm this year's Oscars as being even more predictable and unmemorable than usual. But two minutes 22 seconds later, all hell broke loose. This video can not be played The moment La La Land's producers realised Moonlight had won best picture Later, in the Oscars press room, I asked the official Academy Awards historian, who knows everything there is to know about the Oscars and is on hand to answer journalists' questions, if anything like this had ever happened before. Her eyes glanced down, a sheepish look came over her face, and she replied: ""Not that I know of."" This just does not happen. This is the Oscars. And this is best picture - the final and most prestigious prize of the night. But it has happened - they announced the wrong winner, and 2017 now has an indelible place in Oscars history. The mistake was revealed while La La Land producer Marc Platt was giving his acceptance speech Wrong film named best picture at Oscars How did the Oscars mix-up happen? The complete list of winners Expert's eye on Oscars fashion Oscars 2017: Full coverage Until that point, the biggest upset was Hacksaw Ridge beating La La Land to the award for best film editing. That's how exciting it was. But La La Land was hot favourite to win best picture, so no-one was surprised when its name was read out. Its producers were midway through their well-polished acceptance speeches when hell began to break loose. Perhaps it was worth the mistake to hear La La producer Jordan Horowitz's line, delivered during that heady two minutes 22 seconds: ""There's a lot of love in this room, and let's use it to create and champion bold and diverse work - work that inspires us towards joy, towards hope and towards empathy."" He could have been referring to Moonlight. And when he was told of the mix-up shortly afterwards, his quick and uncomplaining concession to Moonlight was admirable. La La Land's Jordan Horowitz embraced Moonlight's Barry Jenkins ""I'm going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from Moonlight,"" he said before embracing that film's incredulous crew and relinquishing the golden statuette. Every time the TV cameras cut away to a celebrity in the audience, each was wearing the same look - astonishment and disbelief. Unbelievable. La La Land's leading lady Emma Stone was also gracious after defeat was snatched from the jaws of victory - although winning best actress probably softened the blow. In the press room, she seemed unperturbed by the turn of events. ""God I love Moonlight so much,"" she said. ""I'm so excited for Moonlight. Of course it was an amazing thing to hear La La Land, and I would love to win best picture. ""But we are so excited for Moonlight. I think it is one of the best films of all time."" Moonlight's Mahershala Ali and La La Land's Emma Stone: No hard feelings Let's hope, in that case, that Moonlight isn't just remembered as that film that won in that year the Oscars messed up and spoiled La La Land's party. It is a worthy winner, and deserves to be remembered as a beautiful, tender, touching, clever, bold work of art. And let's hope, for that matter, that this fiasco is not forever attached to the memory of La La Land. It would have been a worthy winner too - it is an audacious, magical, transporting cinematic achievement. And the fact that the directors of both films are in their 30s, and have been recognised as major new talents during this awards season, bodes well for future Oscar years. Perhaps there will be a rematch. The commotion also overshadowed the rest of the night's winners, who may have been largely predictable but were no less deserving. This video can not be played 'It's like witnessing a fire!' Viola Davis and Mahershala Ali were hugely popular best supporting actress and actor victors respectively, and delivered powerful personal speeches. The closest acting race was for best actor - where Casey Affleck triumphed over Denzel Washington, meaning history wasn't made by giving three of the four acting trophies to black stars. However, two African-American winners is a welcome result after two years of #OscarsSoWhite. As well as diversity, the other issue that was supposed to dominate the show was politics. This was meant to be the year when Hollywood railed against Donald Trump. And there were references to the current political turmoil. Presenting one award, Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal said: ""I'm against any sort of wall that wants to separate us."" Moonlight's Barry Jenkins indirectly referred to the president, telling those who feel underrepresented: ""For the next four years, we will not leave you alone, we will not forget you."" And ceremony host Jimmy Kimmel touched on the topic throughout the night - in a flippant way. The main political statement came when Iranian director Asghar Farhadi won best foreign language film - but was not there to collect the award because he stayed away in protest at Mr Trump's attempted travel ban. Instead, he sent a message saying: ""Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear. A deceitful justification for aggression and war."" The four acting winners completely steered clear of overtly political statements. Casey Affleck: ""I didn't say anything [political] because my head was completely blank"" ""Man, I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say,"" best actor winner Casey Affleck said from the podium. Which is funny because he did have something bigger and more meaningful to say when he won an Independent Spirit Award just a day earlier. At that ceremony, he said: ""The policies of this administration are abhorrent and they will not last. They're really un-American."" So did the actors and actresses chicken out of talking about politics at the Oscars? Or did they realise that preaching would have done little to change minds and would have just alienated half of the country? Affleck told the BBC backstage: ""Personally, I didn't say anything because my head was completely blank, [because of] the shock of winning the award and the terror of having a microphone in front of you and all of those faces staring at you."" So it won't be remembered as the political Oscars after all. But at least it will be remembered. ""Is that the craziest Oscar moment of all time?"" Emma Stone said of the best picture debacle. Pause. ""Cool! It's going to be history."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

"Best actress nominee Ruth Negga wearing a blue ribbon on the red carpet in Los Angeles. For celebrities and film-makers protesting against recent American political decisions, what bigger stage is there than anawardsceremony watched by millions around the world? Actors and directors used the red carpet at theOscarsin Los Angeles to broadcast their views on President Trump's temporary travel ban on immigrants from seven Muslim majority countries, issued in January. US courts have blocked the ban but the Trump administration is preparing a new executive order. Some stars pinned their politics to their (presumably quite expensive) sleeves and dresses. Writer and director Barry Jenkins wearing a blue ribbon as he accepts the award for best picture for Moonlight alongside actors Jaden Piner (centre) and Alex R Hibbert (right). Blue ribbons with the initials ACLU were seen adorning the outfits of several Oscar nominees. ACLU stands for American Civil Liberties Union - the civil rights organisation that was the first to successfully challenge President Trump's travel ban in a lawsuit brought to a federal court in New York in January. Irish Oscar nominee Ruth Negga wore the ribbon on a flowing red Valentino dress. She was nominated for best actress for playing Mildred Loving in the film Loving which explored the effects of Jim Crow - the legislation that enforced racial segregation in the United States until 1965 - on a mixed-race couple in 1950s Virginia. Full BBC Entertainment coverage of Oscars 2017 Mildred Loving's marriage in 1958 to white construction worker Richard violated legal prohibitions of mixed-race marriage in the US state. After being arrested and serving time in prison, Mildred secured the legal representation of an ACLU lawyer and their case eventually led to the Supreme Court ruling in 1967 that the prohibition of interracial marriage was unconstitutional. Award-winning(eventually) Moonlight writer and director Barry Jenkins also wore the ribbon, as did model Karlie Kloss and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda. The ACLU said it was surprised that it had spawned an Oscar fashion trend. The full list of Oscar winners The best fashion at the Oscars Follow our Oscars board on Pinterest,external Director Ava DuVernay took her sartorial protest to the next level by wearing a dress to celebrate the creativity of one Muslim majority country - Lebanon. She wore an embroidered gown made by Beirut-based fashion house Ashi Studio in what she said was ""a small sign of solidarity"". DuVernay directed the critically-acclaimed film Selma, which was the subject of another Oscars controversy in 2015 when the academy was criticised for failing to nominate DuVernay and the black lead actor David Oyelowo. Ava DuVernay tweeted that she wore dress made by Ashi Studio in Lebanon. Other stars protested with their feet. One Iranian directorcondemned the travel ban as ""inhumane""after he boycotted the ceremony altogether. Asghar Farhadi, who won the award for best foreign film for a second time, sent two Iranian-American representatives to pick up his award for film The Salesmen. They were not just any representatives - one was female Nasa scientist and Mars explorer Anousheh Ansari who read his acceptance speech. His statement read: ""My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of the other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the US."" Iranian-born US engineer and astronaut Anousheh Ansari read out Farhadi's statement A Syrian cinematographer behind the Oscar-winning documentary White Helmets was blocked from attending the ceremony at the last minute. Twenty one-year-old Khaled Khatib, who filmed much of the footage in the documentary that follows the lives of civilian rescue workers called the White Helmets in Syria, had obtained a visa to enter the US but was prevented at Istanbul airport from travelling. He still followed the Oscars though. As the ceremony unfolded, Khatib tweeted a picture of a child he said was the victim of a chlorine gas attack by Syrian government forces in a rebel-held part of the Damascus suburb of Harasta on Sunday. State media reported that ""terrorist groups"" had targeted residential areas of Harasta with a number of rockets, injuring 10 people, but did not mention a chemical attack. Trump's executive order was not the only immigration policy which sparked protests. Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal, who last yearappeared,externalin American comedy show Stephen Colbert as a Hispanic man who supported the wall, spoke out against the President's plan for a border wall between the US and Mexico. ""As a Mexican, as a Latin American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I'm against any form of wall that separates us,"" stated Bernal as he was presenting the award  for best animated feature film.

The Salesman tells the story of a married couple who are appearing in a local production of Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman and whose lives are thrown into turmoil after the wife is attacked while alone at home, sparking the husband to seek revenge. Asghar Farhadi sent a recorded message to those watching the London screening All six directors nominated in the best foreign language film category had signed a statement before the ceremony condemning a ""climate of fascism"" in the US. Farhadi, whose movie A Separation won the same category in 2012, had organised a free screening of The Salesman in London's Trafalgar Square on Sunday. London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the crowds: ""President Trump cannot silence me. We stand in solidarity with Asghar Farhadi, one of the world's greatest directors."" In a recorded message, Farhadi said: ""Despite our different religions, cultures and nationalities, we are all citizens of the world."" Donald Trump's originalexecutive order, signed on 27 January, said that all travellers with the nationality of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen were not permitted to enter the US for 90 days, or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa. Mr Trump said the order was not about religion, adding: ""This is about terror and keeping our country safe."" The order was suspended after the Washington State attorney general argued it violated a clause in the US constitution. Subsequent rulings have rejected reinstating the order. The Syrian cinematographer of The White Helmets, a Netflix film that won the best short documentary Oscar, was unable to attend the ceremony because he was denied entry to the US by immigration authorities. Khaled Khateeb, who shot much of the footage of the volunteer search and rescue workers risking their lives in Syria's civil war, was prevented from flying to Los Angeles from Istanbul on Saturday. Joanna Natasegara and Orlando von Einsiedel urged the audience to applaud the White Helmets The Associated Press reported that US officials had found ""derogatory information"" - a category that could include anything from terrorist connections to passport irregularities. Director Orlando von Einsiedel and producer Joanna Natasegara read out a statement by Khateeb after accepting the award on Sunday night. ""We're so grateful that this film has highlighted our work to the world,"" Khateeb wrote. ""I invite anyone here who hears me to work on the side of life, to stop the bloodshed in Syria and around the world,"" he added. The audience then gave a standing ovation as von Einsiedel made his own appeal. ""It is very easy for these guys to feel they are forgotten,"" he said. ""This war has been going on for six years. If everyone could just stand up and remind them that we all care that this war ends as quickly as possible.""

"Best actress nominee Ruth Negga wearing a blue ribbon on the red carpet in Los Angeles. For celebrities and film-makers protesting against recent American political decisions, what bigger stage is there than anawardsceremony watched by millions around the world? Actors and directors used the red carpet at theOscarsin Los Angeles to broadcast their views on President Trump's temporary travel ban on immigrants from seven Muslim majority countries, issued in January. US courts have blocked the ban but the Trump administration is preparing a new executive order. Some stars pinned their politics to their (presumably quite expensive) sleeves and dresses. Writer and director Barry Jenkins wearing a blue ribbon as he accepts the award for best picture for Moonlight alongside actors Jaden Piner (centre) and Alex R Hibbert (right). Blue ribbons with the initials ACLU were seen adorning the outfits of several Oscar nominees. ACLU stands for American Civil Liberties Union - the civil rights organisation that was the first to successfully challenge President Trump's travel ban in a lawsuit brought to a federal court in New York in January. Irish Oscar nominee Ruth Negga wore the ribbon on a flowing red Valentino dress. She was nominated for best actress for playing Mildred Loving in the film Loving which explored the effects of Jim Crow - the legislation that enforced racial segregation in the United States until 1965 - on a mixed-race couple in 1950s Virginia. Full BBC Entertainment coverage of Oscars 2017 Mildred Loving's marriage in 1958 to white construction worker Richard violated legal prohibitions of mixed-race marriage in the US state. After being arrested and serving time in prison, Mildred secured the legal representation of an ACLU lawyer and their case eventually led to the Supreme Court ruling in 1967 that the prohibition of interracial marriage was unconstitutional. Award-winning(eventually) Moonlight writer and director Barry Jenkins also wore the ribbon, as did model Karlie Kloss and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda. The ACLU said it was surprised that it had spawned an Oscar fashion trend. The full list of Oscar winners The best fashion at the Oscars Follow our Oscars board on Pinterest,external Director Ava DuVernay took her sartorial protest to the next level by wearing a dress to celebrate the creativity of one Muslim majority country - Lebanon. She wore an embroidered gown made by Beirut-based fashion house Ashi Studio in what she said was ""a small sign of solidarity"". DuVernay directed the critically-acclaimed film Selma, which was the subject of another Oscars controversy in 2015 when the academy was criticised for failing to nominate DuVernay and the black lead actor David Oyelowo. Ava DuVernay tweeted that she wore dress made by Ashi Studio in Lebanon. Other stars protested with their feet. One Iranian directorcondemned the travel ban as ""inhumane""after he boycotted the ceremony altogether. Asghar Farhadi, who won the award for best foreign film for a second time, sent two Iranian-American representatives to pick up his award for film The Salesmen. They were not just any representatives - one was female Nasa scientist and Mars explorer Anousheh Ansari who read his acceptance speech. His statement read: ""My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of the other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the US."" Iranian-born US engineer and astronaut Anousheh Ansari read out Farhadi's statement A Syrian cinematographer behind the Oscar-winning documentary White Helmets was blocked from attending the ceremony at the last minute. Twenty one-year-old Khaled Khatib, who filmed much of the footage in the documentary that follows the lives of civilian rescue workers called the White Helmets in Syria, had obtained a visa to enter the US but was prevented at Istanbul airport from travelling. He still followed the Oscars though. As the ceremony unfolded, Khatib tweeted a picture of a child he said was the victim of a chlorine gas attack by Syrian government forces in a rebel-held part of the Damascus suburb of Harasta on Sunday. State media reported that ""terrorist groups"" had targeted residential areas of Harasta with a number of rockets, injuring 10 people, but did not mention a chemical attack. Trump's executive order was not the only immigration policy which sparked protests. Mexican actor Gael Garcia Bernal, who last yearappeared,externalin American comedy show Stephen Colbert as a Hispanic man who supported the wall, spoke out against the President's plan for a border wall between the US and Mexico. ""As a Mexican, as a Latin American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I'm against any form of wall that separates us,"" stated Bernal as he was presenting the award  for best animated feature film.

"John Elliott is a big supporter of Brexit - the UK leaving the European Union Multi-millionaire businessman John Elliott leaves little doubt about his economic patriotism as his Jaguar car nears his factory in north-east England. ""Look at this area, it once produced the world's first locomotive steam engine, and now the Japanese, Hitachi, are producing our trains,"" he says dismissively as he drives. The straight-talking 73-year-old is the founder and boss of manufacturing business Ebac. Set up in 1972 to make dehumidifiers, in the past year it has also started producing the first British designed and built washing machine for 40 years. Ebac is based in the County Durham town of Newton Aycliffe, just a few miles from where Mr Elliott was born, and he has ensured that it will remain that way - in perpetuity. Instead of his two daughters inheriting the business and his Â£70m fortune when he dies, in 2012 he handed ownership of the company over to a trust, the Ebac Foundation. ""The trust means the company can never be sold,"" says Mr Elliott. ""I never felt it was mine to sell."" Under the trust arrangement, Ebac must maintain all work in Newton Aycliffe, and any surplus profits are used to help community groups, such as the local football club. Mr Elliott has ensured that Ebac will always remain in Newton Aycliffe Mr Elliott, who still leads the company, and is one of the foundation's four current trustees, says that his children, who both work for the business, are happy with the arrangement. He adds that he was particularly determined to ensure that Ebac could never be moved abroad. ""We could make more money if we started to make our products in Poland,"" he says. ""But, personally, I would rather make a smaller profit and assist the UK economy than make a bigger profit and devalue the UK economy."" With more than 200 members of staff, Ebac is a sizable employer in an economically deprived area, but Mr Elliott's opinions about his workforce may raise some eyebrows. ""They are not very ambitious but they're not second-class citizens, and there are a lot of them in the UK,"" he says. Mr Elliott says his employees are 'not here by force' ""They are reasonably well motivated, but they're at a low skill level."" Mr Elliott, who was against the introduction of the minimum wage because he views it as a brake on productivity, says it is wrong for generations of UK politicians to think that everyone should do well in school and get lots of qualifications. ""The wrong idea was that we should make everyone in Britain very, very clever so we wouldn't need to do any hard work,"" he says. ""[Instead], half the people in the UK - or thereabouts - want to work in factories like this,"" he says. The business is making the first UK washing machine for 40 years ""It's their choice, they're not here by force. If they would rather do an unskilled or semi-skilled job at a lower rate of pay then that's their preference."" He adds that while the UK still has a manufacturing industry it can be proud of, he is disappointed that so much of it is now in foreign hands. Mr Elliott himself left school at 15 with no qualifications. Looking back on this, he says: ""My biggest regret? Two wasted years - I should have left at 13."" Born and raised in a coal mining village near Bishop Auckland, County Durham, Mr Elliott and his two brothers were brought up by their mother and grandparents after his father died when he was six months old. After leaving school he became an electrical engineering apprentice, going on to work for a number of local companies. Ebac is highlighting the fact the washing machines were made in the UK His big break came in 1972 when he was 29, a client asked him to design an industrial humidifier and he set up his own company to make it. And thus Ebac [then known as Elliott Brothers Air Control] was born. Ebac has grown over the years, and today also makes water coolers and air-conditioning systems. Its annual turnover is more than Â£15m, with profits exceeding Â£3m. A keen supporter of Brexit - the UK leaving the European Union - Mr Elliott says it is a massive opportunity for the country, which the UK should embrace. ""Currently we sell to France and we sell to the US,"" he says. ""The US has tariffs and that's an inconvenience, but it's not a deal breaker. ""The way you sell stuff is to come up with things people want to buy. Mr Elliott hopes to ramp up production of the washing machines ""People imagine the UK won't be able to sell anything anymore to Europe. No, no, no. The rest of the world trades with Europe, you just have to deal with tariffs."" Emma Roberts, head of industrial strategy at the CBI business lobby group, says it is pleasing that Ebac is focusing on ""making a success of Brexit"". While Ebac's washing machines are currently only available at just 20 outlets in north-east England, Mr Elliott has plans to increase production. He says that its Â£10m washing machine assembly line could produce more than 250,000 made in the UK washing machines per year.

"Rex Tillerson is the antithesis of his boss, the Disrupter-in-Chief Donald Trump. He is also, in some respects, the antithesis of his predecessor, the garrulous former Secretary of State John Kerry. For the man who is the public face of US diplomacy, Tillerson keeps a remarkably low profile. Which has left staff at the State Department, and the journalists who cover it, wondering how he will fare against competing power centres in the White House, and how he will represent America to the world. Early signs have not been promising. For the entire first month of the Trump administration the State Department has given no public briefings. It's just been announced that they're set to resume early next month after an unprecedented six-week hiatus. It was not just the matter of being absent from the cacophony of a new order asserting itself in Washington.  It was the noticeable absence of an American voice to the world, a tool of diplomacy that has regularly inserted US positions into the internal debates of allies and foes alike. Tillerson himself has rarely spoken publicly. On his inaugural trip to a G20 Foreign Ministers meeting in Bonn and again in Mexico, he read prepared statements but didn't make room for reporters' questions and didn't respond when we tried to ask them anyway. This reticence is consistent with both his corporate background as former head of Exxon Mobil, and his personal style - a lifelong Eagle Scout who values actions more than words. He does at least avoid the pitfalls of Kerry, who thoroughly embraced the public role of top diplomat, but whose shoot-from-the-hip style sometimes left his aides backtracking after he'd departed the podium. Still, says one State Department employee, ""I think Tillerson hurts himself with this quiet diplomacy approach, because Washington is not a quiet town."" This reluctance is perhaps understandable given the freewheeling approach of the noisiest voice in town, the White House. It has, at best, sent mixed signals on key foreign policy issues such as Nato, Russia and China. But Tillerson's recent absence from Donald Trump's meetings with key foreign leaders has left many questioning just how much influence he has. State department officials point out that his acting deputy Tom Shannon was in the room for the visits of the Canadian and Japanese Prime Ministers. And that Tillerson was travelling during the official part of Benjamin Netanyahu's Washington trip, so he met the Israeli leader separately before he left. Yet while they were at dinner, the White House appeared to blindside him with suggestions it might depart from a long-standing insistence on a two-state solution to the Mideast conflict. ""If there's going to be a policy change, the State Department needs to know about it,"" a US official told the BBC. To a large degree, Mr Tillerson's understated performance reflects this confusion in the administration over who's in charge. The National Security Council - the traditional centre of influence in the White House, which usually works closely with the State Department - has been paralysed by staffing shortages and a leadership change. As CEO of Exxon Mobile, Tillerson was awarded the Russian Order of Friendship and had dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin Meanwhile alternative centres of power with undefined parameters have emerged: Trump's Chief White House Strategist Steve Bannon has set up a ""strategic initiatives"" thinktank to inform policy making. And his son-in-law Jared Kushner has been tasked with taking the lead on foreign policy issues like Middle East peace, with no formal connection to established State Department channels. Tillerson has his own channel to the president, says his aide, RC Hammond: ""The secretary and the president are in frequent contact, meeting in person and speaking regularly over the phone."" The secretary has, however, reportedly been frustrated with the administration over staffing appointments. The president had promised to let him pick ambassadors for many of the top-tier postings, two people close to the transition process told the BBC. But they said White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus circumvented the arrangement by winning Trump's approval for at least 10 nominees before Tillerson was confirmed. These are still going through the vetting process. The White House has not yet responded to BBC requests for comment. Battles between the administration and government ministries over appointments during transitions are not necessarily unusual. ""It sounds like part of the usual Washington game,"" said a senior State Department official. ""But what is unusual right now is the absence of a clear process, of who's in charge of policy formation or policy appointments."" Even if it was clear, the State Department is not fully equipped to help make policy. The White House did not approve Tillerson's initial choice for a deputy and almost all of the high level  jobs are still vacant. Just two out of the 116 requiring congressional confirmation have been filled, according to the non-partisan organisation Partnership for Public Service: the secretary of state and the UN ambassador Nikki Haley. Shake ups on the top floor are standard practice in changeovers between administrations, but this one was done ""in a manner considered highly offensive to all of us,"" said the State Department official. Some were given only 48 hours to vacate their offices and none were left to backfill until new appointments could be made, which is the normal procedure. Tillerson's role in these decisions was not clear, as much of it happened before he was confirmed. And there is plenty of expertise on hand to run the department in the meantime. But those who are acting in senior positions do not necessarily wield the same authority as those who've been officially confirmed for the roles, especially in the uncertain policy environment. We are ""treading water"" said one career diplomat, noting the difficulty of getting guidance on even routine policy decisions from the top floor. With such an introduction to the Trump administration the diplomat had been ""highly sceptical"" about Tillerson's appointment but was ""pleasantly surprised"" by his debut. Tillerson had wanted Elliott Abrams to serve as his deputy, but he was disqualified due to negative comments about Trump He came in strong with an opening speech that said all the right things - promising to make full use of the expertise on hand and suggesting that he'd have an open mind about dissenting opinions. That is what he seems to be doing, working his way through the building in methodical consultations that include not just senior officials but mid-level officers, as he navigates the steep learning curve from CEO to diplomat. This approach has been well received, although I understand there are concerns that he is not as accessible as was hoped. I have met Mr Tillerson in off-the-record settings and he seemed to me a thoughtful, deliberate man with an interest in taking a long-term strategic view. And while he is not anti-establishment in the iconoclastic mould of Mr Trump, he is an outsider - to diplomacy but also to the city. Perhaps that makes him less inclined to play by its rules. Whether that will work in this town, and with this administration, is too soon to say.
