"More than 200 Boots stores across the UK could be closed by its American owners Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) in a bid to cut costs. The shops - which are in areas where Boots has more than one store - are under review for possible closure. It is understood the review will take place over the next 12 to 18 months. Boots said it did not have ""a major programme envisaged"" but was always reviewing ""underperforming stores and opportunities for consolidation"". ""We are being realistic about the future and that we will need to be agile to adapt to the changing landscape,"" it added. The chain has 2,485 stores across the UK, employing about 56,000 staff. Patrick O'Brien, retail research director at GlobalData warned Boots' review could be too late to address its market share decline. ""Shoppers have been trading down to discounters, and trading up to higher end retailers for more expensive treats and gifts. ""Long term lack of investment in stores has become more noticeable to shoppers, and Boots' dated approach also extends to pricing, where multi-buy promotions and a generous loyalty scheme have made its shelf edge prices uncompetitive with discounters such as Aldi, Lidl and Savers, who have all been eating into its market share in health & beauty,"" he said. In April,Walgreens saidit would take ""decisive steps"" to reduce costs as part of a company-wide ""significant restructuring"". Boots has nearly 2,500 stores across the UK At the time, Walgreens boss Stefano Pessina said market challenges had ""accelerated"" in the three months to the end of February, but that it had failed to respond rapidly enough ""resulting in a disappointing quarter"". ""We are going to be more aggressive in our response to these rapidly shifting trends,"" he added. The review of duplicate stores follows Boots' announcement in February that 350 jobs were at risk in its Nottingham head office, amid plans to reduce costs by 20%. Boots is one of a string of well-known names suffering in a tough High Street environment. Last year, Poundworld, Toys R Us and Maplin all went bust and disappeared altogether. Other household names - Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look - were forced into restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of stores. The increasing popularity of online shopping, higher business rates, rising labour costs and the fall in the pound following the Brexit vote - which has increased the cost of imported goods - have been blamed for contributing to retailers' woes. Boots warns of possible store closures Boots may axe 350 head office posts 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Investigators say the owner cannot sell the homes until they prove their source of wealth Three London homes worth more than Â£80m have been frozen by the High Court in the second-ever use of anti-corruption orders to stop foreigners laundering cash in the UK. The Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs) were sought last week against a foreign official who was not named in court. The National Crime Agency has demanded that the subject of the probe explains the source of their wealth. The homes cannot be sold or given a new owner until the investigation is over. The properties are held by offshore companies. UWOs are a new anti-financial crime power targeted at foreign government officials and their families from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who are believed to have laundered stolen money through British property. If the suspect - known as a ""politically exposed person"" - cannot explain the source of the wealth, the NCA can ask the High Court to order the homes' seizure. The measure aims to target people who have committed huge frauds and embezzlements abroad where there is little or no chance of obtaining the evidence to convict them in a British court. The woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods Where are the properties owned by overseas companies located? Ukraine gang hid wealth in London flats The first ever UWO was used against Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of a jailed Azerbaijan banker, who lives in a Â£12m London home and owns a Berkshire golf course. Court papers disclosed to the BBC on Tuesday revealed how shespent Â£16m in Harrods over a decade without raising suspicions. That legal action has so far lasted 15 months - and she not only denies wrongdoing but is also appealing against the potential loss of her property. Zamira Hajiyeva denies any wrongdoing In a statement, the NCA said the three more recent orders were against property in ""prime locations"" in the capital. Andy Lewis, the NCA's head of asset denial, said UWOs are a ""powerful tool in being able to investigate illicit finance flowing into the UK and discourage it happening in the first place"". ""The individuals behind these offshore companies now have to explain how the three properties were obtained,"" he said. Unexplained Wealth Orders have caught the public's eye because of the extraordinary allegations of mysterious wealth hidden behind the doors of some of Britain's mansions. But the fact is that the cases so far brought by the NCA are probably the tip of an iceberg of suspected corruption. Of the properties owned by overseas companies in England and Wales, two-thirds are registered to firms in the British Virgin Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man - which means it can be difficult to work out who ultimately benefits from the asset The government is supposedly committed to banning the ownership of British property through shadowy companies - but nothing has been done. Until there is more clarity on who owns what, already-stretched financial crime investigators will struggle to seize the suspected billions of stolen loot washing around the British property market. Robert Barrington, executive director of campaign group Transparency International, welcomed the latest UWOs - but said much more needed to be done. He said: ""London has long been the playground of the world's corrupt kleptocrats and oligarchs - it's very encouraging to see that this is at last being challenged."" ""Two years ago we identified Â£4.4bn worth of UK property bought with suspicious wealth. From that list of around 150 cases, two have now been progressed."" He said the two cases represent ""progress"" but are ""still an insufficient response to the magnitude of the problem"".

"MacKenzie Bezos, the ex-wife of Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, has promised to give half her fortune to charity. She joins billionaires such as investor Warren Buffett and Microsoft founder Bill Gates in the Giving Pledge. The pledge was started by Mr Buffett and Mr Gates and calls for the richest to give away half or more of their wealth. Ms Bezos is estimated to be worth almost $37bn (Â£29bn). She and Mr Bezos divorced earlier this year. She acquired 4% of the company in the settlement. ""In addition to whatever assets life has nurtured in me, I have a disproportionate amount of money to share,"" she said in a statement. ""My approach to philanthropy will continue to be thoughtful. It will take time and effort and care."" World's richest man agrees $35bn divorce Amazon boss accuses National Enquirer of blackmail The Bezos backlash: Is 'big philanthropy' a charade? The Giving Pledge hasbeen signed by 204 individuals, couples and families,externalfrom 23 countries. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, CNN founder Ted Turner and entertainment executive Barry Diller were among the initial signatories in 2010. Pledges this year have come from hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones; Jeremy Grantham, who is co-founder of US investment firm GMO; and Emirati businessman Sheikh Mohammed bin Musallam bin Ham Al Ameri. The pledge is a public promise rather than a legal contract, according to its website, which says: ""The goal is to talk about giving in an open way and create an atmosphere that can draw more people into philanthropy."" Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan joined the list in 2015, saying they will give away 99% of their shares in the company to good causes. He said they were donating their fortune to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to make the world a better place for their daughter Max to grow up in. The shares, worth more than Â£60bn, will not be donated to the initiative immediately, but over the course of the couple's lives. Mr Bezos is not one of the signatories to the Giving Pledge. Last year, he put $2bn into a charitable fund he established to help the homeless and set up a new network of schools. The move attracted a backlash from some quarters as Mr Bezos has been accused of underpaying his staff. He is estimated by Bloomberg to be worth $114bn. Other top-10 billionaires who have not joined the pledge are Google co-founder Larry Page, Bernard Arnault, head of French luxury goods firm LVMH, and Mexican telecoms chief Carlos Slim. British pledgers include Lord Michael Ashcroft, Sir Richard Branson, Phones 4u founder John Caudwell, Stagecoach co-founder Ann Gloag, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, property developer Sir Tom Hunter, Lord David Sainsbury and oil businessman Sir Ian Wood.

"NatWest is the most complained about bank when it comes to handling fraud claims, a BBC probe has revealed. The Financial Ombudsman has seen a rise in complaints about NatWest, with it becoming the most complained about bank for fraud this year. In addition, in the last six months BBC Watchdog Live has had nearly twice as many complaints about how NatWest handles fraud cases compared to rivals. NatWest said it was ""working harder than ever"" to keep customers safe. Arun Chauhan, a lawyer and member of the Fraud Advisory Panel, told the programme; ""There's a growing body of evidence that they're falling behind other banks and how they're dealing with fraud, now that's on two things. ""That's on the front end side, that's their ability to pick up these transactions that are fraudulent and stop them in the first place, but the second is how they're dealing with customers, are they being fair to customers."" 'They [Natwest] blamed me as a customer,"" says Kevin Patrick Retired police officer Kevin Patrick was one of the many viewers to get in touch with the BBC after he was defrauded of more than Â£11,000 in June 2018. After problems with his email account Kevin contacted his provider, and was given a unique reference number. Shortly afterwards Kevin received a call from someone posing as an engineer working for the company, who quoted the same unique reference number he'd been given. With no reason to suspect the person he was talking to wasn't who they claimed to be, Kevin agreed to give them access to his computer. The fraudsters managed to access both his HSBC and NatWest accounts. An attempt to move money from his HSBC account was stopped by the bank and flagged as fraudulent. After being unable to move any money out of his HSBC account, the fraudsters managed to transfer Â£11,000 from his NatWest account. At the time, the bank refused to refund Kevin because he allowed fraudsters to take over his computer. After BBC Watchdog Live investigated, the bank recognised they did not get it right and have ""wholeheartedly apologised for the distress caused."" ""The way the bank dealt with it is appalling, they've blamed me as a customer. Basically they're saying that because I turned the computer on it's my fault."" ""As a former police officer, I find that really offensive because that's like blaming you as a victim,"" said Kevin. Fraud was also attempted on Kevin's HSBC account. However, the bank stopped this from happening. Arun Chauhan says how Kevin Patrick was conned was 'sophisticated' Fraud lawyer Mr Chauhan said the rules were clear and how Kevin was conned was sophisticated. ""NatWest somehow have not picked this up as an unusual transaction, Â£11,000 out of the blue, is an odd transaction. HSBC clearly have something that works and NatWest on this occasion have something that doesn't."" NatWest said it had recently increased the warnings it issued to customers making transactions on the app and online; updated its app; increased alerts to customers and continued to invest heavily in its security features. ""Since February, we've carried out additional checks on more than 11,000 payments and stopped Â£8.7m of potential scam payments after alerting our customers. ""When customers do become victim to fraud or scams, we treat each case individually and constantly update our processes and procedures to ensure they are fair and above or in-line with the industry and guidance from the ombudsman and regulators. ""Consequentially complaints to FOS have decreased by 48%,"" it said. The bank said it now wanted to work with the BBC to review the cases of the customers who've contacted the show because they've been dissatisfied with the outcome of their fraud complaint. ""We are a founding member of the Contingent Reimbursement Model code launched yesterday and are committed to working with regulators, law enforcers and the industry to try to reduce fraud and increase security for our customers,"" it added. A new voluntary code designed to stop victims of fraud losing moneycame into effect this week. The code sets clear standards for banks to protect customers against fraud and take action in the event it does happen.

"Scott Forsyth said his phone had not stopped ringing since Jamie Carragher's Twitter post A man whose mobile number was inadvertently shared on Twitter by football pundit Jamie Carragher has said he ""panicked"" when he was inundated with thousands of messages. Carragher tweeted a seemingly random number in a bid to mock his Sky Sports sparring partner Gary Neville - which happened to be Scott Forsyth's. Mr Forsyth said: ""My phone has not stopped ringing."" Carragher has been contacted for a response by the BBC. Mr Forsyth said he had received hundreds of calls and thousands of WhatsApp messages since Carragher's post on Sunday. Neville missed a clear-cut chance in a legends rematch of Manchester United's 1999 Champions League final against Bayern Munich. Ex-Liverpool defender Carragher tweeted that he was in Turkey and wanted someone to send him a clip of the miss via WhatsApp. He then posted a mobile number, sparking the deluge of calls and messages to Mr Forsyth. Carragher asked for people to send him a link to the clip of Gary Neville's missed chance Mr Forsyth, from Wylam in the Tyne Valley, told the BBC: ""I was driving home and my phone wouldn't stop ringing and I started panicking thinking it was some kind of virus. ""I was expecting to hear by phone if I had been successful in getting a job as I had been to an interview. ""I have no way of contacting these people so I'm just hoping they email me."" He added: ""I answered one of the calls and someone asked if I was on Twitter  - I checked Twitter and that's when I realised what was going on. ""I've had people asking me for Champions League final tickets and others asking if my Geordie accent is real."" Cheese rolling champ loves taste of success Cartoons poke fun at life on Hadrian's Wall 'How I made a secret Game of Thrones film' Some Liverpool fans who thought the number belonged to Neville, and United fans who assumed it was Carragher's, ""haven't been nice"", according to Mr Forsyth. He added: ""Part of me is annoyed but part of me can see the funny side."" Mr Forsyth said he had received about 54 calls an hour and a total of 50,000 WhatsApp messages before the tweet was deleted. But he then received a fresh wave of calls when screenshots were shared on Facebook. Mr Forsyth said he had not received any apology from Carragher.

"This video can not be played Campbell: 'I'm still in the Labour Party as far as I'm concerned' Alastair Campbell has defended his decision to vote for the Lib Dems in the European elections after he was expelled from the Labour Party. Tony Blair's former spin doctor said he had voted tactically. He said he would ""always be Labour"" but acted ""in the best interests of what the Labour Party should be doing"" by supporting a pro-Remain party. Shadow minister Dawn Butler said members who admitted voting for another party were ""automatically excluded"". ""It's just part of the rule book. Everyone knows that,"" she said. Mr Campbell, a lead campaigner for another Brexit referendum, revealed during the BBC's election night broadcast on Sunday that he had voted Liberal Democrat. After his expulsion, he told reporters: ""I think it's a strange thing to do, and I think people will inevitably draw the contrast between the lack of rapidity in dealing with cases involving anti-Semitism."" He was speaking after the Equality and Human Rights Commissionlaunched a formal investigationover allegations of anti-Semitism within Labour. Mr Campbell added that he believed other Labour MPs, councillors and peers voted in the same way as he did to try and make the leadership alter its position on Brexit. Labour lost ground in the European elections, and some figures have called for Jeremy Corbyn to unequivocally back another referendum to win back support, especially from Remainers. ""I don't think I've left the Labour Party, and I'll always be Labour. I suspect I will be in and around Labour longer than some of the people around Jeremy Corbyn at the moment"", Mr Campbell added. He said he would appeal against the decision to expel him. He added that he wanted to vote Labour at the next general election, but it would ""depend on the policy that the Labour Party puts forward between now and then in relation to Brexit"". The Labour Party said: ""The way... members vote is a private matter. But publicly declaring or encouraging support for another candidate or party is against the rules and is incompatible with party membership."" This video can not be played ""I voted Liberal Democrat"" says Alastair Campbell In Twitter posts earlier, Mr Campbell claimed the decision also ""contrasts with our era"" when Mr Blair was ""pressed"" to withdraw the Labour whip from Jeremy Corbyn for voting against the party - but the then-PM said no. Following Mr Campbell's expulsion from the party, former Labour ministers Charles Clarke and Bob Ainsworth said they had voted for parties other than Labour in the European elections. Calling on Labour to reinstate Mr Campbell, Mr Clarke said he voted Liberal Democrat as a ""one-off decision because of the hopeless incoherence of Labour's position, particularly that of Jeremy Corbyn, on Brexit"". The former home secretary said Mr Campbell's expulsion was ""a disgrace and only compounds Labour's current political difficulties"". Mr Ainsworth - a defence secretary in Gordon Brown's government - told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire: ""Having recently voted Labour in local elections, I voted Green in the Euro elections having never voted other than Labour before in my entire life. ""I didn't intend to make this public, but now Alastair has been expelled for doing the same I feel obliged to do so."" Alastair Campbell with former PM Tony Blair Mr Campbell was a political journalist before coming to prominence in Whitehall as a key member of the Labour PM's staff in 1994. He served as Mr Blair's chief press secretary until 2000 and was a controversial figure, heavily involved in policy, including over the Iraq War. Since leaving government, he has opened up about his struggles with depression and alcoholism, and works with a number of charities. He also campaigns for the People's Vote and is editor-at-large of The New European magazine. Labour MPs have used Twitter to criticise the move to expel Alastair Campbell. Jess Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, tweeted that Mr Campbell was ""expelled quicker than a man who threatened to kill me [and] quicker than a man in my [local party] who denied the Holocaust"", adding: ""Both are only still suspended."" Barking MP and campaigner against anti-Semitism Margaret Hodge said the party's ""priorities are all wrong"", And former Lord Chancellor in Mr Blair's government, Lord Falconer, said Mr Campbell was ""Labour through and through"", adding: ""Voting [Lib Dem] once in a lifetime on one issue should not lead to expulsion."" But Labour activist and commentator Owen Jones questioned why there was ""controversy"" over his expulsion, adding: ""The rule is, if you say you're voting for another party, you auto exclude yourself. ""Those arguing this rule shouldn't apply to Alastair Campbell do so because they agree with him and for no other reason."" Last week, veteran Conservative and pro-European Lord Heseltine admitted he planned to vote Lib Dem in the election.The party responded by effectively expelling him. Labour's share of the vote fell to 14% in last week's European elections andseveral senior figures have blamed a lack of clarity around Brexit. The party agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's withdrawal deal with the EU - which it has effectively done three times - or talks ended in no-deal, there should be a general election. But if it could not force one, conference agreed that the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". Deputy leader Tom Watson said that nuanced stance had led to ""electoral catastrophe"", while former PM Tony Blair said it was not ""possible to sit on the fence on Europe and appeal to both sides"". After the results, Mr Corbyn insisted his policy had been ""very clear"" all along - but sent a letter to his MPs, saying it was ""clear that the deadlock in Parliament can now only be broken by the issue going back to the people through a general election or a public vote"".

"Councils have faced protests over cuts but some have come close to running out of cash savings Some councils in England have been warned they risk running out of cash reserves if recent spending continues. Analysis by the BBC has identified 11 authorities the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa) said would have ""fully exhausted"" reserves within four years unless they topped them up. The Local Government Association said councils faced ""systemic underfunding"". The government said councils were responsible for managing their funds. Councils have facedcuts to their government fundingand rising demand for services such as social care, while MPs have warnedchildren's services are at ""breaking point"". Cash reserves - money held back for specific projects or emergencies, such as flooding - are seen as a measure of financial security. Between them the 152 major councils in England had Â£14bn in reserve in March 2018, Â£500m more than the year before but Â£400m less than in 2015. The BBC analysis ofgovernment data,externalfollows work by Cipfa, whichpublished a ""resilience"" index of councils,external, but stopped short of naming those it warned were depleting reserves the fastest. The warning was based on the latest data available, comparing reserves as of March 2018 with March 2015. The analysis reveals which 11 of the 152 major English councils have used so much of their reserves since 2015 that Cipfa said they would run out within four years if spending patterns continued. The research comes ahead ofWednesday's Panorama, which reveals the failings of the social care system as the population gets older and more people need help with day to day living. Councillor Richard Watts from the Local Government Association said: ""Some councils are facing a choice between using reserves to try and plug funding gaps or further cutting back local services in order to balance the books. ""This is unsustainable and does nothing to address the systemic underfunding that they face. Ongoing funding gaps are simply too big to be plugged by reserves."" The data showed Northamptonshire County Council recorded a 91% drop in reserves. The authority was forced to stop non-essential spending during 2017-18. Thurrock Council was shown to have spent 58% of its reserves but insisted it was planned and the authority was not running out of money. Somerset County Council said it was putting money back into its reserves after data showed a 73% fall. Croydon Council appeared to have spent more than half of its reserves but said the government data was ""inaccurate"" and its reserves ""remain strong"". The council has asked for them to be corrected. Councils cannot borrow money for day-to-day spending so hold reserves for unexpected events or emergencies, such as flooding. Under the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government local councils were told they should not""hoard"" billions of pounds in their reserves. In guidance to councils Cipfa said: ""Balancing the annual budget by drawing on general reserves may be viewed as a legitimate short-term option. However, it is not normally prudent for reserves to be deployed to finance recurrent expenditure."" It stressed that there may be ""good reasons"" for councils to have used reserves for planned spending but added that ""continued depletion of reserves may be a sign of financial stress and being unable to deliver a balanced budget"". Professor Tony Travers of the London School of Economics said: ""We did see for many councils reserves increased during 2017-18, but the pressure on budgets is not going to go away and for some the need to make further use of reserves is going to be unavoidable. ""Emergencies can happen and sudden increases in spending can be needed. Councils need to be resilient or they end up in the position Northamptonshire was in. However, they don't know their funding position from one year to the next."" In a report on thefinancial sustainability of councils,externalin 2018 the National Audit Office said: ""Reducing reserve levels means that local authorities have less scope to support 'invest to save' programmes, and any delays in delivering savings or unexpected cost pressures have a greater impact on their financial position."" Northamptonshire County Council twice banned spending in 2018 Councils said they face shortfalls in funding due to cuts in government grants. However, those identified as having used a lot of their reserves insisted they were not running out of cash. Northamptonshire County Counciloverspent by millions of pounds, leading toplans for it to merge with the smaller district councils. It said there had been ""an improvement and stabilisation"" during 2018-19 with Â£20m going back into reserves. Somerset County Councilfaced a budget gap of Â£28m over three years and announced cuts to various services. It intends to put more money into reserves, reaching Â£19m by March 2020. It said the reserves it used included funding provided by the government to cope with severe flooding. Rotherham Councilsaid its reserves had not fallen as much as the government data showed, due to changes in accounting.  A spokeswoman said: ""Although the picture is better than is portrayed here, we have still had to use our reserves due to increased demand on social care services over the last few years, as the funding from central government is not enough to manage these costs."" Thurrock Councilsaid it was in ""one of the strongest financial positions of any unitary authority"" in England and had frozen council tax. It said its reserves had stayed stable and it had used ""earmarked"" reserves as planned. ""Earmarked reserves do not represent the council's financial strength in any way and to use them to suggest otherwise is misleading and incorrect,"" said deputy leader Councillor Shane Hebb. Croydon Councilsaid the figures in the government data were inaccurate and it had not run down its reserves. It added: ""We expect our finances to continue to remain stable and solvent."" Stoke-on-Trent City Councilsaid auditors had ""no concerns to raise"" over its accounts and it was budgeting to increase reserves. Sutton Councilsaid its figures were from an earlier ""estimate"" and it had Â£33m in reserve in 2018, not the Â£30.8m in the government data. It added: ""Reserves are actively managed according to our consideration of risk and programme of work."" Knowsley Councilsaid it paid Â£16.6m out of reserves to cover three years' worth of planned pension deficit payments in one go. It said the payments had been made in advance to save the council Â£1.8m and there was a ""clear repayment plan in place"". It added reserves were not being used to fund day-to-day services and were not running out. Greenwich Councilsaid it had a Â£125m funding shortfall but stressed most of the reserves used were for planned regeneration projects, with figures also showing a change in accounting for schools' funds. The council said asking people topay more council tax""has not been easy."" Medway Councilsaid it had used reserves to cover an ""unexpected"" number of business rates appeals as well as a planned ""community hub programme"". Heather Jameson, editor of the Municipal Journal, said councils had done an ""extraordinary job"" in keeping their books balanced by cutting staff, remodelling services and starting commercial ventures, but it was ""no longer enough"". ""Despite past political pressure to run down reserves to pay for services, any council with a sound financial plan is likely to hold money in reserve,"" she said. ""While health services can overspend or 'go bust' councils are legally required to balance their books and failing to keep some cash for emergencies is a risk that most are not willing to take. ""However, the pressure on budgets is making it increasingly difficult to hold cash in reserves."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies said despite increases in council tax, local authorities had made substantial cuts to protect adult social care and children's services. Economist Neil Amin Smith said: ""Either councils will have to stop providing some of the services that they currently provide, central government grant funding will have to be re-introduced, or councils will have to be given access to additional sources of revenue."" A government spokesman said this year's local government finance settlement included extra funding for local services. He said: ""Councils are democratically elected bodies responsible for making their own financial decisions and managing their resources. ""All local authorities are required to hold sufficient unallocated reserves to meet unexpected financial risks."" He said local government had access to Â£46.4bn in 2019-20.

"Friends and colleagues said Khuram Butt was a ""normal guy"" The ringleader of the 2017 London Bridge terror attack was ""like a lion out of a cage"" when he was with convicted Islamic State supporter Anjem Choudary, an inquest has heard. A friend said Khuram Butt, 27, became ""energised"" when meeting Choudary,who led the banned Al-Muhajiroun group. In 2015 a relative reported Butt to an anti-terrorist hotline, a court heard. Eight people were killed in the terror attack he carried out with Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22. The men mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market, injuring 48 others. Police shot and killed the three attackers less than 10 minutes after the violence began. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack The inquest at the Old Bailey heard how Butt turned from an ""earnest and hard-working"" schoolboy to an extremist who told a colleague the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in a 2013 terror attack was ""an eye for an eye"". In his early 20s friends and colleagues said he was a ""normal guy"" who liked football and music and smoked cannabis. However, around 2013, he began showing signs of extremism and two years later his family became concerned he wanted to travel to Syria. Butt had bought a ticket to travel and his family threatened to disown him and report him to the police, the inquest heard. In January 2016 Butt appeared in a Channel 4 documentary called the Jihadis Next Door, in which he was depicted as a willing participant who ""condemned the UK government"", particularly over its actions in Iraq and Syria. The court heard Butt's relatives said he ""brought shame on the family"" in the programme and forced him to apologise. In the summer of 2016, Butt had been employed by London Underground as a customer service assistant. Background checks had not flagged up Butt's appearance in the documentary and he was subsequently sacked in October 2016. Acting Det Ch Insp Wayne Jolley, who investigated his background, told the court his job had given Butt access to a London Underground station in a security capacity. By Hanna Yusuf, BBC News, at the inquest The already chilly courtroom seemed to feel colder as attendees watched a smiling and impassioned Butt describe the UK government as ""extreme"" and outline his grievances with British foreign policy in a clip from a Channel 4 documentary called Jihadi Next Door. Christine Delcros, the fiancee of victim Xavier Thomas, watched the clip with her chin resting on her palm and listened intently to accounts from Butt's friends and family about his life as a self-declared ""Londoner who knows his city and people"". All the details about Butt's journey to become the man who would kill Ms Delcros' fiancee appeared to overwhelm her. She reclined and closed her eyes momentarily before continuing to fix her eyes on the evidence presented on the screens. Butt was born in Pakistan but moved to the UK with his family aged eight on a visitor's visa. In 2004 he was given indefinite leave to remain. He went to schools in Forest Gate and Stratford in east London, where he gained 11 GCSEs. He married Zahrah Rehman in December 2013 and they went on to have two children, with his daughter born just a month before the terror attack. Butt met fellow attacker Redouane after he began training at a fitness centre on Ilford Road. He befriended Zaghba through swimming sessions and the pair both volunteered at a primary school in east London. Head teacher Sophie Rahman had asked Butt to give children Koran lessons some 18 months before he launched his attack, the inquest heard. The school was closed and Rahman was later disciplined for engaging Butt, who had already shown signs of extremism in the 2016 documentary. The victims of the attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, Sebastien Belanger, Ignacio Echeverria, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Earlier, the inquest heard that the three men were unlikely to have become more aggressive as a result of taking anabolic steroids before the London Bridge attack. Prof David Cowan, a pharmaceutical toxicologist, said it was ""more likely than not"" that the three attackers had taken DHEA at some point before they launched their attack. However he rejected the suggestion they had been ""juiced up"" on steroids and said the levels found in their bodies were not ""particularly high"" and were ""highly unlikely"" to have had any behavioural effect. A pre-inquest hearing in February was also told the three men had steroids in their systems when they died. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were killed in the attack.

"Neil Findlay and Daniel Johnson gave differing reasons for their decisions to quit Scottish Labour's front bench Two MSPs have quit Scottish Labour's front bench team with the party in turmoil after the European elections. Neil Findlay quit as Brexit spokesman and also said he would step down from Holyrood at the 2021 election. He insisted he had made the decision in March, but hit out at ""eternal internal fighting"" and a ""toxic culture of leaks and briefings"" by some MPs and MSPs. Daniel Johnson later resigned as party justice spokesman, criticising Labour's ""current direction and leadership"". Scottish leader Richard Leonard told reporters he was ""prepared to take the flak for what was a poor result"" in the European elections, with Labour finishing in fifth place with less than 10% of the vote. But he insisted that he would not be resigning, urging the party to ""come together to build a way forward"". Findlay and Murray in Labour complaints row European elections: SNP win third seat as Labour vote collapses There had been calls from some in the party to examine what went wrong with the campaign, which was organised by Mr Findlay. Johanna Baxter, a member of the Scottish party's executive committee, said the result was ""a failure of leadership,externalon the biggest issue facing our country for generations"".

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. On Monday, Mr Leonard said he was ""humbled by the scale of the defeat"", and gave his backing to holding another referendum on Brexit. A party spokeswoman later confirmed that a policy change will be voted on when Labour's Scottish executive committee meets on Saturday 8 June. In his resignation letter, Mr Findlay, who has previously argued for a federal UK, said Labour needed a ""clear and easily understood position on the constitution"". He told BBC Scotland that the party was ""caught between two nationalisms"", the ""Union Jack nationalism of the Tories and the Saltire nationalism of the SNP"", saying it needs ""an offer that means something to people"". However he insisted that ""I'm not quitting because of the European election"", saying he had been considering his position for months and had made up his mind in March. He said it had been ""an enormous privilege"" to serve the Scottish Labour Party as a councillor and an MSP, and said he would continue to work ""hard and diligently"" until the 2021 election. Mr Findlay said he believed the party needed to ""end the eternal internal fighting within our party and the toxic culture of leaks and briefings that come from some within the Scottish and UK parliamentary groups"". Later, in an interview on BBC Scotland's The Nine he reiterated his support for Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard. ""I think he deserves loyalty from those people who, in my opinion, have continually undermined his leadership from the very outset,"" he said. ""There should be people coming together to support him, so we rebuild the Scottish Labour Party."" Richard Leonard insisted that he would not be quitting as Scottish Labour leader Mr Johnson, by contrast, did link his resignation as justice spokesman specifically to the European election results, noting that the party had finished sixth in Edinburgh, the city he represents. In his letter to Mr Leonard, he said: ""My constituents are clear not only that we must have another referendum, but that we must make every effort to ensure the UK remains a member of the EU. This is a view that I share. ""Quite simply, I do not feel I can represent my constituents effectively unless I can articulate and represent this view. I do not believe that I can do this from the front bench under the current direction and leadership of the party."" After a lengthy meeting of the MSP group, Mr Leonard told reporters that he would not be resigning from his post. He said there was ""a determination in the group to find a constructive way forward"" after the ""incredibly bad result"", which saw Labour lose both of its Scottish MEPs. The leader said he was ""very sorry"" that his ""friend"" Mr Findlay was stepping down, and praised his ""outstanding"" work as an MSP. In his reply to Mr Findlay's resignation letter, he said: ""I agree with you very much that our party will only advance when we decisively look outward to the public rather than in on ourselves, and I am pleased that you will be using your remaining time here to build the movement that will help us achieve this objective."" A second meeting of the MSP group took place after the resignation of Daniel Johnson. BBC Scotland political correspondent David Wallace Lockhart said he understood Mr Leonard reassured them he would back a second Brexit referendum, and would actively campaign for a Remain vote. The Scottish Conservatives said that ""people who once voted Labour must be wondering what on earth is going on"", with MSP Annie Wells saying: ""Scottish Labour has once again come out of an election and decided to form a circular firing squad.""

However he rejected the suggestion they had been ""juiced up"" on steroids and said the levels found in their bodies were not ""particularly high"" and were ""highly unlikely"" to have had any behavioural effect. A pre-inquest hearing in February was also told the three men had steroids in their systems when they died. Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were killed in the attack.

"Neil Findlay and Daniel Johnson gave differing reasons for their decisions to quit Scottish Labour's front bench Two MSPs have quit Scottish Labour's front bench team with the party in turmoil after the European elections. Neil Findlay quit as Brexit spokesman and also said he would step down from Holyrood at the 2021 election. He insisted he had made the decision in March, but hit out at ""eternal internal fighting"" and a ""toxic culture of leaks and briefings"" by some MPs and MSPs. Daniel Johnson later resigned as party justice spokesman, criticising Labour's ""current direction and leadership"". Scottish leader Richard Leonard told reporters he was ""prepared to take the flak for what was a poor result"" in the European elections, with Labour finishing in fifth place with less than 10% of the vote. But he insisted that he would not be resigning, urging the party to ""come together to build a way forward"". Findlay and Murray in Labour complaints row European elections: SNP win third seat as Labour vote collapses There had been calls from some in the party to examine what went wrong with the campaign, which was organised by Mr Findlay. Johanna Baxter, a member of the Scottish party's executive committee, said the result was ""a failure of leadership,externalon the biggest issue facing our country for generations"".

On Monday, Mr Leonard said he was ""humbled by the scale of the defeat"", and gave his backing to holding another referendum on Brexit. A party spokeswoman later confirmed that a policy change will be voted on when Labour's Scottish executive committee meets on Saturday 8 June. In his resignation letter, Mr Findlay, who has previously argued for a federal UK, said Labour needed a ""clear and easily understood position on the constitution"". He told BBC Scotland that the party was ""caught between two nationalisms"", the ""Union Jack nationalism of the Tories and the Saltire nationalism of the SNP"", saying it needs ""an offer that means something to people"". However he insisted that ""I'm not quitting because of the European election"", saying he had been considering his position for months and had made up his mind in March. He said it had been ""an enormous privilege"" to serve the Scottish Labour Party as a councillor and an MSP, and said he would continue to work ""hard and diligently"" until the 2021 election. Mr Findlay said he believed the party needed to ""end the eternal internal fighting within our party and the toxic culture of leaks and briefings that come from some within the Scottish and UK parliamentary groups"". Later, in an interview on BBC Scotland's The Nine he reiterated his support for Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard. ""I think he deserves loyalty from those people who, in my opinion, have continually undermined his leadership from the very outset,"" he said. ""There should be people coming together to support him, so we rebuild the Scottish Labour Party."" Richard Leonard insisted that he would not be quitting as Scottish Labour leader Mr Johnson, by contrast, did link his resignation as justice spokesman specifically to the European election results, noting that the party had finished sixth in Edinburgh, the city he represents. In his letter to Mr Leonard, he said: ""My constituents are clear not only that we must have another referendum, but that we must make every effort to ensure the UK remains a member of the EU. This is a view that I share. ""Quite simply, I do not feel I can represent my constituents effectively unless I can articulate and represent this view. I do not believe that I can do this from the front bench under the current direction and leadership of the party."" After a lengthy meeting of the MSP group, Mr Leonard told reporters that he would not be resigning from his post. He said there was ""a determination in the group to find a constructive way forward"" after the ""incredibly bad result"", which saw Labour lose both of its Scottish MEPs. The leader said he was ""very sorry"" that his ""friend"" Mr Findlay was stepping down, and praised his ""outstanding"" work as an MSP. In his reply to Mr Findlay's resignation letter, he said: ""I agree with you very much that our party will only advance when we decisively look outward to the public rather than in on ourselves, and I am pleased that you will be using your remaining time here to build the movement that will help us achieve this objective."" A second meeting of the MSP group took place after the resignation of Daniel Johnson. BBC Scotland political correspondent David Wallace Lockhart said he understood Mr Leonard reassured them he would back a second Brexit referendum, and would actively campaign for a Remain vote. The Scottish Conservatives said that ""people who once voted Labour must be wondering what on earth is going on"", with MSP Annie Wells saying: ""Scottish Labour has once again come out of an election and decided to form a circular firing squad.""

"Scientists have uncovered an evolutionary paradox where men damage their ability to have children during efforts to make themselves look more attractive. Taking steroids to get a buff physique or anti-baldness pills to keep a full head of hair can damage fertility. It has been named the Mossman-Pacey paradox after the scientists who first described it. They say it causes a lot of heartache in couples struggling to conceive. ""I noticed some men coming in to have their fertility tested and these guys were huge,"" says Dr James Mossman, now at Brown University in the United States. He was studying for his doctorate in Sheffield when he made the connection with steroid abuse. He told the BBC: ""They are trying to look really big, to look like the pinnacles of evolution. ""But they are making themselves very unfit in an evolutionary sense, because without exception they had no sperm in their ejaculation at all."" Dr Mossman and Prof Pacey: Originators of the paradox theory Anabolic steroids mimic the effect of the male hormone testosterone in the body and are used as performance-enhancing drugs to increase muscle growth. They are regularly used by bodybuilders. Prof Allan Pacey, from the University of Sheffield, added: ""Isn't it ironic that men go to the gym to look wonderful, for the most part to attract women, and inadvertently decrease their fertility."" Anabolic steroids fool the brain's pituitary gland into thinking the testes are going into overdrive. So the glands react by shutting down the production of two hormones - called FSH and LH - which are the key hormones that drive the production of sperm. The researchers say there is a similar theme in men using medication to prevent male pattern baldness. The drug finasteride changes the way testosterone is metabolised in the body and can limit hair loss, butside effects,externalcan include erectile dysfunction and a hit to fertility. Prof Pacey told the BBC: ""I would say more anabolic steroid users are likely to become sterile than you would think - 90% probably. ""Baldness is a bit more hit-and-miss, but sales are going through the roof and that makes it an increasingly common problem."" The measure of success in evolutionary terms is passing on your genes (instructions in your DNA) to the next generation. Dr Mossman said taking these vanity-based medications might make you more attractive but could turn you into ""an evolutionary dud"". It is not the equivalent of the extravagant peacock's tail, which makes males more attractive to females and increases the chances of passing genes on to the next generation. There are some examples in the natural world where an animal sacrifices their ability to breed. Some bird species perform co-operative breeding in which individuals forego having their own offspring to help raise the descendants of close relatives. But even this can make sense in evolutionary terms as half of your genes are shared with siblings so they are still being passed on, just indirectly. Dr Mossman suspects ""thinking you're more appealing to the opposite sex, but killing your fertility"" is probably unique to humans. Prof Pacey told the BBC: ""The irony is one thing, but I think the key message is for fertility patients. ""It keeps cropping up in clinics and the message is not getting out to young men that it's a problem and a bit of info could save them a lot of heartache."" Follow James onTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played Campbell: 'I'm still in the Labour Party as far as I'm concerned' Alastair Campbell has defended his decision to vote for the Lib Dems in the European elections after he was expelled from the Labour Party. Tony Blair's former spin doctor said he had voted tactically. He said he would ""always be Labour"" but acted ""in the best interests of what the Labour Party should be doing"" by supporting a pro-Remain party. Shadow minister Dawn Butler said members who admitted voting for another party were ""automatically excluded"". ""It's just part of the rule book. Everyone knows that,"" she said. Mr Campbell, a lead campaigner for another Brexit referendum, revealed during the BBC's election night broadcast on Sunday that he had voted Liberal Democrat. After his expulsion, he told reporters: ""I think it's a strange thing to do, and I think people will inevitably draw the contrast between the lack of rapidity in dealing with cases involving anti-Semitism."" He was speaking after the Equality and Human Rights Commissionlaunched a formal investigationover allegations of anti-Semitism within Labour. Mr Campbell added that he believed other Labour MPs, councillors and peers voted in the same way as he did to try and make the leadership alter its position on Brexit. Labour lost ground in the European elections, and some figures have called for Jeremy Corbyn to unequivocally back another referendum to win back support, especially from Remainers. ""I don't think I've left the Labour Party, and I'll always be Labour. I suspect I will be in and around Labour longer than some of the people around Jeremy Corbyn at the moment"", Mr Campbell added. He said he would appeal against the decision to expel him. He added that he wanted to vote Labour at the next general election, but it would ""depend on the policy that the Labour Party puts forward between now and then in relation to Brexit"". The Labour Party said: ""The way... members vote is a private matter. But publicly declaring or encouraging support for another candidate or party is against the rules and is incompatible with party membership."" This video can not be played ""I voted Liberal Democrat"" says Alastair Campbell In Twitter posts earlier, Mr Campbell claimed the decision also ""contrasts with our era"" when Mr Blair was ""pressed"" to withdraw the Labour whip from Jeremy Corbyn for voting against the party - but the then-PM said no. Following Mr Campbell's expulsion from the party, former Labour ministers Charles Clarke and Bob Ainsworth said they had voted for parties other than Labour in the European elections. Calling on Labour to reinstate Mr Campbell, Mr Clarke said he voted Liberal Democrat as a ""one-off decision because of the hopeless incoherence of Labour's position, particularly that of Jeremy Corbyn, on Brexit"". The former home secretary said Mr Campbell's expulsion was ""a disgrace and only compounds Labour's current political difficulties"". Mr Ainsworth - a defence secretary in Gordon Brown's government - told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire: ""Having recently voted Labour in local elections, I voted Green in the Euro elections having never voted other than Labour before in my entire life. ""I didn't intend to make this public, but now Alastair has been expelled for doing the same I feel obliged to do so."" Alastair Campbell with former PM Tony Blair Mr Campbell was a political journalist before coming to prominence in Whitehall as a key member of the Labour PM's staff in 1994. He served as Mr Blair's chief press secretary until 2000 and was a controversial figure, heavily involved in policy, including over the Iraq War. Since leaving government, he has opened up about his struggles with depression and alcoholism, and works with a number of charities. He also campaigns for the People's Vote and is editor-at-large of The New European magazine. Labour MPs have used Twitter to criticise the move to expel Alastair Campbell. Jess Phillips, who represents Birmingham Yardley, tweeted that Mr Campbell was ""expelled quicker than a man who threatened to kill me [and] quicker than a man in my [local party] who denied the Holocaust"", adding: ""Both are only still suspended."" Barking MP and campaigner against anti-Semitism Margaret Hodge said the party's ""priorities are all wrong"", And former Lord Chancellor in Mr Blair's government, Lord Falconer, said Mr Campbell was ""Labour through and through"", adding: ""Voting [Lib Dem] once in a lifetime on one issue should not lead to expulsion."" But Labour activist and commentator Owen Jones questioned why there was ""controversy"" over his expulsion, adding: ""The rule is, if you say you're voting for another party, you auto exclude yourself. ""Those arguing this rule shouldn't apply to Alastair Campbell do so because they agree with him and for no other reason."" Last week, veteran Conservative and pro-European Lord Heseltine admitted he planned to vote Lib Dem in the election.The party responded by effectively expelling him. Labour's share of the vote fell to 14% in last week's European elections andseveral senior figures have blamed a lack of clarity around Brexit. The party agreed a policy at its last conference that if Parliament voted down the government's withdrawal deal with the EU - which it has effectively done three times - or talks ended in no-deal, there should be a general election. But if it could not force one, conference agreed that the party ""must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote"". Deputy leader Tom Watson said that nuanced stance had led to ""electoral catastrophe"", while former PM Tony Blair said it was not ""possible to sit on the fence on Europe and appeal to both sides"". After the results, Mr Corbyn insisted his policy had been ""very clear"" all along - but sent a letter to his MPs, saying it was ""clear that the deadlock in Parliament can now only be broken by the issue going back to the people through a general election or a public vote"".

"New protection for individuals tricked into transferring money to fraudsters has now taken effect - but not all banks are signed up to the scheme. Some 84,000 bank customers lost money - sometimes tens of thousands of pounds - last year after being caught out. Only a fraction of the amount  lost was refunded by banks. Now a new code should mean more will be reimbursed. The refund will come from a central pot in cases when neither the bank nor the customer are to blame. Eight banks, covering 17 brands, have committed to implement the code immediately: Barclays HSBC (including First Direct and M&S Bank) Lloyds (including Halifax, Bank of Scotland, and Intelligent Finance) Metro Bank Nationwide RBS (including NatWest and Ulster Bank) Santander (including Cahoot and Cater Allen) Starling Bank The largest banks have established a fund to immediately reimburse customers who are in the ""no blame"" category. Fraudsters have shifted much of their attention from trying to crack bank systems to trying to con individuals. This may involve impersonating someone, such as a homebuyer's solicitor or a builder, whom the individual was expecting to pay. In other cases they may be selling non-existent goods online. Some of the more elaborate frauds see the con-artists using social media and other avenues such as data breaches to gather information about their victim, making it more likely that potential victims believe they are genuine. In all these cases, the individual authorises the payment. Banks have often refused to refund these frauds as a result. Alex Luke was scammed by thieves using a sophisticated con in December 2016. It took criminals less than 24 hours, using 33 fraudulent payments, to empty her account of about Â£180,000. Having started a small business in 2008, she had managed to save up the money as a nest egg which she had planned to use for her and her children's futures. Alex Luke (left) says she was determined to fight her bank after it initially blamed her when criminals emptied her account But thieves tricked her into believing they were calling from BT before persuading her to hand over sensitive security details to gain access to her account. Although Â£63,000 was traced and returned to Alex in the following weeks, it still left about Â£118,000 unaccounted for. Her bank, Santander, refused to refund the money. But after two years, she won her case with the Financial Ombudsman Service and the bank refunded the rest. ""It [getting the refund] has brought back some of the negative memories I've got, but I'm so utterly delighted and grateful. I'm a different person,"" she said. Read Alex's full story here People who realise they have been caught out in these ""authorised push payment"" scams should report the fraud to their bank immediately as normal. From now, payment providers - primarily banks - that are signed up to the voluntary code will have a new set of criteria to judge whether the customer should get the money back. Previously, banks only tended to reimburse people if there was an obvious fault in the way the payment was handled by the bank. Some Â£354m was lost in this fraud to individuals and businesses last year, but only Â£83m was refunded. Now anyone who has taken reasonable care, or has any element of vulnerability, is much more likely to receive a refund of the lost money. Millions lost in 'celebrity-backed scams' Fraud victims let down by 'inconsistent policing' The larger financial institutions involved will contribute to a pot, which any of the seven signatory banks can draw on to refund people when neither the individual nor the bank is to blame. A long-term funding solution for this should be agreed by the start of next year. A decision on whether someone is refunded should be taken within three weeks, or within seven weeks for complicated cases. Disputed cases that go to the Financial Ombudsman Service will take much longer to resolve. Ruth Evans, independent chair of the APP Scams Steering Group, said: ""For the first time, any victim who is a customer of a signatory firm will be fully refunded, as long as they meet the standards expected of them. ""From today, the majority of consumers will be covered by the code."" Anyone who has already been a victim of such a fraud cannot ask for their case to be reconsidered under the new rules. A victim who has been ""grossly negligent"" will not be reimbursed. Significantly, not all banks are signed up to the code. Banks such as Co-op and Virgin, which were not involved in drawing up the rules, said they could only sign up in the future. The Payment Systems Regulator has also ruled that the code should be voluntary, rather than mandatory. Moreover, one bank - TSB - has broken ranks inannouncing a guaranteethat it would automatically refund all ""innocent"" customers who have been defrauded. Other banks have suggested that a blanket refund policy would simply encourage fraudsters to try their luck. A separate scheme to ensure a recipient's name is as important as the bank account number and sort code when payments are made - designed to cut out much of this kind of fraud - has also been delayed until the end of March next year. 'It took two years to get my Â£100,000 back' TSB pledges to refund fraud victims Bank payment scams claim 84,000 victims Name checks on payments face delay 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Amanda Holden and Elizabeth of The Haunting on Britain's Got Talent Amanda Holden has apologised after shouting a strong swearword during a scary ghost act on the first Britain's Got Talent live semi-final. The judge was visibly shaken when she was put through a spooky routine by an act called The Haunting on Monday. She let slip the profanity near the end before clasping a hand over her mouth. After returning to the judges' desk, she said: ""I just really want to apologise if I said anything. I said a really terrible word."" The segment was shown just after 20:00 BST, before the watershed. Holden added: ""I know there are kids watching, I know my kids are watching, so massive apologies. I can honestly say I feel terrified."" Around 5.5 million people were watching at the moment of her exclamation, according to overnight viewing figures. Afterwards, presenter Ant McPartlin added: ""We'd like to apologise if you heard any bad language there from Amanda. She was very, very scared as you could see."" TV regulator Ofcom had received 192 complaints by 10:30 BST on Tuesday - 38 about Holden's swearing and a further 154 about the scary nature of the act itself. The watchdog is now assessing whether to investigate the show. The segment involved Holden being led to a room beneath the stage and confronted by actresses playing the ""ghosts"" of a woman called Agatha and her 11-year-old daughter Florence.

In a video posted on Twitter, Holden said: ""I've never felt so terrified in my whole life. I wouldn't want anyone to go through that, but she's a genius. I don't know how she does it. And apologies again."" The moment has been cut out of the show on ITV Hub but was shared by several viewers on social media. On ITV2's Britain's Got More Talent, Holden said she had asked head judge Simon Cowell not to fire her from the show for swearing. In response to a question from a caller about what the judges do during the ad breaks, she replied: ""I had a panic attack and went to the toilet. Lots of times."" The Haunting was voted in the night's top three acts by viewers, but was not among the two who went straight through to this weekend's final. Alesha Dixon announced her pregnancy at the beginning of Monday night's show PC Dave Wardell and his retired police dog Finn automatically qualified after topping the vote, and the judges chose Flakefleet Primary School over The Haunting to take the second spot. However, The Haunting still has a chance of making it to the final as the judges' wildcard. Four more semi-finals will take place this week before the final on Sunday. Monday's show began with Ant and Dec performing an elaborate song and dance act that culminated with them revealing that judge Alesha Dixon is pregnant.

"Stansted is the fourth busiest airport in the UK The worst UK airport for flight delays last year was London Stansted, an investigation has found. Passengers were kept waiting on flights for an average of 25 minutes at the Essex airport in 2018, according to the Press Association. Belfast City (George Best) recorded the best performance with an eight-minute average delay, analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data revealed. Stansted blamed ""adverse weather and air traffic control issues"". The airport is the fourth busiest in the UK and its main users are low-cost eastern European airlines and Ryanair, which has its biggest base there. Birmingham and London Luton, with average delays of 19 minutes, had the joint second worst performance. Scheduled and chartered flight from 24 major UK airports were ranked in the investigation but cancelled flights were not included. The average flight delay for all featured airports was 16 minutes in 2018. The second best airport was Liverpool (John Lennon)  - 10 minutes - followed by Doncaster Sheffield, Exeter and Bournemouth, all with 12-minute average delays. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""It's completely unacceptable for passengers to be regularly delayed by nearly half an hour. ""These delays aren't just an inconvenience but can leave holidaymakers hundreds of pounds out of pocket because of missed connections, transfers and fines for picking up their hire car late. ""Airlines should stop passing the buck and make it easier for their passengers by finally introducing automatic compensation."" A spokesman for Stansted blamed ""a particularly challenging summer last year"", saying that ""adverse weather and air traffic control issues had a dramatic impact on airline on-time performance"". A multimillion-pound investment by Ryanair to support its ground operation at the airport ""has already helped deliver significant service improvements to flight punctuality"", the spokesman added.

"This video can not be played Tom Watson: Labour should 'urgently' consult members on Brexit Labour deputy leader Tom Watson has said his party lost ""many hundreds of thousands"" of potential votes in the EU elections because of its Brexit stance. He argued that confusion over holding a referendum on any deal had led to ""electoral catastrophe"", after Labour's share of the vote fell to 14%. But he welcomed leader Jeremy Corbyn saying the party was ""ready to support a public vote on any deal"". Several senior figures criticised Labour's position for lacking clarity. Mr Corbyn has attempted to appeal to both Remain and Leave voters in framing Brexit policy, but has come under increasing pressure from senior figures in the party to back a further referendum. Brexit Party dominates as Tories and Labour suffer UK results at-a-glance In the European Parliament elections, the Brexit Party, which supports a no-deal Brexit, won the most UK votes. Meanwhile, parties supporting a further referendum, including the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, picked up support. Backing for Labour and the Conservatives, whose members tend to have a broader range of views on the subject, slumped. As the results came in, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, one of Mr Corbyn's closest political allies, told the BBC another referendum may be the only way to break the Brexit deadlock in Parliament. This video can not be played McDonnell: Brexit 'needs to go back to the people' Faced with the prospect of a ""Brexiteer extremist"" running the Conservative Party after the contest to replace Theresa May as leader, Mr McDonnell said Labour must back a fresh public vote to prevent a ""catastrophic"" no-deal scenario. ""Of course we want a general election, but realistically, after [the European election results] last night there aren't many Tory MPs who're going to vote for a general election,"" he said. ""It would be like turkeys voting for Christmas, so our best way of doing that is going back to the people in a referendum."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn spells out his party's ""very clear policy"" The House of Commons has rejected Prime Minister Theresa May's withdrawal agreement with the EU three times, and cross-party talks between Labour and the Conservatives, aimed at ending the impasse, ended recently without agreement. Mr Corbyn said Labour's policy had been ""very clear"" all along. He also sent a letter to his MPs, saying it was ""clear that the deadlock in Parliament can now only be broken by the issue going back to the people through a general election or a public vote. We are ready to support a public vote on any deal."" Mr Watson, who has called for ""a confirmatory ballot"" on any agreement, said he was ""really pleased"" that Mr Corbyn had now ""signalled"" a change in policy. However, there was ""very little time"" before the 31 October deadline for Brexit, Mr Watson said, arguing that Labour must ""urgently"" consult its members either through a special conference or a ballot of members to change its Brexit policy. He said Labour's Brexit policy had been agreed by ""a very small number of people"" on Labour's ruling National Executive Committee, which had caused an ""electoral catastrophe"". This video can not be played ""I voted Liberal Democrat,"" says Alastair Campbell Labour's 14% vote share in the European elections is worse than its previous low in 2009. Across Britain, it was in third place, behind the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard,externalandWelsh Labour leader and First Minister Mark Drakefordhave also spoken out in support of another referendum following the EU election results. Former Labour communications director Alastair Campbell told the BBC he had voted for the Liberal Democrats ""for the first time in my life"". ""I felt on this issue the Labour Party has let its own supporters down, its members down and the country down in the way that it has failed properly to develop a policy that the party and country could unite around."" Labour's MPs are divided on Brexit. David Lammy, who represents Tottenham, in north London, called for the party to ""get its act together"" and come out fully in support of another referendum. But other Labour MPs in Leave-voting areas - like Don Valley MP Caroline Flint - said it would be a ""mistake"" for the party to appeal only to Remain voters.

"New protection for individuals tricked into transferring money to fraudsters has now taken effect - but not all banks are signed up to the scheme. Some 84,000 bank customers lost money - sometimes tens of thousands of pounds - last year after being caught out. Only a fraction of the amount  lost was refunded by banks. Now a new code should mean more will be reimbursed. The refund will come from a central pot in cases when neither the bank nor the customer are to blame. Eight banks, covering 17 brands, have committed to implement the code immediately: Barclays HSBC (including First Direct and M&S Bank) Lloyds (including Halifax, Bank of Scotland, and Intelligent Finance) Metro Bank Nationwide RBS (including NatWest and Ulster Bank) Santander (including Cahoot and Cater Allen) Starling Bank The largest banks have established a fund to immediately reimburse customers who are in the ""no blame"" category. Fraudsters have shifted much of their attention from trying to crack bank systems to trying to con individuals. This may involve impersonating someone, such as a homebuyer's solicitor or a builder, whom the individual was expecting to pay. In other cases they may be selling non-existent goods online. Some of the more elaborate frauds see the con-artists using social media and other avenues such as data breaches to gather information about their victim, making it more likely that potential victims believe they are genuine. In all these cases, the individual authorises the payment. Banks have often refused to refund these frauds as a result. Alex Luke was scammed by thieves using a sophisticated con in December 2016. It took criminals less than 24 hours, using 33 fraudulent payments, to empty her account of about Â£180,000. Having started a small business in 2008, she had managed to save up the money as a nest egg which she had planned to use for her and her children's futures. Alex Luke (left) says she was determined to fight her bank after it initially blamed her when criminals emptied her account But thieves tricked her into believing they were calling from BT before persuading her to hand over sensitive security details to gain access to her account. Although Â£63,000 was traced and returned to Alex in the following weeks, it still left about Â£118,000 unaccounted for. Her bank, Santander, refused to refund the money. But after two years, she won her case with the Financial Ombudsman Service and the bank refunded the rest. ""It [getting the refund] has brought back some of the negative memories I've got, but I'm so utterly delighted and grateful. I'm a different person,"" she said. Read Alex's full story here People who realise they have been caught out in these ""authorised push payment"" scams should report the fraud to their bank immediately as normal. From now, payment providers - primarily banks - that are signed up to the voluntary code will have a new set of criteria to judge whether the customer should get the money back. Previously, banks only tended to reimburse people if there was an obvious fault in the way the payment was handled by the bank. Some Â£354m was lost in this fraud to individuals and businesses last year, but only Â£83m was refunded. Now anyone who has taken reasonable care, or has any element of vulnerability, is much more likely to receive a refund of the lost money. Millions lost in 'celebrity-backed scams' Fraud victims let down by 'inconsistent policing' The larger financial institutions involved will contribute to a pot, which any of the seven signatory banks can draw on to refund people when neither the individual nor the bank is to blame. A long-term funding solution for this should be agreed by the start of next year. A decision on whether someone is refunded should be taken within three weeks, or within seven weeks for complicated cases. Disputed cases that go to the Financial Ombudsman Service will take much longer to resolve. Ruth Evans, independent chair of the APP Scams Steering Group, said: ""For the first time, any victim who is a customer of a signatory firm will be fully refunded, as long as they meet the standards expected of them. ""From today, the majority of consumers will be covered by the code."" Anyone who has already been a victim of such a fraud cannot ask for their case to be reconsidered under the new rules. A victim who has been ""grossly negligent"" will not be reimbursed. Significantly, not all banks are signed up to the code. Banks such as Co-op and Virgin, which were not involved in drawing up the rules, said they could only sign up in the future. The Payment Systems Regulator has also ruled that the code should be voluntary, rather than mandatory. Moreover, one bank - TSB - has broken ranks inannouncing a guaranteethat it would automatically refund all ""innocent"" customers who have been defrauded. Other banks have suggested that a blanket refund policy would simply encourage fraudsters to try their luck. A separate scheme to ensure a recipient's name is as important as the bank account number and sort code when payments are made - designed to cut out much of this kind of fraud - has also been delayed until the end of March next year. 'It took two years to get my Â£100,000 back' TSB pledges to refund fraud victims Bank payment scams claim 84,000 victims Name checks on payments face delay 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played There was EU election joy for Alliance's Naomi Long Three women have been elected to represent Northern Ireland in the European Parliament. The pro-Remain Alliance Party won a seat for the first time after hugely increasing its vote in the NI poll. Its leader Naomi Long collected 170,370 votes - 115,000 more than her party received in the 2014 European election. Diane Dodds of the pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Martina Anderson of pro-EU Sinn FÃ©in both retained their seats. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar hailed Mrs Long's victory as a historic, pro-European vote which would be ""heard across the continent"". Her vote share was the best national showing for the cross-community Alliance Party, which isnot aligned to Northern Ireland's traditional Catholic or Protestant voting blocs. This video can not be played Watch the victory speeches of the new MEPs It comes afterAlliance's strong performance in Northern Ireland's council electionsearlier in May. Alliance's sister party, the Liberal Democrats,also made huge gains across the UK in the European elections. Speaking about the significance of her win, Mrs Long said her party rejected ""unionist and nationalist boxes"". How NI's European election count unfolded Full European election results How do European elections work? Why UK couldn't avoid European election The DUP's Diane Dodds was the first to be elected, retaining the seat she has held since 2009 Her voice cracked with emotion as she thanked those who had elected her, saying they had sent a clear message that they wanted to remain in the EU. ""The people who voted for me came together from right across the community, regardless of unionism, regardless of nationalism, regardless of all those labels,"" she said. This video can not be played Northern Ireland EU election count... in 70 seconds. ""I will serve them to the absolute best of my ability - they have my word on that."" All three European seats for Northern Ireland have been taken by women for the first time ever, with counting wrapping up earlier than expected in Magherafelt. The DUP's Diane Dodds was the first elected, but it was Alliance leader Naomi Long who exceeded expectations. She took the second seat, and polled more than 170,000 votes, taking transfers from right across the spectrum. The Ulster Unionists have some reflecting to do - they failed to retain the seat they've held for four decades, with Danny Kennedy only coming sixth. Now the question is for how long the three successful candidates will be MEPs. Eleven candidates were competingto become one of Northern Ireland's three members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in Brussels and Strasbourg. The threshold to win election was 143,112 votes. Mrs Dodds, who secured her place after the third count, won a total of 155,422 votes, while Mrs Long and Ms Anderson were voted in on the fifth count. Speaking after her election, Mrs Dodds said: ""The Democratic Unionist Party is by far the strongest voice of unionism, that voice that unionists trust to defend the union, to deliver Brexit. ""I think there's a lot of anger and frustration among those people who voted in the 2016 referendum that their voice has not been heard and the political class has not been heard. So we need to get on and deliver Brexit, one that is good for Northern Ireland."" Ms Anderson won a total of 152,436 votes - 9,324 more than the quota required to be elected. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) lost the European Parliament seat it had held since 1979 after its support plummeted by more than 30,000 votes on the total it received in 2014. UUP leader Robin Swann (left) admitted disappointment after Danny Kennedy was eliminated It limped in sixth in the first round, behind the leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice party Jim Allister, who accumulated a total of 90,079 votes over the five counts. Its candidate Danny Kennedy was eliminated after the second stage of counting, with party leader Robin Swann admitting it was a ""disappointing"" day. Martina Anderson - pictured with Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill - received the most first-preference votes After the elimination of Mr Kennedy - the sixth candidate to be excluded - the pro-Brexit DUP's Mrs Dodds passed the quota of 143,112 votes for election. Ms Anderson lost almost 33,000 first preference votes for Sinn FÃ©in - she polled just under 160,000 in 2014 - but said she was happy with her result, putting her drop down to tactical voting by her supporters. ""Primarily, the strategy has about getting two Remainers over the line,"" said the anti-Brexit politician. The SDLP leader Colum Eastwood was eliminated after the fourth stage of counting ""I've had republicans coming up to me and telling me: 'Look, you're safe and therefore we're going to vote tactically."" She added: ""We wanted to send a message back to the EU by, in the first instance, topping the poll and, more importantly, sending two Remainers back. ""Fifty seven per cent of the people who voted here voted to remain in the EU and they have sent a strong message back to Europe that they want to stay in the EU."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood was eliminated after the fourth stage of counting. Voters across the UK went to the polls on Thursday to decide who would represent them in the European Parliament. Turnout was 45% of the 1,278,951 people eligible to take part, down on the 2014 election in which almost 52% eligible voters participated. A total of 1,463 ballot boxes were used across Northern Ireland and transported to the election centre in Magherafelt, County Londonderry, where counting began on Monday morning. Voter turnout dropped by more than 6% on the 51.84% who went to the polls in 2014 While the counting in the rest of the UK began on Sunday night, counting does not take place on Sundays in Northern Ireland - a long-standing arrangement due to the traditional observance by the region's Christian population of Sunday as a day of rest. Mrs Dodds of the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in's Ms Anderson and Ulster Unionist Jim Nicholson were elected in the 2014 European Parliament poll. Ms Anderson received the highest number of first-preference votes in that election - a total of 159,813 - while Mrs Dodds received 131,163. Ms Anderson said she was happy with her result Mrs Dodds and Ms Anderson both stood to retain their seats in Thursday's poll but Mr Nicholson did not. Instead Mr Kennedy, a former Stormont minister, was the candidate for the UUP. Northern Ireland uses a different voting system to the rest of the UK in the European election. In the single transferable vote (STV) system, voters are able to rank the candidates in order of preference. To make the system work, officials first need to calculate a quota. TUV leader Jim Allister, who came in fifth place, marks down results during the declaration They take the total number of valid votes cast, divide it by the number of seats available plus one and then add one. In the first round, if any candidate secures more first-preference votes than the quota they are elected. Surplus votes - those received above the quota - are redistributed among the other candidates. Staff at the count centre in Magherafelt finished much earlier than expected If not enough candidates have yet reached the quota, then the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated and the lower-preference votes of their supporters are again reallocated. That process is repeated until the three posts have been filled. The Electoral Office for Northern Ireland recruited about 800 staff for the count at the Meadowbank Sports Arena in Magherafelt.

"There were two largely separate battles taking place in the European elections in the UK. The first was for the support of those who voted Leave in the 2016 referendum, many of whom are disappointed that the UK has not yet left the EU. The second was for the backing of those who voted Remain, many of whom are hoping that the decision to leave the EU might yet be reversed, perhaps via a second referendum. The outcome of the first battle was decisive and widely anticipated. The second was rather messier, but might have just as important an impact on the debate about Brexit between now and when the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October. Many Leave voters had previously supported UKIP under Nigel Farage's leadership, before backing the Conservatives in the 2017 UK general election. They switched en masse towards Mr Farage's new organisation, the Brexit Party. With 32% of the vote, its level of support was as much as five points higher than that of UKIP in the last European elections, in 2014. The Brexit Party performed much better in those areas that voted most heavily for Leave in the 2016 referendum than it did in those places that voted most heavily for Remain. As a result, the party scored much less well in London (18%) and Scotland (15%) - where a majority voted for Remain - than in the rest of England (36%) and Wales (32%), which had provided the foundations of Leave's success in 2016. Because of this surge, the Conservatives fell to just 9% of the vote. Governments often perform badly in European elections, as voters take the opportunity to express their disappointment with its performance without the risk that their vote might put the opposition into government. Yet the rebuff suffered by the Conservatives was far worse than the previous worst snubbing to have been suffered by a government in a European election. That was the 15% to which Labour sunk in 2009, during the darkest days of Gordon Brown's premiership. It was also easily the Conservatives' worst ever performance in a nationwide election. Its performance was weak everywhere - the party did not manage to come first in a single council area. In sharp contrast to the position in the 2017 general election, when it was much stronger in Leave-voting areas than in Remain-inclined ones, the party did equally badly in both. It is an outcome that would seem to confirm the message of the opinion polls that the party has lost the confidence of many Leave voters. However, dramatic though it was, the outcome of the battle between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party had been widely forecast by the polls. Indeed, politicians had already begun to react to it in the period between Thursday's vote and last night's count. It arguably contributed to the downfall of Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, while many of the candidates to be her successor are arguing that 31 October should be a firm and final deadline for the UK's exit from the EU. The European election result will simply ensure that that debate continues. Laura Kuenssberg: Main parties punished for Brexit contortions UK results at a glance The UK's results in maps and charts The second contest in these elections was for the support of those who want to remain in the EU. The polls had suggested that during the campaign Labour, which has been somewhat equivocal in its support for a second referendum, had been losing the backing of Remain supporters to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. However, there was disagreement as to whether the Lib Dems would challenge Labour for second place. In the event, the Lib Dems won this battle hands down. The party won 20% of the vote, its best European election performance ever, while Labour secured just 14%. Sir Vince Cable's party not only beat Labour but managed to come a clear first in those places that voted most heavily for Remain including, most remarkably, in London. There is no doubt that the party was the single most popular party among Remain supporters, a position that had hitherto been enjoyed by Labour. The Lib Dems, who are themselves about to embark on a leadership contest, will hope the outcome signals that the party is finally recovering from the dramatic decline it suffered following its involvement in the 2010-15 coalition. However, it was not the only party in favour of a second referendum to do well. So too did the Greens, whose 12% of the vote was its best European election performance since 1989. However, in its case support was only marginally higher in Remain-voting areas. In Scotland, the SNP, led by Nicola Sturgeon, won no less than 38% of the vote, its best ever European election result. It is an outcome that confirms its dominance of the electoral scene north of the border. In Wales, Plaid Cymru also enjoyed some success with 20% of the vote, its highest since 1999. Though nothing like as devastating as the loss suffered by the Conservatives, Labour's poor performance could, in truth, also lead to a rethink just as important as that now going on inside the government. The party's attempt to keep both its Remain and its Leave supporters on board seems to have resulted in a loss of support among both groups. Although Labour's vote fell most heavily in the strongest Remain voting areas, its vote also fell, by as much as 11 points, in the most pro-Leave areas. There have already been signals from Labour that it might now fall in more firmly behindthe idea of a ""confirmatory vote""in which whatever deal is eventually struck with the EU is put before voters in a second referendum. It will hope that this stance will help reverse the loss of support to the Lib Dems and Greens, without losing it too much ground among its minority of Leave supporters. Such a development would certainly ensure that the government and the opposition are further apart on Brexit than at any point since the EU referendum. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister The main parties have been punished How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket On the other hand, the newest of the pro-second referendum parties, Change UK, led by Heidi Allen, had a bruising night, winning just 3% of the vote. Even in London, where its hopes were highest, the party managed to win no more than 5% of the vote. It seems likely thatthe party will have to seek some form of collaboration with the Lib Demsrather than continue to attempt to compete for much the same body of voters. Inevitably, the outcome of the two battles led those on the Eurosceptic side of the Brexit argument to say the result showed that the electorate were willing to leave the EU without a deal. Those in favour of a second referendum claimed the result indicated that voters wanted just that. The Brexit Party's Ann Widdecombe celebrates her victory in the South West of England In practice, it would seem safer to argue that the outcome confirmed that the electorate is evenly divided as well as polarised between those two options. Overall, 35% of voters voted for parties comfortable with no deal (the Brexit Party and UKIP). Equally, 35% backed one of the three UK-wide parties (Lib Dems, Greens and Change UK) that supported a second referendum. If Plaid Cymru (1%) and the SNP (3.5%) are included, the Remain share of the vote is just over 40%, although the SNP is known to secure considerable support from those who voted Leave. Far from providing a clear verdict, the result simply underlined how difficult it is likely to be to find any outcome to the Brexit process that satisfies a clear majority of voters. Meanwhile, the poor performance of both the Conservatives and Labour will inevitably raise questions about the future of the country's two-party system.  At 23% their joint tally was well below the previous all-time low of 43.5% in 2009. European elections are, of course, not the same as a general election; voters have long shown a greater willingness to vote for smaller parties. However, the issue that caused both parties such difficulties in this election - Brexit - is not going to go away any time soon. In truth, both the Conservatives and Labour have been on notice that they need to handle the issue much better than they have done so far. Otherwise, voters might yet turn elsewhere at the next general election too. About this piece This analysis piece wascommissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'You can't stand in the way of the will of the Scottish people' The SNP has increased its number of MEPs from two to three while Scottish Labour lost both its seats in the European elections. With all 32 Scottish council areas having declared their results, the SNP has 37.7% of the vote - up from 29% in the last EU election. The Brexit Party secured second place and has won one seat. The Lib Dems and Tories also won a seat each. Labour came fifth with less than 10% of the vote - down from 26% in 2014. It means Labour loses both of its MEPs in Scotland, includingDavid Martin who was the UK's longest serving elected EU politician. The final Scottish tally was declared after the last council, Western Isles, declared its results late Monday morning. Brexit Party dominates in EU elections Live coverage of the EU election results 'Wake up Labour' says longest serving MEP Full UK results The SNP came in a clear first with 37.7% of the vote followed by the Brexit Party with 14.8%. Next was the Lib Dems with 13.8%, after that the Conservatives with 11.6%. Labour recorded 9.3% of the vote and the Scottish Greens came in with 8%. The final result means Scotland's six new MEPs will be; the SNP's Alyn Smith, Christian Allard and Aileen McLeod Louis Stedman-Bryce of the Brexit Party Sheila Ritchie of the Liberal Democrats and Baroness Nosheena Mobarik of the Conservatives. The SNP's Alyn Smith, Christian Allard and Aileen McLeod have been elected MEPs SNP leader and Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, was on an official trip to the Republic of Ireland when the final declaration was made. Speaking from Dublin, she said that the outcome had shown that the ""UK political system has failed - and it has failed Scotland utterly"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""Scotland said no to Brexit in 2016. This result makes clear, we meant it. ""The message from Scotland today is that we will not accept a Brexit process that silences our nation, that treats our parliament and government with contempt and that fails to represent the interests of people in Scotland."" She pledged: ""The SNP will continue working with other parties to stop Brexit and all the ensuing economic damage to Scotland."" The party's previous best European election result was 32.6% in 1994. The SNP won the biggest share of the vote in 30 of the 32 council areas, with the Lib Dems first in both Orkney and Shetland. The Liberal Democrats, whose vote is up across the UK, and the Scottish Greens also campaigned against Brexit and have joined the SNP in calling for another referendum on EU membership. At the last EU poll five years ago, UKIP won 10.4% of the vote in Scotland and secured one European seat. At this election its share of the vote dropped to 1.8%. Turnout across Scotland was recorded at 39.9%, up from 33.5% five years ago.

He added: ""Our message clearly should have been that Labour is a remain party."" This video can not be played Richard Leonard: ""I am more and more compelled to believe that there should be a vote on whatever deal is facing parliament."" Labour politicians, MPs Ian Murray and Martin Whitfield, said it was ""devastating"" that Mr Martin had lost his seat. In a strongly-worded joint statement, they suggested Labour may ""never recover"" after posting the worst results in the party's European elections history. The pair blamed UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying: ""It is official Labour Party policy to support a People's Vote as a way out of this catastrophic mess, yet Jeremy Corbyn snubbed our membership and refused to embrace it. As a result he personally handed victory to Nigel Farage. ""As the hard right rises and the Tories tear themselves apart, Jeremy is squandering the opportunity to deliver a radical reforming government that so many millions of people urgently need."" Scottish Labour leader leader Richard Leonard - a close ally of Mr Corbyn - insisted that Labour had been the only party fighting to unite the country against ""the divisions caused by the competing nationalisms of the UK and Scottish governments"". However, he told the BBC that he was ""more and more compelled"" to believe that there should be another vote on the UK's future in Europe. Asked what vote he thought should be held, Mr Leonard said: ""[It should be on] Whatever deal is facing parliament, whether that is a no deal Brexit, which would be catastrophic, or some variant of that."" The SNP topped the poll, returning three MEPs but Scotland also elected the Brexit Party's Louis Stedman-Bryce Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson attended the formal declaration of Scotland's EU election results Sheila Ritchie, the newly-elected Lib Dem MEP, celebrated with party colleagues and supporters Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said her party had retained a Scottish MEP on what was a ""tough night for the party UK-wide"". She said: ""It was clear before the election the Conservatives were going to get a kicking across the UK for not delivering Brexit as promised. ""This election - to a parliament we were already supposed to have left - had a unique set of circumstances. ""That we held our seat in Scotland is primarily down to the hard work of our campaigning team and I thank each and every one of them."" She added that dividing the pro-Union vote only served to benefit the SNP. The Scottish Liberal Democrats recorded a 6.8% increase in their vote compared with five years ago and in the UK as a whole the party's vote share rose by 12.4% to 20%. Lib Dem leader in Scotland, Willie Rennie, urged Ms Sturgeon not to interpret the SNP's success in the election as support for independence. He said: ""She's tried to say that people who voted remain in Scotland in the referendum have somehow indicated support for independence and she's misjudged that, she shouldn't misjudge this one as well. ""This is about stopping Brexit, that's the top priority, it's the crisis that is ahead of us and is why everybody needs to join together."" Analysis by BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim To take the easy questions first, it was a good night for the SNP, who gained a seat while cruising ahead of all of their rivals. There were council areas where the party was comfortably 30 percentage points clear of their nearest opponents. It was also a decent night for the Brexit Party, who improved on UKIP's previous performance in Scotland and have taken a seat. See also the Lib Dems, who say they ""are finding votes from places we have never been before"". But for every winner in politics, there's a loser. Other than the SNP's dominance, the big story of the night was Labour's utter collapse, losing both of their seats. The SNP's Alyn Smith (centre) was returned to the European Parliament as one of his party's three MEPs The official line from Labour is that they're being punished by a ""polarised"" political climate. Others in the party are more direct - calling it an ""absolute catastrophe"" and ""unforgivable"". Does this tell us anything about future elections, or the fate of Brexit? That's a much harder question. Yes, unambiguously pro-EU parties did well - although of course they were always expected to, in a country that voted 62% for Remain in 2016. The SNP in particular are keen to proclaim that the results show that ""Scotland's not for Brexit"". The strong performances from the Brexit Party and the Lib Dems also underline the importance of having a clear constitutional position in an election that was all about sending a message. But while turnout was up on previous European elections, it was still low by comparison with almost every other vote held in Scotland over the last 20 years. Less than half of the electorate registered a vote. These results might not be replicated in any future Westminster or Holyrood election. But they will certainly shape the context of the debate in the coming months, at a pivotal time in politics. Nigel Farage's Brexit Party is on course to win the most votes across the UK Voting took place across the UK against the backdrop of Brexit, with both the Conservatives and Labour suffering big losses and the former heading for less than 10% of the vote. The Brexit Party was the clear winner, with the pro-EU Lib Dems coming second. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the two main parties ""could learn a big message"" from the results.

"It was a tough night for both Labour and the Conservatives. The Brexit Party swept across Britain, and the Liberal Democrats and Green Party also made gains.

The Conservatives did not come top in any council areas. This map does not show results for Northern Ireland because it has a different electoral system to the rest of the UK All results from the UK can be seen here. Nigel Farage's Brexit Party secured more than half the vote in areas where more than 7 in 10 people backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum, while the trends for the Greens and Lib Dems were the opposite. As for the two main parties, Labour particularly struggled to pick up votes in areas that voted strongly for Leave in 2016, averaging less than one in ten votes in those local authorities. The Conservatives performed badly across the board, but worst in areas where voters heavily backed Remain in the referendum. Voters in local authority areas which backed Remain in the EU referendum showed a renewed enthusiasm for getting out to vote. For example, turnout in Bristol, in which more than 60% of voters supported Remain, increased by eight percentage points with the Green Party winning the most votes, and in Edinburgh, where more than 75% of voters were Remainers, it was up by nine points with the SNP in the lead. On average turnout was 36.7%, up a little less than two percentage points on the last EU election in 2014. The Conservatives and Labour combined received less than 25% of the votes, their worst result in any EU election. The two main parties' vote share has been dropping consistently since the UK's first EU election in 1979. By Daniel Dunford, John Walton, Clara Guibourg, Ed Lowther and Paul Sargeant.
