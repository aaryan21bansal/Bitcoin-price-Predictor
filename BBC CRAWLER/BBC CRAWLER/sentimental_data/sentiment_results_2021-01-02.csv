"The editor of the British Medical Journal has asked the New York Times to correct an article that says UK guidelines allow two Covid-19 vaccines to be mixed. The US publication reported that UK health officials would allow patients to be given a second dose that is a different vaccine to their first. Fiona Godlee pointed out in her letter to the NYT that it was not a recommendation. She saidthe NYT's headline claiming UK guidelines say such substitutions ""may happen"",externalwas ""seriously misleading"". The UK has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - but both require two doses which are now to be administered 12 weeks apart Ms Godlee said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)does not,externalmake any recommendation to mix and match - in other words, having a shot of one vaccine and then a different one 12 weeks later. Medics face 'bureaucracy' in bid to give vaccines 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs Hospitals across UK 'must prepare for Covid surge' Dr Mary Ramsay, Public Health England's head of immunisations, said: ""We do not recommend mixing the Covid-19 vaccines - if your first dose is the Pfizer vaccine you should not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine for your second dose and vice versa."" Dr Ramsay added that on the ""extremely rare occasions"" where the same vaccine is unavailable or it is unknown which jab the patient received, it is ""better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all"". Ms Godlee urged the New York Times to print a ""highly visible correction"" as soon as possible.

The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first vaccine approved in the UK,and 944,539 people have had their first jab. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"Doctors have sought to reassure parents that there has been no increase in the severity of Covid-19 cases among children because of the new variant. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said children's wards are not seeing any ""significant pressure"" from Covid-19. It comes after a London hospital matron told BBC Radio 5 Live of having a ward full of children with coronavirus. Laura Duffel said the surge in cases was ""much scarier"" than the first wave. Ms Duffel, who has been working on Covid wards since the beginning of the UK's epidemic and specialises in children's intensive care,told 5 Live's Chiles on Friday showthat people were ""wrong"" to say busy hospitals were merely a reflection of normal winter pressures on the NHS. ""This wave has just hit us so fast. It's literally in the space of a week that this has gotten so bad,"" she said. ""It's very different and I think that's what makes it so much scarier for us. We have children who are coming in. It was minimally affecting children in the first wave - [but now] we have a whole ward of children here [and] 20- and 30-year-olds with no underlying conditions are coming in."" However, doctors denied that the virus is putting significant additional pressure on children's wards across the country. Prof Russell Viner, president of the RCPCH, said: ""Children's wards are usually busy in winter. As of now we are not seeing significant pressure from Covid-19 in paediatrics across the UK. ""As cases in the community rise there will be a small increase in the number of children we see with Covid-19, but the overwhelming majority of children and young people have no symptoms or very mild illness only. ""The new variant appears to affect all ages and, as yet, we are not seeing any greater severity amongst children and young people."" Dr Ronny Cheung, a consultant paediatrician at Evelina Children's Hospital, in London, added: ""I've been the on-call consultant in a London children's hospital this week. Covid is rife in hospitals, but not among children - and that is corroborated by my colleagues across London."" Prof Calum Semple said that he spoke to colleagues on intensive care units and ""not one of them has seen a surge in sick children coming into critical care and we're not hearing of a rise in cases in the wards either"". ""We're not seeing a different spectrum of disease in children, certainly we're not seeing a surge in cases,"" Prof Semple told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. Dr Liz Whittaker, a consultant paediatrician at St Mary's Hospital London, said ""only small numbers"" of children who test positive for Covid develop severe disease and these are ""within expected levels"" at the moment. ""I continue to worry for my elders, not my kids,"" Dr Whittaker added. Meanwhile, Dr Lee Hudson, from Great Ormond Street Hospital, said that none of his paediatric colleagues at hospital across London were reporting higher rates of sick children because of Covid but said that parents should never be afraid to seek medical help if they are worried about their children.

"Candles burned for those who have died in the landslide at Ask Seven bodies have now been found in the search for the missing after a massive landslide that destroyed homes in Norway last week, police have said. Four bodies were discovered on Friday and Saturday, and another three on Sunday. The first victim to be found was named as Eirik GrÃ¸nole, 31. Several people remain missing following the hillside collapse that sent mud into the village of Ask on Wednesday. Rescuers are working to find survivors, but chances of this are fading. Police said the latest body was recovered near where two others had been found, but they gave no further details. Five of the victims have been identified, including a 40-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter. Another 10 people were injured. The king and queen of Norway visited the site of the landslide on Sunday. Queen Sonja and King Harald lit candles in Gjerdrum Church in memory of the victims ""I'm having trouble finding something to say, because it's absolutely horrible,"" King Harald said after the visit. ""This terrible event impacts us all. I sympathise with you who are beginning the new year with sadness and uncertainty,"" he said. A shortage of daylight in the Norwegian winter has proved one of the challenges at the scene in Gjerdrum municipality, 25km (15 miles) north-east of Oslo. Rescuers are also contending with freezing temperatures and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. Helicopters and drones spent two days searching the area before Police Commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter. Rescuers began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards; the bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach the wrecked homes. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide Residents of Ask began calling emergency services at around 04:00 local time on Wednesday telling them that their houses were moving, police said. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" More than 30 homes were destroyed, with others teetering on the edges of the deep crater that was left by the landslide. At least 1,000 residents were evacuated from the area. The landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft), a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built there three years later.

"The aftermath of an attack in August in Niger, which has suffered a number claimed by jihadist groups Suspected Islamist militants have attacked two villages in Niger, with reports of dozens of civilians killed. Around 49 died and 17 were injured in the village of Tchombangou, while another 30 died in Zaroumdareye - both near Niger's western border with Mali, Reuters reports. There have been several recent violent incidents in Africa's Sahel region, carried out by militant groups. France said on Saturday that two of its soldiers were killed in Mali. Hours earlier, a group with links to al-Qaeda said it was behind the killing of three French troops in a separate attack in Mali on Monday. How West Africa is under threat from Islamist militants Africa's Sahel becomes latest al-Qaeda-IS battleground France has been leading a coalition of West African and European allies against Islamist militants in the Sahel. But the region continues to be affected by ethnic violence, banditry, and human and drug trafficking. In light of Saturday's attacks, Interior Minister Alkache Alhada said soldiers had been sent to the area, according to French outlet RFI. But Mr Alhada did not say how many casualties there had been across the two villages. A local official, quoted by AFP news agency, said many people were killed, and a local journalist spoke of up to 50 deaths. Niger's TillabÃ©ri region, where the villages are situated, lies within the so-called tri-border area between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, which has been plagued by jihadi attacks in recent years. Travel by motorbike has been banned in the region for a year, as part of efforts to stop incursions by Islamic militants, who often launch attacks from the vehicles. Areas of Niger are also facing repeated attacks by jihadists from Nigeria, where the government is fighting an insurgency by Boko Haram. Last month, members of the group killed at least 27 people in Niger's south-eastern Diffa region. The latest attacks in TillabÃ©ri come amid national elections in Niger, as President Mahamadou Issoufou steps down after two five-year terms. Election officials announced provisional results on Saturday, showing a lead for Mohamed Bazoum - a former minister and a member of Niger's ruling party. A second round of votes is expected to be held on 21 February, once ballots have been validated by the country's constitutional court.

"Candles burned for those who have died in the landslide at Ask Seven bodies have now been found in the search for the missing after a massive landslide that destroyed homes in Norway last week, police have said. Four bodies were discovered on Friday and Saturday, and another three on Sunday. The first victim to be found was named as Eirik GrÃ¸nole, 31. Several people remain missing following the hillside collapse that sent mud into the village of Ask on Wednesday. Rescuers are working to find survivors, but chances of this are fading. Police said the latest body was recovered near where two others had been found, but they gave no further details. Five of the victims have been identified, including a 40-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter. Another 10 people were injured. The king and queen of Norway visited the site of the landslide on Sunday. Queen Sonja and King Harald lit candles in Gjerdrum Church in memory of the victims ""I'm having trouble finding something to say, because it's absolutely horrible,"" King Harald said after the visit. ""This terrible event impacts us all. I sympathise with you who are beginning the new year with sadness and uncertainty,"" he said. A shortage of daylight in the Norwegian winter has proved one of the challenges at the scene in Gjerdrum municipality, 25km (15 miles) north-east of Oslo. Rescuers are also contending with freezing temperatures and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. Helicopters and drones spent two days searching the area before Police Commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter. Rescuers began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards; the bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach the wrecked homes. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide Residents of Ask began calling emergency services at around 04:00 local time on Wednesday telling them that their houses were moving, police said. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" More than 30 homes were destroyed, with others teetering on the edges of the deep crater that was left by the landslide. At least 1,000 residents were evacuated from the area. The landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft), a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built there three years later.

"It will fall to Mr Pence to declare Mr Biden the winner US Vice-President Mike Pence has welcomed an effort by a group of senators to refuse to certify Joe Biden's presidential election win. The 11 Republican senators and senators-elect, led by Ted Cruz, want a 10-day delay to audit unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud. The move is certain to fail as most senators are expected to endorse Mr Biden in the 6 January vote. Mr Biden, a Democrat, is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. President Donald Trump has refused to concede the 3 November election, repeatedly alleging fraud without providing any evidence. On Saturday he addressed state legislators in five states where he has been trying to overturn the result. Inauguration 2021:Â What to expect as Biden sworn in Why is the Georgia election so important? He also spoke to Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and later tweeted that the Georgia official had been ""unwilling, or unable"" to offer details of instances of fraud, which Mr Trump has alleged took place without providing evidence. The Washington Post reported, citing an audio recording of the call, that Mr Trump had asked Mr Raffensperger to ""find"" enough votes to overturn the result in the state. Mr Trump cajoled and threatened the Georgia official with unspecified consequences if he did not help, telling him he was running a ""big risk"", the paper said. Mr Pence has stopped short of echoing allegations of election fraud. But on Saturday, his chief of staff Marc Short said Mr Pence shared what he called ""the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities"". Mr Pence ""welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people"", Mr Short said. As president of the Senate, Mr Pence will have the responsibility of overseeing the session on 6 January and declaring Mr Biden the winner. All 50 states have certified the election result, some after recounts and legal appeals. So far, US courts have rejected 60 challenges to Mr Biden's win. Mr Trump has notched up only one minor victory, concerning a small number of postal ballots in Pennsylvania, a state won by Mr Biden. In a statement, the 11 senators led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz said November's election had ""featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities"". An investigation by the federal Department of Justice (DOJ) found no evidenceto back any claims of fraud. Citing a precedent from 1877 - when a bi-partisan committee was formed to investigate after both parties claimed victory in three states - they urged Congress to appoint a commission for an ""emergency 10-day audit of election returns in the disputed states"". This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead ""Once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed,"" they said. However, they said their bid was unlikely to succeed. ""We are not naÃ¯ve. We fully expect most, if not all, Democrats, and perhaps more than a few Republicans, to vote otherwise,"" they said. Trump ally Senator Lindsay Graham said their bid for a commission had ""zero chance of becoming reality"" and did not amount to ""effectively fighting for President Trump"". Texas Senator Ted Cruz says an audit would improve ""faith in the electoral process"" Their move is separate from that of Missouri Senator Josh Hawley, who has also saidhe will reject the resultover concerns about the integrity of the election. On Saturday Mr Trump tweeted that ""plenty more"" senators would refuse to certify Mr Biden's win on Wednesday. A group of Republicans in the lower chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, is also planning to contest the election results. With at least a dozen Republican senators now planning to challenge the election results in Congress, it is clear - if it wasn't already - that the party's heart remains with Donald Trump's efforts to overturn his presidential defeat. The effort will be futile, given the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, but the goal for many of these politicians is not to pull off a miraculous reversal of fortune for the president. Instead, it is to curry favour with Trump's loyal base. They are wagering that the road to success in the Republican Party will continue to run through Trump and his faithful, whose support could be invaluable to senators with presidential ambitions, like Ted Cruz of Texas or Josh Hawley of Missouri, or ones concerned about future primary opposition from pro-Trump politicians. This is not the first time members of Congress dismayed by the outcome of a presidential election have objected during the largely ceremonial session. It will, however, be the largest such revolt in nearly a century and a half. It is a sign that the partisan rancour in the US, exacerbated by Trump's scorched-earth fight to hold on to the presidency, will not fade away anytime soon. Objections that are endorsed by a member of the House of Representatives and a member of the Senate must be considered by lawmakers in a two-hour debate, followed by a vote. However, for an objection to be upheld, a majority in both chambers must vote in favour. Republicans hold the majority in the Senate but some of their number have already said they will not contest the results. Democrats are in the majority in the House. Biden victory formalised after electors cast votes Why is the Georgia election so important? Top Republicans have said the Senate's role in certifying the election is largely ceremonial and should not be an opportunity for further lengthy debate about the result. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has already recognised Mr Biden's victory and has asked other Republicans not to object. Utah Senator Mitt Romney, the only Republican to vote for Mr Trump's impeachment last year, has also expressed dismay at moves to overturn the election. ""I could never have imagined seeing these things in the greatest democracy in the world. Has ambition so eclipsed principle?"" he said in a statement. The Biden camp has not responded to the latest move to object to the election result. But Biden spokeswoman Jen Psaki has described Mr Hawley's attempt as ""antics"". ""The American people spoke resoundingly in this election and 81 million people have voted for Joe Biden and [Vice-President-elect] Kamala Harris,"" she said. ""Congress will certify the results of the election as they do every four years."" Why is the Georgia election so important? Bid to get Pence to overturn poll results fails What's in store for Biden?

"Bitcoin's value has soared over the past year Bitcoin's value surged above $34,000 (Â£24,850) for the first time on Sunday as the leading cryptocurrency continued to soar. It put the gain this year at almost $5,000, although by 17:00 GMT the price had drifted lower to about $33,000, according to the Coindesk website. The rise was put down to interest from big investors seeking quick profits. It comes after Bitcoin soared 300% last year, with the price of many other digital currencies also rising sharply. Ethereum, the second biggest cryptocurrency, gained 465% in 2020 Some analysts think Bitcoin's value could rise even further as the US dollar drops further. While the value of the US currency rose in March at the start of the coronavirus pandemic as investors sought safety amid the uncertainty, it has since dropped due to major stimulus from the US Federal Reserve. The currency ended last year with its biggest annual loss since 2017. Covid worries help Bitcoin to three-year high How do cryptocurrencies work? Bitcoin is traded in much the same way as real currencies like the US dollar and pound sterling. Recently it has won growing support as a form of payment online, withPayPal among the most recent adopters of digital currencies. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? But the cryptocurrency has also proved to be a volatile investment. The soaring price has raised concerns that Bitcoin is due for a dramatic correction, as happened three years ago when the value collapsed after a bull run. During the rally in 2017 Bitcoin came close to breaking through the $20,000 level, only to hit extreme lows and fall below $3,300. It passed $19,000 in November last year before dropping sharply again. âRobin Hoodâ hackers giving stolen money to charity 'One day everyone will use China's digital currency' In October, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey cautioned over Bitcoin's use as a payment method. ""I have to be honest, it is hard to see that Bitcoin has what we tend to call intrinsic value,"" he said. ""It may have extrinsic value in the sense that people want it."" Mr Bailey added that he was ""very nervous"" about people using Bitcoin for payments pointing out that investors should realise its price is extremely volatile.

"Hospitals across the UK are being told to prepare to face the same Covid pressures as the NHS in London and south-east England. Senior doctor Prof Andrew Goddard said the virus's highly infectious new variant was spreading nationwide. Case numbers were ""mild"" compared with where he expected them to be next week, he said, with doctors ""really worried"". It comes as a further 57,725 people have tested positive for Covid - a new daily high. This is the fifth day in a row new daily cases have been over 50,000 and brings the total number of cases to 2,599,789. Another 445 deaths, of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days, were reported on Saturday - bringing the total number of deaths to 74,570,according to government figures,external. 'Nail-biting' weeks ahead for NHS, hospitals warn Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? The UK-wide total for people in hospital with Covid has already passed the spring peak. Half of the major hospital trusts in England are said to be dealing with more Covid-19 patients than at the worst point of the first wave in April, with the NHS facing its ""busiest winter ever"". Prof Goddard, of the Royal College of Physicians, told BBC Breakfast: ""There's no doubt that Christmas is going to have a big impact, the new variant is also going to have a big impact, we know that is more infectious, more transmissible, so I think the large numbers that we're seeing in the South East, in London, in south Wales, is now going to be reflected over the next month, two months even, over the rest of the country."" He said: ""It seems very likely that we are going to see more and more cases, wherever people work in the UK, and we need to be prepared for that."" Pressure has been so great on hospitals in London and south-east England that some patients have been moved out of the area. London's weekly rate of coronavirus cases is 858 per 100,000 people, double the UK figure. Dominic Harrison, director of public health for Blackburn and Darwen,said a decision on a new lockdown,externalhad to be decided ""in the next week"" - instead of waiting for the North to get to the same rates as the capital ""and 'call it late' which has been our pattern of response too often"". The most recent UK-wide statistics, from 28 December, showed there were 23,823 people in hospital with Covid. That was already significantly higher than the spring peak, which saw 21,683 in hospital on 12 April. Only English hospitals have released figures for the final three days of December - and these show that a further 2,302 Covid patients were occupying hospital beds on 31 December. London's Nightingale emergency hospital is ready to admit patients, the NHS has said, while other sites currently not in use are being readied. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Prof Goddard said it was vital the public did not ""let their guard down"" and continued to follow government guidelines, including wearing a face mask, maintaining social distancing and washing hands. ""Until the vaccination hits and does its job - that's what our best defence is going to be,"" he said. Dr Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant in Wales, told BBC Breakfast that ""hospitals are absolutely bursting"", adding that a quarter of her staff were currently off sick or self-isolating, making managing patients even more challenging. ""When we see the daily figures - we know that will sting us in about 10-12 days' time in the hospital,"" she said. ""We are not even at day 10 post-Christmas yet and it's already exceedingly busy. ""We are going to get to the point where we physically don't have the staff to look after people safely anymore."" Dr Jones also urged the public to ""please just obey the rules"", adding: ""Stop mixing with other households because it is spreading like wildfire - and we haven't got much more space in the hospitals left.""

"Pressure is growing on the government to keep all schools in England closed for two weeks after the Christmas break amid a surge in coronavirus cases. Teaching unions have told primary school staff it is unsafe to return to work, and called for remote learning. Head teachers have begun legal action to force ministers to reveal data behind the decision for some schools to reopen on Monday. The government said decisions are based on new infections and NHS pressure. Labour has accused the government of ""creating chaos"" for parents. Most primary schools in England are expected to open on Monday while secondary schools will reopen on a staggered basis, with exam year pupils returning on 11 January and others returning a week later. How many cases are there in your area? How will mass testing help schools? 'Nail-biting' weeks ahead for NHS, hospitals warn On Friday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced that all of London's primaries would remain shut on Monday - reversing a decision to keep only schools in certain boroughs closed. He said the closures were a last resort in the face of a fast-moving situation. Elsewhere, Brighton and Hove Council has advised primary schools to switch to remote learning next week. Meanwhile, president of the Royal College of Physicians, Prof Andrew Goddard,told the BBC the new highly infectious strain of coronavirus was spreading across the country, adding: ""All hospitals that haven't had the big pressures that they've had in the South East, London and south Wales should expect that it's going to come their way."" This video can not be played School staff in Liverpool on whether schools there should close for the start of term The National Education Union (NEU), which is the UK's largest education union and has more than 450,000 members, said all primary and secondary schools should remain closed for a further two weeks after the school holiday. It is advising members against working in school. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) called for all schools to move to home learning for a ""brief and determined period for most children"", and said it would issue guidance to head teachers recommending they take no action against staff who refused to return to work if they felt unsafe. And in a letter to the education secretary, the NASUWT called for an ""immediate nationwide move to remote education"" as the ""only sensible and credible option"" to minimise risk, while the GMB, which represents support staff, called on Mr Williamson to apply ""common sense"". Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the government's plans for the start of the spring term were ""untenable"", adding that face-to-face teaching should be restricted to only vulnerable children and those of key workers until at least January 18. The ASCL and the NAHT have started legal action to get the Department for Education to share any information showing ""why they think it is safe to reopen schools on Monday, given the higher transmissibility of the new Covid-19 variant"". This video can not be played Dr Mary Bousted said the original advice to close schools in only some London boroughs ""made no sense right from the beginning"" Dr Mary Bousted, joint head of the NEU, said that if the government did not ""take the right steps"" it would be informing its members of their ""legal right to refuse to work in unsafe conditions"". Elsewhere, the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,300 independent schools in the UK, said it was seeking ""urgent clarification"" from the government over its plans. Julie Robinson, ISC chief executive, said: ""All schools put safety first and are concerned for their communities. Independent schools share the concerns expressed by the unions today."" Dr Mike Tildesley, a University of Warwick epidemiologist who advises the government as part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said that while there was a rise in cases in secondary school age groups, there was not strong evidence of transmission in the school environment. The U-turn on London's primary schools has given momentum to calls for a bigger revision of the government's plans for the new term. A term, which of course, starts in less than 48 hours' time. There has certainly been a dramatic ratcheting up of pressure by teaching unions. The advice from the NEU to its members - that they are not safe in the classroom - puts teachers on a collision course with the government, which insists they are. The latest published advice from government scientists doesn't entirely come down on either side. All of which leaves children and their parents caught in the middle. The Department for Education has pulled quite a few about-turns in this pandemic. The question facing ministers this weekend is this - is another one now practically inevitable (and, politically, best done swiftly)? Or do they, as has been indicated, stand by their commitment to keeping schools open come what may - and try to reassure instead. Sian Elliott, of the Trades Union Congress, said the last-minute announcements were ""wreaking havoc"" for working parents, leaving many ""in an impossible position, scrambling to hold onto their jobs and care for their children"". Ms Elliott said parents affected by school closures should be offered paid parental leave or furlough. Charlotte Clarke, who lives in East Sussex, wants schools to remain open and said it was ""physically impossible"" for her to work from home as a solicitor and teach her son in Year 6 and daughter in Year 1. ""In the first lockdown my mental health, and my children's mental health, suffered. My daughter, who was in foundation at the time, stopped eating and sleeping,"" she said. ""I could not work and care for them and teach them at the same time."" Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live London's Nightingale 'ready to admit patients' What can you still do in tier four? Mr Williamson said in mid-Decemberthat all primary school pupils in England would return as normal in January, while the return of secondary schools and colleges would be gradual to give them time to set up mass testing programmes. But on Wednesday,the education secretary delayed the start of termfor all secondary schools, as well as some primary schools in Covid hotspots in south-east England, including parts of London. Two days later, after pressure from local authorities, heexpanded the primary school closuresto the whole of London. It means more than one million primary school pupils will now learn from home for at least the first two weeks of term. Vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will continue to attend school, the government said, adding that early years care, alternative provision and special schools will remain open. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries Shadow education secretary Kate Green criticised the timing of the announcement, saying it was ""yet another government U-turn creating chaos for parents just two days before the start of term"". Dave Lee-Allan, head teacher of Stowmarket High School in Suffolk, said ""it should be left to the head teachers on the ground to make the right call"", adding he was frustrated that while keeping children in school was said to be a priority and teachers were considered key workers, they did not qualify for early access to the vaccine. Mr Williamson said the London-wide closures were a ""last resort and a temporary solution"" to help tackle the particularly high infection rates in the capital, adding the government would ""reopen classrooms as soon as we possibly can"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said closing all schools in London -which has the highest rate of coronavirus infections- was ""the right decision"" but added that the original plan to only keep some closed had caused immense confusion. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is facing calls to keep schools shut A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Children's education has consistently been a national priority, which is why we want classrooms to reopen wherever possible in the new term. ""Schools will continue to implement appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission. ""As we've said, we will move to remote education as a last resort, with involvement of public health officials, in areas where infection and pressures on the NHS are highest."" Three of the worst-hit English local authorities in tier four have not been told to delay the opening of primaries. Rushmoor (817 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 28 December), Slough (777) and Spelthorne (721) are all in the south-east of England. In Rushmoor where cases have increased by 54% week-on-week, the case rate is higher than 26 local authorities where primary schools will remain shut on 4 January. Secondary schools in Englandwill stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January. Mostprimary schools in Englandwill return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January. InWales, local councils have been told they can be ""flexible"" with when they open - with many schools aiming to return for face-to-face lessons from 11 January. InNorthern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January. InScotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January.

"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

"Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found. This is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage. Increased testing and enhanced contact tracing iscarried out in very specific locations,external- local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets. Some of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not haveCovid symptoms. The testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.

Army medics are helping with vaccinations in some areas where the Delta variant is spreading Scientists have identified a number of ""variants of concern"" - these arenewly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. Also, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines. The Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. This involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis. It is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result. The lateral flow test This also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid.

Half of the major hospital trusts in England are said to be dealing with more Covid-19 patients than at the worst point of the first wave in April, with the NHS facing its ""busiest winter ever"". Prof Goddard, of the Royal College of Physicians, told BBC Breakfast: ""There's no doubt that Christmas is going to have a big impact, the new variant is also going to have a big impact, we know that is more infectious, more transmissible, so I think the large numbers that we're seeing in the South East, in London, in south Wales, is now going to be reflected over the next month, two months even, over the rest of the country."" He said: ""It seems very likely that we are going to see more and more cases, wherever people work in the UK, and we need to be prepared for that."" Pressure has been so great on hospitals in London and south-east England that some patients have been moved out of the area. London's weekly rate of coronavirus cases is 858 per 100,000 people, double the UK figure. Dominic Harrison, director of public health for Blackburn and Darwen,said a decision on a new lockdown,externalhad to be decided ""in the next week"" - instead of waiting for the North to get to the same rates as the capital ""and 'call it late' which has been our pattern of response too often"". The most recent UK-wide statistics, from 28 December, showed there were 23,823 people in hospital with Covid. That was already significantly higher than the spring peak, which saw 21,683 in hospital on 12 April. Only English hospitals have released figures for the final three days of December - and these show that a further 2,302 Covid patients were occupying hospital beds on 31 December. London's Nightingale emergency hospital is ready to admit patients, the NHS has said, while other sites currently not in use are being readied. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Prof Goddard said it was vital the public did not ""let their guard down"" and continued to follow government guidelines, including wearing a face mask, maintaining social distancing and washing hands. ""Until the vaccination hits and does its job - that's what our best defence is going to be,"" he said. Dr Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant in Wales, told BBC Breakfast that ""hospitals are absolutely bursting"", adding that a quarter of her staff were currently off sick or self-isolating, making managing patients even more challenging. ""When we see the daily figures - we know that will sting us in about 10-12 days' time in the hospital,"" she said. ""We are not even at day 10 post-Christmas yet and it's already exceedingly busy. ""We are going to get to the point where we physically don't have the staff to look after people safely anymore."" Dr Jones also urged the public to ""please just obey the rules"", adding: ""Stop mixing with other households because it is spreading like wildfire - and we haven't got much more space in the hospitals left.""

"Teachers' unions say they want to know more about the new variant of the virus Unions representing teachers and heads in Wales have called for face-to-face teaching to be suspended in response to the new coronavirus variant. The NASUWT has threatened ""appropriate action in order to protect members whose safety is put at risk"". Head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said it had taken legal action against the Welsh Government to obtain scientific evidence it said it was ""withholding"". The Welsh Government said it had agreed an approach with local authorities. The National Education Union Cymruhad already called for in-person learning to be delayed until at least 18 January. According to councils, many secondary schools aim to return from 11 January, with some fully open on 6 January. Welsh schools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers from this week. 'Flexible' school return plan in place in Wales from Monday Staggered return for Wales' schools in January New coronavirus variant: What do we know? All pupils will be expected to take part in remote learning before their schools reopen for face-to-face teaching. But teachers' unions have said more time is needed to understand thenew Covid-19 variant. While ""completely committed"" to ensuring children return to school as soon as possible, NASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach said it was now ""abundantly clear that the pandemic is seriously impacting on the ability of all schools to continue to operate normally"". ""The NASUWT will not hesitate to take appropriate action in order to protect members whose safety is put at risk as a result of the failure of employers or the Welsh Government to ensure safe working conditions in schools."" The Welsh Government says it has built flexibility into the first two weeks of term Neil Butler, the union's official for Wales, said there was ""chaos and confusion"" in the Welsh education system, and that ""the buck has effectively been passed to local authorities and some authorities have passed it down to individual schools"". Mr Butler said a suspension of face-to-face teaching would allow schools to review their risk assessments in light of the new variant. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""We have agreed with local authorities a common approach to schools returning in January with some flexibility built in over the first two weeks of term. ""It is our expectation that pupils, when not in school, will continue to benefit from remote learning."" Secondary schools in Englandwill stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January. Mostprimary schools in Englandwill return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January. InNorthern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January. InScotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January. Read more here Laura Doel, director of NAHT Cymru, said ""control of infection has been lost"" in large parts of Wales, which had created an ""intolerable risk to many school communities"". ""It is simply unacceptable for schools to remain open when there is such a question mark over the impact the new variant will have and we will not sit back and let this happen without calling the Welsh Government to account, for the sake of the whole school community,"" she added. Ms Doel said the union had taken legal action ""to force"" the Welsh Government ""to disclose the scientific information they are withholding"" which has guided its policies.

"When dentist Andy Bates offered to help administer the coronavirus vaccine, he hadn't bargained for the ""overload of bureaucracy"" he says came his way. Dr Bates, from North Yorkshire, is one of a number of health staff to criticise the paperwork needed to gain NHS approval to give the jabs. Some medics have been asked for proof they are trained in areas such as preventing radicalisation. The PM said the health secretary would be ""taking steps"" to address the issue. Asked about reports potential volunteers were being deterred by the additional training and forms about ""de-radicalisation measures"" and ""fire drills"", Mr Johnson told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday: ""I think it's absurd and I know that the health secretary is taking steps to get rid of that pointless bureaucracy."" The NHS has previously said training and checks were needed for vaccinators. 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved for use in UK Hospitals across UK 'must prepare for Covid surge' Dr Bates, a 56-year-old dentist based in Skipton, says he was met with layers of ""bureaucracy"" when he applied to be an NHS vaccinator - a paid role that requires healthcare experience. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I am a working dentist with a dental practice. I work four days a week which gives me a day off and the weekend, so I thought I could probably help out [with] explaining things to people, being able to use a needle, being able to relax people in an environment where you're giving them a jab. ""It's part and parcel of the job of being a dentist."" But he says he and two of his dental staff who also applied for roles have been asked to upload a ""huge list of documents"" and complete online modules proving they are trained in certain areas to progress their applications. Recognising and managing anaphylaxis Resuscitation, level 2 Safeguarding adults, level 2 Safeguarding children, level 2 Vaccine administration Vaccine storage Health, Safety and Welfare, level 1 Infection Prevention and control, level 2 Introduction to Anaphylaxis Legal aspects of vaccination Moving and Handling, level 1 Preventing radicalisation, level 1 Conflict resolution, level 1 Core knowledge for Covid-19 vaccinators Covid mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 (Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine) Data security awareness, level 1 Equality, Diversity and Human rights, level 1 Fire safety, level 1 Dr Bates says: ""Some of the things are really quite sensible - like resuscitation, and recognising and managing anaphylaxis - but then you get things like preventing radicalisation, level 1 certificate required [or] safeguarding children level 2."" ""Children aren't a priority for vaccination, [so] I really don't think we're going to be seeing children."" He says in order to be a registered dentist and CQC registered dental practice, he already has to prove he has kept up his various trainings every year, but having to separate them out according to the NHS website's requirements ""would be really quite a task"". ""I must admit, I gave up at the second hurdle, because I'm very busy as a dentist and I do get home quite tired at night. I thought 'good grief, If I have to go through all this', I'm not [doing it]."" Dr Bates believes that registered healthcare practitioners should be able to apply through their registration details, with a thorough identity check that would fast-track them through the necessary training. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first jab approved in the UK, and944,539 people have had their first jab. The prime minister told the BBC there would be 530,000 doses of therecently approved Oxford/AstraZeneca jabat 540 GP and 101 hospital vaccination sites on Monday, in addition to ""the million or so"" who have already been vaccinated. Revealing there were a ""few millions more"" Pfizer vaccine still be used, Mr Johnson told Andrew Marr the jabs were being rolled out ""as fast as we can"", saying the issue was not one of ""not so much one of distribution"",  and referred to concerns over the number of retired doctors to administer the jabs. Dr Phil Clarke and wife Sheelagh, a nurse practitioner, retired from their local GP practice in Southampton two years ago. But when the pandemic struck in March andthe government appealed for retired medics to help out, they answered the call and returned. Sheelagh and Dr Clarke, both 67, say they have already been administering the Pfizer vaccine to the over-70s and 80s, care home residents and other vulnerable groups through their old practice. But when the couple recently applied to become NHS vaccinators, Sheelagh says they feel that despite their skills and relevant experience, that the NHS was asking them to ""jump through 101 hoops"". She told the BBC: ""You kind of feel like you're trusted and have quite major responsibility to go in and do vaccinating, and then a very belittling application tells you that they don't trust that you've got the skills and abilities to do it."" She said although they had done a lot of the required e-learning for their own practice, some of the other modules they'd been asked to do had left them ""flabbergasted"". ""We don't have time to do any more e-learning, we've already done a lot - probably about 10-12 hours- some of which are perfectly reasonable, like infection control, it's the unreasonable demands"" such as ""awareness of radicalisation and conflict resolution"". Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said recently retired medics and other healthcare professionals have ""huge amounts of skill and experience"" to offer the vaccine effort and called for ""bureaucratic barriers"" to be kept to ""the bare minimum"". He added: ""Requiring people to submit more than 20 pieces of documentation, some of which have low relevance to the task they will be doing, and some of which some retired medics and returners to the profession won't even have, is a deterrent for them getting involved at a time when we need all hands on deck."" An NHS spokesman told the BBC on Saturday: ""Regardless of a person's background in healthcare, appropriate training and checks are necessary to handle the vaccine. ""[This] is why important processes are in place to make sure that former members of staff are up to speed on protocols and delivery, so that vaccinators are fully equipped with the skills to safely vaccinate patients in line with Public Health England standards."" The spokesman added that ""tens of thousands of people have already completed their online training"" which ""are being processed as quickly as possible and vaccinators will be deployed as and when they are required"". He added: ""It is categorically untrue that there are any delays in Covid vaccination caused by accrediting volunteers or returners."" This video can not be played The Princess Royal Hospital at Haywards Heath was among the hospitals receiving a delivery The UK plans to accelerate its vaccination rollout,amid a rise in coronavirus cases driven by a new variant of coronavirus, by giving both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between the Pfizer jabs. Public Health England (PHE) has clarified its guidance on second doses of the vaccine, after an article in the New York Times claimed there could be ""mixing and matching"" of the two different vaccines now authorised for use in the UK. Dr Mary Ramsay, PHE's head of immunisations, said experts did ""not recommend mixing"" the jabs, but on the ""extremely rare occasions"" where the same vaccine is unavailable or it is unknown which jab the patient received, it is ""better to give a second dose of another vaccine than not at all"". 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved for use in UK Hospitals across UK 'must prepare for Covid surge' At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

A number of people slept in their cars before returning to dance, Le Monde newspaper reports. One reveller told Le Monde that the rave was ""very well organised"" with food stalls inside. Another, who came with four friends from Finisterre in north-west France, told the newspaper that she had wantedto ""escape"" for a few hours.,external On Friday an interior ministry crisis meeting was held and all vehicle exits from the rave were blocked as police sought to shut down the party. Police issued more than 200 fines France introduced strict rules ahead of the New Year including a curfew from 20:00 until 06:00. More than 100,000 police officers were deployed across the country to break up parties and enforce the curfew. Officers were instructed to break up underground partiesas soon as they were reported, fine participants and identify the organisers.

"Officers dispersed the party at the Grade II* listed church before midnight Thousands of pounds has been raised to pay for repairs to a 500-year-old church that was ""trashed"" during an illegal New Year's Eve party. Hundreds of revellers attended the party at All Saints Church in East Horndon, near Brentwood, after the building was broken into. Three people were arrested on suspicion of public order and drugs offences. Volunteer group Friends of All Saints said it was ""completely overwhelmed"" by peoples' ""support and generosity"". Church volunteer Astrid Gillespie said the damage was ""devastating"" The fundraising page was set up on Friday and aimed to raise Â£2,000, but in less than 24 hours it had raised more than Â£8,700. It said a ""massive clean-up"" was needed at the ""much-loved"" church after ""hundreds of revellers trashed the place"". Essex is in England'stop tier four of coronavirus restrictionsand onWednesday declared a major incident over virus cases. Equipment was seized by police at the illegal party Astrid Gillespie, a volunteer with the Friends of All Saints, said event organisers had smashed a window to put in an extractor fan unit and wired sound equipment into the church's fuse box. She said: ""It was a professional set-up. They had a bar area where you had to exchange tokens. ""It's such a beautiful church. To find out it's been damaged is devastating."" Referring to the money that was raised, she said: ""Faith in humanity restored"". The church, which is owned and maintained by the Churches Conservation Trust, has not been used for religious services since 1970, but regularly houses community events.

"Amanda Quinn, who has early onset dementia, is cared for by her 23-year-old daughter Bethany ""It feels like you're being punished for something you didn't do."" Amanda Quinn describes living through lockdown with early onset dementia as ""scary"" and ""feeling lost"". Two years ago, she was diagnosed with the condition aged 49, and said the disease was a ""ticking time bomb"" for her husband and four children. Alzheimer's Society Cymru support worker Lorraine Davies said lockdown had brought a ""great sense of loss"" to many families. Since her diagnosis, Amanda says she has lost her sense of what day it is, her concentration, and she struggles with speech occasionally and suffers more with incontinence. When Wales went into a UK national lockdown on 23 March, Amanda said she did not leave her home in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, for weeks. She said her children have noticed a ""big change"" in her. ""I used to have a wicked sense of humour - I still have one, but it's not how I used to be,"" she said. But for Amanda one of the worst parts of her condition is ""losing so many friends"" whom she said ""would rather cross the road"" than talk to her. ""They don't know how to interact with me anymore,"" she said. Ex-Wales flanker Alix Popham diagnosed with early onset dementia Are barcodes the way to protect dementia patients? Amanda says her children have noticed a ""big change"" since she was diagnosed aged 49 Her 23-year-old daughter Bethany Kingsley, who cares for her, said the pandemic has caused caring work to increase ten-fold. ""I have to keep an eye on mum a lot more now, because she doesn't know what to do with herself. ""But I have also got to look after my mental health side of it as well. There are days where I'm struggling,"" she said. Now Amanda does activities at home such as adult colouring books, baking with Bethany, and watches movies. ""It is like being a child,"" Amanda explained. ""My daughter says it's like we've switched roles and she has become the adult as she holds my hand when we cross the road. ""Although I can see a car, it doesn't register to me that it is not safe to walk out, all I can think is that I need to be on the other side of the road."" Before the pandemic, she attended dementia support groups in person, such as Memoria, a theatrical group of people with dementia and carers, whereas now she does this virtually. Bethany says Covid has had a big impact on caring for her mother Last year, before the pandemic, Bethany put off moving away to study midwifery at university in Bristol. Although she said it was a ""difficult"" decision as she had wanted to do it for years, she said she was glad she was home to care for her mother during the pandemic. Instead she chose to study for an Open University course in health and social care from home. ""I thought my mother is the only person I've got at the end of the day and I would rather make sure she is safe and happy, rather than go off and leave her,"" she said. But Amanda said she was concerned about how her condition will progress and affect her family more. The 51-year-old said it was ""not fair"" that her daughter had to stay home because of her condition. ""It worries me how it will affect my children. I'm fortunate, I suppose, that I'm not going to know. ""I say I don't want to go into a care home but that wouldn't be fair on them - they have still got their whole lives to lead"". Amanda was still in her 40s when she was diagnosed Alzheimer's Society Cymru support adviser for younger people Lorraine Davies said there was a stigma attached to younger people with the disease and a ""lack of public awareness"". ""Some have mortgages, some have young families, and often they also care for older adults - so it has a different impact on them, and their social network of people. ""A lot of people living with dementia don't always feel they will have next year, so 2020 has been a great sense of loss to them because of the lockdown and restrictions,"" she said. The charity estimates that there are between 2,000 to 3,000 people with young onset dementia in Wales, according to 2018 figures from the first Welsh Government national dementia action plan. However Lorraine said the figure was likely to be higher as getting a dementia diagnosis can be harder for younger people, and can take more than a year to have it confirmed. ""It is also more common for younger people to have rarer forms of dementia, so rather than being a typical Alzheimer's disease, associated with memory loss, a patient might have behavioural changes, but you might just think they are upset, stressed, or put it down to mood swings. ""Some people have been accused of being drunk, because they have slurred speech, but actually that is a symptom."" She said the Alzheimer's Society has organised virtual support groups for people with the condition and their carers during lockdown. ""Often younger people want to meet people like them, because it helps them not to feel so alone in this. Knowing that brings people comfort."" The power of music: Our dementia choir Dementia: The greatest health challenge of our time Simon Hatch, the director of Carers Trust Wales, said the pandemic had highlighted the ""crucial role unpaid carers play both in providing exceptional, expert care to family and friends"". Mr Hatch said the trust found that 44% of young adult carers it spoke to felt overwhelmed by the pressures they were facing. He said although there was support available to carers they would need ""sustainable"" forms of this in the future. There are about 45,000 people with dementia in Wales, according to the Alzheimer's Society. The disease is considered ""early onset"" when it affects people under 65, according to Young Dementia UK. Lorraine said the age distinction was made to mark the difference in financial support, as 65 was state pension age at the time. Dementia itself refers to a set of symptoms caused by many diseases of the brain. The most common symptom is memory loss and difficulty concentrating. Other symptoms can include struggling to remember recent events, changes to behaviour, mood, becoming lost in familiar places or being unable to find the right word in a conversation. Specific symptoms will depend on the parts of the brain that are damaged and the disease that is causing the dementia.

"Candles burned for those who have died in the landslide at Ask Seven bodies have now been found in the search for the missing after a massive landslide that destroyed homes in Norway last week, police have said. Four bodies were discovered on Friday and Saturday, and another three on Sunday. The first victim to be found was named as Eirik GrÃ¸nole, 31. Several people remain missing following the hillside collapse that sent mud into the village of Ask on Wednesday. Rescuers are working to find survivors, but chances of this are fading. Police said the latest body was recovered near where two others had been found, but they gave no further details. Five of the victims have been identified, including a 40-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter. Another 10 people were injured. The king and queen of Norway visited the site of the landslide on Sunday. Queen Sonja and King Harald lit candles in Gjerdrum Church in memory of the victims ""I'm having trouble finding something to say, because it's absolutely horrible,"" King Harald said after the visit. ""This terrible event impacts us all. I sympathise with you who are beginning the new year with sadness and uncertainty,"" he said. A shortage of daylight in the Norwegian winter has proved one of the challenges at the scene in Gjerdrum municipality, 25km (15 miles) north-east of Oslo. Rescuers are also contending with freezing temperatures and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. Helicopters and drones spent two days searching the area before Police Commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter. Rescuers began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards; the bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach the wrecked homes. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide Residents of Ask began calling emergency services at around 04:00 local time on Wednesday telling them that their houses were moving, police said. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" More than 30 homes were destroyed, with others teetering on the edges of the deep crater that was left by the landslide. At least 1,000 residents were evacuated from the area. The landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft), a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built there three years later.

"Israel has given priority to the over-60s in its vaccination campaign Israel has given vaccinations against coronavirus to more than one million people, the highest rate in the world, as global immunisation efforts step up. Israel has a rate of 11.55 vaccination doses per 100 people,external, followed by Bahrain at 3.49 and the UK at 1.47, according to a global tracking website affiliated with Oxford University. In comparison, France had vaccinated 138 people in total by 30 December. More than1.8m people have now died of the virus,externalaround the world. The comparative figures on vaccination are put together by Our World in Data, which is a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity. They measure the number of people who have received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Most of the vaccines approved for use so far rely on two doses, given more than a week apart. The US fell far short of its target of vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020, with just 2.78 million having received a jab by 30 December. Meanwhile, the US government's top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said he does not agree withUK plans to give as many people as possible a first vaccine dose, while delaying second doses. The Oxford vaccine story How close is the light at the end of the Covid tunnel? India plans to 'begin Covid vaccination in January' Dr Fauci said the US would not be adopting a similar strategy. India has meanwhile approved two vaccines for emergency use - the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the Covaxin vaccine, developed locally by Bharat Biotech and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research. Two further vaccines are awaiting approval. The country aims to vaccinate 300 million people by the middle of the year and has been staging drills to prepare for mass distribution. Israel began vaccinations on 19 December and is delivering jabs to about 150,000 people a day, with priority given to the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. It secured supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine following negotiations early on in the pandemic. It is contacting people with priority access to the vaccine through its health care system - by law all Israelis must register with a recognised health care provider. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Bateman spent 2020 following the lives of Israelis affected by the pandemic. Israel has safely subdivided shipments of the Pfizer vaccine, which must be stored at -70C, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told YNet TV news. This means smaller batches of the vaccine can be sent out to remote communities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is campaigning for re-election, has predicted Israel could emerge from the pandemic as early as February. It is currently in its third national lockdown. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? In the first three days of its vaccination campaign, which launched on 27 December, France inoculated fewer than 100 people. In comparison, Germany had given more than 190,000 vaccines by Saturday. The EU was slower than the UK or US to authorise any of the vaccines.The European Medicines Agency, the regulator for the 27 EU member states, gave its approval for the Pfizer vaccine,externalon 21 December, compared to 2 December in the UK and 11 December in the US. Part of the difficulty in France stems from the widespread scepticism about the vaccination. In a 15-country poll carried out by Ipsos Global Advisor,just 40% of French respondents said they would be willing to have the vaccine,external. This compares to 80% in China, 77% in the UK, and 69% in the US. Earlier this week, the French health minister defended the slow pace of vaccinations, saying authorities had chosen to give the jab in care homes to elderly residents, rather than making them travel. However, on Thursday French President Emmanuel Macron struck a more urgent tone, saying: ""I will not allow an unjustified slowness to set in without good reason."" India is holding a national drill for its vaccination programme, which is aiming to reach 300 million people by the middle of the year. Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has said 10 million healthcare workers and 20 million other frontline staff will be prioritised for the jabs. Authorities will initially rely on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which has now been recommended by a government panel. The Oxford jab does not require the same storage at extremely low temperatures as the Pfizer vaccine, making it suitable for distribution to areas without sophisticated health care facilities. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is known as Covishield in India, where it is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. Another vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech, has been approved for emergency use. Covid-19 has already claimed nearly 150,000 lives in India, with about 10 million people infected - second only to the number infected in the US. How close is light at end of Covid tunnel?

"The number of flights in 2020 has fallen due to the coronavirus pandemic, grounding planes worldwide More people died in commercial plane crashes in 2020, an industry group has said, despite the number of flights plummeting due to the pandemic. Dutch aviation consultancy To70 found that 299 people were killed in commercial crashes worldwide last year, rising from 257 in 2019. This is despite a sharp drop in flights due to Covid-19 restrictions. Tracking site Flightradar 24 reported that commercial flights had dropped by 42% last year. Airlines investigated over lockdown refund cases Airport 'could take years to recover' According toa statement released by To70,external, the figures include all deaths from large passenger aircraft accidents - including acts of unlawful interference, like the shooting down of aircraft.

It also includes the deaths of 98 people in May when a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight crashed in the city of Karachi.An initial report blamed ""human error""for the accident. To70 found that the number of accidents fell to 40 from a total of 86 the previous year. Only five of those 40 accidents proved fatal. But while the consultancy said the fatal accident rate is ""similar to the average of the last ten years"", it warned that the lack of flights has had a ""significant"" impact on the performance of crews, saying that ""skill fade is recognised as a critical issue for our industry as we return to normal operations"".

"This video can not be played The Senate overrides President Trump's veto The US Congress has overturned President Donald Trump's veto of a defence spending bill, the first time this has happened in his presidency. The Republican-controlled Senate held a rare New Year's Day session to debate the move, which had already been voted for by the House of Representatives. The $740bn (Â£549bn) bill will fund defence policy for the year to come. Mr Trump, who leaves office in a few weeks, objected to certain provisions in the bill. The Senate voted 81-13 for the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) - a two-thirds majority is required to override a presidential veto in both chambers. It comes just two days before a new US Congress is due to be sworn in. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump cut short their holiday in Florida to return to the White House on New Year's Eve Mr Trump had taken issue with policies that limit troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Europe and remove Confederate leaders' names from military bases. He also wanted the bill to repeal a liability shield for social media companies. Why the Civil War casts a great shadow over the US Has Trump kept his promises on the military? Before the debate began, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he was determined to pass the bill. ""Here's what the Senate is focused on - completing the annual defence legislation that looks after our brave men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform. ""We've passed this legislation 59 years in a row. And one way or another, we're going to complete the 60th annual NDAA and pass it into law before this Congress concludes on Sunday,"" he added. LaterMr Trump responded to the vote specifically on the issue of liability protection.,external ""Our Republican Senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of Section 230, which gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies. Pathetic!!!"" he said on Twitter. Bills passed by Congress need a president's signature to become law. On rare occasions, a president may choose to veto - or reject - legislation because of some policy disagreement. Lawmakers can override a presidential veto and enact bills into law by mustering two-thirds of votes in both chambers of Congress. President Trump says US military interventions like the troop presence in Afghanistan are costly and ineffective House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful congressional Democrat, said Mr Trump's veto was ""an act of staggering recklessness that harms our troops, endangers our security and undermines the will of the bipartisan Congress"". ""In a time when our country was just targeted with a massive cyber-attack,it is particularly hard to understand the reasoning behind the president's irresponsibility,external,"" she said in a statement. Ahead of Wednesday's veto, some of the outgoing president's advisers had cautioned him against rejecting the bill. Mr Trump has previously vetoed eight bills, vetoes which were all upheld with support from his fellow Republicans in Congress. He is due to leave office on 20 January, when he will be replaced by Democrat Joe Biden. Mr Trump called the 4,500-page act, which has been nearly a year in the making, a ""gift to China and Russia"". ""Unfortunately, the Act fails to include critical national security measures, includes provisions that fail to respect our veterans and our military's history, and contradicts efforts by my administration to put America first in our national security and foreign policy actions,"" he said in a statement. Mr Trump also said the bill's measures to limit bringing troops home was ""bad policy"" and ""unconstitutional"".

"Liam Reilly fronted Bagatelle for more than 40 years Irish Eurovision singer and frontman of the rock band Bagatelle, Liam Reilly, has died aged 65. A family statement confirmed that Mr Reilly ""passed away suddenly but peacefully at his home"" on 1 January. Mr Reilly fronted Bagatelle for more than 40 years and they had success with songs including Summer in Dublin and Second Violin. He also came joint second at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1990 with the song Somewhere in Europe. The song finished on 132 points, joint with France's entry sung by JoÃ«lle Ursull, in the contest in Zagreb. Italy's entrant - Insieme: 1992, sung by Tuto Cutugno - won with 149 points. Mr Reilly, from Dundalk, County Louth, also composed Ireland's Eurovision entry for the contest in Rome in 1991, when Kim Jackson performed his song Could It Be That I'm In Love, which was placed 10th. ""We know that his many friends and countless fans around the world will share in our grief as we mourn his loss, but celebrate the extraordinary talent of the man whose songs meant so much to so many."" the family statement added. Joe Gallagher, the band's promoter from Strabane, County Tyrone, told BBC Radio Ulster ""the talent that Liam brought to the music industry in Ireland is second to none"". ""Some of the songs that he has written are up there with some of the better songs written in Ireland,"" he said. ""He is one of the best singer-songwriters Ireland has ever seen or produced."" Mr Reilly also wrote songs for others, including The Wolfe Tones. The Irish group paid tribute to him on social media, describing him as ""a master songwriter"". Allow Twitter content?

"The song was written while George Michael (right) watched a football match Wham!'s Last Christmas has topped the UK singles chart for the first time, 36 years after it was first released. The festive classic was streamed 9.2 million times over the last week, knocking LadBaby's Don't Stop Me Eating off the top spot. First released in December 1984, George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley's song was held off the top spot by Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas? Ridgeley said he was ""somewhat amazed"" the record had now reached number one. He said he was ""delighted"" and ""profoundly pleased"" at the news, ""albeit 36 years after its first release which is, perhaps more than anything, a testament to its timeless appeal and charm"". ""It is a fitting tribute to George's song-writing genius and one of which he would have been immensely proud and utterly thrilled,"" Ridgeley added. Since the song was released in 1984, it has returned to the top 10 a further six times. Mariah's Christmas anthem finally tops the charts LadBaby bags third straight Christmas number one Fans had previously launched a campaign to get it to number one in 2017, to mark the first anniversary of George Michael'suntimely death on Christmas Day 2016. But it only reached number two - and was thwarted by Ed Sheeran's Perfect. Its lyrics also inspired Dame Emma Thompson to write the movie Last Christmas, which was released in cinemas last Christmas. Last Christmas was written by George Michael in his childhood bedroom in February 1984, ""and as far as I was concerned it was a number one"",he told Smash Hits in 1986.,external Inspiration struck out of the blue, while the singer was watching a football match at his parents' house in Hertfordshire. ""We'd had a bite to eat and were sitting together relaxing with the television on in the background when, almost unnoticed, George disappeared upstairs for an hour or so,"" recalled Ridgeley in his 2017 memoir. ""When he came back down, such was his excitement, it was as if he had discovered gold which, in a sense, he had. ""We went to his old room, the room in which we had spent hours as kids recording pastiches of radio shows and jingles... and he played me the introduction and the beguiling, wistful chorus melody to Last Christmas. It was a moment of wonder."" Wham! in March 1984, shortly after Last Christmas was written The song was subsequently recorded in the middle of August at London's Advision Studios, which Michael plastered in Christmas decorations to set the mood. The cheesy-but-cheerful video was shot later that year in Switzerland, featuring Wham's backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie and model Kathy Hill. Alongside its famous chunky knitwear, and central role for a silver brooch, the video also marked the final time Michael would be seen without his trademark designer stubble. Allow YouTube content?

The singer jetted back from the film shoot to record his vocals for Do They Know It's Christmas - which would eventually hold Wham!'s song off the top spot. In a gesture of solidarity with Band Aid, however, the duo donated all the royalties from Last Christmas to Ethiopian famine relief. At the time of its initial release, Last Christmas was part of a Wham! double A-side single, along with Everything She Wants. Although immediately after Christmas, radio stations started playing Everything She Wants and the band did a Top of the Pops appearance to promote it, the colossal sales of Do They Know It's Christmas meant it was never to top the chart at the time. Prior to today's chart, Last Christmas was the UK's biggest-selling single never to have reached number one - accumulating 1.9 million sales across its lifetime, according to the Official Chart Company. That title now passes on to Maroon 5's Moves Like Jagger (1.55 million sales), which was a number two hit in 2011. But Last Christmas does now hold a new chart record - for the longest time taken for a single to reach number one. The previous record-holder was Tony Christie's (Is This The Way To) Amarillo? which had a 34-year gap between its original release and topping the chart for Comic Relief in 2005. Wham!'s record is the second long-toothed classic to claim chart glory in recent weeks, after Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You reached number one in December, 26 years after its release. Christmas songs continue to dominate this week's chart countdown, with 28 festive tracks inside the top 40. This video can not be played All I Want For Christmas Is You: Meet the man behind Mariah Carey's festive classic However, as festive streams decline, some other songs have seen their fortunes turn around - with Little Mix's Sweet Melody returning to the top 10; and Ed Sheeran's new single Afterglow reaching a new peak of 13. In the albums chart, Michael BublÃ©'s Christmas album returned to number one for the first time in nine years, displacing Paul McCartney's latest record, McCartney III. Taylor Swift's second surprise album of 2020, Evermore, held steady at number two; while Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia jumped 15 places to number three after featuring prominently ina number of end-of-year polls. Correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously stated that Martin Kemp of Spandau Ballet made a cameo in the video for Last Christmas.

"The RSPB is worried about the effect the wind farm could have on kittiwakes The bird charity RSPB has criticised agovernment decision to permit an offshore wind farm,externalexpected to harm birds feeding in the North Sea. The giant Hornsea Three development lies 75 miles away fromFlamborough Head, Englandâs biggest sea bird colony,externalon the Yorkshire coast. The RSPB says kittiwakes will need to fly through the area, dodging turbines, to reach feeding grounds. The developers have promised to compensate for the impact on the birds. They plan to do this by building four bespoke nesting towers to encourage them on land. But the RSPB says it will take a decade to see whether this idea works â and that will be too late because the wind farms will be up and running by then. Black turbine blade 'can cut bird deaths' A really simple guide to climate change Have these seven green targets been met? Wind farms are not a straightforward subject for the RSPB in its efforts to protect the UK's birds. The charity supports the growth of renewable energy to combat the effects of climate change, but is fearful of the impact on birds round the coasts as turbines increase to fulfil the prime minister's promise of powering every home by wind energy. Duncan Clark from developers Orsted said: âClimate change remains a very serious threat to our environment and habitats and there is an ever-pressing need to act. âHornsea Three could provide clean power to over two million UK homes and offset over 128.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over its lifetime.â The RSPB says computer modelling suggests the huge turbines, stretching over 200 metres, will cause the deaths of 73 kittiwakes a year. Mr Clark said that the firm would offset the projected deaths by building four artificial kittiwake nest towers on land, which should prompt an equal number of the birds to be born. But the RSPB says the compensation measures proposed at Hornsea Three are speculative, and that like other wind developments in the North Sea, they are undermined by a lack of reliable data. Guillemots, pictured perched on a cliff face, can waste energy flying around the thickets of turbines The RSPBâs Andrew Dodd told BBC News: âWe have no idea whether this plan will work or not. We donât know how many birds are being killed in the first place and we certainly donât know how many of them may be encouraged by breeding towers.â He said kittiwakes had been struggling for three decades â partly because climate change is altering fish patterns and partly because of over-fishing of slim fish called sand eels, which are ground into fishmeal for salmon and pigs. Energy Secretary Alok Sharma acknowledged in his ruling on the development that wildlife would be harmed by Hornsea Three, but he granted consent on the balance of benefits. His ruling said: âThe adverse impactsâ¦ do not outweigh the significant benefits of the development in respect of contribution it would make to meeting the identified need for renewable electricity generation.â Kittiwakes appear to try to slalom their way through the wind farms that are springing up across the North Sea. Other birds such as guillemots and razor bills seem to fly round the thickets of turbines, a journey which uses energy that could otherwise be used for breeding. The RSPB and wind farm association Renewable UK both blame the government for failing to mitigate the conflict between wildlife and clean energy. A razor bill Mr Dodd said: âThe government has to lead on this. We clearly need loads more offshore wind, and the RSPB supports that. But the North Sea is filling up with turbines and we have to avoid development in the most sensitive areas. We need much better knowledge. âThis issue is cumulative â maybe one wind farm wouldnât make a great deal of difference, but the scale of the plans is massive.â The wind farm industry group Renewable UK anticipates that offshore wind turbine operators will face increasing scrutiny in the coming decade â both in terms of their impact on wildlife and the structures needed on sensitive coastlines to bring the power onshore. The group has urged the government to restore funding to the heavily-cut Natural England, so it can adequately supervise developments. Renewable UKâs Melanie Onn told BBC News: âWe urgently need to build new offshore wind farms to tackle climate change which poses the biggest threat to our way of life. âAdvisory bodies like Natural England need more funding from the government so that they can take decisions in a more timely manner.â Some turbines off the coast of Scotland are now being fitted with cameras on the tower and blades to monitor bird strikes, although this may be very challenging in rough weather. In the US, a study suggested that painting one of the three blades black seemed to help birds avoid contact â but the RSPB says that study was on an onshore turbine, and needs verification. Anotherscheme has seen,externalwind farms turned off when the approach of rare condors is detected through radio transmitters they carry. This only works for threatened condor but the US equivalent of the RSPB, the Audubon Society, has warned that if climate change continues apace, hundreds of North American bird species' ranges will shrink by at least half by 2100. ""Climate change is the biggest impact on birds,"" said Garry George from Audubon. What's more, renewable energy campaigners point out that cats and skyscrapers kill far more birds than wind turbines.

"Israel has given priority to the over-60s in its vaccination campaign Israel has given vaccinations against coronavirus to more than one million people, the highest rate in the world, as global immunisation efforts step up. Israel has a rate of 11.55 vaccination doses per 100 people,external, followed by Bahrain at 3.49 and the UK at 1.47, according to a global tracking website affiliated with Oxford University. In comparison, France had vaccinated 138 people in total by 30 December. More than1.8m people have now died of the virus,externalaround the world. The comparative figures on vaccination are put together by Our World in Data, which is a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity. They measure the number of people who have received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Most of the vaccines approved for use so far rely on two doses, given more than a week apart. The US fell far short of its target of vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020, with just 2.78 million having received a jab by 30 December. Meanwhile, the US government's top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said he does not agree withUK plans to give as many people as possible a first vaccine dose, while delaying second doses. The Oxford vaccine story How close is the light at the end of the Covid tunnel? India plans to 'begin Covid vaccination in January' Dr Fauci said the US would not be adopting a similar strategy. India has meanwhile approved two vaccines for emergency use - the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the Covaxin vaccine, developed locally by Bharat Biotech and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research. Two further vaccines are awaiting approval. The country aims to vaccinate 300 million people by the middle of the year and has been staging drills to prepare for mass distribution. Israel began vaccinations on 19 December and is delivering jabs to about 150,000 people a day, with priority given to the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. It secured supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine following negotiations early on in the pandemic. It is contacting people with priority access to the vaccine through its health care system - by law all Israelis must register with a recognised health care provider. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Bateman spent 2020 following the lives of Israelis affected by the pandemic. Israel has safely subdivided shipments of the Pfizer vaccine, which must be stored at -70C, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told YNet TV news. This means smaller batches of the vaccine can be sent out to remote communities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is campaigning for re-election, has predicted Israel could emerge from the pandemic as early as February. It is currently in its third national lockdown. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? In the first three days of its vaccination campaign, which launched on 27 December, France inoculated fewer than 100 people. In comparison, Germany had given more than 190,000 vaccines by Saturday. The EU was slower than the UK or US to authorise any of the vaccines.The European Medicines Agency, the regulator for the 27 EU member states, gave its approval for the Pfizer vaccine,externalon 21 December, compared to 2 December in the UK and 11 December in the US. Part of the difficulty in France stems from the widespread scepticism about the vaccination. In a 15-country poll carried out by Ipsos Global Advisor,just 40% of French respondents said they would be willing to have the vaccine,external. This compares to 80% in China, 77% in the UK, and 69% in the US. Earlier this week, the French health minister defended the slow pace of vaccinations, saying authorities had chosen to give the jab in care homes to elderly residents, rather than making them travel. However, on Thursday French President Emmanuel Macron struck a more urgent tone, saying: ""I will not allow an unjustified slowness to set in without good reason."" India is holding a national drill for its vaccination programme, which is aiming to reach 300 million people by the middle of the year. Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has said 10 million healthcare workers and 20 million other frontline staff will be prioritised for the jabs. Authorities will initially rely on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which has now been recommended by a government panel. The Oxford jab does not require the same storage at extremely low temperatures as the Pfizer vaccine, making it suitable for distribution to areas without sophisticated health care facilities. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is known as Covishield in India, where it is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. Another vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech, has been approved for emergency use. Covid-19 has already claimed nearly 150,000 lives in India, with about 10 million people infected - second only to the number infected in the US. How close is light at end of Covid tunnel?

Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead The latest in a series of attempts by allies of President Donald Trump to overturn the November US election result has failed. A Texas judge rejected the case, brought by Republican Louie Gohmert, seeking to stop Vice-President Mike Pence from certifying the final result. Lawyers for Mr Pence had asked for the case to be thrown out on Thursday. President-elect Joe Biden is due to take office on 20 January. Mr Trump is yet to concede. Mr Gohmert, a Republican congressman, told Newsmax TV thathe planned to appeal against the verdict.,external Mr Trump's friends and colleagues in the Republican party have presenteddozens of legal challengesto the November outcome which delivered a decisive win to Mr Biden. His victory was announced after days of vote-counting that took longer than in recent years because of the huge number of postal ballots cast due to the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Trump has made numerous unsubstantiated claims that Mr Biden's win, which saw the president-elect gain 306 electoral college votes to his rival's 232, was fraudulent. What legal challenges remain to the US election? What happens on the day Biden is sworn in? Trump's looming legal battles The electoral college is a system whereby each US state has an allocated number of points that is granted to the overall winner in each state. The candidate who gains the majority wins the presidency. This video can not be played Explaining the Electoral College and which voters will decide who wins Congressman Gohmert's case sought to allow Vice-President Mike Pence to reject some electoral college votes when they are ratified by Congress on 6 January. The vice-president presides over the vote certification in Congress in a ceremonial role that involves opening and tallying the envelopes containing electoral college votes before announcing the result. Mr Gohmert's case aimed to expand that role to allow Mr Pence to cast judgement on the validity of the votes and potentially replace votes for Mr Biden with ones for Mr Trump. But Judge Jeremy Kernodle, who was appointed to the Texas court in 2018 by Mr Trump, rejected the case, saying it was based on speculative events. On Thursday a lawyer from the US Justice Department representing Mr Pence urged Mr Gohmert to drop the case, suggesting that it was not the vice-president's office that should be scrutinising the outcome. Although most Republicans in Congress are expected to vote in favour of certifying the results, a small number includingSenator Josh Hawley, say they plan to object. But their vote is not expected to change the outcome. Mr Biden is due to be sworn in as president on 20 January at a scaled-back ceremony with just 1,000 tickets available due to Covid-19 precautions.

Israel began vaccinations on 19 December and is delivering jabs to about 150,000 people a day, with priority given to the over-60s, health workers and people who are clinically vulnerable. It secured supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine following negotiations early on in the pandemic. It is contacting people with priority access to the vaccine through its health care system - by law all Israelis must register with a recognised health care provider. This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Bateman spent 2020 following the lives of Israelis affected by the pandemic. Israel has safely subdivided shipments of the Pfizer vaccine, which must be stored at -70C, Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told YNet TV news. This means smaller batches of the vaccine can be sent out to remote communities. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is campaigning for re-election, has predicted Israel could emerge from the pandemic as early as February. It is currently in its third national lockdown. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? In the first three days of its vaccination campaign, which launched on 27 December, France inoculated fewer than 100 people. In comparison, Germany had given more than 190,000 vaccines by Saturday. The EU was slower than the UK or US to authorise any of the vaccines.The European Medicines Agency, the regulator for the 27 EU member states, gave its approval for the Pfizer vaccine,externalon 21 December, compared to 2 December in the UK and 11 December in the US. Part of the difficulty in France stems from the widespread scepticism about the vaccination. In a 15-country poll carried out by Ipsos Global Advisor,just 40% of French respondents said they would be willing to have the vaccine,external. This compares to 80% in China, 77% in the UK, and 69% in the US. Earlier this week, the French health minister defended the slow pace of vaccinations, saying authorities had chosen to give the jab in care homes to elderly residents, rather than making them travel. However, on Thursday French President Emmanuel Macron struck a more urgent tone, saying: ""I will not allow an unjustified slowness to set in without good reason."" India is holding a national drill for its vaccination programme, which is aiming to reach 300 million people by the middle of the year. Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has said 10 million healthcare workers and 20 million other frontline staff will be prioritised for the jabs. Authorities will initially rely on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which has now been recommended by a government panel. The Oxford jab does not require the same storage at extremely low temperatures as the Pfizer vaccine, making it suitable for distribution to areas without sophisticated health care facilities. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is known as Covishield in India, where it is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. Another vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech, has been approved for emergency use.

"Lisa Montgomery is scheduled for execution in January 2021 A US appeals court has lifted a stay of execution on the only woman awaiting a federal death penalty. Lisa Montgomery strangled a pregnant woman in Missouri before cutting out and kidnapping the baby in 2004. If the execution goes ahead, she will be the first female federal inmate to be put to death in almost 70 years. Montgomery's execution date was originally set for last month but a stay was put in place after her attorneys contracted Covid-19. It was then rescheduled for 12 January by the Justice Department. But Montgomery's lawyers argued that the date could not be set while a stay was in place. A court sided with her attorneys, stopping an order from the director of the Bureau of Prisons scheduling her death. But on Friday,a panel of judges concluded that the director had acted under the law,external, allowing the execution to take place. In Trumpâs final days, a rush of federal executions US resumption of federal executions criticised Montgomery's legal team said they willfile a petition for the judges to reconsider their ruling,external. The last woman to be executed by the US government was Bonnie Heady, who died in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years before President Donald Trump ordered them to resume earlier last year. If the remaining executions go ahead, Mr Trump will have overseen the most executions by a US president in more than a century. Montgomery's execution date is just days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office. Mr Biden, who for decades was a fierce supporter of the death penalty as a Delaware senator, has now said he will seek to end federal executions once he takes office. In December 2004, Montgomery drove from Kansas to the home of Bobbie Jo Stinnett, in Missouri, purportedly to purchase a puppy,according to a Department of Justice press release,external. ""Once inside the residence, Montgomery attacked and strangled Stinnett - who was eight months pregnant - until the victim lost consciousness,"" it says. Montgomery cut into Stinnett's body to remove the baby, which she took with her in an attempt to pass it off as her own. In 2007, a jury found Montgomery guilty of federal kidnapping resulting in death, and unanimously recommended a death sentence. But Montgomery's lawyers say she experienced brain damage from beatings as a child and is mentally unwell, so should not face the death penalty. Under the US justice system, crimes can be tried either in federal courts, at a national level, or in state courts, at a regional level. Certain crimes, such as counterfeiting currency or mail theft, are automatically tried at a federal level, as are cases in which the US is a party or those which involve constitutional violations. The death penalty was outlawed at state and federal level by a 1972 Supreme Court decision that cancelled all existing death penalty statutes. A 1976 Supreme Court decision allowed states to reinstate the death penalty and in 1988 the government passed legislation that made it available again at federal level. According to data collected by the Death Penalty Information Center, 78 people were sentenced to death in federal cases between 1988 and 2018 but only three were executed.

"This video can not be played The Senate overrides President Trump's veto The US Congress has overturned President Donald Trump's veto of a defence spending bill, the first time this has happened in his presidency. The Republican-controlled Senate held a rare New Year's Day session to debate the move, which had already been voted for by the House of Representatives. The $740bn (Â£549bn) bill will fund defence policy for the year to come. Mr Trump, who leaves office in a few weeks, objected to certain provisions in the bill. The Senate voted 81-13 for the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) - a two-thirds majority is required to override a presidential veto in both chambers. It comes just two days before a new US Congress is due to be sworn in. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump cut short their holiday in Florida to return to the White House on New Year's Eve Mr Trump had taken issue with policies that limit troop withdrawals from Afghanistan and Europe and remove Confederate leaders' names from military bases. He also wanted the bill to repeal a liability shield for social media companies. Why the Civil War casts a great shadow over the US Has Trump kept his promises on the military? Before the debate began, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he was determined to pass the bill. ""Here's what the Senate is focused on - completing the annual defence legislation that looks after our brave men and women who volunteer to wear the uniform. ""We've passed this legislation 59 years in a row. And one way or another, we're going to complete the 60th annual NDAA and pass it into law before this Congress concludes on Sunday,"" he added. LaterMr Trump responded to the vote specifically on the issue of liability protection.,external ""Our Republican Senate just missed the opportunity to get rid of Section 230, which gives unlimited power to Big Tech companies. Pathetic!!!"" he said on Twitter. Bills passed by Congress need a president's signature to become law. On rare occasions, a president may choose to veto - or reject - legislation because of some policy disagreement. Lawmakers can override a presidential veto and enact bills into law by mustering two-thirds of votes in both chambers of Congress. President Trump says US military interventions like the troop presence in Afghanistan are costly and ineffective House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful congressional Democrat, said Mr Trump's veto was ""an act of staggering recklessness that harms our troops, endangers our security and undermines the will of the bipartisan Congress"". ""In a time when our country was just targeted with a massive cyber-attack,it is particularly hard to understand the reasoning behind the president's irresponsibility,external,"" she said in a statement. Ahead of Wednesday's veto, some of the outgoing president's advisers had cautioned him against rejecting the bill. Mr Trump has previously vetoed eight bills, vetoes which were all upheld with support from his fellow Republicans in Congress. He is due to leave office on 20 January, when he will be replaced by Democrat Joe Biden. Mr Trump called the 4,500-page act, which has been nearly a year in the making, a ""gift to China and Russia"". ""Unfortunately, the Act fails to include critical national security measures, includes provisions that fail to respect our veterans and our military's history, and contradicts efforts by my administration to put America first in our national security and foreign policy actions,"" he said in a statement. Mr Trump also said the bill's measures to limit bringing troops home was ""bad policy"" and ""unconstitutional"".

"Israel has given priority to the over-60s in its vaccination campaign Israel has given vaccinations against coronavirus to more than one million people, the highest rate in the world, as global immunisation efforts step up. Israel has a rate of 11.55 vaccination doses per 100 people,external, followed by Bahrain at 3.49 and the UK at 1.47, according to a global tracking website affiliated with Oxford University. In comparison, France had vaccinated 138 people in total by 30 December. More than1.8m people have now died of the virus,externalaround the world. The comparative figures on vaccination are put together by Our World in Data, which is a collaboration between Oxford University and an educational charity. They measure the number of people who have received a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Most of the vaccines approved for use so far rely on two doses, given more than a week apart. The US fell far short of its target of vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020, with just 2.78 million having received a jab by 30 December. Meanwhile, the US government's top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said he does not agree withUK plans to give as many people as possible a first vaccine dose, while delaying second doses.

"Pressure is growing on the government to keep all schools in England closed for two weeks after the Christmas break amid a surge in coronavirus cases. Teaching unions have told primary school staff it is unsafe to return to work, and called for remote learning. Head teachers have begun legal action to force ministers to reveal data behind the decision for some schools to reopen on Monday. The government said decisions are based on new infections and NHS pressure. Labour has accused the government of ""creating chaos"" for parents. Most primary schools in England are expected to open on Monday while secondary schools will reopen on a staggered basis, with exam year pupils returning on 11 January and others returning a week later. How many cases are there in your area? How will mass testing help schools? 'Nail-biting' weeks ahead for NHS, hospitals warn On Friday, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson announced that all of London's primaries would remain shut on Monday - reversing a decision to keep only schools in certain boroughs closed. He said the closures were a last resort in the face of a fast-moving situation. Elsewhere, Brighton and Hove Council has advised primary schools to switch to remote learning next week. Meanwhile, president of the Royal College of Physicians, Prof Andrew Goddard,told the BBC the new highly infectious strain of coronavirus was spreading across the country, adding: ""All hospitals that haven't had the big pressures that they've had in the South East, London and south Wales should expect that it's going to come their way."" This video can not be played School staff in Liverpool on whether schools there should close for the start of term The National Education Union (NEU), which is the UK's largest education union and has more than 450,000 members, said all primary and secondary schools should remain closed for a further two weeks after the school holiday. It is advising members against working in school. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) called for all schools to move to home learning for a ""brief and determined period for most children"", and said it would issue guidance to head teachers recommending they take no action against staff who refused to return to work if they felt unsafe. And in a letter to the education secretary, the NASUWT called for an ""immediate nationwide move to remote education"" as the ""only sensible and credible option"" to minimise risk, while the GMB, which represents support staff, called on Mr Williamson to apply ""common sense"". Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the government's plans for the start of the spring term were ""untenable"", adding that face-to-face teaching should be restricted to only vulnerable children and those of key workers until at least January 18. The ASCL and the NAHT have started legal action to get the Department for Education to share any information showing ""why they think it is safe to reopen schools on Monday, given the higher transmissibility of the new Covid-19 variant"". This video can not be played Dr Mary Bousted said the original advice to close schools in only some London boroughs ""made no sense right from the beginning"" Dr Mary Bousted, joint head of the NEU, said that if the government did not ""take the right steps"" it would be informing its members of their ""legal right to refuse to work in unsafe conditions"". Elsewhere, the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,300 independent schools in the UK, said it was seeking ""urgent clarification"" from the government over its plans. Julie Robinson, ISC chief executive, said: ""All schools put safety first and are concerned for their communities. Independent schools share the concerns expressed by the unions today."" Dr Mike Tildesley, a University of Warwick epidemiologist who advises the government as part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said that while there was a rise in cases in secondary school age groups, there was not strong evidence of transmission in the school environment. The U-turn on London's primary schools has given momentum to calls for a bigger revision of the government's plans for the new term. A term, which of course, starts in less than 48 hours' time. There has certainly been a dramatic ratcheting up of pressure by teaching unions. The advice from the NEU to its members - that they are not safe in the classroom - puts teachers on a collision course with the government, which insists they are. The latest published advice from government scientists doesn't entirely come down on either side. All of which leaves children and their parents caught in the middle. The Department for Education has pulled quite a few about-turns in this pandemic. The question facing ministers this weekend is this - is another one now practically inevitable (and, politically, best done swiftly)? Or do they, as has been indicated, stand by their commitment to keeping schools open come what may - and try to reassure instead. Sian Elliott, of the Trades Union Congress, said the last-minute announcements were ""wreaking havoc"" for working parents, leaving many ""in an impossible position, scrambling to hold onto their jobs and care for their children"". Ms Elliott said parents affected by school closures should be offered paid parental leave or furlough. Charlotte Clarke, who lives in East Sussex, wants schools to remain open and said it was ""physically impossible"" for her to work from home as a solicitor and teach her son in Year 6 and daughter in Year 1. ""In the first lockdown my mental health, and my children's mental health, suffered. My daughter, who was in foundation at the time, stopped eating and sleeping,"" she said. ""I could not work and care for them and teach them at the same time."" Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live London's Nightingale 'ready to admit patients' What can you still do in tier four? Mr Williamson said in mid-Decemberthat all primary school pupils in England would return as normal in January, while the return of secondary schools and colleges would be gradual to give them time to set up mass testing programmes. But on Wednesday,the education secretary delayed the start of termfor all secondary schools, as well as some primary schools in Covid hotspots in south-east England, including parts of London. Two days later, after pressure from local authorities, heexpanded the primary school closuresto the whole of London. It means more than one million primary school pupils will now learn from home for at least the first two weeks of term. Vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will continue to attend school, the government said, adding that early years care, alternative provision and special schools will remain open. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries Shadow education secretary Kate Green criticised the timing of the announcement, saying it was ""yet another government U-turn creating chaos for parents just two days before the start of term"". Dave Lee-Allan, head teacher of Stowmarket High School in Suffolk, said ""it should be left to the head teachers on the ground to make the right call"", adding he was frustrated that while keeping children in school was said to be a priority and teachers were considered key workers, they did not qualify for early access to the vaccine. Mr Williamson said the London-wide closures were a ""last resort and a temporary solution"" to help tackle the particularly high infection rates in the capital, adding the government would ""reopen classrooms as soon as we possibly can"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said closing all schools in London -which has the highest rate of coronavirus infections- was ""the right decision"" but added that the original plan to only keep some closed had caused immense confusion. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is facing calls to keep schools shut A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Children's education has consistently been a national priority, which is why we want classrooms to reopen wherever possible in the new term. ""Schools will continue to implement appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission. ""As we've said, we will move to remote education as a last resort, with involvement of public health officials, in areas where infection and pressures on the NHS are highest."" Three of the worst-hit English local authorities in tier four have not been told to delay the opening of primaries. Rushmoor (817 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 28 December), Slough (777) and Spelthorne (721) are all in the south-east of England. In Rushmoor where cases have increased by 54% week-on-week, the case rate is higher than 26 local authorities where primary schools will remain shut on 4 January. Secondary schools in Englandwill stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January. Mostprimary schools in Englandwill return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January. InWales, local councils have been told they can be ""flexible"" with when they open - with many schools aiming to return for face-to-face lessons from 11 January. InNorthern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January. InScotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January.

"The RSPB is worried about the effect the wind farm could have on kittiwakes The bird charity RSPB has criticised agovernment decision to permit an offshore wind farm,externalexpected to harm birds feeding in the North Sea. The giant Hornsea Three development lies 75 miles away fromFlamborough Head, Englandâs biggest sea bird colony,externalon the Yorkshire coast. The RSPB says kittiwakes will need to fly through the area, dodging turbines, to reach feeding grounds. The developers have promised to compensate for the impact on the birds. They plan to do this by building four bespoke nesting towers to encourage them on land. But the RSPB says it will take a decade to see whether this idea works â and that will be too late because the wind farms will be up and running by then. Black turbine blade 'can cut bird deaths' A really simple guide to climate change Have these seven green targets been met? Wind farms are not a straightforward subject for the RSPB in its efforts to protect the UK's birds. The charity supports the growth of renewable energy to combat the effects of climate change, but is fearful of the impact on birds round the coasts as turbines increase to fulfil the prime minister's promise of powering every home by wind energy. Duncan Clark from developers Orsted said: âClimate change remains a very serious threat to our environment and habitats and there is an ever-pressing need to act. âHornsea Three could provide clean power to over two million UK homes and offset over 128.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide over its lifetime.â The RSPB says computer modelling suggests the huge turbines, stretching over 200 metres, will cause the deaths of 73 kittiwakes a year. Mr Clark said that the firm would offset the projected deaths by building four artificial kittiwake nest towers on land, which should prompt an equal number of the birds to be born. But the RSPB says the compensation measures proposed at Hornsea Three are speculative, and that like other wind developments in the North Sea, they are undermined by a lack of reliable data. Guillemots, pictured perched on a cliff face, can waste energy flying around the thickets of turbines The RSPBâs Andrew Dodd told BBC News: âWe have no idea whether this plan will work or not. We donât know how many birds are being killed in the first place and we certainly donât know how many of them may be encouraged by breeding towers.â He said kittiwakes had been struggling for three decades â partly because climate change is altering fish patterns and partly because of over-fishing of slim fish called sand eels, which are ground into fishmeal for salmon and pigs. Energy Secretary Alok Sharma acknowledged in his ruling on the development that wildlife would be harmed by Hornsea Three, but he granted consent on the balance of benefits. His ruling said: âThe adverse impactsâ¦ do not outweigh the significant benefits of the development in respect of contribution it would make to meeting the identified need for renewable electricity generation.â Kittiwakes appear to try to slalom their way through the wind farms that are springing up across the North Sea. Other birds such as guillemots and razor bills seem to fly round the thickets of turbines, a journey which uses energy that could otherwise be used for breeding. The RSPB and wind farm association Renewable UK both blame the government for failing to mitigate the conflict between wildlife and clean energy. A razor bill Mr Dodd said: âThe government has to lead on this. We clearly need loads more offshore wind, and the RSPB supports that. But the North Sea is filling up with turbines and we have to avoid development in the most sensitive areas. We need much better knowledge. âThis issue is cumulative â maybe one wind farm wouldnât make a great deal of difference, but the scale of the plans is massive.â The wind farm industry group Renewable UK anticipates that offshore wind turbine operators will face increasing scrutiny in the coming decade â both in terms of their impact on wildlife and the structures needed on sensitive coastlines to bring the power onshore. The group has urged the government to restore funding to the heavily-cut Natural England, so it can adequately supervise developments. Renewable UKâs Melanie Onn told BBC News: âWe urgently need to build new offshore wind farms to tackle climate change which poses the biggest threat to our way of life. âAdvisory bodies like Natural England need more funding from the government so that they can take decisions in a more timely manner.â Some turbines off the coast of Scotland are now being fitted with cameras on the tower and blades to monitor bird strikes, although this may be very challenging in rough weather. In the US, a study suggested that painting one of the three blades black seemed to help birds avoid contact â but the RSPB says that study was on an onshore turbine, and needs verification. Anotherscheme has seen,externalwind farms turned off when the approach of rare condors is detected through radio transmitters they carry. This only works for threatened condor but the US equivalent of the RSPB, the Audubon Society, has warned that if climate change continues apace, hundreds of North American bird species' ranges will shrink by at least half by 2100. ""Climate change is the biggest impact on birds,"" said Garry George from Audubon. What's more, renewable energy campaigners point out that cats and skyscrapers kill far more birds than wind turbines.

"Police tweeted this photo, which appears to show the vehicle severely damaged in the crash Four ponies have been killed in a collision with a vehicle in the New Forest National Park. The animals were hit on Thursday night while licking freshly laid salt on Roger Penny Way, Hampshire Constabulary said. Three ponies died at the scene while a fourth was found dead later a short distance away. In December, three donkeys werekilled on the road, which is a black spot for animal accidents. Mark Ferrett, whose daughter owned the ponies, said the deaths were ""unacceptable"" The crash happened at about 21:00 GMT on a 40mph (64km/h) section of the road north of Brook. The car, a Land Rover Discovery, appears to have been severely damaged in the collision, according to a police tweet, which gave no further details. Mark Ferrett, whose daughter owned the ponies, said the deaths were ""unacceptable"". He said: ""I would favour a reduction in the speed [limit]. Please, everyone needs to slow down and stop this carnage."" The New Forest is one of the largest remaining areas of unenclosed land where commoners' cattle, ponies and donkeys roam throughout the open heath. InÂ 2019, 58 animals were killed and 32 were injured, according to the New Forest National Park Authority. The crash happened on Roger Penny Way, where donkeys, cattle and horses roam freely Andrew Napthine, a New Forest Agister who helps manage the area's free-roaming animals, attended the scene of the crash, and said the male driver was not injured. He said three of the ponies were killed on the road while a fourth fled the scene and died behind a bush.
