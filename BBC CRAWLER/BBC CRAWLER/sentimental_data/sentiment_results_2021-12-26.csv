"The upcoming Lord of the Rings series pre-dates The Hobbit It's fair to say that 2021 was a great year for TV. Line of Duty had record viewing figures for drama. And the final of the men's European football championship gained the biggest TV audience since the funeral of Princess Diana in 1997. Numbers aren't everything, though, and it's true there's a general feeling in some parts of the TV industry that it's streaming services that are really pushing the envelope when it comes to quality. But the traditional broadcasters are still having a significant impact, and not just the main two channels. In my annual preview a year ago, I described how Channel Four's (then-forthcoming) It's A Sin ""follows a group of friendsâ¦ as the Aids crisis begins to unfold"". That bland description did not come close to conveying the way the five-episode drama reduced so many of us to angry tears. So here are 22 shows and TV events across traditional broadcasters and streaming services worth keeping an eye out for on the small screen in 2022. Maxine Peake stars in Anne The award-winning Maxine Peake plays real-life campaigner Anne Williams, whose son was among those who died in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Before her death in 2013, she spent decades trying to achieve justice for 15-year-old Kevin and the other victims. The drama follows Williams, who had no formal legal training, and her efforts to challenge the medical evidence and legal rulings that she believed were fundamentally wrong. A UK remake of the popular French comedy drama that follows a group of talent agents doing their best to survive in a competitive industry, while at the same time trying to steer and control their sometimes impulsively difficult clients. Like the French series, it will feature cameos from well-known actors playing themselves, including Phoebe Dynevor, Dominic West and Helena Bonham Carter. The Crown's Erin Doherty stars as Becky/Sasha A new mystery thriller about the impact of social media on a group of young people. Becky, a temp, lives in a small flat in Bristol with her mother, who has early-onset dementia. She's been enviously following the picture-perfect social media posts of a woman called Chloe for a long, long time. But when Chloe dies suddenly, Becky takes on a new identity and infiltrates Chloe's group of friends. After being called to a fatal train crash, paramedic Jenny develops a serious gambling habit as she tries to cope with her PTSD. Heavily in debt to a sinister loan shark, Jenny doesn't know which way to turn - until a woman called Sasha comes into her life, offering what appears to be a way out of her problems. But the easy solution turns out to be far more dangerous than Jenny could ever have imagined. Alison Oliver portrays Frances Many were hoping for the BBC's follow-up to its adaptation of Sally Rooney's Normal People to appear in 2021. It was not to be, but the TV version of Rooney's debut novel, Conversations With Friends, about two college students and their connection with a married couple, looks on schedule to finally arrive in 2022. And it will almost certainly be one of the centrepieces of a back-on-traditional-TV BBC Three. Who will replace Jodie Whittaker as the new Doctor? Stay tuned... Jodie Whittaker made history in 2017 as the first woman to play the Time Lord. Now her time in the Tardis is coming to an end. Her final special, when she'll regenerate into the 14th Doctor, is due to be broadcast in the autumn to coincide with the BBC's centenary. The unveiling of a new Doctor has developed into a television event in its own right. And while at one end of the scale David Tennant was announced by press release, Matt Smith, Peter Capaldi and Jodie Whittaker were all announced to millions on BBC One. So what will happen this time? Depending on when filming has to start on their first episode, might we even see the 14th Doctor revealed to the world on screen when Whittaker finally regenerates? Filming wrapped on the TV adaptation of Dolly Alderton's memoir Everything I Know About Love earlier this year Award-winning writer Dolly Alderton has adapted her memoir about navigating her 20s, Everything I Know About Love, for this seven-part series. Much of the story is set in 2012 in the house shared by best friends Maggie (Emma Appleton) and Birdy (Bel Powley) and, like the book, it's expected to explore the themes of love, heartache and friendship. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson will appear alongside their Harry Potter co-stars After the success of the Friends reunion special, bringing together the cast of the widely beloved multi-billion pound Harry Potter franchise seems like an obvious ratings winner. As well as the three central stars - Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint - many more members of the cast will be involved, including Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid), Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) and Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort). Harry Potter creator JK Rowling won't be taking part, a move that's widely believed to be related toher comments about trans people, sex and gender, which have divided public opinion. Olivia Cooke is one of the stars of the Game of Thrones spin-off This prequel is set 200 years before the eight-series Game of Thrones TV show and tells the story of the House Targaryen, the ancestors of Danerys Targaryen (aka Khalessi, aka the Mother of Dragons). It's based on George RR Martin's book Fire and Blood, and the 10-part series stars Paddy Considine, Olivia Cooke and Matt Smith. Anna Delvey is played by Julia Garner Inventing Anna is based on a New York magazine investigation into a woman going by the name of Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) who convinced people she was a wealthy European heiress. In fact she turned out to be a fake who conned friends, hotels and banks out of eye-watering amounts of money. She was eventually convicted on multiple fraud charges in 2019. The series follows journalist Vivian Kent's (Anna Chlumsky) attempts to discover the truth. It's been touted as the most expensive TV series ever, with a budget equivalent to several tonnes of Dwarf mined mithril. And after the high production values of the Peter Jackson film adaptations, viewers are expecting to be just as dazzled and thrilled by this new take on Middle Earth, which has also been filmed with New Zealand as its spectacular backdrop. The series is set thousands of years before the events of the novels The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. Noele Gordon played Meg Richardson in Crossroads Crossroads was a phenomenon. Its production values may have been far from perfect, but viewers loved the motel-set, Midlands-based soap opera. And at its heart was Noele Gordon's Meg Mortimer (formerly Richardson). Russell T Davies (It's A Sin) has written this three-part drama about Gordon's time on the show, which ended with her shock sacking. Helena Bonham Carter will play the soap icon. Following the success of The Mandalorian in expanding the Star Wars universe on the small screen, Obi-Wan Kenobi will feature the return of Ewan McGregor as one of the franchise's most-loved characters. It's set between the events of Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith and the original movie Episode IV: A New Hope, and will see Hayden Christensen also returning as Darth Vader.

The show centres around the character Peacemaker from the film The Suicide Squad, a man who'll kill anyone and anything in the name of peace. The new series is written and directed by James Gunn, who performed the same duties on The Suicide Squad movie and on Marvel's Guardian of the Galaxy films. The Sex Pistols were a highly influential punk band in the 1970s in the UK Pistol, based on the memoir by Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones, charts the rise of the seminal punk band in the 1970s as they grew in both popularity and notoriety. A legal action was recently launched by Pistols frontman John Lydon in an attempt to stop the production using any of their music, but he lost the case. The series is being directed by Oscar winner Danny Boyle. Steve Coogan will play Jimmy Savile, the TV presenter who carried out sexual abuse over decades The subject matter of this mini-series is likely to make it one of the year's most talked-about dramas, whatever its quality. The Reckoning will follow the rise of TV presenter Jimmy Savile and, after his death, the subsequent uncovering of his decades of abuse. The BBC has said it intends to give a voice to Savile's many victims, and to tell their stories with respect. Savile will be played by actor and comedian Steve Coogan. Screw is the latest dark comedy-drama from Channel 4 Set in the fictional Long Marsh Prison, Screw promises to be a darkly comic drama following the lives of the under-pressure prison staff and the male inmates they're in charge of. Leading the team of prison officers is Nina Sosanya's Leigh. She's joined by newcomer Rose, played by Derry Girls' Jamie-Lee O'Donnell, who has to endure what's described as a baptism of fire.

"All NI nightclubs will be closed from Boxing Day Nightclubs in Northern Ireland are now closed ina bid to curb the spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant. The NI Executive said this was because nightclubs are a high-risk settings where face coverings and social distancing rules could not be applied. They only reopened fully on 31 October after being closed from March 2020. All large indoor standing events are also banned in Northern Ireland with further restrictions in force from Monday. The regulations will be reviewed by the executive on 30 December. Fresh coronavirus restrictions alsocame into force in Wales and Scotland on Sunday. Ministers in England aren't expected to discuss whether to impose further measures until Monday. Where can I get tested for Covid-19 over Christmas? What are the rules? In Northern Ireland, local and mobile Covid-19 testing sites are currently operating at a reduced level of service during the Christmas period with shorter opening times from 10:00 until 14:00. On Friday,a record number of Covid-19 caseswere recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. The majority of the new Covid-19 restrictions begin on Monday and mainly affect the hospitality sector. Hospitality venues, including pubs, cafes and restaurants, will have to provide table service only. Up to six people from six households will be allowed to sit together at a table, but this will not apply to wedding or civil partnership celebrations. Dancing will not be allowed in hospitality venues either, but again this will not apply to weddings. The restrictions that have moved back in are a far cry from the full lockdown people in Northern Ireland faced last year. The measures are a response to rising cases and an attempt to stem the tide, which is expected to rise further into January. There has been criticism from some that the rules don't go far enough, while the businesses affected say they're being unfairly targeted again. And what is the plan to help workforces who face potentially large numbers of staff being absent due to Covid or self-isolation? As Omicron tightens its grip, ministers have no easy options and it's possible they could have to take further steps when they meet again on Thursday for a post-Christmas review. Pubs and restaurants already worried about trade this week will nervously await what that could mean for their New Year's Eve service. Something no one wanted this Christmas - more Covid uncertainty - is unfortunately going to be sticking around as we enter 2022. Proof of Covid status will remain a requirement to enter hospitality venues and some other indoor settings. Also from Monday, the executive is strengthening its laws on face coverings to remove some exemptions, but there will be a grace period until 7 January before this can be enforced. It will remain a legal requirement for people to wear face coverings in shops, on public transport and indoor attractions - unless they are exempt. The executive says the exemption of wearing a face covering where it causes severe stress will be removed and the onus of proving an exemption on medical grounds will be on the individual. For the moment. sporting events can continue with no limit on capacity but those travelling to and from games are advised not to car share. A day after announcing restrictions, the executive unveileda support package for hospitality businesses affected. The Department of Finance will deliver the Â£40m fund to provide for more than 3,000 businesses. The Omicron Hospitality Payment will provide: Â£10,000 for businesses with a rateable value up to Â£15,000 Â£15,000 for businesses with a rateable value between Â£15,001 to Â£51,000 Â£20,000 for businesses with a rateable value over Â£51,000 However, the scheme will not cover supply chains or people who provide entertainment. Nightclubs only reopened in Northern Ireland on October 31 Last week Finance Minister Conor Murphy acknowledged the need for extra support for those associated with the hospitality industry. Speaking after the grant scheme was announced, he said his department would continue to press the UK government to reintroduce furlough, and that further funding would be available ""to take more measures in the time ahead if those measures are required"". ""We're still learning what the impact of this variant is going to be so we don't know how long this is going to last, we don't know if there will be further measures required,"" he added. Rules on wearing masks in shops and public transport are tightened from 27 December While the Boxing Day sales normally bring lots of people to town centres in Northern Ireland, Glyn Roberts of Retail NI told BBC News NI that the new restrictions are a worry for businesses on the High Street. ""The modern high street is all about being a destination,"" he said. ""If our colleagues in hospitality are experiencing restrictions or are closed that's not good for retail. ""We do worry that it will result in dramatically reduced footfall for our highstreets as a whole."" What are Northern Ireland's rules on Covid-19?

"Richard Osman is the creator and co-presenter of Pointless, and also now a best-selling author Richard Osman, the TV personality and author, has spoken about how hard it is to ""work your way out of"" an eating disorder. The 51-year-old told BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs he had therapy in his 30s to address his food issues. The Pointless star's best-selling debut novel, The Thursday Murder Club, saw him named author of the year at the 2021 British Book Awards. He said food addiction doesn't have the ""doomed glamour"" of drugs or alcohol. ""But if an alcoholic came to my house they would be shocked to see bottles of gin and bottles of wine, completely untouched,"" Osman told presenter Lauren Laverne. ""Because an alcoholic couldn't have that in their house. ""And if I came to your house and there were crisps or chocolate bars untouched in the fridge, I'd be like 'What? How are they untouched?' - if I'm going through an episode."" The addiction, he said, ""is identical"" to that experienced by people with alcohol and drug addictions. ""The secrecy of consuming these things, the shame behind it,"" he noted. ""And food is a tricky one, because booze and drugs you can just give up.  [It is] unbelievably difficult but [with] a zero tolerance policy. ""Whereas if you're addicted to food or to love or all these things that are sustaining, you do still have to have them, and so it's quite a hard one to work your way out of."" BBC Action Linehas more details of organisations which can provide advice, information and support for people affected by eating disorders. Osman recalled how despite having a successful television career and a family with two children, he had been left feeling directionless. He sought professional help for his problems, including those connected with food, which had been with him since childhood. He believes they will be with him for the rest of his life. ""I'm either controlling it or not controlling it at any given time, and these days I control it more often than I don't, but it's actually quite hard and sometimes you do slip, but I try my best and I certainly have no shame about it now."" Osman told the programme he is ""now in a place where I want to be"" He talked about his childhood, saying his father leaving the family home when Richard was nine came as a complete shock, and he ""shut himself down"" in response. The broadcaster encouraged listeners on Boxing Day who may ""over-eat"" to tackle the issue. ""Listen, we all have something that gets us through life and you know if that's yours, then we have to face it head on,"" he continued. ""It's just not being so afraid of life and afraid of what will happen if you put yourself out there. ""That's a difficult journey and it doesn't come naturally to me, but the more I try it, the happier I get."" Constant Cravings: Does Food Addiction Exist Christmas 'tough' for people with eating disorders Tom Quinn, director of external affairs foreating disorder charity Beat,external, told the BBC: 'We are so grateful to Richard Osman for choosing to speak openly about his food addiction. ""Sadly there is still stigma surrounding men who experience disordered eating, which can make it more difficult for men to recognise symptoms in themselves and reach out for help. 'Whenever people in the public eye share their experiences with disordered eating, it helps to reduce the misconception that disordered eating only affects women, and can encourage more people to reach out for support."" He said the charity estimates there are about 300,000 males in the UK with an eating disorder, and that during the pandemic they saw a ""huge increase"" in people reaching out for support. 'We'd like anyone [who is} struggling to know that support is available, and making a full recovery from disordered eating is possible. If you are worried about yourself or somebody you know, please reach out to your GP as soon as possible,"" he said. For years, scientists have debated if food addiction really exists, and in a 2013 report,addiction researcher and academic Sally Marlow wrotethat binge eating - which has been linked to obesity - was the only type of eating disorder where it was thought that addiction played a role. ""Although we tend to trivialise the idea of addiction and food being related - many of us have at some point referred to ourselves as addicted to chocolate - Binge Eating Disorder is something which holds people within its grip,"" she said. ""It causes physical and psychological harm and is utterly miserable. Just like other forms of addiction."" Osman, who rose to fame as the knowledgeable sidekick on the BBC TV gameshow Pointless, having worked behind the camera on shows like Deal or No Deal, has recently become known for his very successful novels. Hollywood producer Steven Spielberg snapped up the movie rights to last year's Thursday Murder Club, a tale of four elderly amateur sleuths. The book broke sales records and soared to the pinnacle of the best-sellers' list in the UK. Its follow-up, The Man Who Died Twice, finished runner-up in this year's official Christmas book chart, Nielsen Book Services announced this week. The book hasbecome one of the fastest-selling novels,externalsince records began. Richard Osman: Trying to make the world a better place Richard Osman named author of the year Richard Osman: 'I wish I were cooler but I'm not' In September, Osman told the BBC he is not going to get complacent about his achievements. ""I've been through my creative life with great TV shows that fail and not-so-great that succeed so I'm rarely surprised by anything,"" he said. ""But I'm humbled and amazed. ""I'm thinking 'what a lovely thing to have happened and I get such lovely comments in the street, but I'm with Kipling on success and failure: you have to treat them in just the same way'."" The broadcaster, who is in a relationship with the actress and comic Ingrid Oliver, added he is ""now in a place where I want to be"". ""I'm happy with myself, I've got these beautiful kids, I've met the woman who I'm going to be with for the rest of my life and that thing of competition and ambition - you soon realise that rocket fuel disappears and it's about happiness, and my kids bring me happiness and Ingrid brings me happiness.""

"Covid restrictions means fewer customers in shops, the Welsh Retail Consortium has said. Every adult in Wales should be given Â£100 in vouchers to spend locally, according to a retailers' group. Many retailers are on a ""knife edge"" due to Covid restrictions, said Sara Jones, head of the the Welsh Retail Consortium (WRC). While pre-Christmas trade was welcome, Ms Jones saidthe voucher scheme used in Northern Irelandshould be adopted in Wales. The Welsh government said businesses had already received Â£2.5bn of grants. Ms Jones welcomed the 50% cut in business rates announced in theWelsh government budget, but wants the government to go further. ""Many retailers will certainly be on a knife edge,"" she said. ""Things have been picking up lately but obviously with the new variant that's created a lot of uncertainty out there."" Shop worker Jules Y Fenyw says it will be lovely to have time off rather than working on Boxing Day Footfall in shops on Boxing Day, 26 December - traditionally one of the busiest of the year - is expected to fall this year as some major supermarkets remain closed for the day. This follows campaigns by trade unions asking employers not to ask staff to work on Christmas Day or Boxing Day. Supermarket worker Jules Y Fenyw, from Newport, will not be working on Boxing Day as her shop will be closed. She said it was ""lovely"" to be able to have time off. ""Normally you don't have much downtime before you're back in and you really don't feel as though you've had a rest, so two days off together means so many more people have been able to relax and enjoy Christmas,"" she said, adding customers had also been positive about the change.

Shoppers should be given Â£100 vouchers to revive the local economy, the Welsh Retail Consortium says Tightened Covid rules in Wales, along with guidance for people to work from home, had a ""huge impact"", said Ms Jones. The Welsh Government said: ""We understand the continued challenges faced by our high streets as a result of the pandemic. ""Since the start of the pandemic, we've provided more than Â£2.5bn of support to businesses in Wales to help them manage their way through the difficult circumstances. ""As part of this, businesses in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors won't pay any business rates until April 2022. ""In the recent budget, the finance minister confirmed we're providing an additional Â£116m package of non-domestic rates relief for businesses in sectors hardest hit, which means retail, leisure and hospitality businesses will receive 50% non-domestic rates relief for 2022-23. ""We're also making a further Â£120m available for nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses, and their supply chains, affected by the move to Alert Level Two - doubling the Â£60m package announced last week.""

"Large events such as concerts have strict limits on numbers from Sunday New rules aimed at slowing transmission of the Omicron variant have come into force in Scotland, meaning all large public events have been cancelled. The limits on the size of events were announced last week but came into force at 05:00 on Sunday. However, many concerts, theatre shows and pantomimes were already cancelled ahead of the restrictions. Boxing Day football matches in the Scotland's top flight will be played in front of a maximum of 500 seated fans. At the Celtic V St Johnstone match at McDiarmid Park, police said they dispersed a ""small"" group of fans who had gathered outside the Perth stadium. Hogmanay events cancelled as Covid rules tightened Nightclubs in Scotland to close for three weeks Premiership winter break brought forward After Sunday's fixtures, the SPFL (Scottish Professional Football League) will then bring forward its winter break and fixtures will not resume until 17 January. It said it was ""very hopeful"" capacity crowds could return to matches after the three-week cap on attendances over the festive period. Attendance at all live public events for the next three weeks is limited to: 100 people for indoor standing events 200 people for indoor seated events 500 people for all outdoor events (seated or standing) This effectively cancelled large Hogmanay parties including Edinburgh's Hogmanay. The restrictions do not apply to private life events such as weddings. Further restrictions prevent adult non-professional contact sports - such as five-a-side football - in indoor spaces. Hospitality measures will come into effect on Monday Other measures announced by the first minister on Tuesday,externalwill take effect from 05:00 on Monday 27 December. They include a return to 1m physical distancing in all hospitality and indoor leisure settings, which includes pubs, restaurants, gyms, theatres and museums. Table service must also be used in places where alcohol is served to drink on the premises. Nightclubs also have to close for a period of at least three weeks, though they can stay open if they operate as a pub with table service and distancing. All of the measures will be reviewed after three weeks on Tuesday 11 January. The new restrictions follow rising Covid case numbers fuelled by the new Omicron variant. Themost recent figures, released on Christmas Eve, showed 7,076 new cases of Covid-19, the highest daily total since August. The figures also showed 10 deaths and a 14.7% positivity rate. The Scottish government's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said the new measures were proportionate, but acknowledged that they would have an impact on businesses. He said the Scottish government had put in place a Â£375m support package for business. ""I can completely understand why people are scunnered and sick and tired of the protective measures and restrictions we bring in. ""But science is helping us,"" he added, asking everyone toget booked in for their booster appointment as soon as possible,external. He said there were ""plenty"" of appointments available for 27 December onwards. ""Get yourself boosted by the bells,"" he said, noting that without vaccines the situation would be far worse - and much tougher curbs would be needed. The Scottish government urged people should stay home as much as possible to limit the number of contacts they have and to gather in groups of no more than three households. Wales and Northern Ireland have also implemented further restrictionson the hospitality and leisure industry, resumed social distancing rules and put limits on the size of gatherings. No further restrictions have been implemented in England. Bars will go to table service-only from 05:00 on Monday Hospitality businesses were preparing for the change in operating procedures on Monday. In Glasgow, staff at Hootenanny on Howard Street were getting ready to return to measures last used in the summer. Manager Andy Fairgrieve told the BBC: ""We're going back to full table service like we were in the summer. So basically no one is allowed to come to the bar counter. No one is allowed to walk about with food or drinks."" He said that procedures for table service and physical distancing were already in place. ""All the staff know what they are doing, so it is quite easy going back. But the thing about the summer was people didn't mid sitting outside and using the space there. I am not sure how keen people will be in the middle of January to sit outside and have a beer and some food."" He said a quiet January on top of a December of cancelled parties and people not going out would take its toll financially. ""I just hope people will still come out,"" he added. This variant is very contagious - it spreads faster than others and can infect people even if they are fully vaccinated Vaccines and boosters are still essential - they do a great job at protecting against severe disease that could put you in hospital It is milder - if you catch it, the risk of needing hospital treatment is up to 70% lower than with previous variants - but that is largely because many of us have built up immunity from vaccines and past infections rather than changes to the virus Even if Omicron is milder, because it is more contagious a large number of people will catch it and some will still become very ill, which puts pressure on the NHS Read more RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Delta airline passengers are among those worst-hit by the cancellations Tens of thousands of airline passengers have been hit by the grounding of thousands of flights as a surge in Covid cases causes staff shortages. More than 7,500 flights have now been cancelled since Friday and over the Christmas weekend, according to the FlightAware data tracking website. Chinese and US airlines appear to be the hardest hit, with further delays and cancellations announced for Monday. Companies say the cancellations are due to airline crews testing positive. Staff who have not tested positive but have been in contact with those infected are then being forced to self-isolate. Recorded Covid cases are rising sharply around the world, largely driven by the Omicron variant. Despite early findings that Omicron is milder than other coronavirus variants, scientists are concerned by the sheer number of infections being recorded. How can I tell I have Omicron? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Omicron wave appears milder, but concern remains On Sunday, more than 2,400 flights were cancelled - over 800 of which were to or from US airports, according to FlightAware. The worst-hit US companies are Delta, United and JetBlue. United warned earlier that a spike in Omicron cases had ""had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation"", adding that it was contacting impacted passengers in advance of them coming to the airport. Omicron now is the dominant strain in the US. However, the most affected single airline appears to be China Eastern with more than 390 scrapped flights on Sunday. The airport in the northern Chinese city of Xi'an has reported more than 120 flight cancellations. More than 13 million people in Xi'an have been recently ordered to stay at homeas authorities attempt to tackle a Covid outbreak there. Heathrow Airport in London has seen more than 60 flights cancelled on Sunday. Nearly 5.4 million people have died with coronavirus worldwide, according to America's Johns Hopkins University.

"This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Nomsa Maseko looks back at the life and legacy of Desmond Tutu Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel Peace prize laureate who helped end apartheid in South Africa, has died aged 90. President Cyril Ramaphosa said the churchman's death marked ""another chapter of bereavement in our nation's farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans"". Archbishop Tutu had helped bequeath ""a liberated South Africa,"" he added. Tutu was one of the country's best known figures at home and abroad. A contemporary of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, he was one of the driving forces behind the movement to end the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991. Obituary: South Africa's rebellious priest In pictures: The life of Desmond Tutu UK tributes paid to archbishop He was awarded the Nobel prize in 1984 for his role in the struggle to abolish the apartheid system. Tutu's death comes just weeks after that of South Africa's last apartheid-era president, FW de Klerk, who died at the age of 85. Archbishop Tutu was a contemporary of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela (r) President Ramaphosa said Tutu was ""an iconic spiritual leader, anti-apartheid activist and global human rights campaigner"". He described him as ""a patriot without equal; a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead. ""A man of extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid, he was also tender and vulnerable in his compassion for those who had suffered oppression, injustice and violence under apartheid, and oppressed and downtrodden people around the world."" The Nelson Mandela Foundation was among those paying tributes, saying Tutu's ""contributions to struggles against injustice, locally and globally, are matched only by the depth of his thinking about the making of liberatory futures for human societies. ""He was an extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd."" Former US president Barack Obama described him as a mentor and a ""moral compass"". It is impossible to imagine South Africa's long and tortuous journey to freedom - and beyond - without Archbishop Desmond Tutu. While other struggle leaders were killed, or forced into exile, or prison, the diminutive, defiant Anglican priest was there at every stage, exposing the hypocrisy of the apartheid state, comforting its victims, holding the liberation movement to account, and daring Western governments to do more to isolate a white-minority government that he compared, unequivocally, to the Nazis. When democracy arrived, Tutu used his moral authority to oversee the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that sought to expose the crimes of the white-minority government. Later he turned that same fierce gaze on the failings, in government, of South Africa's former liberation movement, the ANC. Many South Africans today will remember Tutu's personal courage, and the clarity of his moral fury. But as those who knew him best have so often reminded us, Tutu was always, emphatically, the voice of hope. And it is that hope, that optimism, accompanied, so often, by his trademark giggles and cackles, that seems likely to shape the way the world remembers, and celebrates, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Known affectionately as The Arch, Tutu was instantly recognisable, with his purple clerical robes, cheery demeanour and almost constant smile. He was not afraid to show his emotions in public, including memorably laughing and dancing at the opening ceremony of the football World Cup in South Africa in 2010. Despite his popularity though he was not a man who was loved by all. He was very critical of the African National Congress (ANC) government in the post-apartheid era, when, at times, he felt it was misrepresenting South Africa - even warning in 2011 that he would pray for its downfall over a cancelled visit by the Dalai Lama. In response, the national police commissioner Gen Bheki Cele told Tutu to ""go home and shut up"". ""He is not a vice-Jesus Christ,"" he said. This video can not be played Watch Justin Welby's tribute: ""Tutu just had this extraordinary, bubbly, overwhelming sense of humour"" Ordained as a priest in 1960, Tutu went on to serve as bishop of Lesotho from 1976-78, assistant bishop of Johannesburg and rector of a parish in Soweto. He became Bishop of Johannesburg in 1985, and was appointed the first black Archbishop of Cape Town the following year. He used his high-profile role to speak out against oppression of black people in his home country, always saying his motives were religious and not political. After Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994, Tutu was appointed by him to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate crimes committed by both whites and blacks during the apartheid era. He was also credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa, but in his latter years he expressed regret that the nation had not coalesced in the way in which he had dreamt.

"All NI nightclubs will be closed from Boxing Day Nightclubs in Northern Ireland are now closed ina bid to curb the spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant. The NI Executive said this was because nightclubs are a high-risk settings where face coverings and social distancing rules could not be applied. They only reopened fully on 31 October after being closed from March 2020. All large indoor standing events are also banned in Northern Ireland with further restrictions in force from Monday. The regulations will be reviewed by the executive on 30 December. Fresh coronavirus restrictions alsocame into force in Wales and Scotland on Sunday. Ministers in England aren't expected to discuss whether to impose further measures until Monday. Where can I get tested for Covid-19 over Christmas? What are the rules? In Northern Ireland, local and mobile Covid-19 testing sites are currently operating at a reduced level of service during the Christmas period with shorter opening times from 10:00 until 14:00. On Friday,a record number of Covid-19 caseswere recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. The majority of the new Covid-19 restrictions begin on Monday and mainly affect the hospitality sector. Hospitality venues, including pubs, cafes and restaurants, will have to provide table service only. Up to six people from six households will be allowed to sit together at a table, but this will not apply to wedding or civil partnership celebrations. Dancing will not be allowed in hospitality venues either, but again this will not apply to weddings. The restrictions that have moved back in are a far cry from the full lockdown people in Northern Ireland faced last year. The measures are a response to rising cases and an attempt to stem the tide, which is expected to rise further into January. There has been criticism from some that the rules don't go far enough, while the businesses affected say they're being unfairly targeted again. And what is the plan to help workforces who face potentially large numbers of staff being absent due to Covid or self-isolation? As Omicron tightens its grip, ministers have no easy options and it's possible they could have to take further steps when they meet again on Thursday for a post-Christmas review. Pubs and restaurants already worried about trade this week will nervously await what that could mean for their New Year's Eve service. Something no one wanted this Christmas - more Covid uncertainty - is unfortunately going to be sticking around as we enter 2022. Proof of Covid status will remain a requirement to enter hospitality venues and some other indoor settings. Also from Monday, the executive is strengthening its laws on face coverings to remove some exemptions, but there will be a grace period until 7 January before this can be enforced. It will remain a legal requirement for people to wear face coverings in shops, on public transport and indoor attractions - unless they are exempt. The executive says the exemption of wearing a face covering where it causes severe stress will be removed and the onus of proving an exemption on medical grounds will be on the individual. For the moment. sporting events can continue with no limit on capacity but those travelling to and from games are advised not to car share. A day after announcing restrictions, the executive unveileda support package for hospitality businesses affected. The Department of Finance will deliver the Â£40m fund to provide for more than 3,000 businesses. The Omicron Hospitality Payment will provide: Â£10,000 for businesses with a rateable value up to Â£15,000 Â£15,000 for businesses with a rateable value between Â£15,001 to Â£51,000 Â£20,000 for businesses with a rateable value over Â£51,000 However, the scheme will not cover supply chains or people who provide entertainment. Nightclubs only reopened in Northern Ireland on October 31 Last week Finance Minister Conor Murphy acknowledged the need for extra support for those associated with the hospitality industry. Speaking after the grant scheme was announced, he said his department would continue to press the UK government to reintroduce furlough, and that further funding would be available ""to take more measures in the time ahead if those measures are required"". ""We're still learning what the impact of this variant is going to be so we don't know how long this is going to last, we don't know if there will be further measures required,"" he added. Rules on wearing masks in shops and public transport are tightened from 27 December While the Boxing Day sales normally bring lots of people to town centres in Northern Ireland, Glyn Roberts of Retail NI told BBC News NI that the new restrictions are a worry for businesses on the High Street. ""The modern high street is all about being a destination,"" he said. ""If our colleagues in hospitality are experiencing restrictions or are closed that's not good for retail. ""We do worry that it will result in dramatically reduced footfall for our highstreets as a whole."" What are Northern Ireland's rules on Covid-19?

"This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's Nomsa Maseko looks back at the life and legacy of Desmond Tutu Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel Peace prize laureate who helped end apartheid in South Africa, has died aged 90. President Cyril Ramaphosa said the churchman's death marked ""another chapter of bereavement in our nation's farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans"". Archbishop Tutu had helped bequeath ""a liberated South Africa,"" he added. Tutu was one of the country's best known figures at home and abroad. A contemporary of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela, he was one of the driving forces behind the movement to end the policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991. Obituary: South Africa's rebellious priest In pictures: The life of Desmond Tutu UK tributes paid to archbishop He was awarded the Nobel prize in 1984 for his role in the struggle to abolish the apartheid system. Tutu's death comes just weeks after that of South Africa's last apartheid-era president, FW de Klerk, who died at the age of 85. Archbishop Tutu was a contemporary of anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela (r) President Ramaphosa said Tutu was ""an iconic spiritual leader, anti-apartheid activist and global human rights campaigner"". He described him as ""a patriot without equal; a leader of principle and pragmatism who gave meaning to the biblical insight that faith without works is dead. ""A man of extraordinary intellect, integrity and invincibility against the forces of apartheid, he was also tender and vulnerable in his compassion for those who had suffered oppression, injustice and violence under apartheid, and oppressed and downtrodden people around the world."" The Nelson Mandela Foundation was among those paying tributes, saying Tutu's ""contributions to struggles against injustice, locally and globally, are matched only by the depth of his thinking about the making of liberatory futures for human societies. ""He was an extraordinary human being. A thinker. A leader. A shepherd."" Former US president Barack Obama described him as a mentor and a ""moral compass"". It is impossible to imagine South Africa's long and tortuous journey to freedom - and beyond - without Archbishop Desmond Tutu. While other struggle leaders were killed, or forced into exile, or prison, the diminutive, defiant Anglican priest was there at every stage, exposing the hypocrisy of the apartheid state, comforting its victims, holding the liberation movement to account, and daring Western governments to do more to isolate a white-minority government that he compared, unequivocally, to the Nazis. When democracy arrived, Tutu used his moral authority to oversee the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that sought to expose the crimes of the white-minority government. Later he turned that same fierce gaze on the failings, in government, of South Africa's former liberation movement, the ANC. Many South Africans today will remember Tutu's personal courage, and the clarity of his moral fury. But as those who knew him best have so often reminded us, Tutu was always, emphatically, the voice of hope. And it is that hope, that optimism, accompanied, so often, by his trademark giggles and cackles, that seems likely to shape the way the world remembers, and celebrates, Archbishop Desmond Tutu. Known affectionately as The Arch, Tutu was instantly recognisable, with his purple clerical robes, cheery demeanour and almost constant smile. He was not afraid to show his emotions in public, including memorably laughing and dancing at the opening ceremony of the football World Cup in South Africa in 2010. Despite his popularity though he was not a man who was loved by all. He was very critical of the African National Congress (ANC) government in the post-apartheid era, when, at times, he felt it was misrepresenting South Africa - even warning in 2011 that he would pray for its downfall over a cancelled visit by the Dalai Lama. In response, the national police commissioner Gen Bheki Cele told Tutu to ""go home and shut up"". ""He is not a vice-Jesus Christ,"" he said. This video can not be played Watch Justin Welby's tribute: ""Tutu just had this extraordinary, bubbly, overwhelming sense of humour"" Ordained as a priest in 1960, Tutu went on to serve as bishop of Lesotho from 1976-78, assistant bishop of Johannesburg and rector of a parish in Soweto. He became Bishop of Johannesburg in 1985, and was appointed the first black Archbishop of Cape Town the following year. He used his high-profile role to speak out against oppression of black people in his home country, always saying his motives were religious and not political. After Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994, Tutu was appointed by him to a Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to investigate crimes committed by both whites and blacks during the apartheid era. He was also credited with coining the term Rainbow Nation to describe the ethnic mix of post-apartheid South Africa, but in his latter years he expressed regret that the nation had not coalesced in the way in which he had dreamt.

He was in the country for five years and then returned in 1972, as vice-director of the Theological Education Fund of the World Council of Churches. Tutu eventually went back to South Africa to become the first African to be appointed Anglican Dean of Johannesburg. Tutu visited Birmingham in 1989 as part of the city-wide Christian Celebrations and he and his wife saw a number of establishments, including the Nelson Mandela School in Sparkbrook. When he was there, he criticised what he termed ""two-nation"" Britain, and said there were too many black people in the country's prisons. Tutu was given the freedom of Hull in 1999 after giving the annual Wilberforce lecture there, commemorating the life and achievements of anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce. And he returned to the UK yet again in 2004 as visiting professor in Post-Conflict Societies at King's College London. Archbishop Welby said Tutu - ""always known as Arch"" - was ""a prophet and priest, a man of words and action, one who embodied the hope and joy that were the foundations of his life"". He added: ""He was a man of extraordinary personal courage and bravery: when the police burst into Capetown Cathedral, he defied them by dancing down the aisle."" Tutu's love ""transformed the lives of politicians and priests, township dwellers and world leaders"", he added, saying he was a pioneer and ""a man of enormous vision"". He also spoke of his ""extraordinary, bubbly, overwhelming sense of humour"", adding ""you laughed the whole time when you met him"". Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said ""the world itself feels a little smaller without him"". He said Tutu had been asked to chair the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Cape Town as ""one of the few people in South Africa other than Nelson Mandela himself, who could unite the nation and carry the trust of everyone. ""In this respect, he was a giant,"" he added.

"Delta airline passengers are among those worst-hit by the cancellations Tens of thousands of airline passengers have been hit by the grounding of thousands of flights as a surge in Covid cases causes staff shortages. More than 7,500 flights have now been cancelled since Friday and over the Christmas weekend, according to the FlightAware data tracking website. Chinese and US airlines appear to be the hardest hit, with further delays and cancellations announced for Monday. Companies say the cancellations are due to airline crews testing positive. Staff who have not tested positive but have been in contact with those infected are then being forced to self-isolate. Recorded Covid cases are rising sharply around the world, largely driven by the Omicron variant. Despite early findings that Omicron is milder than other coronavirus variants, scientists are concerned by the sheer number of infections being recorded. How can I tell I have Omicron? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Omicron wave appears milder, but concern remains On Sunday, more than 2,400 flights were cancelled - over 800 of which were to or from US airports, according to FlightAware. The worst-hit US companies are Delta, United and JetBlue. United warned earlier that a spike in Omicron cases had ""had a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation"", adding that it was contacting impacted passengers in advance of them coming to the airport. Omicron now is the dominant strain in the US. However, the most affected single airline appears to be China Eastern with more than 390 scrapped flights on Sunday. The airport in the northern Chinese city of Xi'an has reported more than 120 flight cancellations. More than 13 million people in Xi'an have been recently ordered to stay at homeas authorities attempt to tackle a Covid outbreak there. Heathrow Airport in London has seen more than 60 flights cancelled on Sunday. Nearly 5.4 million people have died with coronavirus worldwide, according to America's Johns Hopkins University.

"This video can not be played Watch the Queen deliver her Christmas message for 2021 The Queen has paid tribute to her husband in her first annual Christmas message since his death. ""Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones. This year especially I understand why,"" she said in a personal message. She described Prince Philip as her ""beloved"", and said she felt his presence over the festive period. The Queen's comments about loss come against the background of another year of the pandemic. Speaking beside a photograph of them together, the Queen paid tribute to the late Duke of Edinburgh, her ""irrepressible"" husband of 73 years. The Queen and Prince Philip on honeymoon, with the same sapphire brooch in view ""That mischievous, inquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him,"" she said. ""But life of course consists of final partings as well as first meetings. ""And as much as I and my family miss him, I know he would want us to enjoy Christmas,"" said the Queen, remembering his ""capacity to squeeze fun out of any situation"". Queen cancels spending Christmas at Sandringham A look back at the Royal Family's 2021 'Seeing the Queen is part of our Christmas magic' The framed photograph in view during the broadcast was taken during their diamond wedding anniversary in 2007 - and the Queen was wearing the same sapphire brooch that appears in the photograph. She also wore the same brooch, in the form of a chrysanthemum, on her honeymoon in 1947. This week Buckingham Palace announced plans for a service of thanksgiving for the life of Prince Philip, to be held at Westminster Abbey in the spring. The Queen's Christmas message felt more personal than expected. It was really quite touching and a departure from the normal Christmas broadcast, which is typically a reflection on the year. This broadcast was very personal and one got an impression of the keen sense of loss that she clearly feels for the man who was her husband for 73 years. There's very little mention of Covid, just a passing reference that it has once again disrupted Christmas plans - including the Queen's. She had planned to go to Sandringham, her Norfolk estate, but she has stayed at Windsor and been joined by six members of her family today, including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. This Christmas broadcast is the first time we've had a chance to see the Queen face to face - nine weeks after she cancelled her trip to Northern Ireland for health reasons. Next year will be significant for the Queen and for the monarchy, because it will be her Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years since she acceded to the throne in February 1952. After another year of uncertainty with the pandemic, the Queen spoke of the reassuring comfort of family traditions, such as ""watching a favourite film where we already know the ending"". Royal aides declined to say what such a favourite film might be - although her grandson Prince William recently pointed to Elf as one of his seasonal favourites. The speech highlighted the importance of ""passing the baton"" to the next generation, in a year when the 95-year-old monarch has had her own health problems. The Christmas broadcast, recorded in Windsor Castle, was the Queen's most extensive appearance since having to withdraw from a series of events during the autumn. The Queen at the funeral of her husband Prince Philip, observing pandemic restrictions at the time The Queen praised the work of Prince Charles and Prince William at the COP26 climate change summit and their commitment to the ""stewardship of the environment"". She looked ahead to the Platinum Jubilee next year, marking 70 years of her reign, which she hoped would bring a ""sense of togetherness"" and a chance to take stock of the ""enormous changes"" over those decades. The broadcast included a community choir, called Singology, that helped to bring people together during the pandemic. There were glimpses of the royal family at events during the year, but there were no mentions of Prince Andrew, Prince Harry or Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Channel migrants deserve compassion - archbishop Armed intruder arrested in Windsor Castle grounds As a precaution against rising levels of the Omicron variant, the Queen is staying in Windsor Castle, rather than spending Christmas as usual on her Sandringham estate. Members of her family have been with her on Christmas day, including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Earlier,a 19-year-old man armed with an ""offensive weapon"" was arrested in the grounds of Windsor Castle, police said. Thames Valley Police said the man, who is from Southampton, was found within ""moments"" of entering the grounds at 08:30 GMT. He was arrested on suspicion of breach or trespass of a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon. The force said he did not enter any buildings and members of the Royal Family had been informed. At Sandringham, the Queen would usually have attended a Christmas morning local church service - and in her message the Queen spoke of the ""bedrock of my faith"". For a year of such personal and public upheavals, she quoted the Christmas carol, O Little Town of Bethlehem, with the lines: ""The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight."" The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall went to a church service in Windsor before joining the Queen for Christmas Day Many members of the Royal Family attended a morning church service at St George's Chapel in Windsor. Charles and Camilla went to the Christmas Matins service ahead of spending the day with the Queen. The couple were joined at the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle by the Earl and Countess of Wessex and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. It is understood the Queen's absence from the service is a personal choice and follows a precautionary approach seen over the last six months amid rising coronavirus cases. Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tweeted that this Christmas would be different to what so many people had planned. Prince William and Kate wrote:,external""From those who are alone or having to isolate away from loved ones, to the incredible people supporting our NHS and caring for those most in need - we are thinking of you."" The duchess also surprised an audience at a community carol concert as she took to the piano alongside musician Tom Walker. The service, which was held at Westminster Abbey, was broadcast last night on ITV. Catherine was joined at the service by Prince William and other members of the Royal Family including Zara and Mike Tindall, Sophie Wessex, and Princess Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.

"Donald Trump bought the golf resort at Turnberry in 2014 Donald Trump's golf courses and leisure businesses in Scotland claimed over Â£3m in UK government furlough money, newly-published accounts show. Covid restrictions caused substantial losses at Trump resorts in Ayrshire and Aberdeenshire with both companies reducing staff. Trump Turnberry saw turnover more than halved and it recorded a loss of more than Â£3m in 2020. The other course and resort at Balmedie also reported a loss, of Â£1.3m. Donald Trump's mother came from the Isle of Lewis, and the former US president is said to have spoken fondly of his Scottish ancestry. Donald Trump's mother: From Lewis to New York Trump Turnberry posts loss for fourth year in a row He opened his first golf resort on the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire in 2012, amid opposition over potential environmental damage, and later tried to stop a wind farm being built off the coast, arguing itwould spoil the view. In 2014 he bought the Turnberry golf resort in South Ayrshire from a Dubai-based company. He handed control of both courses to his sons Donald Junior and Eric shortly before he became president in 2017, but he retained a financial interest. Critics of Mr Trump recentlylost a legal bidto force the Scottish government to investigate how he paid for the courses, using an unexplained wealth order. Donald Trump has been a regular visitor to his golf resorts in Scotland According to accounts filed with Companies House, Golf Recreation Scotland Ltd, which owns the Turnberry golf course and resort, saw turnover fall from Â£19.7m in 2019 to Â£6.7m in 2020. It made a profit of Â£321,000 in 2019, and a loss of Â£3.4m in 2020. The resort was closed from 23 March to 15 July 2020, and again from 20 November to 26 April 2021. The company received a total of Â£2.3m in grants under the furlough scheme in 2020, the accounts say, while the average number of employees fell from 541 to 289. A subsidiary of the company, SLC Turnberry Ltd, made further furlough claims of between Â£435,000 and Â£1.1m from January to August 2021, according to government data not included in the published accounts. ""Government support was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible, however, uncertainty of the duration of support and the pandemic's sustained impact meant that redundancies were required to prepare the business for the long term effects to the hospitality industry,"" say the accounts, signed by Eric Trump. Donald Trump, pictured with his son Donald Jnr, teed off the first ball from the Aberdeenshire course in 2012 Trump International Golf Club Scotland Limited, which owns Donald Trump's golf course in Aberdeenshire, also saw a steep drop in turnover, from Â£3.3m in 2019 to Â£1.1m in 2020, although the company's losses rose only slightly, from Â£1.1m to Â£1.3m. The accounts note that while golf was permitted for much of the year, the Macleod House hotel was closed from 21 March onwards, and the restaurants and dining facilities only opened in June and closed again on 20 November. ""The UK government furlough scheme was helpful to retain as many jobs as possible, and the majority of employees were reinstated over the course of the year,"" the accounts say. The company received Â£452,000 in from the furlough scheme in 2020, according to the accounts. Separately, government data shows that Trump International Golf Club Scotland Limited claimed between Â£85,000 and Â£205,000 of furlough money from January to August 2021. The average number of employees fell from 84 in 2019 to 63 in 2020, the accounts show. The ultimate controlling parties of both companies are the trustees of the Donald J Trump Revocable Trust, registered in Florida, the accounts say.
