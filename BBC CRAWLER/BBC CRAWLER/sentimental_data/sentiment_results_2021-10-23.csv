"Disruption is expected in Glasgow over the weekend as the first major road closures for COP26 take effect. Routes including the Clyde Arc and part of the Clydeside Expressway closed on Saturday night while Finnieston Street will only allow local access on Sunday. Rail strikes also look set to go aheadfor the duration of the summit, following a breakdown in union talks. The climate conference is expected to draw 25,000 delegates and runs from 31 October to 12 November. Security is expected to be tight, particularly around the attendance of some 120 world leaders, and police have announcedhow they plan to approach disruptive climate activists. Strikes and closures during Glasgow climate summit How will road closures affect Glasgow? 'I'm worried how my business will fare with COP26' Road closures will last until Monday 15 November. Some days are expected to be busier than others, with the biggest disruption expected on Saturday 6 November which has been designated as the Global Day For Climate Justice. About 100,000 protesters are expected in Glasgow, with a march which begins at Kelvingrove Park at noon before making its way to Glasgow Green for about 15:00. People across the city can expect to be affected by delays, diversions or road congestion, from pedestrians and cyclists to drivers and those using public transport. This video can not be played Roads in Glasgow close ahead of the COP26 climate change summit The RMT confirmed that strikes during COP26 would go ahead, with ScotRail workers planning action from 1-12 November amid an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. The union's general secretary Mick Lynch said the decision to press on with industrial action was made on Friday after the train company ""failed to get serious"" in talks with the union. He said ScotRail had missed ""a golden opportunity"" for progress by offering ""nothing of any consequence"". Mr Lynch continued that there was still time to avoid ""the chaos of a transport shutdown during COP26 if the key players get back with some serious proposals"". Government 'perplexed' at RMT over ScotRail strike A Scottish government spokesperson welcomed that three out of four railway trade unions had now accepted, or recommended acceptance of, the pay offer. That offer amounts to a 2.5% pay increase backdated to 1 April 2021, and a 2.2% increase effective from 1 April 2022, with a one-off Â£300 payment for staff working during COP26. But the government said it was ""disappointed"" the offer was rejected by the RMT. A spokesperson said after this, ScotRail sought to focus the issue ofrest day working,external, which the RMT said needed to be addressed. However, an offer on rest day working was ""rejected out of hand"" and the union returned to the issue of pay, according to the government. It said: ""We don't think anyone, including the membership of the RMT, wants to disrupt COP26 or the chance to showcase Scotland's green, clean railway to a global audience. We hope that encompasses the RMT leadership too, although their approach to seeking resolution does appear to call this into question."" Meanwhile, Ian McConnell, of ScotRail, said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" that the union had ""point blank rejected"" the latest proposal. He accused the leadership of having ""moved the goalposts without consulting their members"". Mr McConnell said time was running out to reach agreement, adding: ""It seems RMT bosses are intent on sabotaging Scotland's railway's role during COP26."" Contingency plans were being developed to provide a core service for the duration of the summit, he said. Appearing onBBC Radio Scotland, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken urged people to plan ahead of travelling and check theGet Ready Glasgow,externalwebsite for more information. Ms Aitken also said cleansing teams were out clearing up fly-tipping ""hotspots"" after the issue of mounting rubbish in the city was raised onQuestion Time. About 1,500 Glasgow City Council staff including those in refuse collection and cleansingplan to strike for a week during the climate summitdue to an ongoing pay dispute. Union members rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 a year, and are instead calling for a Â£2,000 pay rise for staff. Concerns have also been raised about the impact the summit could have on Scotland's Covid cases. Prof Devi Sridhar, of Edinburgh University, tweeted,externalthat a mass event such as COP26 ""will cause an increase in cases"" and could ""trigger a need for further restrictions"". Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence for NHS Grampian, said the risk of infection during mass events was high even if safety precautions were in place. Shewarnedmany of those attending would not be fully vaccinated. Ms Evans added: ""We've got a really fragile situation, the number of cases in Scotland have been plateauing - plateaued at higher levels than ever before."" ""You're looking at numbers we probably haven't seen before, whether that leads to restrictions will depend on the scale of this. I would say the stakes are really high,"" she said. The Scottish government has said appropriate mitigation measures will be in place for the summit and Covid-19 continues to be closely monitored. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman made the announcement in Riyadh The world's biggest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, has pledged to cut its carbon emissions to net zero by 2060. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the Gulf state would invest more than $180bn (Â£130bn) to reach the goal. But he said the kingdom would continue to produce oil for decades to come. The announcement comes days before the COP26 climate change summit, at which world leaders will be pressed on their plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions and thereby reduce global warming. A really simple guide to climate change Saudi Arabia now joins more than 100 countries that have committed to reaching net-zero emissions. Net zero means not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is achieved by a combination of cutting emissions as much as possible - mainly by reducing gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), which are released in the use of fossil fuels - and so-called offsetting measures, such as planting trees and carbon-capture technology. Net zero explained While China and Russia have plans to reach net zero by 2060, other countries - including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia's neighbour the United Arab Emirates, another major oil producer, aim to achieve the goal 10 years earlier. Saudi Arabia's move does mark a shift for the world's 10th-largest emitter of carbon dioxide. It has long resisted calls to cut its investment in fossil fuels. This week, documents leaked to the BBC revealedSaudi officials asked the UN to play down the need to rapidly move away from fossil fuels, ahead of the COP26 meeting, which starts in Glasgow on 31 October. At the launch of a climate conference in Riyadh, Prince Mohammed - Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler - said it would reach the target without affecting the ""stability of global energy markets"". He said the country also would cut its emissions of methane by 30% by 2030. The plans would rely on ""the availability of the required technologies to manage and reduce emissions"", the prince said. Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said the country would use carbon capture - technology that extracts CO2 from the air - to help it meet the goal. Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia said it would reduce carbon emissions by shifting to renewable energy and planting billions of trees. Richard Black, senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a UK-based think tank, described Saudi Arabia's net-zero target as ""very welcome"" but said the kingdom needed to publish a plan of how it would be achieved. ""There's a lack of clarity... it would be really good to see that stuff made clear,"" he said, adding that the carbon-capture commitments were ""really speculative"". Since the net-zero target only applies to domestic emissions, it may mean Saudi Arabia will not need to reduce its oil and gas production. Carbon emissions from fossil fuels burned by other nations once the kingdom ships them abroad will not be counted. ""There's a lot of people who will be cynical about this unless Saudi Arabia plans to ramp down its production of oil and gas, which it has no plans on doing,"" Mr Black said.

"Healthcare Science is one of the T-levels already on offer The government will reconfirm its commitment to a ""skills revolution"" with a spending package to be unveiled by the chancellor on Wednesday. Rishi Sunak will announce Â£1.6bn to roll out newT-levels,externalfor 16 to 19-year-olds, and Â£550m for adult skills in England in his autumn statement. And there will be Â£830m confirmed to continue a five-year-scheme to revamp and modernise colleges. College principals said the funding was welcome but would not go far enough. Sixth form colleges and 16-19 education finances have been struggling for many years. A report by the IPPR think-tank last year suggested colleges in England would have needed an extra Â£2.7bn a year since 2010 just to catch up with investment levels then. Scrapping B-Tecs 'hammer blow for social mobility' Millions 'could miss out on new skills scheme' What will teenagers study for the new T-levels? The Â£1.6bn cash investment for colleges over three years to 2024-25 will be used, in the main, to provide additional classroom hours for up to 100,000 young people taking T-levels. Presently there are about 6,000 students on T-level courses. These are the government's new vocational qualifications, equivalent to three A-levels, that have been developed with businesses to meet the needs of industry. Currently, there are 10 T-levels available currently However, in time the government wants the list to be expanded to include training for many more professions. The funding will also cover inflationary pressures and accommodate the higher number of teenagers in the population. An extra Â£550m is being invested in adult skills through the Skills Fund by 2024-25. This fund offers short courses and so-called ""skills boot camps"" for adults who have no qualifications beyond GCSE level. And there is a further Â£170m for apprenticeships and training. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Our future economic success depends not just on the education we give to our children but the lifelong learning we offer to adults."" He said his Â£3bn investment would create a ""skills revolution"", which would build on the government's job creation plans and spread opportunity across the UK by transforming post-16 education. Mr Sunak told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show ""more sector-orientated training schemes have been shown to be really powerful"" and ""the best way to get to a high wage economy is to improve people's skills"". At the heart of the government's plan for 16 to 19-year-olds in England is a qualification that few have yet heard of, the Technical or T-Level. One T-level is designed to be equivalent to three A-levels, or up to 3 BTecs. T-Levels are meant to be substantial and quite demanding courses, which include at least 45 days of work placement. At the moment, only around 6,000 students across England are enrolled to study the first T-levels, which they will complete next summer. The government hopes to scale up the numbers rapidly as more T-levels are introduced, partly through a controversial decision to remove funding from popular BTecs in similar subjects. Association of Colleges chief executive David Hughes said: ""We always expected the increased funding wouldn't go far enough, but in the circumstances we view this as a good start in a tough spending round. ""That the chancellor is leading with this announcement in advance of the Comprehensive Spending Review shows just how far we've come in making the government recognise the importance of investing in people to close the skills gap."" He added: ""I am hopeful that the lack of mention of education recovery is because of a significant announcement on Wednesday at the dispatch box."" He said his organisation had calculated that it was going to take at least Â£300m per year to support education recovery for 16 to 19-year-olds. Bill Watkins, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said: ""Today's announcement focuses on the small minority of 16 to 18-year-olds that pursue a technical course. ""That's welcome, but all students deserve to have their education properly funded and we hope that Wednesday's spending review will also focus on the vast majority of young people that study A-level or BTec qualifications."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the investment in the further education sector, which he said had traditionally been ""starved of funding"". However, he told BBC Breakfast the move was a ""gamble"" when it was still unclear how many teenagers would want to do T-levels.

"An A-level history textbook has been withdrawn after a youth worker said she was ""horrified"" to discover an image asking whether the treatment of Native Americans had been exaggerated. The AQA-approved book asked students to balance ""criticisms of treatment of Native Americans"" with ""defence"" of their treatment in the late 1800s. The period saw some massacres of Native American tribes by the US government. The publisher Hodder has withdrawn the book. In one section the textbook - called The Making of a Superpower: USA 1865-1975 - asked students ""to what extent do you believe the treatment of Native Americans has been exaggerated?"" Hannah Wilkinson, who offers history mentoring sessions at Durham Sixth Form Centre, said the exercise was ""quite problematic"". ""It was deeply shocking to see how ingrained racial injustice is,"" she told the BBC. ""The period we're looking at is a period of American policy where Native Americans were treated terribly,"" she said. ""The way the textbook framed it suggests that maybe the treatment of Native Americans has been exaggerated."" From the early the 17th Century through to the late 19th Century a series of wars took place between European colonists and Native American tribes. They became known as the American-Indian Wars. In this time the Native American population fell heavily, partly due to new diseases brought by the Europeans and partly due to wars and massacres. Several historians have accused the colonialists of a ""genocide"" against Native American tribes. Whether or not the US government's actions amounted to a genocide, it imposed policies that targeted Native American land, freedom, and wellbeing. Ms Wilkinson teaches history for students who need extra support as part of her work with St Nicholas Church, Durham. ""My concern is that it presents really oppressive policies in an objective way. That didn't seem appropriate to the historical context,"" she said. ""I am definitely worried this is a wider pattern. We like to think that compared to America that we don't really have an issue of racial injustice."" She added: ""This period goes from slavery, to Jim Crow, to civil rights. If this is how they're presenting the history of Native Americans with such bias my concern is whether that is a repeated pattern in the framing of US history and whether that is coming up throughout the course.""

"England's city regions are set to receive billions of pounds to improve public transport in next week's Budget. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will commit Â£6.9bn towards train, tram, bus and cycle projects when he sets out his spending plans on Wednesday. Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire are among the regions that will benefit. The funding was welcomed by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham as ""an important first step"". Earlier this month,he launched a bid for Â£1bn to create a London-style transport networkfor the region. Areas set to receive funding include: Greater Manchester(Â£1.07bn): For next generation Metrolink tram-train vehicles; new bus corridors at Bury and Ashton-under-Lyne West Midlands(Â£1.05bn): For projects including Metro extension, including the completion of the Wednesbury to Brierley Hill extension West Yorkshire(Â£830m): Extending the West Bradford-Cycle Superhighway and installing electric vehicle charging stations in Kirklees neighbourhoods Liverpool City region(Â£710m): For new and renovated stations in Liverpool and Runcorn as well as an interchange project at St Helens South Yorkshire(Â£570m): Starting a Supertram renewal project and installing a ""Dutch-style"" roundabout in Barnsley town centre West of England(Â£540m): A fully prioritised bus route between Bristol and Bath Tees Valley(Â£310m): Upgrading Darlington and Middlesbrough train stations, and improving rail links in the region Mr Sunak said: ""There is no reason why somebody working in the North and Midlands should have to wait several times longer for their bus or train to arrive in the morning compared to a commuter in the capital. ""This transport revolution will help redress that imbalance as we modernise our local transport networks so they are fit for our great cities and those people who live and work in them."" Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding through the Barnett formula - a mechanism the UK government uses to allocate additional money to the devolved nations when it spends more in England. Six things that could affect you in the Budget A simple guide to Budget 2021 How is levelling up going down in Yorkshire? The Â£5.7bn is a five-year settlement, and has been increased from the initial Â£4.2bn proposed, the Treasury said. The Â£1.2bn of funding to make bus services cheaper and more frequent is part of Â£3bn thatPrime Minister Boris Johnson committed to spending on a ""bus revolution""in March. Labour's Andy Burnham said the cash was ""an important first step towards a London-style public transport system for Greater Manchester"". But he added: ""As welcome as it is, infrastructure investment alone will not make levelling up feel real to the people of Greater Manchester. ""That will only happen when the frequency and coverage of bus services are increased and fares are lowered to London levels,"" Mr Burnham added. Andy Street, Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, said he was ""absolutely delighted"" to get the funding, which he said was the largest single transport sum the area had ever received. ""From more metro lines and train stations, to new bus routes and electric vehicle charging points, this cash will help us to continue to build a clean, green transport network that connects communities and tackles the climate emergency."" Silviya Barrett, head of policy and research at the Campaign for Better Transport, welcomed the increased funding for trams, trains and ""active travel"" but wanted the government to end the process of regions competing for bus funding. ""We are concerned that the competitive funding process for buses could mean that investment does not reach everywhere that needs it. ""Many areas have bus fares that are too high and gaping holes in services, so they need funding to put their bus service improvement plans in place,"" Ms Barrett said. The Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents the bus and coach industry, said the fact the full Â£3bn the government had committed to spending on buses had not yet been reached meant the government's ""rhetoric is unfortunately not being matched by reality"". More money will go to the West Midlands Metro It comes as a new survey shows reliance on cars has reached a 15-year high despite fewer people commuting during the pandemic. More than four in five (82%) of 2,652 UK motorists surveyed by the RAC motoring organisation said they would struggle without a car. That is up from 79% in 2020 and 74% the previous year. More than half said that there were no feasible public transport services in their area. And people living in cities who have to drive are spending more time at the wheel, according to research from the Centre for Cities, which found motorists in Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester spend more than 50 hours a year stuck in traffic. Drivers in rural areas were also more likely to be car-dependent (87%) than their urban counterparts (77%).

"The protocol is the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland which keeps it in the EU's single market for goods The first round of new talks on theNorthern Ireland Protocolwas ""constructive"", UK officials have said. However big gaps remain, particularly onthe role of the European Court of Justice(ECJ). EU and UK officials held technical talks in Brussels last week, and an EU team will arrive in London on Tuesday to continue negotiations. The lead negotiators, Lord Frost and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, are expected to meet at the end of next week. A European Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the talks. Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? The protocol is the Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. That also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses. Unionist politicians say the arrangement undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK. Unionists say the protocol damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK The EU has suggested a package of reforms which would reduce the practical impacts of the protocol. The UK wants more fundamental change, including the removal of the ECJ from its oversight role in the deal. A UK government source said: ""The talks this week were constructive and we've heard some things from the EU that we can work with. ""There's been plenty of speculation about governance this week but our position remains unchanged: the role of the ECJ in resolving disputes between the UK and EU must end. ""We need to see real progress soon rather than get stuck in a process of endless negotiation. ""Whether we're able to establish that momentum soon will help us determine if we can bridge the gap or if we need to use Article 16."" Lord Frost is expected to meet his EU counterpart MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ next week Article 16 is the part of the deal which allows parts of the protocol to be temporarily suspended if they are causing serious difficulties or leading to diversion of trade. If one side uses Article 16 the other can take ""proportionate rebalancing measures"". Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has suggested the talks have a rough deadline of late December. He told the Press Association news agency that there is a finite ""window"" within which the EU is willing to find solutions. ""I think that window is on offer now to the British government if they want to use it to find a way of implementing the protocol in a way that responds to the vast majority of the issues and problems that have been raised,"" he said. ""I can't tell you when the EU will decide that that approach is getting us nowhere if there's no agreement. ""But certainly I think there's a window between now and late December, when the EU, I think, will be open to continuing dialogue and trying to find a way of making this work.""

"England's city regions are set to receive billions of pounds to improve public transport in next week's Budget. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will commit Â£6.9bn towards train, tram, bus and cycle projects when he sets out his spending plans on Wednesday. Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire are among the regions that will benefit. The funding was welcomed by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham as ""an important first step"". Earlier this month,he launched a bid for Â£1bn to create a London-style transport networkfor the region. Areas set to receive funding include: Greater Manchester(Â£1.07bn): For next generation Metrolink tram-train vehicles; new bus corridors at Bury and Ashton-under-Lyne West Midlands(Â£1.05bn): For projects including Metro extension, including the completion of the Wednesbury to Brierley Hill extension West Yorkshire(Â£830m): Extending the West Bradford-Cycle Superhighway and installing electric vehicle charging stations in Kirklees neighbourhoods Liverpool City region(Â£710m): For new and renovated stations in Liverpool and Runcorn as well as an interchange project at St Helens South Yorkshire(Â£570m): Starting a Supertram renewal project and installing a ""Dutch-style"" roundabout in Barnsley town centre West of England(Â£540m): A fully prioritised bus route between Bristol and Bath Tees Valley(Â£310m): Upgrading Darlington and Middlesbrough train stations, and improving rail links in the region Mr Sunak said: ""There is no reason why somebody working in the North and Midlands should have to wait several times longer for their bus or train to arrive in the morning compared to a commuter in the capital. ""This transport revolution will help redress that imbalance as we modernise our local transport networks so they are fit for our great cities and those people who live and work in them."" Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding through the Barnett formula - a mechanism the UK government uses to allocate additional money to the devolved nations when it spends more in England. Six things that could affect you in the Budget A simple guide to Budget 2021 How is levelling up going down in Yorkshire? The Â£5.7bn is a five-year settlement, and has been increased from the initial Â£4.2bn proposed, the Treasury said. The Â£1.2bn of funding to make bus services cheaper and more frequent is part of Â£3bn thatPrime Minister Boris Johnson committed to spending on a ""bus revolution""in March. Labour's Andy Burnham said the cash was ""an important first step towards a London-style public transport system for Greater Manchester"". But he added: ""As welcome as it is, infrastructure investment alone will not make levelling up feel real to the people of Greater Manchester. ""That will only happen when the frequency and coverage of bus services are increased and fares are lowered to London levels,"" Mr Burnham added. Andy Street, Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, said he was ""absolutely delighted"" to get the funding, which he said was the largest single transport sum the area had ever received. ""From more metro lines and train stations, to new bus routes and electric vehicle charging points, this cash will help us to continue to build a clean, green transport network that connects communities and tackles the climate emergency."" Silviya Barrett, head of policy and research at the Campaign for Better Transport, welcomed the increased funding for trams, trains and ""active travel"" but wanted the government to end the process of regions competing for bus funding. ""We are concerned that the competitive funding process for buses could mean that investment does not reach everywhere that needs it. ""Many areas have bus fares that are too high and gaping holes in services, so they need funding to put their bus service improvement plans in place,"" Ms Barrett said. The Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents the bus and coach industry, said the fact the full Â£3bn the government had committed to spending on buses had not yet been reached meant the government's ""rhetoric is unfortunately not being matched by reality"". More money will go to the West Midlands Metro It comes as a new survey shows reliance on cars has reached a 15-year high despite fewer people commuting during the pandemic. More than four in five (82%) of 2,652 UK motorists surveyed by the RAC motoring organisation said they would struggle without a car. That is up from 79% in 2020 and 74% the previous year. More than half said that there were no feasible public transport services in their area. And people living in cities who have to drive are spending more time at the wheel, according to research from the Centre for Cities, which found motorists in Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester spend more than 50 hours a year stuck in traffic. Drivers in rural areas were also more likely to be car-dependent (87%) than their urban counterparts (77%).

"Disruption is expected in Glasgow over the weekend as the first major road closures for COP26 take effect. Routes including the Clyde Arc and part of the Clydeside Expressway closed on Saturday night while Finnieston Street will only allow local access on Sunday. Rail strikes also look set to go aheadfor the duration of the summit, following a breakdown in union talks. The climate conference is expected to draw 25,000 delegates and runs from 31 October to 12 November. Security is expected to be tight, particularly around the attendance of some 120 world leaders, and police have announcedhow they plan to approach disruptive climate activists. Strikes and closures during Glasgow climate summit How will road closures affect Glasgow? 'I'm worried how my business will fare with COP26' Road closures will last until Monday 15 November. Some days are expected to be busier than others, with the biggest disruption expected on Saturday 6 November which has been designated as the Global Day For Climate Justice. About 100,000 protesters are expected in Glasgow, with a march which begins at Kelvingrove Park at noon before making its way to Glasgow Green for about 15:00. People across the city can expect to be affected by delays, diversions or road congestion, from pedestrians and cyclists to drivers and those using public transport. This video can not be played Roads in Glasgow close ahead of the COP26 climate change summit The RMT confirmed that strikes during COP26 would go ahead, with ScotRail workers planning action from 1-12 November amid an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. The union's general secretary Mick Lynch said the decision to press on with industrial action was made on Friday after the train company ""failed to get serious"" in talks with the union. He said ScotRail had missed ""a golden opportunity"" for progress by offering ""nothing of any consequence"". Mr Lynch continued that there was still time to avoid ""the chaos of a transport shutdown during COP26 if the key players get back with some serious proposals"". Government 'perplexed' at RMT over ScotRail strike A Scottish government spokesperson welcomed that three out of four railway trade unions had now accepted, or recommended acceptance of, the pay offer. That offer amounts to a 2.5% pay increase backdated to 1 April 2021, and a 2.2% increase effective from 1 April 2022, with a one-off Â£300 payment for staff working during COP26. But the government said it was ""disappointed"" the offer was rejected by the RMT. A spokesperson said after this, ScotRail sought to focus the issue ofrest day working,external, which the RMT said needed to be addressed. However, an offer on rest day working was ""rejected out of hand"" and the union returned to the issue of pay, according to the government. It said: ""We don't think anyone, including the membership of the RMT, wants to disrupt COP26 or the chance to showcase Scotland's green, clean railway to a global audience. We hope that encompasses the RMT leadership too, although their approach to seeking resolution does appear to call this into question."" Meanwhile, Ian McConnell, of ScotRail, said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" that the union had ""point blank rejected"" the latest proposal. He accused the leadership of having ""moved the goalposts without consulting their members"". Mr McConnell said time was running out to reach agreement, adding: ""It seems RMT bosses are intent on sabotaging Scotland's railway's role during COP26."" Contingency plans were being developed to provide a core service for the duration of the summit, he said. Appearing onBBC Radio Scotland, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken urged people to plan ahead of travelling and check theGet Ready Glasgow,externalwebsite for more information. Ms Aitken also said cleansing teams were out clearing up fly-tipping ""hotspots"" after the issue of mounting rubbish in the city was raised onQuestion Time. About 1,500 Glasgow City Council staff including those in refuse collection and cleansingplan to strike for a week during the climate summitdue to an ongoing pay dispute. Union members rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 a year, and are instead calling for a Â£2,000 pay rise for staff. Concerns have also been raised about the impact the summit could have on Scotland's Covid cases. Prof Devi Sridhar, of Edinburgh University, tweeted,externalthat a mass event such as COP26 ""will cause an increase in cases"" and could ""trigger a need for further restrictions"". Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence for NHS Grampian, said the risk of infection during mass events was high even if safety precautions were in place. Shewarnedmany of those attending would not be fully vaccinated. Ms Evans added: ""We've got a really fragile situation, the number of cases in Scotland have been plateauing - plateaued at higher levels than ever before."" ""You're looking at numbers we probably haven't seen before, whether that leads to restrictions will depend on the scale of this. I would say the stakes are really high,"" she said. The Scottish government has said appropriate mitigation measures will be in place for the summit and Covid-19 continues to be closely monitored. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"This video can not be played Watch: Erdogan orders 10 ambassadors to be declared 'persona non grata' Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has ordered 10 ambassadors, including those from the US, Germany and France, be declared persona non grata. It follows a statement from the envoys calling for the urgent release of activist Osman Kavala. He has been in jail for more than four years over protests and a coup attempt, although he has not been convicted. Persona non grata can remove diplomatic status and often results in expulsion or withdrawal of recognition of envoys. This week's statement on Mr Kavala jointly came from the embassies,externalof the US, Canada, France, Finland, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. Seven are fellow Nato allies of Turkey. The Council of Europe, Europe's main human rights watchdog, has given Turkey a final warning to heed a European Court of Human Rights ruling to free Mr Kavala pending trial. Addressing a crowd in Eskisehir on Saturday, Mr Erdogan said the ambassadors ""cannot dare to come to the Turkish foreign ministry and give orders"". He said: ""I gave the necessary order to our foreign minister and said what must be done. These 10 ambassadors must be declared persona non grata at once. You will sort it out immediately."" However, what will happen now remains unclear. Osman Kavala has spent more than four years in jail, without conviction Mr Erdogan said the envoys should either understand Turkey or leave, Turkish media reported. There has been little response from the ambassadors so far, although the German foreign ministry said the nations involved were in ""intensive consultation"". No official notification has been received from Turkish authorities. The Norwegian foreign ministry told Reuters its envoy had ""not done anything that warrants an expulsion"". Turkey's foreign ministry had summoned the ambassadors on Tuesday to protest at their ""irresponsible"" statement on the Kavala case. The embassies' statement had criticised the ""continuing delays"" in Osman Kavala's trial, which ""cast a shadow over respect for democracy, the rule of law and transparency in the Turkish judiciary system"". It urges a speedy resolution and calls for ""Turkey to secure his urgent release"". Mr Kavala was last year acquitted of charges over nationwide protests in 2013, but almost immediately rearrested. The acquittal was overturned and new charges were added relating to the military coup attempt against the Erdogan government in 2016. A brief guide to Turkey's coup Mr Kavala denies any wrongdoing and critics of the Erdogan government say his case is an example of a widespread crackdown on dissent. Earlier this week, Mr Erdogan defended Turkey's judicial system, saying: ""I told our foreign minister: We can't have the luxury of hosting this lot in our country. Is it for you to give Turkey such a lesson? Who do you think you are?"" By Ece Goksedef, BBC Turkish The Kavala case has been a source of tension between the Turkish government and its Western allies. Turkey has been accused of applying criminal law against its critics and breaching the rule of law. The Kavala case is one example. As a businessman, Mr Kavala had been campaigning for freedom of speech and democracy. President Erdogan says he supportedthe Gezi protests in Turkey in 2013. He believes those protests were aimed at toppling himself and his government. That is why he believes all the calls for Mr Kavala's release are directly targeting himself. Hence his harsh response. Turkish officials told me that they did not know when the trial should start. But if it does, we can expect a response from the countries now speaking out, and that will have consequences for the Turkish economy, which is already struggling, since some of those countries are Turkey's biggest trade partners. This is a very bold move, probably a show of strength, especially for domestic politics a year and a half before elections. Some analysts believe it is rhetoric for domestic consumption.

"Government plans for social media regulation need ""far more clarity"", a Twitter boss has told the BBC. Katy Minshall said the draft Online Safety Bill failed to answer key questions such as how to define legal but harmful material. Instead of simply targeting those who post offensive content, the bill would put more responsibility on platforms. The culture secretary said the bill would make the UK ""the safest place in the world to be online"". Writing in the Daily Mail,external, Nadine Dorries said ""online hate has poisoned public life, it's intolerable, it's often unbearable and it has to end"". ""Enough is enough. Social media companies have no excuses. And once this bill passes through Parliament, they will have no choice."" She also said the government had decided to ""re-examine how our legislation can go even further to ensure the biggest social media companies properly protect users from anonymous abuse"". Meanwhile, a senior government source said ""social media giants could be acting now to stamp out abuse but instead they're out making excuses"". Ofcom would get powers to regulate social media sites It would be able to force companies to have a duty of care for their users, including protecting users from legal but harmful content, such as abuse that doesn't cross the criminality threshold Companies who breach Ofcom rules could face fines of up to Â£18m Social media sites would also be required to moderate content from different political viewpoints equally and without discrimination Provisions would be introduced to tackle online scams, such as romance fraud and fake investment opportunities. Ruth Moss, whose daughter Sophie took her own life aged 13 in 2014, is calling for social media companies to take more action to address harmful material on their platforms. After her daughter's death, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she found numerous ""deeply disturbing"" images and instructions on self-harm and suicide on Sophie's phone and tablet. Despite limiting her internet use at home, she said Sophie, who suffered from depression, was still able to use her phone on the bus or with friends and it was ""impossible"" for parents to know what their child was doing online all the time. Ruth Moss says her daughter Sophie viewed harmful content online before her death Under the draft Online Safety Bill, the regulator Ofcom would have the power to levy fines of up to Â£18m or 10% of global profits, whichever is higher, on social media platforms which fail to comply with the new laws. Ofcom would also be given the power to block services from the UK if they are deemed to present a risk of significant harm to UK citizens. Can new law tackle social media abuse of MPs? Government lays out plans to protect users online But Twitter is concerned the bill gives too much influence to the culture secretary over Ofcom. The current draft bill would allow Ms Dorries to change the Ofcom code of practice that would be used to regulate the likes of Facebook and Twitter. Speaking to Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme, Ms Minshall - the head of policy in the UK for Twitter - said the bill gave the minister ""unusual powers"", leaving Ofcom to ""muddle through"". She also rejected the idea of stronger rules around online anonymity - something some MPs have campaigned for. Conservative MP Mark Francois said people sending ""horrendous abuse"" online should not be allowed to ""hide behind a cloak of anonymity with the connivance of the social media companies for profit"". But Ms Minshall argued that clamping down on anonymous accounts would ""fail to deal with the problems of online abuse"" and could damage people who rely on ""pseudonymity"". ""If you're a young person exploring their sexuality or you're a victim of domestic violence looking online for help and for support, pseudonymity is a really important safety tool for you."" She added that users already had to provide a date of birth, full name and email address when signing up, meaning that the police could access data about an account, even if someone had used a pseudonym. Asked about the fines that could be levied on companies, she said such penalties were ""almost existential"". In February of this year,Twitter boss Jack Dorsey saidhis company had experienced an ""extraordinary year"" in 2020, with revenues growing by 28% to $1.29bn (Â£930m) compared to the last quarter of 2019. Ms Minshall said the bill had thrown up ""all sorts of really important questions"", such as ""how do we define legal but harmful content"" and ""what sorts of exemptions should we make for journalistic content or content of democratic importance"". ""These are questions that Parliament needs to answer,"" she added. MPs and peers are currently scrutinising the draft bill and next Thursday they will hear evidence from representatives of Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube and TikTok. Writing in the Mirror,,externalLabour's shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens described the government's bill as ""weak and ineffective"", adding ""it won't do the job we need it to do"". She said the government should introduce criminal sanctions against the bosses of big technology companies who repeatedly break the new laws. She also raised concern that small companies would be subject to less stringent rules. Can new law tackle social media abuse of MPs?

"Disruption is expected in Glasgow over the weekend as the first major road closures for COP26 take effect. Routes including the Clyde Arc and part of the Clydeside Expressway closed on Saturday night while Finnieston Street will only allow local access on Sunday. Rail strikes also look set to go aheadfor the duration of the summit, following a breakdown in union talks. The climate conference is expected to draw 25,000 delegates and runs from 31 October to 12 November. Security is expected to be tight, particularly around the attendance of some 120 world leaders, and police have announcedhow they plan to approach disruptive climate activists. Strikes and closures during Glasgow climate summit How will road closures affect Glasgow? 'I'm worried how my business will fare with COP26' Road closures will last until Monday 15 November. Some days are expected to be busier than others, with the biggest disruption expected on Saturday 6 November which has been designated as the Global Day For Climate Justice. About 100,000 protesters are expected in Glasgow, with a march which begins at Kelvingrove Park at noon before making its way to Glasgow Green for about 15:00. People across the city can expect to be affected by delays, diversions or road congestion, from pedestrians and cyclists to drivers and those using public transport. This video can not be played Roads in Glasgow close ahead of the COP26 climate change summit The RMT confirmed that strikes during COP26 would go ahead, with ScotRail workers planning action from 1-12 November amid an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. The union's general secretary Mick Lynch said the decision to press on with industrial action was made on Friday after the train company ""failed to get serious"" in talks with the union. He said ScotRail had missed ""a golden opportunity"" for progress by offering ""nothing of any consequence"". Mr Lynch continued that there was still time to avoid ""the chaos of a transport shutdown during COP26 if the key players get back with some serious proposals"". Government 'perplexed' at RMT over ScotRail strike A Scottish government spokesperson welcomed that three out of four railway trade unions had now accepted, or recommended acceptance of, the pay offer. That offer amounts to a 2.5% pay increase backdated to 1 April 2021, and a 2.2% increase effective from 1 April 2022, with a one-off Â£300 payment for staff working during COP26. But the government said it was ""disappointed"" the offer was rejected by the RMT. A spokesperson said after this, ScotRail sought to focus the issue ofrest day working,external, which the RMT said needed to be addressed. However, an offer on rest day working was ""rejected out of hand"" and the union returned to the issue of pay, according to the government. It said: ""We don't think anyone, including the membership of the RMT, wants to disrupt COP26 or the chance to showcase Scotland's green, clean railway to a global audience. We hope that encompasses the RMT leadership too, although their approach to seeking resolution does appear to call this into question."" Meanwhile, Ian McConnell, of ScotRail, said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" that the union had ""point blank rejected"" the latest proposal. He accused the leadership of having ""moved the goalposts without consulting their members"". Mr McConnell said time was running out to reach agreement, adding: ""It seems RMT bosses are intent on sabotaging Scotland's railway's role during COP26."" Contingency plans were being developed to provide a core service for the duration of the summit, he said. Appearing onBBC Radio Scotland, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken urged people to plan ahead of travelling and check theGet Ready Glasgow,externalwebsite for more information. Ms Aitken also said cleansing teams were out clearing up fly-tipping ""hotspots"" after the issue of mounting rubbish in the city was raised onQuestion Time. About 1,500 Glasgow City Council staff including those in refuse collection and cleansingplan to strike for a week during the climate summitdue to an ongoing pay dispute. Union members rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 a year, and are instead calling for a Â£2,000 pay rise for staff. Concerns have also been raised about the impact the summit could have on Scotland's Covid cases. Prof Devi Sridhar, of Edinburgh University, tweeted,externalthat a mass event such as COP26 ""will cause an increase in cases"" and could ""trigger a need for further restrictions"". Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence for NHS Grampian, said the risk of infection during mass events was high even if safety precautions were in place. Shewarnedmany of those attending would not be fully vaccinated. Ms Evans added: ""We've got a really fragile situation, the number of cases in Scotland have been plateauing - plateaued at higher levels than ever before."" ""You're looking at numbers we probably haven't seen before, whether that leads to restrictions will depend on the scale of this. I would say the stakes are really high,"" she said. The Scottish government has said appropriate mitigation measures will be in place for the summit and Covid-19 continues to be closely monitored. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"This video can not be played Watch: Erdogan orders 10 ambassadors to be declared 'persona non grata' Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has ordered 10 ambassadors, including those from the US, Germany and France, be declared persona non grata. It follows a statement from the envoys calling for the urgent release of activist Osman Kavala. He has been in jail for more than four years over protests and a coup attempt, although he has not been convicted. Persona non grata can remove diplomatic status and often results in expulsion or withdrawal of recognition of envoys. This week's statement on Mr Kavala jointly came from the embassies,externalof the US, Canada, France, Finland, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden. Seven are fellow Nato allies of Turkey. The Council of Europe, Europe's main human rights watchdog, has given Turkey a final warning to heed a European Court of Human Rights ruling to free Mr Kavala pending trial. Addressing a crowd in Eskisehir on Saturday, Mr Erdogan said the ambassadors ""cannot dare to come to the Turkish foreign ministry and give orders"". He said: ""I gave the necessary order to our foreign minister and said what must be done. These 10 ambassadors must be declared persona non grata at once. You will sort it out immediately."" However, what will happen now remains unclear. Osman Kavala has spent more than four years in jail, without conviction Mr Erdogan said the envoys should either understand Turkey or leave, Turkish media reported. There has been little response from the ambassadors so far, although the German foreign ministry said the nations involved were in ""intensive consultation"". No official notification has been received from Turkish authorities. The Norwegian foreign ministry told Reuters its envoy had ""not done anything that warrants an expulsion"". Turkey's foreign ministry had summoned the ambassadors on Tuesday to protest at their ""irresponsible"" statement on the Kavala case. The embassies' statement had criticised the ""continuing delays"" in Osman Kavala's trial, which ""cast a shadow over respect for democracy, the rule of law and transparency in the Turkish judiciary system"". It urges a speedy resolution and calls for ""Turkey to secure his urgent release"". Mr Kavala was last year acquitted of charges over nationwide protests in 2013, but almost immediately rearrested. The acquittal was overturned and new charges were added relating to the military coup attempt against the Erdogan government in 2016. A brief guide to Turkey's coup Mr Kavala denies any wrongdoing and critics of the Erdogan government say his case is an example of a widespread crackdown on dissent. Earlier this week, Mr Erdogan defended Turkey's judicial system, saying: ""I told our foreign minister: We can't have the luxury of hosting this lot in our country. Is it for you to give Turkey such a lesson? Who do you think you are?"" By Ece Goksedef, BBC Turkish The Kavala case has been a source of tension between the Turkish government and its Western allies. Turkey has been accused of applying criminal law against its critics and breaching the rule of law. The Kavala case is one example. As a businessman, Mr Kavala had been campaigning for freedom of speech and democracy. President Erdogan says he supportedthe Gezi protests in Turkey in 2013. He believes those protests were aimed at toppling himself and his government. That is why he believes all the calls for Mr Kavala's release are directly targeting himself. Hence his harsh response. Turkish officials told me that they did not know when the trial should start. But if it does, we can expect a response from the countries now speaking out, and that will have consequences for the Turkish economy, which is already struggling, since some of those countries are Turkey's biggest trade partners. This is a very bold move, probably a show of strength, especially for domestic politics a year and a half before elections. Some analysts believe it is rhetoric for domestic consumption. But others argue Mr Erdogan may be serious in pursuing this order. It remains to be seen.

"Ministers are to fund a network of ""family hubs"" in England as part of a Â£500m package to support parents and children. The centres in 75 different areas will provide a ""one stop shop"" for support and advice, the government said. The funding, to be announced by the chancellor in Wednesday's Budget, will also go towards breastfeeding advice and mental health services. Labour called the plans a ""smokescreen"" for failing to deliver for families. Kate Green MP, Labour's shadow education secretary, said family hubs were ""a sticking plaster for a fractured childcare and children services landscape"". ""This supposed commitment rings hollow after 11 years of Conservative cuts have forced the closure of over a thousand children's centres, cutting off the early learning that sets children up for life,"" she said. Six things that could affect you in the Budget What is the Budget - and when is it? Will spending be cut in the Budget? The funding includes Â£200m to support 300,000 families who face complex issues that could lead to family breakdown. Some Â£82m will be given to 75 local authorities to fund the new family hubs, while another Â£100m will go towards mental health support for expectant parents. And Â£50m will be spent on breastfeeding support - including antenatal classes and one-to-one support - to build upon best practice from areas such as Tower Hamlets in London, which has the highest breastfeeding rates at six to eight weeks in England. Parenting programmes will receive Â£50m and Â£10m will go to signposting theStart4Life initiative,external, which offers help and advice from the NHS during pregnancy, birth and parenthood. Ahead of the announcement, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he ""passionately"" believed in giving children the ""best possible start in life"". He said: ""We know that the first thousand and one days of a child's life are some of the most important in their development, which is why I'm thrilled that this investment will guarantee that thousands of families across England are given support to lead healthy and happy lives."" The government said the funding package addressesa report from March,externalon improving the health and development of babies in England, which recommended more joined-up, welcoming support for families. Neil Leitch, of the Early Years Alliance, said the new money was ""welcome news for struggling families"" but criticised the government for failing to address existing problems within the early years sector, specifically among nurseries, childminders and pre-schools, where almost 3,000 providers have closed down since January. He called for an independent review of the entire sector.  ""It's no good having a bit-piece approach to this, it needs a complete revamp,"" Mr Leitch told BBC Breakfast. ""If we fail to get it right effectively, it will cost us billions."" His concerns were echoed by Alison Morton, executive director of the Institute of Health Visiting.She said: ""We've had a really challenging time during the pandemic. Families have really faced the brunt of it - and whilst the government have poured a lot of money into other sectors, zero pounds, literally, has been spent on babies, young children and families.""""The government needs to go an awful lot further if they want to build back better for our babies and children,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

"The law aims to reduce after-school tutoring in favour of ""enriching extra-curricular activities"" China has passed an education law aimed at reducing the pressures of excessive homework and intensive after-school tutoring, state media say. Parents are being asked to ensure their children have reasonable time for rest and exercise, and do not spend too much time online. In AugustChina banned written exams for six and seven year olds. Officials warned at the time that students' physical and mental health was being harmed. In the last year the state has also introduced a number of measures aimed at moderating children's ""addiction"" to the internet and popular culture. The latest measure was passed on Saturday by the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the country's permanent legislative body. Full details of the law have not yet been published, but media reports suggest it encourages parents to nurture their children's morals, intellectual development and social habits. Local government will be responsible for implementation, such as providing funding for ""enriching extra-curricular activities"". The law received a mixed reaction on social media site Weibo, with some users praising the drive for good parenting while others questioned whether local authorities or the parents themselves would be up to the task. ""I work 996 [from 9am to 9pm, six days a week], and when I come home at night I still need to carry out family education?"" one user asked, quoted by the South China Morning Post newspaper.

"The car club is being used by someone..... You take your mobile phone out, walk up to a car, press your screen and the door opens. Yes, yes, it's 2021, we know phones can do magic, right? But here's the catch: It's not your car. The wonders of modern technology have meant that for those wanting to opt out of car ownership but still have access to a vehicle when necessary, joining a car club might just be the answer. With coronavirus ending commuting for some and home deliveries booming, that car which once racked up hundreds of miles a week is doing next to nothing - so do you still need it? Wheels in motion for electric car-sharing club Hundreds apply for car-exchange scheme How much public transport could Â£114m buy? Essentially, car clubs offer vehicles to members which they can rent by time periods as short as an hour and collect from parking spaces in their locality without having to travel to a central base. They might be run by a UK-wide operator or by a community-focused group. ....unlike all these private cars, lining city streets There are car club schemes running across most major cities in Britain, including Cardiff, which has 21 vehicles available to members. Nearly 635,000 people belong to a club in Wales, England and Scotland, with more than 6,000 cars available. Research by transport charity CoMoUK found for every car club vehicle, 18 private cars are removed from the road, and 25% of club members sell a car once they join up. Call for help to shape 'future of Cardiff' Key city centre street set to reopen to cars Cardiff's club has run for over a decade, initially as a council-backed scheme run by City Car Club before being taken over by vehicle hire company Enterprise in 2015, and continued on a commercial basis with no affiliation to the council. However, the council is now hoping to expand shared car usage and have more integration with public transport, and is exploring a concept known as Mobility as a Service (Maas), where multiple transport options including buses, shared cars, rental bikes and scooters are bundled into one linked service. The car club scheme is going out to tender, with the preferred bidder required to demonstrate how it would increase capacity and usage, as well as meeting minimum standards on emissions. Dan Gursel, Enterprise's UK head of car club operations, said for many of their customers it was not so much about going completely car-free, but giving them an option not to have a second car that makes the car club attractive. He said: ""As part of the pandemic, we're definitely seeing people's choices changing as a result."" People were seeing their cars, especially second cars ""sitting on the driveway"" and looking at them as expensive assets while wondering: ""Do we need that or are there alternatives?"" He admitted he was surprised to see that despite lockdowns, membership rose by 30% as coronavirus turned society upside down. But it's not just about those with the means to afford to run a second car. Some 20% of their members don't have access to any car and part of their aim is to offer services in areas that have low car ownership. Climate crisis awareness is a key motivator for some. With the UK just weeks away from hosting theCOP26climate summit in Glasgow, the need to reduce fossil fuel usage in our lives is taking centre stage. Offering low-emission vehicles is part of car clubs' strategy, with pure electric vehicles and hybrids making up a larger share of the fleet compared to the average private ownership model. Research shows club vehicles emit 84% less nitrogen dioxide than the average car. ""We have got a growing base of customers that are very aware of the environment and we know our members have a much higher disposition for active travel,"" said Dan. Such use of electric and hybrid cars is one of the hooks that could draw in those mindful of their carbon footprint, but unable to afford the cost of a newer electric vehicle (EV). Cars are parked in residential areas for easy access by users A sudden and unforeseen parting with my own car left me without wheels and perfectly placed to test drive (excuse the dreadful pun) Cardiff's existing car club while looking for a more permanent solution. The Enterprise scheme is app based. I applied to join, downloaded the app, took my driving licence to an office to be verified the next morning and was able to hire a car that day by reserving one which I located on the app, within reasonable walking distance from home. I walked up to the car, pressed ""start hire"" on the app and the doors unlocked. I entered a Pin code on a smart mile-counter pad kept with the key in the glove compartment to release the security system and start driving. Any issues can be dealt with by a call to the 24-hour service team, then I was off. I went in my temporary hybrid, feeling smug as I drove on electric power for short distances around the city before the petrol engine kicked in. A hand held keypad is used to release the car and record mileage On schemes like these, operators charge either a monthly or yearly membership fee, and hourly or daily rates of hire for the vehicle. Then there is a per mile charge which varies depending on the type and size of vehicle. Electric vehicle mileage is substantially cheaper or even free with some car clubs. Fuel or power is paid for via an account card housed in the smart meter so there are no out-of-pocket expenses to reclaim. Overall, for the long-distance journey I needed to take it was slightly cheaper to use the car club on its daily rate than to take public transport, and - crucially on this day - substantially faster. It also meant I had the car to use for errands and the usual weekend child taxi service for a few hours when I got home. I used car club vehicles twice more before getting my own wheels again, this time purely for local but essential trips. For shorter hires, it did feel like a bit of an expensive way to get about but once again it was the time-saving factor which gave it the edge. I also used taxis and buses during this period, not to mention getting a fair bit more walking and cycling than usual done, which is a win for my health - and the planet's. While it is unremarkable to find them in cities - density of population, close proximity to a vehicle - a car share in more rural areas might seem more of a challenge. But Llani Car Club proves it can be done. The club is in its 15th year and, after establishing itself in the Powys town of Llanidloes - population fewer than 3,000 - now operates in Newtown and Machynlleth and has just acquired a car to start up in Welshpool. Andrew Capel with a Renault Zoe, one of the car club's four electric vehicles They run five cars in total, with nearly 50 members across the different sites, although the majority are based around Llanidloes. With an electric car in each town and an additional petrol car in Llanidloes, the club's environmental credentials are an obvious draw to those concerned with their carbon footprint. But what brings most people to the club is an external stimulus, such as a current car needing replacing or a change in personal circumstances. Being a rural area, many people rely on their cars, but echoing Dan Gursel's words, club founder and member Andrew Capel said car club membership could be a positive option for those trying to avoid becoming a two-car household. ""Most people use it as a second car or as a way to avoid owning a second car,"" he explained, with the car club acting as a back up when the primary vehicle is in use. Llani Car Club used a grant to get electric vehicles on the road However, about a quarter of members do not own any vehicle, including him, but the decision to get rid of his own car was not easy, he admits. ""We'd set up the car club but hadn't got rid of our car immediately because I was actually dragging my feet, metaphorically speaking. ""There's a resistance to change. If it's forced on you in a way it's easier. ""Most people tend to give up their car when something happens to it, like with ours. It was coming to the end of its life and it wasn't worth putting it through the MOT. ""It is a leap of faith, but I tell people I think it's about education. I say, 'you give up your car, second car, and join the car club. If it doesn't work out for you, what's the worst thing that's going to happen?' [They're] going to go and get another car."" Using the club's car does mean he tends to maximise the value of a trip, so rather than just using it to go for a dental appointment in another town, for example, he will think of all the things he needs to do or get in advance and combine them into one journey. He sees it as a mindset change. Rather than running the kids to school when it's raining, they have to accept they'll still be cycling if there is no car at hand. The club was able to acquire electric cars to expand its services following a grant award. Despite being located in the middle of Wales it has not proved a problem for people to get around and recharge, Andrew said, pointing toan initiative by Powys council,externalto install public fast electric charging points as a help. People start off taking shorter local trips but then ""after a short while they get more adventurous"". He added: ""With a new car you're talking about a range officially of 246 miles so we've actually found that people get less preoccupied with range anxiety."" Back in Cardiff, Caro Wild, the council's cabinet member for transport, is hoping an expanded car club could help transform a city which, like so many others, was simply not built for the volume of traffic it now hosts. ""It just hits a crisis point when there's too many cars trying to move around, too many cars trying to park places,"" he said. As well as causing congestion and pollution, cars take up ""such a huge amount of space"". ""Surely there's something better that we can do with all that space? Far better for the environment, for people's health, for people's happiness, for housing."" The council provides dedicated spaces for the car club The council has looked at different models, including an app-based model for wider transport, ""roaming"" cars that can be collected in one location and left in another, in a similar way to the existing bike scheme in the city. Peer-to-peer sharing is another possibility, where people living on a street get together locally to have a car for all residents to use. Enterprise car club outside Wales Millennium Centre While the councillor cannot name a figure for how many cars the council would like removed, Cardiff's 10-year strategy is to see the number of car journeys halved. ""You look down a small urban street in Cardiff or elsewhere with maybe 100 cars parked on it and they're used 5% of the time,"" he said. ""Imagine if we could halve that number, the amount of space that would provide, what good that would be doing for the environment and how that would decrease the number of journeys as people start looking at different ways of getting around."" He hopes the scheme would be particularly attractive to those in multi-car households as a means of cutting overall car numbers. ""There's a massive amount of savings there for people. Some of the analysis we saw is a car on average costs Â£3,500 per year - that's a huge amount off a family or individual's budget,"" he said. In terms of numbers, he thinks a truly workable scheme would mean hundreds of cars dotted around the city, possibly 500 or more. There are 1,598 car club vehicles across the whole of England and Wales, excluding London, which has 3,887, according to CoMoUK, so anything on that scale would make Cardiff a significant player in the car club world. Other things the council would consider to help boost the scheme could see free parking offered to club car users,""mobility credits""for people who gave up a car, or encouraging businesses to use the car club instead of their own pool cars. As Caro Wild puts it: ""We'll need to make it better than owning your own car otherwise why would people bother using it?""

"The car club is being used by someone..... You take your mobile phone out, walk up to a car, press your screen and the door opens. Yes, yes, it's 2021, we know phones can do magic, right? But here's the catch: It's not your car. The wonders of modern technology have meant that for those wanting to opt out of car ownership but still have access to a vehicle when necessary, joining a car club might just be the answer. With coronavirus ending commuting for some and home deliveries booming, that car which once racked up hundreds of miles a week is doing next to nothing - so do you still need it? Wheels in motion for electric car-sharing club Hundreds apply for car-exchange scheme How much public transport could Â£114m buy? Essentially, car clubs offer vehicles to members which they can rent by time periods as short as an hour and collect from parking spaces in their locality without having to travel to a central base. They might be run by a UK-wide operator or by a community-focused group. ....unlike all these private cars, lining city streets There are car club schemes running across most major cities in Britain, including Cardiff, which has 21 vehicles available to members. Nearly 635,000 people belong to a club in Wales, England and Scotland, with more than 6,000 cars available. Research by transport charity CoMoUK found for every car club vehicle, 18 private cars are removed from the road, and 25% of club members sell a car once they join up. Call for help to shape 'future of Cardiff' Key city centre street set to reopen to cars Cardiff's club has run for over a decade, initially as a council-backed scheme run by City Car Club before being taken over by vehicle hire company Enterprise in 2015, and continued on a commercial basis with no affiliation to the council. However, the council is now hoping to expand shared car usage and have more integration with public transport, and is exploring a concept known as Mobility as a Service (Maas), where multiple transport options including buses, shared cars, rental bikes and scooters are bundled into one linked service. The car club scheme is going out to tender, with the preferred bidder required to demonstrate how it would increase capacity and usage, as well as meeting minimum standards on emissions. Dan Gursel, Enterprise's UK head of car club operations, said for many of their customers it was not so much about going completely car-free, but giving them an option not to have a second car that makes the car club attractive. He said: ""As part of the pandemic, we're definitely seeing people's choices changing as a result."" People were seeing their cars, especially second cars ""sitting on the driveway"" and looking at them as expensive assets while wondering: ""Do we need that or are there alternatives?"" He admitted he was surprised to see that despite lockdowns, membership rose by 30% as coronavirus turned society upside down. But it's not just about those with the means to afford to run a second car. Some 20% of their members don't have access to any car and part of their aim is to offer services in areas that have low car ownership. Climate crisis awareness is a key motivator for some. With the UK just weeks away from hosting theCOP26climate summit in Glasgow, the need to reduce fossil fuel usage in our lives is taking centre stage. Offering low-emission vehicles is part of car clubs' strategy, with pure electric vehicles and hybrids making up a larger share of the fleet compared to the average private ownership model.

"England's city regions are set to receive billions of pounds to improve public transport in next week's Budget. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will commit Â£6.9bn towards train, tram, bus and cycle projects when he sets out his spending plans on Wednesday. Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire are among the regions that will benefit. The funding was welcomed by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham as ""an important first step"". Earlier this month,he launched a bid for Â£1bn to create a London-style transport networkfor the region. Areas set to receive funding include: Greater Manchester(Â£1.07bn): For next generation Metrolink tram-train vehicles; new bus corridors at Bury and Ashton-under-Lyne West Midlands(Â£1.05bn): For projects including Metro extension, including the completion of the Wednesbury to Brierley Hill extension West Yorkshire(Â£830m): Extending the West Bradford-Cycle Superhighway and installing electric vehicle charging stations in Kirklees neighbourhoods Liverpool City region(Â£710m): For new and renovated stations in Liverpool and Runcorn as well as an interchange project at St Helens South Yorkshire(Â£570m): Starting a Supertram renewal project and installing a ""Dutch-style"" roundabout in Barnsley town centre West of England(Â£540m): A fully prioritised bus route between Bristol and Bath Tees Valley(Â£310m): Upgrading Darlington and Middlesbrough train stations, and improving rail links in the region Mr Sunak said: ""There is no reason why somebody working in the North and Midlands should have to wait several times longer for their bus or train to arrive in the morning compared to a commuter in the capital. ""This transport revolution will help redress that imbalance as we modernise our local transport networks so they are fit for our great cities and those people who live and work in them."" Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding through the Barnett formula - a mechanism the UK government uses to allocate additional money to the devolved nations when it spends more in England. Six things that could affect you in the Budget A simple guide to Budget 2021 How is levelling up going down in Yorkshire? The Â£5.7bn is a five-year settlement, and has been increased from the initial Â£4.2bn proposed, the Treasury said. The Â£1.2bn of funding to make bus services cheaper and more frequent is part of Â£3bn thatPrime Minister Boris Johnson committed to spending on a ""bus revolution""in March. Labour's Andy Burnham said the cash was ""an important first step towards a London-style public transport system for Greater Manchester"". But he added: ""As welcome as it is, infrastructure investment alone will not make levelling up feel real to the people of Greater Manchester. ""That will only happen when the frequency and coverage of bus services are increased and fares are lowered to London levels,"" Mr Burnham added. Andy Street, Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, said he was ""absolutely delighted"" to get the funding, which he said was the largest single transport sum the area had ever received. ""From more metro lines and train stations, to new bus routes and electric vehicle charging points, this cash will help us to continue to build a clean, green transport network that connects communities and tackles the climate emergency."" Silviya Barrett, head of policy and research at the Campaign for Better Transport, welcomed the increased funding for trams, trains and ""active travel"" but wanted the government to end the process of regions competing for bus funding. ""We are concerned that the competitive funding process for buses could mean that investment does not reach everywhere that needs it. ""Many areas have bus fares that are too high and gaping holes in services, so they need funding to put their bus service improvement plans in place,"" Ms Barrett said. The Confederation of Passenger Transport, which represents the bus and coach industry, said the fact the full Â£3bn the government had committed to spending on buses had not yet been reached meant the government's ""rhetoric is unfortunately not being matched by reality"". More money will go to the West Midlands Metro It comes as a new survey shows reliance on cars has reached a 15-year high despite fewer people commuting during the pandemic. More than four in five (82%) of 2,652 UK motorists surveyed by the RAC motoring organisation said they would struggle without a car. That is up from 79% in 2020 and 74% the previous year. More than half said that there were no feasible public transport services in their area. And people living in cities who have to drive are spending more time at the wheel, according to research from the Centre for Cities, which found motorists in Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester spend more than 50 hours a year stuck in traffic. Drivers in rural areas were also more likely to be car-dependent (87%) than their urban counterparts (77%).
