"Labour's Keith Vaz, who was suspended from the Commons after he was found to have ""expressed willingness"" to purchase cocaine for others, will not be standing for re-election. Mr Vaz, who has been MP for Leicester East for 32 years, said in a statement he was retiring from Parliament. He said it had been ""an honour and a privilege"" to serve his constituency. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he had ""made a substantial and significant contribution to public life"". Mr Vaz was suspended for six months after ascathing report,externalby the Commons standards commission, which found he ""disregarded"" the law by ""expressing a willingness"" to help buy cocaine for male prostitutes. Which MPs are standing down at the election? Labour bans four candidates from standing Vaz suspended from Commons for six months He had been re-selected as Labour's candidate in Leicester East a few weeks before the publication of the standards report. If he had been re-elected in 12 December's general election he could have taken up his seat, with the suspension requiring a new vote in the next Parliament. Labour's ruling National Executive Committee failed to reach a decision on Mr Vaz's future last week - but he has faced calls from Labour allies to stand down. Labour must now choose a new candidate in the constituency before Thursday's deadline. The standards committee said in its report that there was ""compelling evidence"" Mr Vaz offered to pay for a class A drug and had paid-for sex in August 2016. The revelations, first reported by the Sunday Mirror, led to him standing down as chairman of the Home Affairs committee - which at the time was conducting an inquiry into drug policy. Mr Vaz, a former Europe minister, rejected the standards committee's claim that he had been ""evasive or unhelpful"" during the investigation into his conduct. A statement on his website said he was admitted to hospital on the day the committee's report was published. It said he had been receiving treatment for a ""serious mental health condition"" since details of the encounter were published in 2016. In a statement, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Keith Vaz was among the pioneering group of black and Asian Labour MPs elected in 1987. I was proud to support his selection and incredibly proud when he won, taking the seat from the Tories. ""Keith has made a substantial and significant contribution to public life, both as a constituency MP for the people of Leicester and for the Asian community across the country. He has helped to pave the way for more BAME people to become involved in politics."" The Labour leader said Mr Vaz's work in Parliament had been ""exemplary"". Mr Vaz said in a statement: ""I have decided to retire after completing 32 years as the Member of Parliament for Leicester East. ""In that time I have won eight general elections. It has been an honour and a privilege to serve my constituency since I came to the city in 1985. ""I want to thank the people of Leicester East for their absolute loyalty and support.""

"Chinese firm Jingye says will invest Â£1.2bn in British Steel as it signed a deal to rescue the UK steelmaker. It also said it would seek to ""preserve thousands of jobs in a key foundation industry for the UK"" but did not put a number on how many would be saved. British Steel employs about 4,000 people in Scunthorpe and Teesside. It has been kept running by the government via the Official Receiver since May, when the company went into liquidation. Jingye said it anticipated making job offers ""to as many employees across the business as possible"". Group chairman Li Ganpo said it would spend Â£1.2bn over the next decade in upgrading plant and machinery, ""improving the company's environmental performance... and boosting energy efficiency to place the operations on a more competitive and sustainable footing"". It also said it would aim to identify new markets and products. Business Minister Andrea Leadsom said she had met with Jingye's chairman on Monday. ""I have been given reassurances that next to all current staff will be kept and that in the medium to longer term they are likely to want to expand the workforce"" she said. The deal will give the Chinese company control of a third of the UK's steel industry. But Ms Leadsom said: ""There aren't any national security issues with this acquisition. ""In my dealings with Jingye, I think they will show themselves to be very committed to continued and expanded production [here] in Scunthorpe and on Teesside."" Jingye will acquire the steelworks at Scunthorpe, UK steel mills and shares of FN Steel BV, British Steel France Rail SAS and TSP Engineering.  The sale also includes the shares owned by BSL in Redcar Bulk Terminal. A statement from the Official Receiver said: ""Completion of the contract is conditional on a number of matters, including gaining the necessary regulatory approvals. The parties are working together to conclude a sale as soon as reasonably practicable. ""The business will continue to trade as normal during the period between exchange and completion. Support from employees, suppliers and customers since the liquidation has been a critical factor in achieving this outcome."" One worker at British Steel in Scunthorpe told the BBC: ""It has been a big concern, nobody knew what was happening... whether they had a job, could pay the mortgages, feed the families. It is great news."" Gareth Stace, director general of industry lobby group UK Steel, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the business being bought was a ""significant asset to our country"". He said that there was a need for ""very significant investment"" in the Scunthorpe works and that was why the deal with Jingye was ""really welcome"". This video can not be played British Steel is Scunthorpe's biggest employer British Steel had previously been in rescue talks with Ataer, a subsidiary of Turkey's state military retirement scheme Oyak. Ataer said its own talks failed ""mainly due to lack of support from the key stakeholders"". What does a steel maker from Hebei province, south-west of Beijing, see in a struggling plant in Scunthorpe?  It is difficult to know, particularly when we know so little about Jingye. There is little publicly available information - certainly no set of accounts - but the organisation's Facebook page extols its rapid rise to become a big player in steel in just 20 years. On the face of it, the Chinese buyer will be interested in the products that British Steel makes that it does not. British Steel is a specialist in railway tracks, ""long  products"", a catch-all term for girders used in construction, and the high-quality steel wire used in car tyres and dozens of other industrial applications. Jingye does not appear to make the first two, so British Steel should bring it some valuable technology and new product lines. This has to be set against the need for investment at Scunthorpe. What British Steel workers will fervently hope is that the Jingye commitment is long-term and that this is not another false dawn. Mr Stace said he believed the steel industry in the UK could now compete globally and he was publishing a manifesto with ideas for change. ""But the problem we have is we have an uncompetitive business landscape in the UK. Government can change that,"" he added. ""I'm talking about energy costs, business rates, procurement - the government buying more steel from the UK - free and fair trade, and even much more support for R&D [research and development], which we are going to lose when we fall out of the EU."" He said: ""What government needs to do is give us that business landscape. We can thrive on the global market and generate highly paid, highly skilled jobs for the UK economy."" In the long term, it is believed that while Jingye Group has promised to increase production, it has also warned costs may need to be cut. Ross Murdoch, national officer for the GMB union, said: ""We were impressed with the passion and enthusiasm from the Jingye team. ""However, due diligence on this sale was completed very quickly and the devil will be in the detail."" British Steel: 'We fear for our town's future' Chinese group 'is favourite to buy British Steel' Community, a UK trade union which absorbed the old Iron & Steel Trades Confederation body, said it welcomed ""this positive step towards securing British Steel under new ownership"". ""The fact that there has been ongoing interest from both Ataer and now Jingye rightly demonstrates that potential buyers believe that British Steel can have a sustainable future."" The UK industry has been struggling for a number of years amid claims that China has been flooding the market with cheap steel. In 2016 the EU imposed tariffs of up to 73.7% on Chinese steel after an influx of cheap imports from Asia forced European manufacturers to cut jobs and lower prices. Jingye has 23,500 employees and as well as its main steel and iron making businesses, italso engages in tourism, hotels and real estate.,external It has total registered assets of 39bn yuan (Â£4.4bn). According to its website, Jingye Group ranked 217th among the top 500 enterprises in China in 2019. The firm sells its products nationwide and exports them to more than 80 countries and regions. Jingye's products have been used in major projects such as Beijing Daxing International Airport and the underground system in Shijiazhuang.

"If you fancy your chances as a politician, you have now sadly missed the deadline to register as a candidate in this general election. But here are the rules on who can stand and who decides which candidates voters choose from. People who want to become a Member of Parliament (MP) are known as a parliamentary candidate, or a prospective parliamentary candidate. They are usually chosen by a political party - groups of people with similar beliefs who come together to try to win power. A small number of candidates do not represent a party but stand alone as independents. The candidates compete against one another for votes in one of the UK's 650 voting areas, or constituencies. Whoever wins the most votes in a particular constituency is elected as an MP. Almost anyone can put themselves forward as an MP, which can lead to a crowded field. In one poll in 2008,no fewer than 26 candidates stood,externalfor election - many of them as independents. Candidates must be at least 18 years old, a British citizen, or a qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland who is resident in the UK. Certain groups of people are not allowed to stand. For example, prisoners, members of the police and armed forces and judges are excluded. To be on the ballot paper - which voters use to make their choice - candidates must complete nomination forms. They also have to pay a Â£500 deposit, which is returned to them if they win at least 5% of the votes cast.  18Minimum age to stand as a candidate Â£500Amount of deposit required to stand 650Number of MPs in the House of Commons Â£79,468MP's current annual average pay 8.7Average length of service for MPs (in years) The names of the nominated candidates will appear on the ballot paper and they cannot decide to withdraw. However, if a candidate of one of the registered parties dies, the election in their constituency is postponed. Thislast happened in the 2010 general election,external. Your Questions Answered: Can EU citizens vote? Sir John Curtice: What voters care about most How much does a general election cost? The parties normally have plenty of time to select candidates for an election. All parties currently represented in the UK Parliament follow similar procedures. First of all, to be nominated, you have to be a party member for a certain period of time, which varies from three months to a year. Then there are application forms and assessments, with questions about life and political experiences and career. The parties then draw up centrally approved lists of candidates, which are then put to the local party members for a final decision. More than 70 MPs are stepping down at this election and it will not be possible to replace all of them using the parties' usual procedures. This is because there is so little time to make the decision on new parliamentary candidates before the election takes place. The parties' ruling bodies, composed of senior figures, are involved in making decisions about who should stand. In recent years, all major political parties have changed the way they choose their candidates, to improve the diversity of MPs. Some have introduced gender quotas, all-women shortlists, or lists of preferred candidates from minority backgrounds. Although the 2017 Parliamentwas the most diverse yet,it was still not representative of the UK population. For example, only 32% of MPs were female and just 8% were from ethnic minorities - compared with 14% of the population of England and Wales as a whole. To help you decide who to vote for here's a concise guide to where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. POLICY GUIDE: Who should I vote for?

"The Buckley family are concerned about the future of Scunthorpe ""I think it will just go downhill. It'll be left almost barren."" Julian Buckley paints a gloomy picture of his hometown of Scunthorpe if the British Steel plant closes down. Sitting around the family dining room table over a fish-and-chip supper, Julian, aged 21, tells me he hopes to come back home to live after graduating from Liverpool University. ""I actually want to work in health and safety, which the steelworks would be such a good employer for. ""But if it's not there, I'll have to look somewhere else. And that's the problem really, isn't it?"" Network Rail bids for part of British Steel Steelworks town faces 'fight for future' Julian's father Matthew has been working at British Steel's on-site power station in Scunthorpe for 19 years, but now fears losing his job. ""The last few months have been quite awful really,"" he admits, reflecting on months of rumour and fear about the future of the plant. Matthew, who is 50, has faced this situation before.  He used to work at British Steel in Stoke-on-Trent and left just before it closed in 2000. ""We started to reduce shift patterns,"" he recalls. ""You felt that the writing was on the wall, and it was only a matter of time before that closed, so we decided to take the plunge and we transferred up here."" The family settled in the pretty village of Winterton, six miles north of the town centre. But in 2016, Matthew faced another job crisis when Tata, the owners of the Scunthorpe plant, decided to sell up. ""We were at a really sticky place there,"" Matthew says. ""It took a long time to get the ball rolling and get some interest from the central government. ""We had marches in Scunthorpe and London to keep steelmaking alive and well in the town."" The campaign worked. London-based Greybull Capital moved in to save the company, but it was only a temporary reprieve. In May, they too conceded defeat andBritish Steel was forced into liquidation. Matthew's wife Joy, 48, says:  ""If the worst comes to worst, and the steelworks does actually shut, it will be devastating for so many people here. ""People will probably have to move away."" Julian reflects on the youngsters who he grew up with, who didn't go to university, but instead secured much-prized British Steel apprenticeships. ""Without the steelworks, they won't get those apprenticeships,"" he says. ""They'll either be stuck in Scunthorpe because they haven't got those skills, or they will have to look elsewhere, and you'll have this exodus of young people. ""It sounds cheesy, but they are the future of society. ""Without all those young people, what's going to happen to Scunthorpe?""

"Thousands of people have been driven from their homes Two Australian states have declared a state of emergency as bushfires bring a ""catastrophic"" threat to heavily populated areas of the nation's east. At least three people are dead and thousands have been displaced by three days of dangerous weather conditions in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland. But officials say the worst danger will come on Tuesday for areas around Sydney, the nation's largest city. More than 120 bushfires are burning across the two states. In NSW, the blazes have scorched 970,000 hectares of land and destroyed 150 houses. Nine homes have been razed in Queensland. ""Everybody has to be on alert no matter where you are and everybody has to assume the worst and we cannot allow complacency to creep in,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Monday. Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? Early Australian bushfires 'an omen for summer' Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' Have you been affected by the bushfires? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Australia's conservative government has refused to be drawn on whether climate change could have contributed to the fires, in a response that has drawn criticism. ""My only thoughts today are with those who have lost their lives and their families,"" said Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday. NSW fire authorities have issued the maximum level of warning for the first time since new fire warnings were introduced a decade ago, afterAustralia's deadly Black Saturday disaster. The ""catastrophic"" warning is in place across the greater Sydney area and regions to the city's north and south. Temperatures are expected to reach 37C by Tuesday. Conditions are predicted to be worse than on Friday, when the firestorms began tearing through eastern Australia. ""Under these conditions, these fires will spread quickly and threaten homes and lives,"" NSW Rural Fire Service said in a statement. The danger is currently less severe in Queensland, but officials there say conditions could deteriorate later in the week. This video can not be played ""Unprecedented"" bushfires turn skies orange Thousands of people in both states spent the night in evacuation centres while officials assessed whether it was safe for them to return home. On Monday, NSW followed Queensland in declaring a state of emergency - a move which grants fire officials additional powers, such as control over government agencies. Hundreds of schools will be shut down across NSW on Tuesday. Firefighters from New Zealand have been flown in to help as weary emergency crews prepare for a fresh onslaught. A man surveys the destruction on his property in Torrington, NSW Australian PM Scott Morrison (left) with Owen Whalan, a NSW resident who was evacuated Mr Morrison says the military could also be called upon to support the 1,300 firefighters working in the two states. Hundreds of civilians have also volunteered to help in affected areas. While clearing affected areas on Friday, fire crews discovered the body of one victim in a burnt-out car near Glen Innes, about 550km (340 miles) north of Sydney. He was identified by local media as George Nole. Vivian Chaplain, 69, was found suffering from severe burns in Wytaliba, a nearby town. She was rushed to hospital but died shortly afterwards. Carol Sparks, the mayor of Glen Innes, said on Sunday that the town's residents were traumatised. ""The fire was as high as 20 ft [6m] and raging with 80 km/h [50 mph] winds,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""It was absolutely horrific for the people that were impacted."" About 1,000 firefighters have been tackling the blazes across New South Wales The bushfires have left many areas shrouded in smoke On Saturday, NSW police confirmed that a third person - Julie Fletcher, 63 - had died after a body was found in a burnt-out home near Taree, a town about 300km north of Sydney. Two firefighters were injured when a tree fell onto their truck in the Nambucca Heads area of NSW, officials said. They were treated at the scene and transferred to hospital in a stable condition. Crews have fought hundreds of fires in the state since last month, when two people died while trying to protect their home. Earlier this month, a blaze burned though 2,000 hectares of bush which contained a koala sanctuary.Hundreds of the animals were feared to have died. Rains lashed NSW last week, providing relief for many farmers. But the storms were not nearly enough to end the long-running drought. Authorities in the state warn that many fires will continue to burn unless there is more rain. More than 100 fires are raging across NSW and Queensland ""We just cannot overstate the profound impact that the drought is having on fire behaviour,"" NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters on Friday. Farmers - Australia's 'unlikely' climate activists Living with the strain of a devastating drought Water-bombing aircraft are often flying long distances because of the difficulty of accessing water in dry areas. In some cases authorities have drilled bores to keep up with demand. ""We've very mindful of the scarcity of water and how precious it is, but the reality is we can't do firefighting without water,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. Australia's fire season risks growing longer and more intense due to climate change, according to scientists. This video can not be played Why Australia bushfires are now ""hotter and more intense"" Officials have confirmed that 2018 and 2017 were Australia's third and fourth-hottest years on record respectively, and last yearthe nation experienced its warmest summer on record. The Bureau of Meteorology'sState of the Climate 2018 report said climate change had led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland increased the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Even if global temperatures are contained to a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels - a limit set out in the landmark Paris accord, agreed by 188 nations in 2015 -scientists believe the country is facing a dangerous new normal.

At 11:00 GMT, a two-minute silence was held across the country. Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson broke away from the election campaign to attend the annual ceremony at the Cenotaph in London. Prince Charles laid a wreath of poppies during the service on behalf of the Queen, who was watching from a balcony. Sussexes and Cambridges attend Remembrance event Queen will not lay Remembrance wreath 'I haven't heard from my friend since 1944' - BBC News The Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex followed their father in laying wreaths. The Queen, dressed in black, stood beside the Duchess of Cambridge and Duchess of Cornwall as she viewed the commemorations. The Duchess of Sussex looked on from another balcony with the Countess of Wessex and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence. The beginning and end of the two minutes' silence were marked by the firing of a gun by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery. Up to 10,000 war veterans marched during the remembrance service at the Cenotaph Hundreds of members of the armed forces attended the commemoration The Duchess of Sussex observed the two-minute silence William and Harry followed Prince Charles in laying wreaths The commemorations at the Cenotaph honoured the armed forces community, British and Commonwealth veterans, the allies who fought alongside the UK and the civilian servicemen and women involved in the two world wars and later conflicts. Cabinet ministers, religious leaders and representatives of Commonwealth nations attended alongside more than 800 members of the armed forces. A royal aide laid a wreath on behalf of the Duke of Edinburgh, who retired from royal duties in 2017. For the first time, the ambassador of Nepal placed a wreath to honour the contribution Gurkha regiments have made to the UK's military campaigns over two centuries.

Following the service, crowds lined the streets in the winter sun to watch as up to 10,000 war veterans marched in a slow procession past the war memorial. Regiments and societies walked past the Cenotaph in groups, their pace matching the drum beat of a brass band. Some wheelchair-using veterans left their chairs behind and walked the distance instead, their medals sparkling on their lapels. World War Two veteran Ron Freer, 104, who is blind, is thought to be the oldest person to have marched at the Cenotaph this year. The Remembrance Sunday commemorations always hold ""special significance"" for him because his father was killed in 1918 and is buried at Dernancourt Communal Cemetery in the Somme, France, according to Blind Veterans UK. Ron Freer from Kent was the oldest person marching at the Cenotaph Speaking ahead of the ceremony, Mr Johnson said he would be ""proud"" to lay his first wreath at the Cenotaph as prime minister, and vowed to continue to ""champion those who serve today with such bravery in our military"". He later posted on Twitter:,external""We will remember them."" Labour leader Mr Corbyn said: ""It was an honour meeting and hearing the stories of veterans, and all those who came to pay their respects.""

"British Airways has launched a review into a money-saving practice which increases its greenhouse gas emissions. It follows a BBC investigation exposing ""fuel tankering"" by airlines - in which planes are filled with extra fuel, usually to avoid paying higher prices for refuelling at destination airports. The industry-wide practice could mean extra annual emissions equivalent to those of a large European town. BA now says that using tankering to cut costs ""may be the wrong thing to do"". However, the airline added that it also uses the practice for safety and operational reasons, including helping planes to turn around quickly. BBC Panorama has discovered the airline's planes generated an extra 18,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide last year through fuel tankering. Cost savings made on a single flight can be as small as just over Â£10 - though savings can run to hundreds of pounds. Researchers have estimated that one in five of all European airlines' flights,externalinvolves some element of fuel tankering. The practice on European routes could result in additional annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to that produced by a town of 100,000 people. Critics say the widespread use of the practice undermines the aviation industry's claims that it is committed to reducing its carbon emissions. John Sauven, Greenpeace UK's executive director, told the BBC that fuel tankering was a ""classic example of a company putting profit before planet"". Responding to BA's decision to carry out a review, Mr Sauven, said it showed how the airline industry had been treating climate change ""like a PR problem"". ""This is why we need government-enforced reduction targets to ensure airlines take responsibility for the damage their emissions are causing,"" he said. John Sauven called for rules and regulations to be ""tougher"" International Airlines Group (IAG), the company that owns BA, says it wants to be the world's leading airline group on sustainability. BA boasts it even prints its in-flight magazine on lighter paper to save weight. Yet BBC Panorama has seen dozens of internal BA documents that show up to six tonnes of extra fuel have been loaded onto planes in this way. It has also seen evidence that Easyjet carries extra fuel in this way. Airlines can save money from the fact that the price of aviation fuel differs between European destinations. BA insiders say the company - like many airlines running short haul routes in Europe - has computer software that calculates whether costs can be saved by fuel tankering. The software will calculate whether there is a cost saving to be made. If there is, crews load up the extra fuel. An example of documents seen by Panorama show that a recent BA flight to Italy carried nearly three tonnes of extra fuel. British Airways owner IAG says strikes cost Â£121m British Airways flights to Cairo cancelled The extra weight meant the plane emitted more than 600kg of additional carbon dioxide - the same emissions one person is responsible for on a return flight to New York. The cost saving on that trip was less than Â£40, but the documents Panorama has seen show that it can be even lower than that. IAG made an annual profit of â¬2.9bn (Â£2.6bn) in 2018, about 80% of which came from BA. A BA insider described the practice as ""hypocritical"". ""For such a big company to be trying to save such small amounts while emitting so much extra CO2 seems unjustifiable in the current climate,"" he said. In response to the claims, the chief executive of BA's parent company, IAG, announced the airline would carry out a review of the practice. On Friday, Willie Walsh told investors that the airline wanted to ensure it was not ""incentivising the wrong behaviour"" from managers. ""Because clearly the financial saving would have incentivised us to do fuel tankering,"" he said. ""But maybe... this the wrong thing to do and the wrong thing to incentive. So we want to make sure we have our incentives aligned to the right activities so ensure financial sustainability but also environmental sustainability."" This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly BA said it was common practice for the airline industry to carry additional fuel on some flights. The airline said for BA this applies mainly to short-haul destinations ""where there are considerable price differences between European airports"". It said the additional emissions from the airline represented approximately 2% of the total extra emissions generated by all airlines tankering fuel in Europe, based on research by Eurocontrol. BA pointed out that since 2012 all flights within Europe had been covered by the EU Emissions Trading System. It added that from 2020 the company would offset all CO2 emissions from its UK domestic flights. Easyjet said it had reduced the level of tankering in recent years and that it only took place on a tiny proportion of flights for operational and commercial reasons. Eurocontrol, the body which coordinates air traffic control for Europe, has calculated that tankering in Europe resulted in 286,000 tonnes of extra fuel being burnt every year, and the emission of an additional 901,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. It calculates that the practice saved airlines a total of â¬265m (Â£228m) a year. Eurocontrol described the practice as ""questionable"" at a time when aviation is being challenged for its contribution to climate change.

"This video can not be played Watch Evo Morales announce his resignation Bolivian President Evo Morales has resigned after nearly 14 years in power, amid turmoil following his disputed re-election last month. The head of the army had called on him to go after protests over his election win. Auditors found irregularities with the poll but Mr Morales said he had been the victim of a coup. He said he was leaving to help protect families of political allies, after their homes were burned down. In a televised address, Mr Morales urged protesters to ""stop attacking the brothers and sisters, stop burning and attacking"". Evo Morales' turbulent run Country profile The biggest criticism of Evo Morales was his lack of respect for Bolivia's democracy - accused of overstaying his welcome and refusing to step down. But the fact that the military has called the shots on the president standing down does not do much for Bolivia's democracy either. Now Evo Morales has gone, there is a power vacuum. Increasing numbers of his Mas party are resigning, and it feels like there is a need for retribution - for Evo Morales and his people to pay the price for the mistakes they made while in power. His supporters have called this a coup - his detractors the end of tyranny. The priority now is to choose an interim leader, call new elections and bring a polarised Bolivia together or face yet more unrest and violence in the coming weeks. Vice-President Alvaro GarcÃ­a and Senate President Adriana Salvatierra also resigned. Protesters took to the streets to celebrate, chanting ""yes we could"" and setting off fire crackers. Bolivia has been rattled by weeks of anti-government protests, following the reports of election fraud. Tensions first flared on the night of the presidential election after the results count was inexplicably stopped for 24 hours. The final result gave Mr Morales slightly more than the 10-percentage-point lead he needed to win outright in the first round of the race. At least three people died during clashes that followed. Some uniformed police officers also joined the protesters. On Sunday, the Organization of American States, which monitored the elections, said it had found evidence of wide-scale data manipulation, and could not certify the result of the previous polls. This video can not be played Watch how police took part in Bolivia's anti-government protests on Saturday Pressure continued to build on Mr Morales during the day, as several of his political allies resigned, some citing fears for the safety of their families. The army chief, Gen Williams Kaliman, urged Mr Morales to resign ""to allow for pacification and the maintaining of stability"". The military also said it would conduct operations to ""neutralise"" any armed groups that attacked the protesters. Opposition leader Carlos Mesa - who came second in last month's poll - thanked protesters for ""the heroism of peaceful resistance"". In a tweet, he described the development as ""the end of tyranny"" and a ""historical lesson"", saying, ""Long live Bolivia!"" Protesters chanted ""yes we could"" and ""Bolivia"" as they celebrated the resignation However, the Cuban and Venezuelan leaders - who had previously voiced their support for Mr Morales - condemned the events as a ""coup"". Cuban President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel described it as a ""violent and cowardly"" attempt against democracy, while Venezuelan leader NicolÃ¡s Maduro said tweeted: ""We categorically condemn the coup realised against our brother president."" Mexico says it is considering granting asylum to Mr Morales. Bolivia's first indigenous president, he had served as leader since 2006. He ran for a fourth consecutive term in the October elections after a controversial decision by the constitutional court to scrap presidential term limits. In a 2016 referendum, a majority had voted ""no"" to dropping the limit of term numbers that Bolivians could serve. However, Mr Morales' party took the issue to the constitutional court, which abolished the term limits altogether.

"Socialist leader Pedro SÃ¡nchez hails victory, despite again failing to win a majority government Spain's governing Socialists (PSOE) won the most seats in Sunday's election, but fell short of a majority - and right-wing parties made major gains. The conservative Popular Party (PP) came in second, and far-right Vox more than doubled its seats to become the country's third most-powerful party. This is Spain's fourth general election in as many years. A previous vote in April ended with no clear majority, and the Socialists failed to form a coalition government. How the far-right Vox party found its footing This time, the Socialist party won 120 of the 350 seats - three fewer than in April's vote. The PP has 88 seats, up from 66 in the previous poll, while Vox has 52 - up from just 24 in April. One of the main issues in Sunday's vote was the increasing tensions with Catalonia, Spain's semi-autonomous north-eastern region whose failed bid for independence in 2017 sparked the country's biggest political crisis for 40 years. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Protesters block the AP-7 motorway at the Spanish-French border in northern Spain On Monday, hundreds of Catalan separatist demonstrators blocked traffic in both directions on the AP-7 motorway connecting Spain with France in a protest against the jailing of separatist leaders from Spain's Catalonia region last month. Addressing Socialist supporters after the results came in, acting Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said it was his priority to ""form a stable government and do politics for the benefit of the majority of Spaniards"". Who's who in race to run Spain ""I would like to make a call to all the political parties because they need to act with generosity and responsibility in order to unblock the political situation in Spain,"" he added. After failing to form a government, Mr SÃ¡nchez had hoped that calling another election would strengthen his party's hand - but Pablo Iglesias, leader of left-wing Podemos, warned that it had only reinforced the far right. Pablo Iglesias warned that this election had only strengthened right wing and far-right parties ""Once again we extend a hand to the Socialist party and Pedro SÃ¡nchez,"" he said, adding that he was ready to start talks with the party as soon as Monday. Podemos is the Socialist party's natural political ally. However, a coalition between the two would still fall short of the 176 seats needed for a majority. Meanwhile the centre-right party Ciudadanos - or Citizens - haemorrhaged support, winning only 10 seats this month compared to 57 in April. Ciudadanos was also overtaken by ERC-Sobiranistes, an electoral coalition of pro-Catalan separatist parties. Albert Rivera, leader of Ciudadanos, said: ""Spaniards have wanted more SÃ¡nchez for this legislature, but Spaniards have also wanted more Vox and less of the political centre."" Vox is thought to have benefited at the ballot box from the Catalan crisis, and strong anti-separatist sentiment in other regions of Spain. ""Today a patriotic alternative and a social alternative has been consolidated in Spain that demands national unity and the restoration of constitutional order in Catalonia,"" Vox leader Santiago Abascal told crowds after the election. Guy Hedgecoe, Madrid Although Pedro SÃ¡nchez's Socialists have emerged as winners having suffered only slight losses in this election, the overall result is not a positive one for the acting prime minister. With Podemos having lost some ground and MÃ¡s PaÃ­s securing only a handful of seats, there is no clear left-wing majority. The Socialists' arch-rivals on the right, the PP, has recovered many of the seats it lost in April's ballot. If the country's longstanding political stalemate is to be broken, Mr SÃ¡nchez might have to seek the support of the PP, or else a third election in the space of one year could beckon. Meanwhile, the huge surge by Vox means it will now find it easier to set the agenda on the right. That is likely to hinder any attempts by Mr SÃ¡nchez to seek a conciliatory solution to the Catalan crisis. The April election ended in deadlock, with parties failing to form a coalition by a September deadline, thus forcing Sunday's election. To form a coalition now, they would need to form alliances with smaller, nationalist parties, analysts suggest. Meanwhile, the PP and Vox could seek to make the most of their gains. One PP politician said Prime Minister SÃ¡nchez should ""start to think about going"", given the early results. The huge surge in seats for Vox will be one of the biggest talking points of the night. This video can not be played Who are Spain's far-right party? Spain had appeared immune to a wave of far-right populism spreading across the continent in the past decade, with many remembering the military dictatorship ofÂ GenÂ Francisco Franco. But now Vox has established itself as a major force in Spanish politics. France's far-right party leader Marine Le Pen took to Twitter to congratulate Vox's ""staggering progress"".Italian populist Matteo Salvini also spoke of his pleasure at seeing Vox's success. ""Not at all racism and fascism, in Italy as in Spain we just want to live peacefully in our own home,"" he tweeted.Â How Spain's far-right Vox party found its footing Catalan crisis in 300 words LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid: ""Over 50% of the costings are from Labour's own figures"" A spending row has broken out after the Conservative Party published what it claims would be the cost of a Labour government over five years. The report, compiled by the party and not the Treasury, is based on a number of commitments from Labour's annual party conference but not its manifesto. Chancellor Sajid Javid said Labour's proposals would leave the UK ""on the brink of bankruptcy"". But shadow chancellor John McDonnell condemned the report as ""fake news"". The Conservatives claim that Labour's policies would cost Â£1.2tn over the course of the next five years, if the party wins next month's general election. The figure is based on costing Labour's 2017 manifesto and other pledges it has made since then. But the Labour Party has yet to publish its 2019 election manifesto, detailing its policies and spending proposals. Senior Labour figures will meet next weekend to decide which policies passed by the party's annual conference will become manifesto proposals for government, with some unlikely to be confirmed. Labour's shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said the manifesto would be ""fully costed"" when it is published. Labour and Tories pledge more borrowing A really simple guide to the election,external The clock is ticking: How to register to vote Pienaar: Trust is the burning issue at this election What's the price tag on an election? Challenged on the assessment by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Javid stood by the figures. He told the programme: ""This is the true cost of Corbyn's Labour. These are the numbers that John McDonnell did not want you to see."" The chancellor added: ""Of course [Labour] aren't going to welcome these numbers. They don't want to see this kind of transparency. ""These are eye-watering levels of spendingâ¦ it will be absolutely reckless and will leave this country with an economic crisis within months."" But asked about the Conservatives' own spending pledges - and how they would be funded - Mr Javid only said the party would ""set out our plans during the course of the election campaign"". ""Our plans are properly costed and it will be clear how we will be funding that,"" he added. Earlier, business minister Kwasi Kwarteng was pushed for the Conservatives' spending plans by Sky News' Sophy Ridge programme, but he said he was ""not going to bandy around figures"".

Mr McDonnell branded the Conservative report a ""ludicrous piece of Tory fake news"" and an ""incompetent mish-mash of debunked estimates and bad maths, cooked up because they know Labour's plans for real change are popular"". And Mr Gwynne told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the Conservative claims about Labour spending were ""an absolute work of fiction"". The shadow minister said his party's proposals would be ""open and transparent"" on costings, and called on the Tories to do the same with their manifesto. This video can not be played Andrew Gwynne: ""This is an absolute work of fiction by the Conservatives"" Neither the Conservatives nor Labour have confirmed a date for when their manifestos will be published. But the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, has called for both parties to submit their manifestos to the Office for Budget Responsibility to be independently costed. ""The cash commitments that are being thrown around by the two old parties need to be subject to proper scrutiny,"" he said. ""Manifestos need to be independently assessed and costed by the Office for Budget Responsibility so that the public can be confident that flagship policies can be delivered."" Mr Davey said the Lib Dems were ""more than prepared"" to do the same with their own manifesto when it is published. There are problems with the Conservative Party's approach. As Labour has not yet published its election manifesto, previous pledges may well be dropped, while new ones could still be added. That makes the job of accurately costing election pledges, at this stage of the campaign, impossible. Just because certain policy positions passed at the Labour conference, there is no guarantee they will be adopted in the upcoming manifesto. There is also an issue with some of the costing. For example, the Conservatives cost Labour's renationalisation plans at Â£196bn. This is based on a Confederation of British Industry estimate, whichwas itself the subject of criticism,external. But it is certainly true that Labour wants to spend a lot more - something it has been upfront about. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says he wants to more than double UK investment spending to an extra Â£55bn a year. However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has called into question where such an immediate increase in investment spending could be achieved. Read more from Reality Check on Labour's economic plans here. This video can not be played John McDonnell: Â£150bn fund for ""human emergency created by Tories"" The publication of the Conservative document comes after civil service head Sir Mark Sedwillblocked a Tory plan to use civil servants to cost the Labour Party's fiscal plans in a separate report. Sir Mark's decision came after Mr McDonnell complained vociferously to Treasury Permanent Secretary Tom Scholar. Speaking about Labour's plans in Liverpool on Thursday, Mr McDonnell promised""investment on a scale never seen before""to overhaul infrastructure in all areas of the UK. The shadow chancellor said he wanted to transfer power and money out of the south-east of England - and will fund his plans through borrowing. He said his party would introduce new fiscal rules, meaning ""borrowing for investment"" would not be included in borrowing targets. Labour'seconomic planincludes doubling ""investment"" spending, a Â£150bn ""social transformation fund"", and a Â£250bn ""green transformation fund"". The Tories have also vowed to borrow to fund more spending, rewriting their current financial rules. This document is political rather than financial. The Conservatives' aim is to frame Labour's plans not as ambitious, but as unaffordable. But the dossier assumes that all Labour's policies are firm commitments, and it does not examine Labour's revenue raising measures. John McDonnell has made no secret that Labour intends to borrow more than the Tories to invest - his political argument is that this would both grow the economy more rapidly and increase the state's assets - not just its liabilities. So, in the end, the calculation voters are likely to make is about who they trust more to run the economy. Do you have any questions about the general election?

"There's nothing new about politicians trying to please the crowd, or people lacking faith in politicians. Back in 1834, when Westminster caught fire,a large crowd turned out to cheer,externalon the fire. What's new now is the scale of the promises, the polling evidence that public trust in politicians is as low as its been in modern times, and the clear signs that voters' loyalty to political parties is looser than we've seen before. That's arguably driving parties to make increasingly extravagant promises. We are seeing the biggest spending plans from the Tories since before the financial crash. And the biggest borrowing plan by Labour since the 1970s. So a big factor in deciding this election will probably be who's trusted least? Labour and Tories row about spending plans The mystery of the Russia report And it's not just about the economy. There's growing suspicion around the government's seeming slow progress in publishing a report by the Commons Intelligence Committee on Russian influence. There've been reports today that it discusses, among other things, political donations by named wealthy Russians to the Tory Party. It's not suggested the donations were illegal. Donations from people registered to vote in the UK are perfectly lawful. But there's a long-running question about whether it's possible to buy political influence. There's also controversy surrounding Russian investment in the UK, and of course, interference in UK elections. We don't know the MPs' verdict. We haven't seen it. And that's the problem. A high-ranking former MI6 official I spoke to today said the controversy itself was destabilising and that alone amounted to a win for President Putin.

"Greetings card chain Clintons is considering shop closures and rent cuts as part of a survival plan. The retailer, which has about 2,500 staff, is in restructuring talks with landlords in another sign of the High Street crisis. A spokeswoman told the BBC no decisions have yet been made. Clintons was responding to reports on Sunday that it wanted to close 66 out of 332 shops, with landlords slashing rents on most of the other stores. The restructuring would involve a controversial scheme known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process that allows companies to continue trading while pushing through closures and rent cuts. A Clintons spokeswoman said ""discussions are continuing with our landlords but no decisions have been made"". But she declined to comment on aSunday Telegraph report,externalthat the company told landlords 90 of its shops were loss-making and that sales were expected to continue to decline. One landlord told the BBC that although there was a meeting with Clintons last week, very few details of the restructuring plan were given. More talks are expected this week. The Sunday Times,externalsaid landlords would have until 20 December to air their objections to a CVA. However, landlords have taken an increasingly tough stance on the growing use of CVAs and are more prepared to fight demands for rent cuts. What has gone wrong at Mothercare? BonmarchÃ© appoints administrators Jessops owner plans to call in administrators The retailer, formed in 1968, is owned by the Weiss family, which previously controlled the American Greetings retail chain in the US. Clintons, previously known as Clinton Cards, had appointed advisers from consultancy KPMG to explore a potential sale, but it is thought no acceptable offers were received. News of Clintons' restructuring comes days after baby goods retailer Mothercare announced its UK operation was going into administration, putting 2,500 jobs at risk. Mothercare is part of a long list of High Street names to go under, including Maplin and Poundworld. Others, including Homebase, Debenhams and Carpetright, have been forced into restructuring. A string of restaurant chains have also closed amid a squeeze on consumer spending. Retail experts expect more pain, however, as firms approach the make-or-break Christmas trading period.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The parents of Harry Dunn have been told by the UK government their claims of abuse of power by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab are ""without foundation"". The 19-year-old died in hospital after a crash in Northamptonshire in August. US suspect Anne Sacoolas left the UK claiming diplomatic immunity. The teenager's parents allege the granting of immunity by Mr Raab was ""wrong in law"". The Foreign Office (FCO) has written to the family rejecting the allegations. It told the BBC it had sent a letter - seen by the BBC -  to Mr Dunn's parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, but would not comment on its content. It expressed its ""deepest sympathy"" to the family. Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn have met US president Donald Trump at the White House about the crash In the letter, the FCO said it would ""seek costs"" for any judicial review brought and argues the family has not found ""any reasonably arguable ground of legal challenge"". It said the allegation that the foreign secretary had ""misused and/or abused his power"" was ""entirely without foundation"". Mr Dunn's motorbike crashed with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas, the 42-year-old wife of US intelligence officer Jonathan Sacoolas, outside RAF Croughton, near Brackley, on 27 August. Northamptonshire Police hashanded a file to the Crown Prosecution Serviceafter interviewing Mrs Sacoolas in the US. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Family spokesman Radd Seiger said: ""The FCO relies on two private agreements between the USA and UK dated in 1995 and 2001 to assert that Anne Sacoolas did have diplomatic immunity."" He added the family had taken legal advice and its ""position is clear that these arrangements have no basis in law"". He continued: ""As if it were not enough for the family to have to endure the loss of Harry, the British government now appear[s] intent on putting them through a needless and protracted legal battle culminating in court. So be it. They will not rest until justice is done. But shame on the government.""

"Rescuers used boats to reach people trapped in Rotherham Almost 50 flood warnings are in place across England after days of persistent rain. Five severe warnings - deemed a threat to life - remain on South Yorkshire's River Don, with flooding in that area likely to continue until Wednesday. Towns and cities across Yorkshire and the Midlands have faced disruption and in some cases emergency evacuations. Former High Sherriff of DerbyshireAnnie Hall was swept to her deathby the flooded River Derwent near Matlock. In addition to the severe warnings,the Environment Agency earlier issued a further 43 warnings,external- meaning flooding is expected - and 103 alerts. It said water levels were still very high on stretches of the River Don and expected flooding in that area until midweek. A military helicopter would be used on Sunday evening to drop sandbags at Bentley Ings by the river. A flooded field 100 metres from the River Don on the outskirts of Kirk Bramwith in South Yorkshire Roads to Fishlake have been closed, cutting off the South Yorkshire village On Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who visited flood-hit Derbyshire on Friday, said he was ""in awe of the community's spirit and resilience in the face of this awful ongoing event"". He said he was receiving regular briefings on the situation and added the government's emergency Bellwin scheme had been activated to reimburse eligible councils for certain costs they incur. Boris Johnson visited Matlock on Friday where he met emergency workers A military helicopter has been delivering sandbags to flood-hit Doncaster Doncaster Council reiterated its call to evacuate Fishlake and has set up a rest centre in nearby Stainforth ""for as long as is needed"". According to the Salvation Army, some people had been rescued from their homes by boat since the early hours of Saturday morning but others remained in their properties. Damian Allen, chief executive of Doncaster Council, said: ""We are concerned over reports that some residents remain in the Fishlake area. ""South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue crews are on hand to evacuate any Fishlake residents who may be stuck in their homes, and we would urge everybody to take advantage of this. ""The council are unable to offer on-the-ground support to residents who are in severe flood warning areas, based on advice from the Environment Agency."" The authority said it expected it would be ""at least 48 hours until you can return to your homes, if not longer"" and was told by the Environment Agency that flood waters in the village would ""not start to go down for at least the next 24 hours"".

Helen Batt, from the agency, said 4,000 properties had been protected by flood defences in the village, but added 300 had been flooded, with more than 1,200 evacuated. BBC reporter Richard Cadey said some roads around Fishlake had been closed and the village was ""effectively cut off because of flooding"". Many parts of the area remain under 3ft (1m) of water and only tractors are able to get in by some roads. He said people on the ground had told him 90% of the homes there had been flooded. Pam Webb, who owns a spa in Fishlake, said: ""We've got blue skies, it looks picturesque until you actually get in to the village and you see the devastation that's been caused to homes and businesses. ""Devastating is an easy word to use but it's completely devastating and it's heartbreaking."" Pam Webb's business in Fishlake is among the many that have been flooded in the village Many parts of Fishlake remain under 3ft (1m) of water By Richard Cadey, BBC Radio Sheffield reporter Trying to get to Fishlake seemed like an impossible task. The village has suffered severe flooding and I was constantly met by road and bridge closures. In nearby Stainforth people had collected food in the local pub and taken it to those stranded in Fishlake by tractor. But now even this has become impractical. Richard Pashley's family farm in neighbouring South Bramwith dates to 1910. The 63-year-old told me he had never seen flooding as bad as this in his lifetime. He put it down to a number of different factors, including torrential rainfall and the lack of dredging on the River Don. This was a recurring concern from a number of residents and they all echoed Mr Pashley's call for dredging to begin again on this section of the river. The fields surrounding these villages were like lakes and Mr Pashley's field of potatoes was submerged by up to five feet of water, just two weeks before he was due to harvest them. Kirk Bramwith has also seen flooding National Rail said anumber of routes were affected by flooding,externaland advised those travelling by train to check before setting out. Some train routes between Doncaster and Sheffield were closed and Northern Rail has warned commuters they are likely to remain shut until further notice.

"A man was bundled away by police as an angry crowd shouted at him A man who disrupted a Remembrance Sunday event with fireworks had to be rushed away from angry veterans by police. The fireworks exploded in the sky as hundreds of people stood in silence at 11:00 GMT and listened to the Last Post at the cenotaph in Eccles, Salford. A man had set them off from a window ledge in a disused pub across the road. Angry veterans began shouting, ""Get him out!"" and trying to break down the pub door before officers took the man away. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said a 38-year-old man had been arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and was being questioned. Some members of the crowd attempted to climb up to the window from which a man, believed to be a squatter at the pub, had ignited the fireworks. This video can not be played Angry veterans shouted, ""Get him out!"" before officers took a man away in a police car A police officer blocked the door while shouting into his radio as he struggled to hold back the crowd, before reinforcements arrived. The man, wearing what appeared to be army-style fatigues, then appeared at the window to remonstrate with the crowd. Traffic cones were thrown up at him and he retreated inside. When police reinforcements arrived, the man was handcuffed with his head held down and rushed out of the pub to a waiting police car. A large crowd remained at the scene while a team of police officers guarded the entrance. A group of people, who appeared to be squatting at the pub, remained inside. A GMP spokeswoman said officers were called shortly after 11:05 to reports of a disturbance at a pub on Church Street. ""Initial inquiries suggest that a firework was thrown through the window of the pub"", she said. No injuries were reported, she added.

"This video can not be played See how Cyclone Bulbul has impacted India and Bangladesh Cyclone Bulbul has ripped through coastal areas of Bangladesh and India, killing at least 13 people while more than two million others were forced to spend a night in storm shelters. The storm packed winds of up to 120km/h (75 mph), injuring dozens and destroying thousands of homes. Five of the six who lost their lives in Bangladesh were hit by falling trees. Officials say that further casualties were avoided because people were evacuated in time. Authorities say the storm is now weakening. Seven people were killed in the Indian state of West Bengal, the state's minister for disaster management told reporters. West Bengal is one of the worst hit areas in India The five victims hit by trees in Bangladesh included a 52-year old woman who died when a tree dropped onto her house. A 60-year-old fisherman also lost his life after ignoring evacuation warnings. There are increasing concerns after two fishing boats carrying more than 30 men failed to return, an official in Bangladesh's Bhola district said. Around 1,200 tourists, most of them Bangladeshi, were stuck on St Martin's Island, part of Cox's Bazar district, an official told the Reuters news agency. ""All of them will be rescued,"" he said. Services at many sea ports and airports in the region were also suspended - including the busy Kolkata airport. Bangladesh's two biggest ports, Mongla and Chittagong, were closed and flights into Chittagong airport were stopped.

"Woody Allen had filed a $68m (Â£52m) lawsuit over the termination of his contract with Amazon Woody Allen has reached a legal settlement with Amazon Studios after it abandoned a four-film deal. Allen initially filed a $68m (Â£52m) lawsuit in February amid resurfaced allegations that he molested his adopted daughter. Amazon argued that his comments about the #MeToo movement ""sabotaged"" its attempts to promote his new movies. The film director denies sexually assaulting Dylan Farrow, who lost a court case against him in 1992. Under the movie deal, signed in 2016, Allen received a $10m advance payment. But two years later, the release of his first film, A Rainy Day in New York, was shelved and plans for three other movies were cancelled. Shortly before Amazon withdraw from the agreement, Allen reportedly expressed sympathy for movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who was accused of sexually assaulting dozens of women. Mr Weinstein denied the accusations against him, but has since reached a $44m settlement with some of the alleged victims. Months after these initial comments, Allen accused Dylan Farrow of ""cynically using the #MeToo movement"" after she repeated allegations that he assaulted her when she was seven years old. Moses Farrow defends Woody Allen Woody Allen: I'm #MeToo's poster boy In an interview with Argentinean broadcaster Eltrece, Allen said he ""should be the poster boy for the Me Too movement"" since he had worked with ""hundreds of actresses"" and was ""only accused by one woman in a child custody case"". Amazon Studios said its decision to terminate the deal was justifiedbecause Allen's comments undermined its financial security. Dylan Farrow claims her father sexually abused her in 1992 It also pointed out that ""scores of actors and actresses expressed profound regret for having worked with Allen in the past, and many declared publicly that they would never work with him in the future"". In response, Allen said Amazon was fully aware of Dylan Farrow's accusation when the deal was signed. His company, Gravier Productions, secured an international release for A Rainy Day in New York this year, but US distribution has not been secured. Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Hall, who star in the film, said last year that they would donate their wages to charity.

"President Evo Morales denies accusations of wrongdoing after weeks of protests The army chief in Bolivia has urged President Evo Morales to step down amid protests stemming from his disputed re-election last month. The call comes hours after Mr Morales agreed to call a new election after international monitors called for the result to be annulled. The Organization of American States (OAS), which monitored the elections, found ""clear manipulation"". Mr Morales has denied wrongdoing and previous calls to resign. General Williams Kaliman told reporters on Sunday: ""After analysing the conflicted domestic situation, we ask the president to resign his presidential mandate to allow for pacification and the maintaining of stability, for the good of our Bolivia."" He added that the military had ordered ""operations in the air and on land to neutralise armed groups acting outside the law"". Why protesters are on the streets worldwide Opposition leader Carlos Mesa - who came second in last month's poll - had also urged Mr Morales and his vice-president to rule themselves out of the new election. Nor should they preside over the electoral process, he said. ""If you have an iota of patriotism, you should step aside,"" Mr Mesa said at a news conference. Mr Morales had already come under increased pressure on Sunday, with several political allies resigning, some citing fears for the safety of their families. In its preliminary report on Sunday, the OAS said it had found ""clear manipulations"" of Bolivia's voting system and it could not verify the result of the 20 October race. Protesters marched in La Paz on Saturday with a sign reading: ""Resistance against the dictatorship"" During the audit, it said it found physical records with alterations and forged signatures, and evidence of wide-scale data manipulation. The international body concluded it was unlikely that Mr Morales had won by the 10% margin required for a victory. It recommended that a new electoral commission be set up before a fresh election could take place. The president was first elected in 2006. In his announcement on Sunday, he said the country's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TES) would be overhauled before the poll, with parliament choosing its members. Bolivia's attorney general has now ordered an investigation into the conduct of TES members. Mr Morales, who is Bolivia's first indigenous president, told reporters that he had made the decision ""to reduce all tension"".

"Greetings card chain Clintons is considering shop closures and rent cuts as part of a survival plan. The retailer, which has about 2,500 staff, is in restructuring talks with landlords in another sign of the High Street crisis. A spokeswoman told the BBC no decisions have yet been made. Clintons was responding to reports on Sunday that it wanted to close 66 out of 332 shops, with landlords slashing rents on most of the other stores. The restructuring would involve a controversial scheme known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process that allows companies to continue trading while pushing through closures and rent cuts. A Clintons spokeswoman said ""discussions are continuing with our landlords but no decisions have been made"". But she declined to comment on aSunday Telegraph report,externalthat the company told landlords 90 of its shops were loss-making and that sales were expected to continue to decline. One landlord told the BBC that although there was a meeting with Clintons last week, very few details of the restructuring plan were given. More talks are expected this week. The Sunday Times,externalsaid landlords would have until 20 December to air their objections to a CVA. However, landlords have taken an increasingly tough stance on the growing use of CVAs and are more prepared to fight demands for rent cuts. What has gone wrong at Mothercare? BonmarchÃ© appoints administrators Jessops owner plans to call in administrators The retailer, formed in 1968, is owned by the Weiss family, which previously controlled the American Greetings retail chain in the US. Clintons, previously known as Clinton Cards, had appointed advisers from consultancy KPMG to explore a potential sale, but it is thought no acceptable offers were received. News of Clintons' restructuring comes days after baby goods retailer Mothercare announced its UK operation was going into administration, putting 2,500 jobs at risk. Mothercare is part of a long list of High Street names to go under, including Maplin and Poundworld. Others, including Homebase, Debenhams and Carpetright, have been forced into restructuring. A string of restaurant chains have also closed amid a squeeze on consumer spending. Retail experts expect more pain, however, as firms approach the make-or-break Christmas trading period. It is common for banks to wait until they have a clearer picture of Christmas and New Year sales before pulling the plug on retailers. What has gone wrong at Mothercare?

"Prof Sokolov enjoyed dressing up as Napoleon A well-known Russian historian has confessed to murdering his partner, his lawyer says, after he was found in a river with a backpack containing a woman's arms. Oleg Sokolov, 63, was drunk and fell into the river as he tried to dispose of body parts, Russian media said. Police then found the decapitated body of Anastasia Yeshchenko, 24, at his home in the city of St Petersburg. Prof Sokolov is a Napoleon expert who has received France's LÃ©gion d'Honneur. ""He has admitted his guilt,"" his lawyer, Alexander Pochuyev, told AFP news agency, adding that the historian regretted what he had done and was now co-operating. He lived with Ms Yeshchenko in a flat by the Moika river in St Petersburg, and they had been together for three years. They were experts on French history: she was a postgraduate student at St Petersburg State University and had co-authored some works with him. They both enjoyed wearing period costume, with him dressed as Napoleon, and participated in historical re-enactments. Prof Sokolov was treated in hospital for hypothermia, after rescuers hauled him out of the icy water early on Saturday, and is now in police custody. He is suspected of having killed Ms Yeshchenko with a sawn-off shotgun before dismembering the body. A stun pistol was found in the backpack along with the woman's arms. The shotgun, knives, an axe and ammunition were also found in his apartment, Interfax news agency reported. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prof Sokolov reportedly told police he had killed Ms Yeshchenko during an argument and had then sawn off her head, arms and legs. He is said to have planned to get rid of the body before publicly taking his own life dressed as Napoleon. Teenage Russian 'abuse victims' face jail The dark reality of Russia's domestic violence laws 'I want to stand up for every woman experiencing abuse' Some students at the university, quoted by Russian media, described the professor as ""eccentric"" and a woman student said she had complained to the police about his behaviour previously. A St Petersburg local councillor and former student of the professor, Vasily Kunin,has tweeted that he raised concerns,externalabout Prof Sokolov's behaviour but the university authorities did not act on his complaint. More than 2,000 people have now signed an online petition demanding an inquiry into the university management and the history faculty's director. According to students, quoted by AFP, Prof Sokolov enjoyed speaking French, did impressions of Napoleon, and called Ms Yeshchenko ""Josephine"" and asked to be addressed as ""Sire"". Police divers have been searching St Petersburg's Moika river Ms Yeshchenko moved to St Petersburg to study from Krasnodar region in southern Russia, and was a postgraduate student at the time of her death. ""She was quiet, sweet and always the ideal student,"" an acquaintance told Russia's RIA news agency. ""Absolutely everyone knew about their relationship."" Russian media report that her mother is a police lieutenant colonel and her father a school PE teacher. A brother once played as a goalkeeper for the national junior football team. The papers here are full of details of this murder, the tragic and gruesome tale of a brilliant and beautiful young student shot and dismembered by her 63-year old former professor-turned-lover. In these accounts, Oleg Sokolov emerges as a historian whose interest in Napoleon bordered on the obsessive. He had a glittering CV as a respected expert on French military history, who had been visiting professor at the Sorbonne. He was also a major figure in the world of historical re-enactment. One friend told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper the professor had organised costume balls and picnics, as well as recreating battles. But organisations he's been linked to have now scrubbed his name from their websites. Anastasia Yeshchenko's three-year-long affair with the married professor was common knowledge at the university. Friends say she was a top student, highly intelligent, who shared her lover's passion for Napoleonic history. One person described the professor as ""eccentric but not aggressive""; others claimed he considered himself Napoleon reincarnated. Anastasia's brother told RBK Media that she called him in tears in the early hours of Friday morning, saying the couple had had a furious row sparked by the professor's jealousy. She was planning to spend the night in a student hostel. At 01:49 the two spoke again, and Anastasia told her brother she was fine. It was the last anyone heard from her. Prof Sokolov's apartment, where Ms Yeshchenko's decapitated body was found, has been sealed off Prof Sokolov was also a member of France's Institute of Social Science, Economics and Politics (Issep), which on Saturday said it had removed him from his position on its scientific committee. ""We learn with horror... the atrocious crime of which Oleg Sokolov is allegedly guilty,"" it said in a statement. ""We could not have imagined that he could commit such an odious act."" Issep was founded by Marion MarÃ©chal, the niece of far-right National Rally party leader Marine Le Pen and a former lawmaker for the far-right National Front party.

"A US financial regulator has opened an investigation into claims Apple's credit card offered different credit limits for men and women. It follows complaints - including from Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak - that algorithms used to set limits might be inherently biased against women. New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS) has contacted Goldman Sachs, which runs the Apple Card. Any discrimination, intentional or not, ""violates New York law"", the DFS said. The Bloomberg news agency reported on Saturday,externalthat tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson had complained that the Apple Card gave him 20 times the credit limit that his wife got. In a tweet, Mr Hansson said the disparity was despite his wife having a better credit score. Later, Mr Wozniak, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs, tweeted that the same thing happened to him and his wife despite their having no separate bank accounts or separate assets.

Banks and other lenders are increasingly using machine-learning technology to cut costs and boost loan applications. But Mr Hansson, creator of the programming tool Ruby on Rails, said it highlights how algorithms, not just people, can discriminate. US healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group is being investigated over claims an algorithm favoured white patients over black patients. Mr Hansson said in a tweet: ""Apple Card is a sexist program. It does not matter what the intent of individual Apple reps are, it matters what THE ALGORITHM they've placed their complete faith in does. And what it does is discriminate."" He said that as soon as he raised the issue his wife's credit limit was increased. The DFS said in a statement that it ""will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex"". ""Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class violates New York law."" The BBC has contacted Goldman Sachs for comment. On Saturday, the investment bank told Bloomberg: ""Our credit decisions are based on a customer's creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law."" The Apple Card, launched in August, is Goldman's first credit card. The Wall Street investment bank has been offering more products to consumers, including personal loans and savings accounts through its Marcus online bank. The iPhone maker markets Apple Card on its website as a ""new kind of credit card, created by Apple, not a bank"". Leo Kelion, Technology desk editor Without access to the Goldman Sachs computers, it's impossible to be certain of what is going on. The fact there appears to be a correlation between gender and credit doesn't necessarily mean one is causing the other. Even so, the suspicion is that unintentional bias has crept into the system. That could be because when the algorithms involved were developed, they were trained on a data set in which women indeed posed a greater financial risk than the men. This could cause the software to spit out lower credit limits for women in general, even if the assumption it is based on is not true for the population at large. Alternatively, the problem might lie in the data the algorithms are now being fed. For example, within married couples, men might be more likely to take out big loans solely using their name rather than having done so jointly, and the data may not have been adjusted to take this into account. A further complication  is that the software involved can act as a ""black box"", coming up with judgements without providing a way to unravel how each was determined. ""There have been a lot of strides taken in the last five to six years to improve the explainability of decisions taken based on machine learning techniques,"" commented Jonathan Williams of Mk2 Consulting. ""But in some cases, it's still not as good as it could be."" In any case, for now Apple would prefer Goldman Sachs take the heat, despite the fact its marketing materials state that its card was ""created by Apple, not a bank"". But that's a tricky position to maintain. Apple's brand is the only one to feature on the minimalist styling of its card's face, and many of its consumers have higher expectations of its behaviour than they would do for other payment card providers. That means that even if issues of gender bias prove to be common across lenders, Apple faces becoming the focal point for demands that they are addressed. Apple Card can be damaged by wallets and jeans Apple unveils TV streaming platform LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"President Evo Morales denies accusations of wrongdoing after weeks of protests Bolivia's President Evo Morales has said he will call a new election after international monitors questioned the validity of his victory last month. The Organization of American States (OAS), which monitored the elections, found ""clear manipulation"" and called for the result to be annulled. Reports of election fraud sparked off weeks of anti-government protests. Opposition leader Carlos Mesa said Mr Morales and his vice-president should not run in the new poll. Nor should they preside over the electoral process, he said. Why protesters are on the streets worldwide ""If you have an iota of patriotism, you should step aside,"" Mr Mesa said at a news conference. The president, who was first elected in 2006, has denied any wrongdoing and ignored calls to resign. ""The candidacies must be secondary; what comes first is to pacify Bolivia,"" he told a local radio station. In his announcement on Sunday, he also said the country's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TES) would be overhauled before the poll, with parliament choosing its members. Bolivia's attorney general has now ordered an investigation into the conduct of TES members. Mr Morales, who is Bolivia's first indigenous president, told reporters that he had made the decision ""to reduce all tension"". In its preliminary report on Sunday, the OAS said it had found ""clear manipulations"" of Bolivia's voting system and it could not verify the result of the 20 October race. Protesters marched in La Paz on Saturday with a sign reading: ""Resistance against the dictatorship"" During the audit, it said it found physical records with alterations and forged signatures, and evidence of wide-scale data manipulation. The international body concluded it was unlikely that Mr Morales had won by the 10% margin required for a victory. It recommended that a new electoral commission be set up before a fresh election could take place. Evo Morales's decision to call fresh elections is in some ways a climb-down. His position was looking increasingly untenable after weeks of unrest that worsened in the past 48 hours. So a new vote for many is a positive start. But for Mr Morales's critics - and the number is growing - the promise of fresh elections is not enough. He was accused of rigging the vote the first time, few believe clean elections are possible a second time around. Plus, there's lots of detail that's needed to calm the nerves of his sceptics. At the news conference, he said there would be new elections but didn't give any detail as to when. And when they're held, will he run? Already his opponents have called for him to step aside, despite his concessions. Many doubt his intentions to move the country forward in a democratic manner. Bolivia has been rattled by protests, strikes and road blocks since the night of the election. At least three people have died during clashes.The mayor of a small town was also attacked by protesters earlier this week, who dragged her through the streets barefoot, covered her in red paint and forcibly cut her hair. Tensions first flared after the results count was inexplicably paused for 24 hours. The final result gave Mr Morales slightly more than the 10% lead he needed to win outright, giving him a fourth consecutive term. This video can not be played Watch how police took part in Bolivia's anti-government protests on Saturday In an escalation of protests on Saturday, opposition supporters overran two state-run media outlets in La Paz and forced them off air. On the same day a number of uniformed police officers also joined crowds of demonstrators in several major cities. Mr Morales condemned the seizure of the TV and radio stations, but Bolivia's defence minister said there were no plans to deploy the military to quell the police ""mutiny"". Bolivia's armed forces have also called for the crisis to be solved by democratic means. Elsewhere in the region, the leaders of Venezuela, Cuba and Mexico - and Argentina's president-elect Alberto Fernandez - voiced their support for Mr Morales.

"President Vladimir Putin has denied claims of Russian interference A row has broken out over the publication of an intelligence report into Russian covert actions in the UK,with critics saying Downing Street is stalling on its release until after the election. Chancellor Sajid Javid said the timescale for the publication of the report from Parliament's Intelligence Security Committee (ISC) was ""perfectly normal"". But pressure is mounting on No 10 afterthe Sunday Times,externalclaimed nine Russian business people who have donated money to the Conservative Party were named in the document. So what is in the Intelligence and Security Committee report? The answer is that only a small circle of people know for sure and none of them are saying. But it is possible to get a sense of what might be in it. No 10 denies suppressing Russia interference report No Russia interference report until after election We know the report looks at a wide range of Russian activity - ranging from traditional espionage to subversion - and not just in the UK. But the greatest interest has been in what it might say on political interference in the UK. The Mueller inquiry in the US laid out a broad pattern of interference in the US 2016 presidential election, particularly using social media and leaking of documents. So far, no evidence of a cyber campaign on the same scale has been produced in the UK. While it is possible there is evidence of attempts in the report, government ministers have already said there is no evidence of ""successful"" interference in elections, including the Brexit referendum (although defining what ""successful"" means is hard and may be disputable). However, last week former deputy national security adviser Paddy McGuinness told the BBC not enough had been done to deal with vulnerabilities that the Russians and others could exploit. Mr McGuinness, who sat on the Oxford Technology and Elections Commission, said reforms were needed, including more transparency from political parties on how they collect and use data. The ISC report is likely to focus more on broader aspects of Russian influence in politics and public life. The committee took evidence from a number of independent experts and also from the secret intelligence agencies, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. Some of those external experts are well known figures. Bill Browder is a former investor in Russia who became an arch-critic of the Kremlin and campaigns for sanctions on Russian individuals in the form of the Magnitsky Act (named after his former lawyer who died in jail in Moscow). Another witness is understood to be Chris Steele, the former MI6 officer behind the famous dossier on US President Donald Trump. Another is journalist Edward Lucas. These and other observers are understood to have been highly critical of the UK's openness to Russian influence - in particular the way in which Russian money had compromised first the financial system in London and then bled over into politics. There have been questions about some donors to political parties andthe Sunday Times,externalsuggests that nine who gave to the Conservative Party could be named in the report (although this may be more likely in a classified annex rather than the public report). There may also have been evidence about specific relationships with Russians. For instance Boris Johnson as foreign secretary went to a party at an Italian villa hosted by Evgeny Lebedev, who runs the Evening Standard and whose father is a former KGB officer. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Chancellor Sajid Javid said: ""When it comes to party donors, whether it is to the Conservative Party or any other party, there are very strict rules that need to be followed and of course we will always follow those rules."" Asked whether he was sure no Russian money was pulling the strings in December's general election, he said: ""I am as sure as I can be. I'm absolutely sure in terms of our own party and I am very confident about how we are funded and we are very transparent about that."" Mr Javid says the Tory Party follows strict rules on party donors The BBC understands that witnesses have given evidence to the ISC that the UK government itself is partly to blame because it has not done enough to deter Russian subversion and interference - for instance in successive governments' weak response to events like the killing ofAlexander Litvinenkoin 2006. The UK, it was argued, is uniquely placed to be able to push back precisely because of the amount of Russian money in London and the importance of the city to Russia's elite. The failure to push back and instead to protect the financial centre in London has been, it is argued, a choice - but one with consequences. It is easier to know what evidence from well-known critics of the Kremlin will have been. What is harder to know is how much of this the committee accepted and included in the final report. The committee will likely have given most weight to evidence produced by the intelligence agencies themselves. What they said is less clear but it is unlikely they will have wanted details of specific individuals included in the report and any names will probably have been redacted and blacked out. The report has gone through the formal security clearance process and sources have told the BBC there was no objection from any other government agency or department to its publication. That left the decision entirely with Downing Street. It has been adamant that a normal process needs to be followed which explains why it could not be released ahead of the election. But critics have been unconvinced. They believe that the embarrassing details - perhaps of party funding - were something that the government did not want out ahead of the election. Another source suggested it could also have been references to evidence of interference in the US which might have added to the concerns since Donald Trump is due to come to the UK for a Nato summit just days before the election. One official told the BBC there were details of Russian interference in the report but they also thought the government could have rebutted many of the allegations. They suggested these were not as explosive as some people thought and that Downing Street had made a mistake by not releasing the report since by failing to do so, the questions of what is in the report and why it has not been released will now dog them throughout the campaign.

"Socialist leader Pedro SÃ¡nchez hails victory, despite again failing to win a majority government Spain's governing Socialists (PSOE) won the most seats in Sunday's election, but fell short of a majority - and right-wing parties made major gains. The conservative Popular Party (PP) came in second, and far-right Vox more than doubled its seats to become the country's third most-powerful party. This is Spain's fourth general election in as many years. A previous vote in April ended with no clear majority, and the Socialists failed to form a coalition government. How the far-right Vox party found its footing This time, the Socialist party won 120 of the 350 seats - three fewer than in April's vote. The PP has 88 seats, up from 66 in the previous poll, while Vox has 52 - up from just 24 in April. One of the main issues in Sunday's vote was the increasing tensions with Catalonia, Spain's semi-autonomous north-eastern region whose failed bid for independence in 2017 sparked the country's biggest political crisis for 40 years. Catalonia crisis in 300 words Protesters block the AP-7 motorway at the Spanish-French border in northern Spain On Monday, hundreds of Catalan separatist demonstrators blocked traffic in both directions on the AP-7 motorway connecting Spain with France in a protest against the jailing of separatist leaders from Spain's Catalonia region last month. Addressing Socialist supporters after the results came in, acting Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said it was his priority to ""form a stable government and do politics for the benefit of the majority of Spaniards"". Who's who in race to run Spain ""I would like to make a call to all the political parties because they need to act with generosity and responsibility in order to unblock the political situation in Spain,"" he added. After failing to form a government, Mr SÃ¡nchez had hoped that calling another election would strengthen his party's hand - but Pablo Iglesias, leader of left-wing Podemos, warned that it had only reinforced the far right. Pablo Iglesias warned that this election had only strengthened right wing and far-right parties ""Once again we extend a hand to the Socialist party and Pedro SÃ¡nchez,"" he said, adding that he was ready to start talks with the party as soon as Monday. Podemos is the Socialist party's natural political ally. However, a coalition between the two would still fall short of the 176 seats needed for a majority. Meanwhile the centre-right party Ciudadanos - or Citizens - haemorrhaged support, winning only 10 seats this month compared to 57 in April. Ciudadanos was also overtaken by ERC-Sobiranistes, an electoral coalition of pro-Catalan separatist parties. Albert Rivera, leader of Ciudadanos, said: ""Spaniards have wanted more SÃ¡nchez for this legislature, but Spaniards have also wanted more Vox and less of the political centre."" Vox is thought to have benefited at the ballot box from the Catalan crisis, and strong anti-separatist sentiment in other regions of Spain. ""Today a patriotic alternative and a social alternative has been consolidated in Spain that demands national unity and the restoration of constitutional order in Catalonia,"" Vox leader Santiago Abascal told crowds after the election. Guy Hedgecoe, Madrid Although Pedro SÃ¡nchez's Socialists have emerged as winners having suffered only slight losses in this election, the overall result is not a positive one for the acting prime minister. With Podemos having lost some ground and MÃ¡s PaÃ­s securing only a handful of seats, there is no clear left-wing majority. The Socialists' arch-rivals on the right, the PP, has recovered many of the seats it lost in April's ballot. If the country's longstanding political stalemate is to be broken, Mr SÃ¡nchez might have to seek the support of the PP, or else a third election in the space of one year could beckon. Meanwhile, the huge surge by Vox means it will now find it easier to set the agenda on the right. That is likely to hinder any attempts by Mr SÃ¡nchez to seek a conciliatory solution to the Catalan crisis. The April election ended in deadlock, with parties failing to form a coalition by a September deadline, thus forcing Sunday's election. To form a coalition now, they would need to form alliances with smaller, nationalist parties, analysts suggest. Meanwhile, the PP and Vox could seek to make the most of their gains. One PP politician said Prime Minister SÃ¡nchez should ""start to think about going"", given the early results. The huge surge in seats for Vox will be one of the biggest talking points of the night. This video can not be played Who are Spain's far-right party? Spain had appeared immune to a wave of far-right populism spreading across the continent in the past decade, with many remembering the military dictatorship ofÂ GenÂ Francisco Franco.

"The world's most profitable company has published more details about its planned stock market flotation. Oil giant Saudi Aramco's long-awaited prospectus said individual retail investors will have a chance to buy shares as well as big institutions. But the 600-page prospectus did not say how much of the Saudi firm would be sold, nor the date of the listing. It did, though, mention possible risks, including the government's control over oil output and terrorist attack. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to sell the shares to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries. Bankers think the long-awaited flotation will value Aramco at $1.5-2 trillion, making the stock market listing the biggest ever. The prospectus said up to 0.5% of the company would be set aside for retail savers, but Aramco had not yet decided on the percentage for larger institutional buyers. After the flotation, Aramco will not list any more shares for six months, the prospectus says. Although one of the attractions for investors is the potential of high dividends, the document said Aramco has the right to change dividend policy without prior notice.

"Thousands of people have been driven from their homes Two Australian states have declared a state of emergency as bushfires bring a ""catastrophic"" threat to heavily populated areas of the nation's east. At least three people are dead and thousands have been displaced by three days of dangerous weather conditions in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland. But officials say the worst danger will come on Tuesday for areas around Sydney, the nation's largest city. More than 120 bushfires are burning across the two states. In NSW, the blazes have scorched 970,000 hectares of land and destroyed 150 houses. Nine homes have been razed in Queensland.

NSW fire authorities have issued the maximum level of warning for the first time since new fire warnings were introduced a decade ago, afterAustralia's deadly Black Saturday disaster. The ""catastrophic"" warning is in place across the greater Sydney area and regions to the city's north and south. Temperatures are expected to reach 37C by Tuesday. Conditions are predicted to be worse than on Friday, when the firestorms began tearing through eastern Australia.

"This video can not be played People in Khulna, Bangladesh, seek shelter from the storm More than two million people in India and Bangladesh have been evacuated as Cyclone Bulbul hits the Bay of Bengal. The storm made landfall at midnight local time (18:30 GMT) on Saturday, near Sagar Island in Indian West Bengal, and is expected to unleash surges as high as 7ft (2m). Two people have already been killed by the cyclone, local media report. Services at many seaports and airports in the region were also suspended - including at the busy Kolkata airport. Bangladesh's two biggest ports, Mongla and Chittagong, were closed and flights into Chittagong airport were stopped. Shah Kamal, Bangladesh's disaster management secretary, told AFP agency that the evacuated residents had been moved to more than 5,500 cyclone shelters. Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister for the Indian state of West Bengal, tweeted before the cyclone made landfallurging people to stay calm,external. ""Please do not panic,"" she wrote. ""Kindly remain calm and co-operate with the administration in its rescue and relief efforts. Be alert, take care and stay safe."" Forecasters expect the storm to move north and weaken gradually. Many seaports and airports have been closed along the Bay of Bengal It is set to reach wind speeds of up to 120km/h (75mph), with gusts of 150km/h, and create tidal surges in the sea and rivers when it hits the coastal regions, says the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Along its predicted path is the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest and home to the endangered Bengal tigers. Thousands have been urged to move to storm shelters before the storm makes landfall But the closure of transport hubs left thousands of other people stranded on islands off the coast, including St Martin's Island in Bangladesh. Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Indian authorities said military ships and planes have been put on standby to assist with emergencies. Bangladesh's low-lying coast is often hit by deadly cyclones, but the country has successfully reduced the number of casualties in recent years. Early cyclone warning systems have improved, giving authorities more time to evacuate people. More cyclone shelters have also been constructed to protect local residents.

"Posters should be displayed in schools warning against violence or threats to staff, a teaching conference has heard. A motion to the National Education Union (NEU) Cymru conference raised the idea of posters in reception areas, similar to those in GP surgeries. The union claims aggressive behaviour is a growing concern, calling for a review of the causes. The Welsh Government said councils and schools needed to ensure schools were a safe environment for all. This teacher spoke of his frustration about how his case was dealt with One teacher said he had been punched by a teenager when he tried to intervene in an incident on the yard. As well as the physical impact and a suspected broken bone, he says he became stressed and anxious and did not return to work for a year, before formally leaving his job. ""There didn't seem to be any consequences for the pupils or any support for me,"" he said. ""What was I feeling like?"" ""Staff safety and well-being is just as important as pupil safety and well-being. It should be equal - it's not equal"". Another secondary school teacher said she had been forced to take time off work after several incidents including threats of violence and ""a torrent of abuse"" from pupils. She felt drink and drug abuse was a factor, something schools were ""not well equipped to deal with and are loath to recognise"". ""These incidents are happening more and more frequently"", she said. The union, which debated the issue in Newport on Sunday, said that funding cuts are making the problem worse, as well as issues around discipline at home and wider problems in society. David Evans, Wales secretary of NEU Cymru, said: ""It's not an every day occurrence in every school - incidents are few and far between, but even one attack is one too many. ""It highlights the difficulty in dealing with it. Managers have to deal with unusual incidents but they have to deal with it properly and ensure people are protected in their workplace."" Teachers 'face weekly violence from pupils' Secondary school staff suffer work attacks 'We are kicked, spat on, hit and sworn at' 'Alarming' number of teacher attacks - union At the lowest level there was verbal abuse, then intimidation, right up to physical assaults and injuries. There was also threatening behaviour involving parents. Mr Evans said there was variation in the action from the guidelines which came from local authorities, but there needed to be consistency. He said the poster idea was a start and highlighted the issue, but cited a need for respect for teachers from a minority causing problems. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""Any form of violence or abuse against staff in our schools is completely unacceptable.

"A poster from the time of Shona Stevens' murder The killer of a woman who was murdered 25 years ago has been urged to ""search your conscience"" by police. Shona Stevens was savagely attacked in broad daylight 200 yards (180m) from her home in Irvine, North Ayrshire, in November 1994. Ms Stevens, 31, suffered ""horrific injuries"" and died three days later. Her mother and her daughter, who was only seven at the time, joined police in marking the anniversary with a fresh appeal for information. Asked if he had a message for the killer, Det Supt Paul Livingstone said: ""It has been 25 years. It is a huge burden. Shona's family have endured this for too long now. Do the right thing and come forward."" Det Supt Paul Livingstone issued a direct appeal to the killer to mark the 25th anniversary of Ms Stevens' murder On Thursday 10 November, 1994, Ms Stevens left the Co-op at Bourtreehill Shopping Centre and was last seen alone on Towerlands Road at 13:10. Ten minutes later her body was found in bushes near a footpath, close to the rear of her home in Alder Green in the Bourtreehill Park area. Det Supt Livingstone described the attack as ""vicious and frenzied"". He said: ""Her family have had to endure this for too long now. That's why we are having this appeal 25 years on, because I firmly believe that the answer lies in the local community."" Officers believe a weapon was involved but it was never recovered. Det Supt Livingstone also said the inquiry team were keeping an open mind as to a motive for the crime. He would not disclose whether officers had a DNA profile of the suspect but said technology was constantly creating new forensic opportunities. During theElaine Doyle murder trialin 2014 a court heard that convicted killer Gavin McGuire was interviewed in connection with Ms Stevens' murder. The then Strathclyde Police staged a reconstruction of Ms Stevens' final movements Despite extensive media coverage, including a reconstruction of Ms Stevens' final movements, no one has been brought to justice. The senior detective also encouraged anyone who knew the identity of Ms Stevens' attacker to consider the devastating impact the crime has had on her family, especially her daughter. He said: ""Shona was a young mother who was subject to an unprovoked attack that has left her family devastated and we want to trace those responsible. ""I think everyone can assume for themselves what it must have been like for any child to grow up without a parent. ""That to me is all the catalyst that anyone should need that, if they have any information, to come forward and tell us about that."" He added: ""This is very much an open case and we will keep working away until we find who is responsible and bring them to justice."" He said the footpath where Ms Stevens was found was regularly used by the public to access Bourtreehill Shopping Centre. Shona's mother, Mhairi Smith, issued an emotional appeal to the media a week after the murder in November 1994 As part of the new appeal Ms Stevens' family issued brief statements through Police Scotland. Daughter Candice, who is now one year older than her late mother, said: ""I was only seven at the time of my mum's murder but that does not make it any easier to deal with. ""I spent a large part of my childhood years growing up without my mum and I would please ask anyone who knows anything about the incident to please come forward."" The victim's mother Mhairi Smith said: ""It has been 25 years since Shona was taken from us and we are still as hopeful as ever that those responsible for her murder can be brought to justice. ""I cannot emphasise enough how important even the smallest piece of information could be in being able to give me and my family closure. ""I want to know who was responsible for this attack and why they did it. If you have any information about Shona and her murder please contact the police.""

"Lesley Laird (left) said the appeal by Annie Wells ""would be laughable if it wasn't so desperate"" The Scottish Conservatives have made a direct pitch to Labour voters asking them to support their party in a bid to stop another independence referendum. In an open letter, Tory MSP Annie Wells said most supporters of the two parties could agree there should not be another vote on independence. Ms Wells urged Labour supporters to vote Conservative in the election. Scottish Labour's deputy leader Lesley Laird said the appeal ""would be laughable if it wasn't so desperate"". Ms Wells suggested that Jeremy Corbyn would grant another referendum in exchange for taking up residence at Downing Street. In her letter, she wrote: ""When I was growing up in Springburn in Glasgow, I was Labour. My family were Labour. We were all Labour. ""But, during the independence referendum, I decided instead to back the Scottish Conservatives. ""I realised that only they could be relied on 100% to back Scotland's place in the Union. It was only by voting for them that I could make my voice heard."" The Tories have made a direct pitch to Labour supporters to switch allegiance and ""stop another independence referendum"" ""It is not the Labour Party of old,"" she said. ""It's certainly not the Labour Party of Red Clydeside or of Donald Dewar."" Ms Wells added: ""Labour and Conservative supporters won't agree on every issue. But most of us can agree that we want to stop Nicola Sturgeon from getting indyref2. ""Please help us send Sturgeon a message that we do not want to be divided any more. We are fed up with referendums and we're fed up with Nicola Sturgeon."" Scottish Labour's Lesley Laird said: ""The people of Scotland know the Tory party is not their friend. They can see it in the rise in child poverty, the disregard that the Tory government shows for Scottish public opinion and the Tories' sharp turn to English nationalism. ""In contrast, Scottish Labour stands on a platform promising real and lasting change for Scotland. ""Only a transformative UK Labour government backed by Scottish Labour MPs can safeguard the unity of this country, because when Labour wins, Scotland wins."" The SNP's candidate for Airdrie and Shotts, Neil Gray, said the campaign by the Conservatives in Scotland was a ""blatant con trick"". ""For voters in Scotland, the choice in this election is crystal clear,"" he said. ""It's a choice between the SNP who reject Brexit, reject austerity and stand up for our local communities - or the Tories who want to cut Scotland off from Europe against our will, impose deeper cuts on public services and hand their rich chums in the City tax cuts. ""A vote for Labour at this election simply risks letting Tory MPs in through the backdoor - helping Boris Johnson fulfil his right-wing Brexit fantasy that will destroy jobs, businesses and household incomes here in Scotland. ""And the Tory campaign in Scotland is a blatant con trick, whatever they say, a vote for the Tories will simply endorse a deeply damaging Brexit that will hit jobs, living standards and reduce workers rights."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie has previously pledged to stop indyref2 ""dead in its tracks"" even if pro independence parties win a majority in Scotland. In September he said: ""We are against another independence referendum, so if you vote for us that's what you get. I can't say vote for us and you'll get another policy. ""Vote for us and we'll stop independence dead in its tracks.""

"Prof Sokolov enjoyed dressing up as Napoleon A well-known Russian historian has confessed to murdering his partner, his lawyer says, after he was found in a river with a backpack containing a woman's arms. Oleg Sokolov, 63, was drunk and fell into the river as he tried to dispose of body parts, Russian media said. Police then found the decapitated body of Anastasia Yeshchenko, 24, at his home in the city of St Petersburg. Prof Sokolov is a Napoleon expert who has received France's LÃ©gion d'Honneur. ""He has admitted his guilt,"" his lawyer, Alexander Pochuyev, told AFP news agency, adding that the historian regretted what he had done and was now co-operating. He lived with Ms Yeshchenko in a flat by the Moika river in St Petersburg, and they had been together for three years. They were experts on French history: she was a postgraduate student at St Petersburg State University and had co-authored some works with him. They both enjoyed wearing period costume, with him dressed as Napoleon, and participated in historical re-enactments. Prof Sokolov was treated in hospital for hypothermia, after rescuers hauled him out of the icy water early on Saturday, and is now in police custody. He is suspected of having killed Ms Yeshchenko with a sawn-off shotgun before dismembering the body. A stun pistol was found in the backpack along with the woman's arms. The shotgun, knives, an axe and ammunition were also found in his apartment, Interfax news agency reported. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prof Sokolov reportedly told police he had killed Ms Yeshchenko during an argument and had then sawn off her head, arms and legs. He is said to have planned to get rid of the body before publicly taking his own life dressed as Napoleon. Teenage Russian 'abuse victims' face jail The dark reality of Russia's domestic violence laws 'I want to stand up for every woman experiencing abuse' Some students at the university, quoted by Russian media, described the professor as ""eccentric"" and a woman student said she had complained to the police about his behaviour previously. A St Petersburg local councillor and former student of the professor, Vasily Kunin,has tweeted that he raised concerns,externalabout Prof Sokolov's behaviour but the university authorities did not act on his complaint. More than 2,000 people have now signed an online petition demanding an inquiry into the university management and the history faculty's director. According to students, quoted by AFP, Prof Sokolov enjoyed speaking French, did impressions of Napoleon, and called Ms Yeshchenko ""Josephine"" and asked to be addressed as ""Sire"". Police divers have been searching St Petersburg's Moika river Ms Yeshchenko moved to St Petersburg to study from Krasnodar region in southern Russia, and was a postgraduate student at the time of her death. ""She was quiet, sweet and always the ideal student,"" an acquaintance told Russia's RIA news agency. ""Absolutely everyone knew about their relationship."" Russian media report that her mother is a police lieutenant colonel and her father a school PE teacher. A brother once played as a goalkeeper for the national junior football team. The papers here are full of details of this murder, the tragic and gruesome tale of a brilliant and beautiful young student shot and dismembered by her 63-year old former professor-turned-lover. In these accounts, Oleg Sokolov emerges as a historian whose interest in Napoleon bordered on the obsessive. He had a glittering CV as a respected expert on French military history, who had been visiting professor at the Sorbonne. He was also a major figure in the world of historical re-enactment. One friend told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper the professor had organised costume balls and picnics, as well as recreating battles. But organisations he's been linked to have now scrubbed his name from their websites. Anastasia Yeshchenko's three-year-long affair with the married professor was common knowledge at the university. Friends say she was a top student, highly intelligent, who shared her lover's passion for Napoleonic history. One person described the professor as ""eccentric but not aggressive""; others claimed he considered himself Napoleon reincarnated. Anastasia's brother told RBK Media that she called him in tears in the early hours of Friday morning, saying the couple had had a furious row sparked by the professor's jealousy. She was planning to spend the night in a student hostel. At 01:49 the two spoke again, and Anastasia told her brother she was fine. It was the last anyone heard from her. Prof Sokolov's apartment, where Ms Yeshchenko's decapitated body was found, has been sealed off Prof Sokolov was also a member of France's Institute of Social Science, Economics and Politics (Issep), which on Saturday said it had removed him from his position on its scientific committee. ""We learn with horror... the atrocious crime of which Oleg Sokolov is allegedly guilty,"" it said in a statement. ""We could not have imagined that he could commit such an odious act."" Issep was founded by Marion MarÃ©chal, the niece of far-right National Rally party leader Marine Le Pen and a former lawmaker for the far-right National Front party.

"Posters should be displayed in schools warning against violence or threats to staff, a teaching conference has heard. A motion to the National Education Union (NEU) Cymru conference raised the idea of posters in reception areas, similar to those in GP surgeries. The union claims aggressive behaviour is a growing concern, calling for a review of the causes. The Welsh Government said councils and schools needed to ensure schools were a safe environment for all. This teacher spoke of his frustration about how his case was dealt with One teacher said he had been punched by a teenager when he tried to intervene in an incident on the yard. As well as the physical impact and a suspected broken bone, he says he became stressed and anxious and did not return to work for a year, before formally leaving his job. ""There didn't seem to be any consequences for the pupils or any support for me,"" he said. ""What was I feeling like?"" ""Staff safety and well-being is just as important as pupil safety and well-being. It should be equal - it's not equal"". Another secondary school teacher said she had been forced to take time off work after several incidents including threats of violence and ""a torrent of abuse"" from pupils. She felt drink and drug abuse was a factor, something schools were ""not well equipped to deal with and are loath to recognise"". ""These incidents are happening more and more frequently"", she said. The union, which debated the issue in Newport on Sunday, said that funding cuts are making the problem worse, as well as issues around discipline at home and wider problems in society. David Evans, Wales secretary of NEU Cymru, said: ""It's not an every day occurrence in every school - incidents are few and far between, but even one attack is one too many. ""It highlights the difficulty in dealing with it. Managers have to deal with unusual incidents but they have to deal with it properly and ensure people are protected in their workplace."" Teachers 'face weekly violence from pupils' Secondary school staff suffer work attacks 'We are kicked, spat on, hit and sworn at' 'Alarming' number of teacher attacks - union At the lowest level there was verbal abuse, then intimidation, right up to physical assaults and injuries. There was also threatening behaviour involving parents. Mr Evans said there was variation in the action from the guidelines which came from local authorities, but there needed to be consistency. He said the poster idea was a start and highlighted the issue, but cited a need for respect for teachers from a minority causing problems. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""Any form of violence or abuse against staff in our schools is completely unacceptable. ""We want our schools to be safe and welcoming environments where teachers can get on with their jobs, helping pupils achieve the best they can. ""There is a duty is on local authorities and schools to ensure that schools are a safe environment for all.

"England have won five of the past six Twenty20 series against New Zealand Fifth Twenty20, Eden Park, Auckland New Zealand 146-5:Guptill 50 (20), Munro 46 (21) England 146-7:Bairstow 47 (18), Santner 2-20 England 17, New Zealand 8in super over England won by nine runs in super over; England won series 3-2 Scorecard England beat New Zealand in another super over to win a thrilling final Twenty20 and take the series 3-2. In a repeat of July'sWorld Cup final,the scores were tied at the end of a wildly unpredictable game in Auckland. New Zealand plundered 146-5 from 11 overs, and it took Chris Jordan hitting 12 off the final three deliveries to take the game to a super over. Jonny Bairstow, who earlier struck 47 off 18 balls, and captain Eoin Morgan scored 17 off England's six deliveries, before Jordan limited New Zealand to eight. It was a remarkable finish to a rain-delayed game that contained a staggering 29 sixes in 24 overs. While England, who won the World Cup final by virtue of scoring more boundaries, held their nerve in admittedly less pressurised circumstances, New Zealand will take little comfort from once again missing out by the thinnest of margins. If the two-Test series which starts on 21 November comes close to matching the excitement on offer at Eden Park, supporters from both sides can have no complaints. First the World Cup final, now this... TMS podcast: ANOTHER super over success for England There were several moments around which this game hinged: Bairstow's three sixes in a row off Ish Sodhi; Jordan's four off the final delivery to tie the scores; and Morgan's stunning catch over his shoulder as he ran back from cover to remove Tim Seifert from the fourth ball of the super over. But Jordan's nerveless display with the ball deserves particular praise, given the batting pyrotechnics which had gone before. On a pitch that offered the bowlers no assistance, and on a ground with boundaries so short that mis-hits frequently cleared the rope, his yorkers restricted Seifert and Martin Guptill to a two, a four and two singles. England's celebrations may not have matched those at Lord's on 14 July, but they can be rightly proud of the manner in which they pulled off an away series win with a squad featuring six T20 debutants. Victory in the Tests would cap an impressive first series for new England coach Chris Silverwood. England in New Zealand - fixtures & results Jonny Bairstow hit five sixes and two fours in his 47, then scored eight off three balls in the super over That Guptill's 19-ball fifty, Colin Munro's equally savage 46 off 21 deliveries and Seifert's 39 off 16 will go down as footnotes in this memorable match says much for the excitement that followed. Man of the match Bairstow was almost solely responsible for leading England's pursuit, which veered between probable and unlikely amid a barrage of brutal hitting and clumps of wickets. Requiring more than 13 runs an over from the beginning, England lost Tom Banton, James Vince and Morgan in slipping to 39-3. But Bairstow, pummelling the short, straight boundaries, added 61 in four overs with the resourceful Sam Curran before he became the first of three wickets to fall in four balls. Sam Billings and Tom Curran kept England afloat - just - but three runs and the departure of Curran off the first three balls of Jimmy Neesham's last over left new man Jordan needing 13 off three. No bother. He swatted a full toss over long-off for six, scampered a two, then swung to fine leg for four to tie the scores. Given what took place four months ago, perhaps it was no surprise. Bairstow was subsequently given one demerit point by the International Cricket Council for an ""audible obscenity"" after he was dismissed. He now has two points on his record - accumulating four within a two-year period would earn a suspension. England captain Eoin Morgan on BBC Test Match Special:""It's absolutely remarkable. We didn't expect to play much cricket today and it's turned out to be an epic end to a series where there wasn't much between the two sides. ""To win it in such fashion with a young, inexperienced side in the long term will pay huge dividends for us."" England batsman Jonny Bairstow:""It was manic. The way they came out and put on that total was very, very impressive. It was a pretty imposing total but we thought we had a chance. ""We don't want to keep making a habit of super overs. It just shows how close the sides are. It sets up a fantastic Test series."" England bowler Chris Jordan:""A few of us have played T10 cricket so the mood was very calm the entire way through. I just tried to keep a clear mind. ""I'd bowled a super over beforein Sharjah against Pakistan,so it was more or less going through processes and letting what will be will be."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""It was fitting that the last match of this series should end in a super over. ""It's been as difficult to separate these two teams now as it was in the World Cup final - but this time, England's victory was emphatic."" New Zealand captain Tim Southee:""The shorter the game, the harder the side can go. It would have been nice to have one more run there somewhere but it wasn't to be. ""It's been a good series throughout - it has ebbed and flowed. It will be good to get the whites back on.""

"President Evo Morales denies accusations of wrongdoing after weeks of protests Bolivia's President Evo Morales has said he will call a new election after international monitors questioned the validity of his victory last month. The Organization of American States (OAS), which monitored the elections, found ""clear manipulation"" and called for the result to be annulled. Reports of election fraud sparked off weeks of anti-government protests. Opposition leader Carlos Mesa said Mr Morales and his vice-president should not run in the new poll. Nor should they preside over the electoral process, he said. Why protesters are on the streets worldwide ""If you have an iota of patriotism, you should step aside,"" Mr Mesa said at a news conference. The president, who was first elected in 2006, has denied any wrongdoing and ignored calls to resign. ""The candidacies must be secondary; what comes first is to pacify Bolivia,"" he told a local radio station. In his announcement on Sunday, he also said the country's Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TES) would be overhauled before the poll, with parliament choosing its members. Bolivia's attorney general has now ordered an investigation into the conduct of TES members. Mr Morales, who is Bolivia's first indigenous president, told reporters that he had made the decision ""to reduce all tension"". In its preliminary report on Sunday, the OAS said it had found ""clear manipulations"" of Bolivia's voting system and it could not verify the result of the 20 October race. Protesters marched in La Paz on Saturday with a sign reading: ""Resistance against the dictatorship"" During the audit, it said it found physical records with alterations and forged signatures, and evidence of wide-scale data manipulation. The international body concluded it was unlikely that Mr Morales had won by the 10% margin required for a victory. It recommended that a new electoral commission be set up before a fresh election could take place. Evo Morales's decision to call fresh elections is in some ways a climb-down. His position was looking increasingly untenable after weeks of unrest that worsened in the past 48 hours. So a new vote for many is a positive start. But for Mr Morales's critics - and the number is growing - the promise of fresh elections is not enough. He was accused of rigging the vote the first time, few believe clean elections are possible a second time around. Plus, there's lots of detail that's needed to calm the nerves of his sceptics. At the news conference, he said there would be new elections but didn't give any detail as to when. And when they're held, will he run? Already his opponents have called for him to step aside, despite his concessions. Many doubt his intentions to move the country forward in a democratic manner. Bolivia has been rattled by protests, strikes and road blocks since the night of the election. At least three people have died during clashes.The mayor of a small town was also attacked by protesters earlier this week, who dragged her through the streets barefoot, covered her in red paint and forcibly cut her hair. Tensions first flared after the results count was inexplicably paused for 24 hours. The final result gave Mr Morales slightly more than the 10% lead he needed to win outright, giving him a fourth consecutive term. This video can not be played Watch how police took part in Bolivia's anti-government protests on Saturday In an escalation of protests on Saturday, opposition supporters overran two state-run media outlets in La Paz and forced them off air. On the same day a number of uniformed police officers also joined crowds of demonstrators in several major cities.

"Politicians had urged voters to turn out to cast their ballot and break months of political deadlock Voters in Spain returned to the polls for the fourth general election in as many years. In the last election in April, the governing Socialist Party won the most seats but fell short of a majority and was unable to form a coalition. Spain has not had a stable government since 2015. Polls closed at 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT), but the election was overshadowed by unrest in Catalonia and the rise of the far-right Vox party. Results are expected on Sunday evening. Who's who in the Spanish election Can another vote end the deadlock? After April's vote, Socialist Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez entered coalition talks with the leftist Podemos party, but talks collapsed - causing them to miss a September deadline to form a new government. At a closing rally on Friday, Mr SÃ¡nchez had told supporters: ""There are only two options: either vote for the Socialists so that we have a government, or vote for any other party to block Spain from getting a progressive government."" The five main candidates are PP leader Pablo Casado, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, Vox leader Santiago Abascal, Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias, and Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera Thousands of people held a rally in Barcelona on the eve of the election Mr Sanchez is thought to be at an advantage given his current position as caretaker leader, despite having never won a parliamentary majority. But the latest opinion polls before voting began showed none of the parties winning a majority. Instead, they showed Socialist Party (PSOE) in the lead again, but with fewer votes than in April's election, and the conservative People's Party (PP) and Vox making gains. This video can not be played Who are Spain's far-right party? The election comes less than a month after Spain's Supreme Court handed out lengthy jail sentences to nine Catalan independence leaders, over their role in organising an outlawed referendum in 2017. The move triggered protests and violence on the streets of Barcelona and other cities in Catalonia. The Catalan crisis in 300 words The Catalan crisis dominated the election campaign, with parties on the right - Vox, the PP and the centre-right Ciudadanos - taking a hardline anti-separatist stance. This video can not be played Catalan protests: Why is Barcelona burning? Support for Vox surged in the last election, with the party winning 24 seats in parliament with more than 10% of the vote. Meanwhile, the PP suffered its worst-ever general election performance.

"The world's most profitable company has published more details about its planned stock market flotation. Oil giant Saudi Aramco's long-awaited prospectus said individual retail investors will have a chance to buy shares as well as big institutions. But the 600-page prospectus did not say how much of the Saudi firm would be sold, nor the date of the listing. It did, though, mention possible risks, including the government's control over oil output and terrorist attack. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is seeking to sell the shares to raise billions of dollars to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil by investing in non-energy industries. Bankers think the long-awaited flotation will value Aramco at $1.5-2 trillion, making the stock market listing the biggest ever. The prospectus said up to 0.5% of the company would be set aside for retail savers, but Aramco had not yet decided on the percentage for larger institutional buyers. After the flotation, Aramco will not list any more shares for six months, the prospectus says. Although one of the attractions for investors is the potential of high dividends, the document said Aramco has the right to change dividend policy without prior notice. World's most profitable company to go public Saudi Aramco flotation 'coming soon' Iran 'finds new oil field with 53bn barrels' Aramco has hired a host of international banking giants including Citibank, Credit Suisse and HSBC as financial advisers to assess interest in the share sale and set a price. Based on the level of interest - a final value will be put on the shares on 5 December. The sale of the company, first mooted four years ago, has been overshadowed by delays and criticism of corporate transparency at Saudi Arabia's crown jewel. It was initially thought about 5% of Aramco would be sold, but the final figure is now expected to be half that. Amid speculation that some foreign institutional investors are cool on the flotation, the government has reportedly pressed wealthy Saudi business families and institutions to invest, and many nationalists have labelled it a patriotic duty. Aramco last year posted $111bn in net profit. In the first nine months of this year, its net profit dropped 18% to $68bn.

Regiments and societies walked past the Cenotaph in groups, their pace matching the drum beat of a brass band. Some wheelchair-using veterans left their chairs behind and walked the distance instead, their medals sparkling on their lapels. World War Two veteran Ron Freer, 104, who is blind, is thought to be the oldest person to have marched at the Cenotaph this year.

"A poster from the time of Shona Stevens' murder The killer of a woman who was murdered 25 years ago has been urged to ""search your conscience"" by police. Shona Stevens was savagely attacked in broad daylight 200 yards (180m) from her home in Irvine, North Ayrshire, in November 1994. Ms Stevens, 31, suffered ""horrific injuries"" and died three days later. Her mother and her daughter, who was only seven at the time, joined police in marking the anniversary with a fresh appeal for information. Asked if he had a message for the killer, Det Supt Paul Livingstone said: ""It has been 25 years. It is a huge burden. Shona's family have endured this for too long now. Do the right thing and come forward."" Det Supt Paul Livingstone issued a direct appeal to the killer to mark the 25th anniversary of Ms Stevens' murder On Thursday 10 November, 1994, Ms Stevens left the Co-op at Bourtreehill Shopping Centre and was last seen alone on Towerlands Road at 13:10. Ten minutes later her body was found in bushes near a footpath, close to the rear of her home in Alder Green in the Bourtreehill Park area. Det Supt Livingstone described the attack as ""vicious and frenzied"". He said: ""Her family have had to endure this for too long now. That's why we are having this appeal 25 years on, because I firmly believe that the answer lies in the local community."" Officers believe a weapon was involved but it was never recovered. Det Supt Livingstone also said the inquiry team were keeping an open mind as to a motive for the crime. He would not disclose whether officers had a DNA profile of the suspect but said technology was constantly creating new forensic opportunities. During theElaine Doyle murder trialin 2014 a court heard that convicted killer Gavin McGuire was interviewed in connection with Ms Stevens' murder. The then Strathclyde Police staged a reconstruction of Ms Stevens' final movements Despite extensive media coverage, including a reconstruction of Ms Stevens' final movements, no one has been brought to justice. The senior detective also encouraged anyone who knew the identity of Ms Stevens' attacker to consider the devastating impact the crime has had on her family, especially her daughter. He said: ""Shona was a young mother who was subject to an unprovoked attack that has left her family devastated and we want to trace those responsible. ""I think everyone can assume for themselves what it must have been like for any child to grow up without a parent. ""That to me is all the catalyst that anyone should need that, if they have any information, to come forward and tell us about that."" He added: ""This is very much an open case and we will keep working away until we find who is responsible and bring them to justice."" He said the footpath where Ms Stevens was found was regularly used by the public to access Bourtreehill Shopping Centre. Shona's mother, Mhairi Smith, issued an emotional appeal to the media a week after the murder in November 1994 As part of the new appeal Ms Stevens' family issued brief statements through Police Scotland. Daughter Candice, who is now one year older than her late mother, said: ""I was only seven at the time of my mum's murder but that does not make it any easier to deal with. ""I spent a large part of my childhood years growing up without my mum and I would please ask anyone who knows anything about the incident to please come forward."" The victim's mother Mhairi Smith said: ""It has been 25 years since Shona was taken from us and we are still as hopeful as ever that those responsible for her murder can be brought to justice. ""I cannot emphasise enough how important even the smallest piece of information could be in being able to give me and my family closure. ""I want to know who was responsible for this attack and why they did it. If you have any information about Shona and her murder please contact the police.""

"Protesters marched in La Paz on Saturday with a sign reading: ""Resistance against the dictatorship"" Bolivia's governing party has called on its supporters to defend President Evo Morales, after police in some cities joined protests against him. Demonstrators accuse Mr Morales, Latin America's longest-serving leader, of rigging last month's election to secure a fourth term. On Saturday, opposition protesters overran two state-run media outlets in La Paz and forced them off air. Mr Morales denies any wrongdoing and says he will not resign. He also condemned the seizure of the TV and radio stations , tweeting: ""They [the protesters] say they defend democracy, but they behave as if they were in a dictatorship."" This video can not be played Watch how police took part in Bolivia's anti-government protests on Saturday The country's defence minister said there were no plans to deploy the military to quell the police ""mutiny"". For their part, Bolivia's armed forces said they would never go against the people and that the crisis needs to be solved by democratic means. So far, three people have died and hundreds have been injured in the unrest, which has lasted more than four weeks. The president's main rival, Carlos Mesa, has rejected an offer of dialogue - instead insisting on new elections and Mr Morales' resignation. Mr Morales' party Movement for Socialism called on its supporters to come to La Paz and ""defend"" the results of the controversial election. The previous day's demonstrations, on Friday, were the first to include large numbers of police - though the scale was unclear. Police officers were seen hoisting Bolivian flags on top of police stations Uniformed officers joined protesters in cities including La Paz and Sucre. Speaking to local media, several uniformed officers called on Mr Morales to resign - and said they would stop him from turning Bolivia into a dictatorship like his allies in Cuba and Venezuela. Why protesters are on the streets worldwide In a tweet, President Morales denounced the protests as an ""attack on the rule of law"". Defence Minister Javier Zabaleta, speaking with state television, called for calm and said he was confident police would ""continue to fulfil their constitutional job to safeguard the people"". Earlier this week,the mayor of a small town was attacked by protesterswho dragged her through the streets barefoot, covered her in red paint and forcibly cut her hair. Bolivia has been rattled by protests, strikes and roadblocks since the country held a presidential election on 20 October. Carlos Mesa, who came second to Mr Morales in the election, is calling for it to be re-run Tensions first flared on the night of the presidential election after the results count was inexplicably paused for 24 hours. The final result gave Mr Morales slightly more than the 10-percentage-point lead he needed to win outright in the first round of the race. The Organization of American States (OAS) is conducting an audit of the votes, and the results are expected to be published next week. But Mr Mesa - the candidate who finished second - has spoken out against the audit, saying that his party was not consulted. A former president himself, he has asked Bolivia's congress to pass an emergency bill to prepare for new elections. Bolivian police protest against Morales.

Many seaports and airports have been closed along the Bay of Bengal It is set to reach wind speeds of up to 120km/h (75mph), with gusts of 150km/h, and create tidal surges in the sea and rivers when it hits the coastal regions, says the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Along its predicted path is the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest and home to the endangered Bengal tigers. Thousands have been urged to move to storm shelters before the storm makes landfall But the closure of transport hubs left thousands of other people stranded on islands off the coast, including St Martin's Island in Bangladesh. Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Indian authorities said military ships and planes have been put on standby to assist with emergencies. Bangladesh's low-lying coast is often hit by deadly cyclones, but the country has successfully reduced the number of casualties in recent years.

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid: ""Over 50% of the costings are from Labour's own figures"" A spending row has broken out after the Conservative Party published what it claims would be the cost of a Labour government over five years. The report, compiled by the party and not the Treasury, is based on a number of commitments from Labour's annual party conference but not its manifesto. Chancellor Sajid Javid said Labour's proposals would leave the UK ""on the brink of bankruptcy"". But shadow chancellor John McDonnell condemned the report as ""fake news"". The Conservatives claim that Labour's policies would cost Â£1.2tn over the course of the next five years, if the party wins next month's general election. The figure is based on costing Labour's 2017 manifesto and other pledges it has made since then. But the Labour Party has yet to publish its 2019 election manifesto, detailing its policies and spending proposals. Senior Labour figures will meet next weekend to decide which policies passed by the party's annual conference will become manifesto proposals for government, with some unlikely to be confirmed. Labour's shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne said the manifesto would be ""fully costed"" when it is published. Labour and Tories pledge more borrowing A really simple guide to the election,external The clock is ticking: How to register to vote Pienaar: Trust is the burning issue at this election What's the price tag on an election? Challenged on the assessment by the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Javid stood by the figures. He told the programme: ""This is the true cost of Corbyn's Labour. These are the numbers that John McDonnell did not want you to see."" The chancellor added: ""Of course [Labour] aren't going to welcome these numbers. They don't want to see this kind of transparency. ""These are eye-watering levels of spendingâ¦ it will be absolutely reckless and will leave this country with an economic crisis within months."" But asked about the Conservatives' own spending pledges - and how they would be funded - Mr Javid only said the party would ""set out our plans during the course of the election campaign"". ""Our plans are properly costed and it will be clear how we will be funding that,"" he added. Earlier, business minister Kwasi Kwarteng was pushed for the Conservatives' spending plans by Sky News' Sophy Ridge programme, but he said he was ""not going to bandy around figures"".

Mr McDonnell branded the Conservative report a ""ludicrous piece of Tory fake news"" and an ""incompetent mish-mash of debunked estimates and bad maths, cooked up because they know Labour's plans for real change are popular"". And Mr Gwynne told the BBC's Andrew Marr show the Conservative claims about Labour spending were ""an absolute work of fiction"". The shadow minister said his party's proposals would be ""open and transparent"" on costings, and called on the Tories to do the same with their manifesto. This video can not be played Andrew Gwynne: ""This is an absolute work of fiction by the Conservatives"" Neither the Conservatives nor Labour have confirmed a date for when their manifestos will be published. But the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Ed Davey, has called for both parties to submit their manifestos to the Office for Budget Responsibility to be independently costed. ""The cash commitments that are being thrown around by the two old parties need to be subject to proper scrutiny,"" he said. ""Manifestos need to be independently assessed and costed by the Office for Budget Responsibility so that the public can be confident that flagship policies can be delivered."" Mr Davey said the Lib Dems were ""more than prepared"" to do the same with their own manifesto when it is published. There are problems with the Conservative Party's approach. As Labour has not yet published its election manifesto, previous pledges may well be dropped, while new ones could still be added. That makes the job of accurately costing election pledges, at this stage of the campaign, impossible. Just because certain policy positions passed at the Labour conference, there is no guarantee they will be adopted in the upcoming manifesto. There is also an issue with some of the costing. For example, the Conservatives cost Labour's renationalisation plans at Â£196bn. This is based on a Confederation of British Industry estimate, whichwas itself the subject of criticism,external. But it is certainly true that Labour wants to spend a lot more - something it has been upfront about. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says he wants to more than double UK investment spending to an extra Â£55bn a year. However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has called into question where such an immediate increase in investment spending could be achieved. Read more from Reality Check on Labour's economic plans here. This video can not be played John McDonnell: Â£150bn fund for ""human emergency created by Tories"" The publication of the Conservative document comes after civil service head Sir Mark Sedwillblocked a Tory plan to use civil servants to cost the Labour Party's fiscal plans in a separate report. Sir Mark's decision came after Mr McDonnell complained vociferously to Treasury Permanent Secretary Tom Scholar. Speaking about Labour's plans in Liverpool on Thursday, Mr McDonnell promised""investment on a scale never seen before""to overhaul infrastructure in all areas of the UK. The shadow chancellor said he wanted to transfer power and money out of the south-east of England - and will fund his plans through borrowing. He said his party would introduce new fiscal rules, meaning ""borrowing for investment"" would not be included in borrowing targets. Labour'seconomic planincludes doubling ""investment"" spending, a Â£150bn ""social transformation fund"", and a Â£250bn ""green transformation fund"". The Tories have also vowed to borrow to fund more spending, rewriting their current financial rules. This document is political rather than financial. The Conservatives' aim is to frame Labour's plans not as ambitious, but as unaffordable. But the dossier assumes that all Labour's policies are firm commitments, and it does not examine Labour's revenue raising measures. John McDonnell has made no secret that Labour intends to borrow more than the Tories to invest - his political argument is that this would both grow the economy more rapidly and increase the state's assets - not just its liabilities. So, in the end, the calculation voters are likely to make is about who they trust more to run the economy. Do you have any questions about the general election?

"Labour's chancellor John McDonnell has unveiled a plan which it promises will deliver a ""irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people"". So what is the party's plan? Labour want to spend a lot more money. They want to double ""investment"" spending - money spent on long-term projects, as opposed to day-to-day expenses such as paying civil servants' salaries. An extra Â£55bn a year on investment is certainly a huge amount of money. For comparison, the government was expected to spend Â£48.4bn on investment this year, according to the 2018 Budget. Capital investment in health this year is set at Â£6.7bn, and for education it is Â£5.1bn. Under Labour, there would be a Â£150bn ""social transformation fund"". This would pay for upgrades to schools, hospitals, social care facilities and council homes and would be spent over five years - an average of Â£30bn a year. In addition, a Â£250bn ""green transformation fund"" would be spent over ten years, averaging Â£25bn a year. This would be spent on projects to improve sustainability, such as energy and transport, and insulating existing homes. There is no doubt a long list of things in the UK which could do with improvement. To take the example of schools, a National Audit Office report in 2017 found that there were 178 schools in the UK in poor condition. The report found that it would cost Â£6.7bn to upgrade all the schools in England to a satisfactory condition, and another Â£7.1bn to upgrade them to good condition. However, the UK is already undertaking a number of significant construction projects - Crossrail, the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and HS2. This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? Finding qualified workers to undertake more infrastructure projects would not be straightforward. Infrastructure projects take years to plan and approve before the first concrete gets poured. Experts warn that finding enough projects which are ready to start and offer good value for taxpayers' money might be problematic for whoever wins the election. ""If you promise more than is deliverable then you risk wasting money, however good the long-term intention is,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the IFS. Reality Check looked at the difficulties of investment spendinghere. John McDonnell says he wants to achieve ""an irreversible shift in the centre of gravity in political decision making and investment"" away from London to the North and other regions of the UK. The National Transformation Fund will be managed from a new department of the Treasury, based at an unspecified location in the North of England. And an element of the fund would be specifically managed and spent locally. As thisreport,externalshows, only a minority of civil servants - 83,500 out of 430,000 - are based in London. More than 50,000 are already based in the North-West. However, the majority of Treasury staff, and the most senior staff, are currently based in London. On top of its investment plans, Labour promises to make university tuition free, as the party did in its 2017 manifesto. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said at the time that scrapping tuition fees would add an extra Â£11bn a year to the amount the government has to borrow. In this election, the extra cost of doing this instead of keeping tuition fees at their current level of Â£9,250 would be lower because of a change in the way student loans are treated in the national accounts. Labour has promised to make university tuition free As much as 45% of student loans will never be repaid, and this now has to be counted as government spending. You can read more about the changesin this piece. Mr McDonnell said the National Transformation Fund would allow Labour to ""decarbonise as thoroughly and fast as our commitment to a just transition will allow"". In other words, it would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases the country produces. The most dramatic element of the plan announced so far is a scheme to improve the insulation of 27 million homes, which it estimates would cost Â£250bn, though only Â£60bn of that would come from government grants. It would increase investment in rail and offshore wind. In its 2017 manifesto, Labour said it was ""committed to ensuring that the national debt is lower at the end of the next Parliament than it is today"". Called the fiscal credibility rule, this commitment is designed to reassure investors that Labour is a reliable steward of the economy and would not let debt spiral out of control. On Thursday Labour said its target for borrowing would change significantly. Instead of promising to reduce the national debt, it would seek to improve ""the overall balance sheet"". Instead of targeting the national debt, they are targeting a different statistic called ""public sector net worth"". Though it sounds similar its consequences in practice would be profound. At the moment, if the government borrows Â£1m to build a road, that counts as Â£1m more added to the national debt. But under the new rule, the government now owns a new road which would be worth around Â£1m. The value of the new asset - the road - balances out the new debt, and public sector net worth hasn't changed at all. This means the government can borrow much more than it would have done under the old rules, as long as it uses that money to invest in an asset. Labour's plan to borrow an extra Â£55bn a year for the National Transformation Fund would have been next to impossible under the old rule. Also Labour's plans to borrow to nationalise some public utilities would be affordable under this plan, as they would bring the government an asset as well as a debt. Affordable, that is, as long as the government can find someone to lend it the money. Labour has said that it will fund this extra spending by borrowing money. It will issue long-dated government bonds - IOUs which attract an interest rate, but won't have to be paid back for many years. The government can currently borrow for 30 years for an effective interest rate of 1.25%, and many economists argue that it makes sense to borrow at such low rates for projects that will give a bigger return than it costs to fund them. It is likely that bond markets would be willing to lend the government this money, though the effective interest rate that investors demand might well rise as borrowing increases. The influential bond investor Pimcotold the Financial Times,externalthat the UK was one of its ""least favourite"" markets to invest in, because of the combination of low rates and big public spending increases in prospect. But even they did not expect a big increase in government borrowing costs. The National Investment Bank was an idea that also featured in Labour's 2017 manifesto, which it is committed to again. The bankwould have Â£250bn of lending power over 10 years,externaland would target small businesses that support the government's industrial strategy (such as energy-efficient housing and decarbonisation). While the bank would require an initial cash injection from government funds, Labour believes it would able to fund itself in the longer run. This could be done, for example, by raising money from outside investors. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the party's tax plans ""will affect 5% of the population - the rest of the population will benefit from it"". So how much do you have to earn to be in the 5%? HMRC figures from 2017,externalindicated that the top 5% of taxpayers earn more than Â£75,300.That's in line with Labour's previous remarksimplying that ""the rich"" are those earning more than about Â£70,000-80,000 a year. How many people is that? HMRC says that there were 31.2 million taxpayers in 2016-2017, so the top 5% being targeted would be about 1,560,000 people. ""Taxpayers"" covers most working people, but not anyone who earned less than the personal tax allowance of Â£11,200 that year. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"The UK is gearing up to hold a general election on Thursday. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. A total of 650 people will be chosen asmembers of Parliament (MPs), to decide laws and policies. Members of Parliament are elected by voters to represent the interests of their constituency in the House of Commons. Most belong to a political party, but some do stand as independents. There are 650 MPs in the House. MPs are elected to the House of Commons, one of two chambers of Parliament in London, where the government is based. The government passes laws that help it run the country. This compares with local governments which deal with issues such as bin collections and schools in each area. In a general election, the UK's 46 million voters are invited to choose an MP for their area - one of 650 constituencies. Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, as long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. Older people are more likely than younger ones to vote. At the 2017 general election, 59% of 20- to 24-year-olds voted, compared with 77% of 60- to 69-year-olds. However, about two-thirds of the more than 3.1 million people who registered to vote between the election being called and the registration deadline were under the age of 35, with more than a million of them under 25. Voting takes place at local polling stations, set up in places such as churches and school halls. Voters put a cross on the ballot paper beside the name of their chosen candidate and drop it into a sealed ballot box. Most people over 18 on polling day can stand as a candidate - as long as they are a British citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizen resident in the UK. They must also pay a Â£500 deposit, which will be lost if they do not get at least 5% of the votes in their constituency. Candidates must meet certain conditions - prisoners, civil servants, judges and members of the police and armed forces cannot stand. A total of 3,322 candidates are standing across the 650 seats this year. There are 91 Davids standing for election - the most popular name among the candidates - while the first female name on the list is Sarah in 18th place. There are 22 candidates with that first name standing. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected, even if they are chosen by less than half the electorate in their seat. Most MPs represent a political party but some stand for election as independent candidates. Any party with more than half the MPs (326) in the Commons usually forms the government. Parties with well below 50% of the national vote can take power as a result of theUK's voting system. The UK uses a first past the post voting system. It means a local candidate who receives the most votes wins â and the party with the most winning candidates forms a government. So the overall number of votes parties get nationally does not have any bearing on who wins the election. If no party has a majority of MPs, the one with the most can form a coalition - or partnership - with one or more other parties to gain control. The prime minister is not directly voted for by the public. He or she is chosen by the winning party's MPs and appointed bythe Queen, who is duty bound to follow their advice. The Queen is the UKâs head of state, although she is not in charge of the government. Elizabeth II is the countryâs longest-serving monarch, having ascended to the throne in 1952. She performs state duties, which include formally opening Parliament, representing the country at events such as the annual Remembrance Day parade, and making official visits overseas. She is also head of the armed forces and Church of England. Detailed proposals for everything from the economy to defence and policing are set out before any general election inmanifestos. A manifesto is basically a brochure containing all of a party's ideas and policies. Manifestos are usually published during the general election campaign. If a party wins the election, it is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver as a government. These come from the UK's political parties - groups of people with similar political beliefs who come together to try to win power. The issues UK voters care most about have changed a lot, according to the polls. TheNational Health Service (NHS)and immigration were the things that most concerned voters in 2015. The National Health Service (NHS), which started in 1948, is the government-funded national healthcare service that provides free diagnosis and treatment for UK citizens. TheEuropean Union (EU)was of far less interest. European Union: the political and economic union of 28 member states, which the UK is planning to leave. Now, however,Brexit- the UK's departure from the EU - is a huge issue. Short for British exit - refers to the UK leaving the European Union. Neither the Conservative orLabourparties had enough votes to form a majority government after the 2017 election. The Labour Party was founded by the trade union movement in 1900 to give workers a voice in Parliament. It believes in the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, greater rights for working people and strong, state-run public services. The Conservatives were the bigger of the two parties and formed a partnership with the Democratic Unionist PartyDUPin order to win votes in the Commons. The Democratic Unionist Party was founded in 1971, during the time of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. As unionists, the DUP support Northern Ireland being part of the UK and are known for their socially conservative beliefs on abortion and same-sex marriage. After the 2017 election, DUP MPs helped keep the Conservatives in power by agreeing to support them in Commons votes. Since the election, the Conservatives and Labour have both lost MPs, while theLiberal Democratshave made gains. Often called the Lib Dems, the Liberal Democrats were formed in 1988 by the merger of one of Britain's oldest political institutions, the Liberal Party, which stood for free trade and individual liberty, and the Social Democratic Party, a centrist offshoot of the Labour Party. The party likes to see itself as being on the centre ground of British politics. Parliament's second chamber is theHouse of Lords. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. It is independent from the House of Commons but shares with it the role of making laws, while it also checks the governmentâs work. Members are given a title, such as Lord, are not elected, do not represent constituencies and most do not belong to any party. Its members are not elected but are appointed by the Queen, on the prime minister's advice. On general election day, voting takes place between 07:00 and 22:00. The results are declared through the night and the following day. When the overall result is known, the leader of the winning party, if there is one, visits Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Once they have that, which is a formality, they return to the traditional home of the prime minister10 Downing Street. This terraced house is the official residence and office of the UK prime minister. Often they will stand outside to deliver a speech about their party's plans for the coming years.

"Annie Hall's family said: âWe are in great shock and grieving"" A woman swept to her death by a flooded river was Derbyshire's former High Sheriff Annie Hall, police have said. Her body was pulled from the River Derwent near Matlock on Friday, as persistent rain caused floods acrossYorkshire and the Midlands. Derbyshire Chief Constable Peter Goodman said he was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the death of his friend. Seven severe flood warnings - deemed a threat to life - remain in place on the River Don in South Yorkshire. Flooding has caused evacuations and travel disruption, with trains still not running in parts of the East Midlands. In a statement, Mrs Hall's family said: ""We are in great shock and grieving."" This video can not be played Drone footage filmed from Matlock shows the extent of the floodwater Services are cancelled on the Matlock-Derby-Nottingham route and diversions are in place between Derby and Chesterfield, adding about 30 minutes to journeys. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said it had declared a major incident on Friday night, and said it had carried out more than 160 rescues over 24 hours. Deputy chief fire officer Alex Johnson advised people to ""keep themselves safe, help each other and don't drive into floodwater"". Residents from 12 homes in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, are still unable to return home after a mudslide on Thursday led to 35 properties being evacuated. The River Derwent burst its banks in Derby city centre In Derby city centre, officials considered a city-wide evacuation as authorities saw the River Derwent swell to record levels of 3.35m (11ft). The bus station was temporarily evacuated on Friday evening, and some major roads remain flooded. In Worksop, Nottinghamshire, water levels are receding after 200 homes and businesses were evacuated on Thursday evening. Bassetlaw District Council said it had closed its emergency rest centre as everyone who had left their homes were with friends and relatives. The River Don, which flows through Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster, hit its highest recorded level at just over 6.3m (21ft), higher than it was in 2007 when it also flooded. Rescuers used boats to reach people trapped in Rotherham People continued to be rescued from flood-hit towns and cities on Friday. One man told the BBC he carried children from his gym in Rotherham through flooded streets. ""The whole of the gym was completely flooded in water,"" said Neil Wilson. ""We had to wade through water to get children to the cars so they could get home with their parents."" In pictures: Rain floods parts of northern England How do you stop flooding? Dozens sleep at shopping centre amid floods One of the most severely hit areas was Bentley, Doncaster, where flooding affected many homes 12 years ago. This video can not be played This home in Fishlake, near Doncaster, has been left nearly submerged in floodwater One resident told BBC Radio Sheffield: ""The worry is our insurance policies are expensive as it is because of the 2007 floods, so now we're all worried whether we're going to get reinsured."" Reporter Richard Cadey said some residents were ""angry and frustrated"" at Doncaster Council - claiming it had not been providing sandbags early enough to prevent properties from flooding. A rest facility has been set up by the council at the Salvation Army centre in the town. Flooding has caused disruption in the region since Thursday evening,when dozens of shoppers were left stranded in the Meadowhall Shopping Centreafter torrential downpours. Sheffield has had 84mm of rain over the past 36 hours, which is the near the average monthly rainfall for Yorkshire. Prime Minister Boris Johnson helping with the clean up in Matlock on Friday evening On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Matlock, close to where Mrs Hall died. He said the town could expect ""extra help from the government"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn visited flood-hit Conisbrough, near Doncaster, on Saturday and warned the UK could expect more extreme weather due to climate change. ""Obviously we need much better flood management and prevention schemes,"" he said.
