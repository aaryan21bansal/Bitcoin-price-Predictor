"Preeti Desai found the creature on a Texas beach and asked Twitter for help identifying it A mysterious fanged sea creature that washed up on a beach in Texas following Hurricane Harvey has been identified. Preeti Desai found the decaying fish on a beach in Texas City, and asked Twitter for help. She posted several photos with the caption: ""Okay, biology twitter, what the heck is this?"" Her request was passed to biologist and eel specialist Dr Kenneth Tighe, who believes it is a fangtooth snake-eel. He said,externalit may also be a garden or conger eel, because ""all three of these species occur off Texas and have large fang-like teeth"". Allow Twitter content?

It is thought thatHurricane Harvey, which brought strong winds and flooding to Texas, could explain why the creature was washed up. The fangtooth snake-eel, also known as a ""tusky"" eel, is usually found in waters between 30 and 90 metres deep in the western Atlantic ocean. Ms Desai, who was at the beach assessing the damage from the hurricane, told the BBC:  ""It was completely unexpected, it's not something that you'd typically see on a beach. I thought it could be something from the deep sea that might have washed on to shore.""

Ms Desai said she posted the images on Twitter because she knows a lot of scientists use it, and a friend soon responded and contacted Dr Tighe. ""I follow a lot of scientists and researchers. There's such a great community of these folks that are very helpful, especially when it comes to answering questions about the world or identifying animals and plants,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Florida nursing home survivors evacuated Eight people at a Florida nursing home that was left without power for days after Hurricane Irma have died. Police evacuated 115 residents on Wednesday from the facility, whose air conditioning was cut by the storm. Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief said three were found dead at the nursing home in the city of Hollywood. Five others died in hospital. Ten million people are still without power in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas after Hurricane Irma. The storm - which has claimed more than two dozen lives in the US - struck southwestern Florida on Sunday morning as a category four hurricane before weakening to a tropical depression on Monday. Irma earlier left a trail of destruction in the Caribbean, where nearly 40 people were killed. Cuba stunned and suffering 'Island looks like a bomb site' Why did Caribbean get worst of storm? Hollywood Police Chief Tomas Sanchez said the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills facility has been sealed off and police are conducting a criminal investigation. State investigators from the Florida Office of Attorney General were also at the scene, city officials said in a statement. ""It may be related to a loss of power in the storm,"" Mr Sanchez said, adding that officers were checking in on 42 other assisted living facilities and nursing homes throughout the city. Florida Governor Rick Scott also ordered emergency workers to check on nursing homes and assisted living facilities to ensure residents are safe. ""This situation is unfathomable,"" he said. Hollywood Fire Rescue found several patients ""in varying degree of medical distress and immediately began treatment"" when they arrived at the Hollywood Hills facility on Wednesday morning, according to the city's statement. Some residents there awoke sick,the Miami Herald reported,external. Kitchen worker Jean Lindor told the newspaper a generator allowed staff to cook but did not provide the facility with air conditioning. Rescue crews found several patients in ""medical distress"" Temperatures on Tuesday in Hollywood reached 32C (90F), according to theNational Weather Service,external. The nursing home has had brushes with the regulators in recent years for violating federal rules on its power system, a generator and because of a faulty alarm,according to records,external. The Florida Health Care Association called Wednesday's deaths a ""profound tragedy within the larger tragedy of Hurricane Irma"". Bobby Owens, 84 Manuel Mario Medieta, 96 Miguel Antonio Franco, 92 Estella Hendricks, 71 Gail Nova, 71 Carolyn Eatherly, 78 Betty Hibbard, 84 Albertina Vega, 99 The facility is not the only Florida nursing home that has been left without power by Irma. Rare animals survive devastation In pictures: Irma blasts Florida An estimated 150 facilities out of the nearly 700 in the state are currently without full power services, the association said. Popular with retirees, Florida is home to more than 680 nursing homes, which house about 73,000 residents, according to the Florida Health Care Association. Assisted living facilities across the state serve an additional 92,000 residents. But concern for the safety of Florida's 3.6 million senior citizens is growing as officials struggle to restore power amid sweltering temperatures. The association said it was working with officials to prioritise ""the locations with the greatest need"". Power has yet to be restored at 150 of the nearly 700 of Florida's assisted living facilities, officials say Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said officials were providing ice to 27 senior residence facilities still without power,local media reported,external. More than half of a large retirement community in Pembroke Pines, Florida, still had no electricity by Wednesday afternoon, leaving elderly residents stuck in rooms with no access to lifts. Pembroke Pines police spokeswoman Amanda Conwell told the Miami Herald that officers were at the scene. She said some of the 15,000 residents at Century Village were vulnerable and ""we are concerned about their welfare"".

Cape Coral Shores kept 20 elderly patients during the storm because local emergency shelters had been evacuated as Irma bore down on the coast. At least six people appeared to die of carbon monoxide poisoning from generators in Florida, the AP news agency reported. Damage mapped Florida assesses cost of Hurricane Irma More than 100 prisoners escaped during Irma Florida residents are counting the cost of Irma's destruction.

"Aston Villa first team squad photo 1988-89, featuring manager Graham Taylor (bottom, centre) and Dave Richardson (next to him) Ex-Aston Villa manager Graham Taylor was warned about the abuse of young players in the 1980s, the FA's inquiry into sexual abuse has been told. One victim told the Victoria Derbyshire show he was advised to ""sweep it under the carpet"" rather than tell police. A new document appears to show paedophile Ted Langford worked as a scout for Villa almost two years after staff were first warned about him. A club spokesman said safeguarding was of ""paramount importance"". This video can not be played 'They told me to sweep it under the carpet' Langford, who is now dead, was convicted in 2007 of historical abuse against four boys, three of whom were linked to Aston Villa football club. Tony Brien - who has waived his right to anonymity - revealed on the Victoria Derbyshire programme in January that he was abused numerous times by Langford while playing for a local youth team from the age of 12. Aged 16, Mr Brien was signed for Leicester City by then youth team manager Dave Richardson, recommended by Langford, who was a part-time scout for the club. Two years later, in the summer of 1987, Mr Richardson joined Aston Villa as assistant manager and Langford moved with him. Later that season Mr Brien said he decided to call Mr Richardson to warn him about the scout's behaviour. Mr Brien, aged 18 or 19 at the time, claimed he had a number of conversations with Mr Richardson and later a single conversation with manager Graham Taylor, but was put off from going public with the allegations. In oral evidence to the FA's independent inquiry into sexual abuse, he said: ""They discouraged me from going forward and never offered me a chance to go to the police or anything like that. ""I went into the kitchen at my mum's and my mum said, 'Well?'  And I just said, 'They just told me to sweep it underneath the carpet.'  And I burst into tears."" In his interview with Victoria Derbyshire, Mr Brien added that Mr Taylor had said to him: ""Look, you're a young lad starting out in the game. I know you've just made your debut. Could you really be dealing with all the obscenities from the terraces? So I just suggest you sweep it under the carpet."" Mr Brien played for Leicester City and number of other league clubs. He never played for Aston Villa. In December 2016 he first gave a police statement outlining allegations against Langford and the response of Aston Villa FC. Graham Taylor died of a heart attack in January. Dave Richardson told the Victoria Derbyshire programme in January that he could not recall having a conversation with Tony Brien and strongly denied he would have advised the player he should not go public. Ted Langford was sentenced to three years in prison in 2007 for sexual abuse between 1976 and 1989. ""The bottom line is once he'd rung me, [I would have said] 'We're dealing with it, it will be dealt with in such a way whereby you don't have to worry',"" he said at the time. ""I wouldn't brush it under the carpet."" The BBC now understands a second victim of abuse, who wishes to remain anonymous, has come forward saying he made similar complaints about Langford in the late 1980s. His lawyer said he was visited at his house by someone he now believes to be Graham Taylor, and another unidentified man, who he says both deterred him from taking the matter any further. ""They should have done more to protect children in their care,"" said Dino Nocivelli from solicitors Bolt Burdon Kemp. ""My clients have been let down and other children have been abused due to the lack of action from Villa staff."" Mr Richardson said in a statement issued in January through his lawyers that he was first made aware of ""alarming allegations"" against Langford shortly after he joined Aston Villa in the summer of 1987. He said he spoke to Graham Taylor and chairman Doug Ellis and an internal investigation took place. ""I took these extremely seriously and began making inquiries. These led me to speak to the parents of two young footballers at Aston Villa who each told me their sons had been abused by Ted Langford,"" he said. This letter given to the Victoria Derbyshire programme suggests that Langford was still acting as the club's official representative until at least March 1989. Mr Richardson said the parents involved did not want the matter reported to the police but, after consulting with Mr Taylor and Mr Ellis, Langford was sacked by the club. He said earlier this year that he acted ""rapidly"" to deal with the situation. ""As soon as we got more information, as soon as I knew, we brought him in and we got him out of the way,"" he said. But the programme has now seen a document that shows Langford was still acting as the club's official representative until at least March 1989, almost two years after Mr Richardson said he was first made aware of the allegations. When asked to respond to the latest information obtained by the programme, Mr Richardson said he did not consider it appropriate to comment while the FA independent inquiry was continuing. He said he would co-operate with the inquiry if he was asked to do so. It is not clear what happened to Langford after he was sacked by Aston Villa although it is thought he continued to work in junior football in the Birmingham area. In 2007, the scout was convicted of a range of sexual offences against boys that took place between 1976 and 1989. He died in 2012 after his release from prison. A spokesman for Aston Villa said: ""Aston Villa would encourage anyone with any allegation or concern regarding safeguarding or other potential wrongdoing to contact the relevant authorities. ""Allegations relating to Ted Langford and involving the club are subject to ongoing legal proceedings and it is therefore not appropriate for the club to comment further on this matter."" Former chairman Doug Ellis, now 93, could not be reached for comment. Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

"The aircraft is capable of transmitting high definition images - day or night Two multi-million pound British Army drones crashed after taking off from a base in mid Wales, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed. The unmanned Watchkeeper aircraft were lost in the Irish Sea earlier this year, leading commanders to temporarily ground the entire fleet. Flight trials resumed at Aberporth Airport in Ceredigion in early July. The crashes are the latest in aseries of accidentsand delays to have hit the Army's new spy planes. The MoD ordered 54 Watchkeepers in 2005 as part of an Â£847m deal. Originally, it was hoped they would be in service by 2010. A recent report from theUK infrastructure and projects authority,externalsaid the project had already cost Â£1.1bn. Delays have been blamed on technical and safety issues and a lack of trained personnel. The MoD said despite the crashes, it hoped to bring the aircraft into full service by the end of the year. A spokesman said: ""Inquiries into the specific incidents are ongoing as they look to learn all they can from the events"". A demonstration was held outside the airport on Wednesday The Watchkeeper has proved controversial and protests have been held at Aberpoth Airport by peace campaigners. Harry Rogers, who runs Drones Campaign Network Cymru, is concerned about their safety. He said: ""There's been two previous incidents, one crashed into the runway about three years ago and another one crashed into the road outside the base and hit a parked car. No one was in the car but there could have been. ""The main reason people are opposed to drones in this area is the noise and the surveillance issue. People are worried about their privacy."" But business owner Derfel Thomas said he had ""benefitted business wise"" from the airport. ""We've sold them specially-built trailers and we maintain their tractor. Across 12 months we do a fair bit with them,"" he said. ""We have to support anybody that creates work.""

"The army has been landing aid vehicles on Anguilla's Sandy Bay Village beach The UK's Â£13bn aid budget cannot be used to help the British overseas territories hit by Hurricane Irma, the BBC has learned. Under international aid rules, Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and the British Virgin Islands are considered too wealthy to qualify for assistance. Instead, the UK's emergency relief will have to be funded by various budgets from across government. The governmenthas pledged Â£57m so farto help with recovery efforts. The Department for International Development denied that its response to the crisis had been affected by any budgetary considerations. In a statement it said: ""This is an unprecedented disaster. It is absolutely right that the UK responded immediately to the people affected. ""This has been our primary focus and continues to be our priority. We are looking at how the current overseas aid rules apply to disasters such as this one."" There are very strict international rules about what officially counts as foreign aid. These are agreed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, of which Britain is a member. What are the UK's commitments to overseas territories? Aerial footage shows destruction on British Virgin Islands And these rules make clear that only the poorest countries can receive what is known as official development assistance or ODA. The OECD confirmed that Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and the British Virgin Islands do not qualify for this official aid. Their national incomes are too high. The Royal Marines have been helping to repair damage at the Princess Alexandra hospital in Anguilla One well-placed minister told me this made it harder for the government to raise the funds needed - and he claimed five times as much money would have been available if the official pot of aid could have been used. ""These millions (announced by the government) are non-ODA,"" he said. ""Therefore they come from rather scanty resources. ""This great pot of ODA, necessary for development, needs to be spent on crises like this and we have to find a way of doing it."" The Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson visited the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla and promised Â£25m more relief money - on top of the Â£32m already being spent in the region. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You can't but be affected by the scale of the devastation"" The Department for International Development insisted that the fact that the territories were not eligible for official development assistance had not affected the UK's emergency relief. And officials categorically denied that five times as much money would have been available if ODA could have been used. A DFID source said: ""Claims that we could have provided five times as much money are absolute nonsense. These are British people on British territories and in times of crisis we stand by them. ""Absolutely nothing held us back in sending help. Our response was based on need alone."" The problem for the future is that a lot more money is going to be needed to help the long-term reconstruction of the three territories and that will put a huge strain on government budgets if official aid cannot be used. The MoD says it is funding its response from cross-government funds. In Haiti, many roads were blocked or damaged by the storm, hindering recovery operations It has also emerged that the group of charities that form the Disasters Emergency Committee are refusing to launch an emergency appeal for the three British territories. The committee said that the scale of the damage on the islands did not justify an appeal. In a statement, the DEC said: ""Many of the islands that have been affected are supported by wealthy nations such as the UK, France and the US, and those governments are providing the assistance needed. ""The DEC and its members have been closely monitoring poorer islands such as Haiti, but the current assessment is that the scale of the long-term damage to infrastructure and livelihoods is not at the level which justifies DEC members collectively appealing to the UK public for funds.""

"Theresa May will travel to Florence to make a speech on Brexit in a move likely to be seen as a bid to break the deadlock in negotiations. The prime minister will give the speech on 22 September, days before Brexit negotiations resume in Brussels. Downing Street said the PM will underline the UK's wish for a ""special partnership"" with the EU after Brexit. The EU has criticised UK negotiators, claiming progress on Britain's divorce deal has been too slow. Speculation about Mrs May's speech was sparked when EU Parliament negotiator Guy Verhofstadt claimed an ""important intervention"" would be made by the PM. The fourth round of talks will begin on 25 September after they were pushed back by a week. Mrs May's official spokesman denied that the delay was caused by the timing of the PM's speech. ""Both sides settled on the date for that round after discussions between senior officials in recognition that more time would give negotiators flexibility to make further progress,"" he said. Downing Street declined to discuss the content of Mrs May's speech, beyond saying that she will give an ""update on Brexit negotiations so far"" and will ""underline the government's wish for a deep and special partnership with the European Union once the UK leaves the EU"".

"This video can not be played Nick Clegg tells ITV's Lorraine Kelly that advances in chemotherapy are remarkable ""but it is still a very brutal thing"" Former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his wife, Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, have spoken for the first time about their son's treatment for cancer. Antonio, now 15, was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma last September. After treatment at University College Hospital in London, including chemotherapy, he is now in remission. His parents told ITV's Lorraine programme how telling their eldest son he had blood cancer was one of the ""toughest things"" the family had faced. ""It is like a word bomb - certainly if you are not familiar with it, as we were not,"" said Mr Clegg. ""Your initial reaction, as we found, was like any mum or dad - it is irrational but you almost have this physical wish to take it off your kid and take it yourself."" The teenagers growing up with cancer Ms Gonzalez Durantez said Antonio had gone to his GP after finding a small lump on his neck, which had not been particularly painful. ""We were very lucky that he [the GP] spotted that it could be something more serious,"" she told host Lorraine Kelly. ""We dealt with it by carrying on and trying to keep things as close to the routine that we had beforehand and also being very open. ""The day that he was told, and I think that probably us telling him is one of the toughest things that we have ever done, the following day he went to school, he stood up and he told everybody, 'I have cancer.' ""That's the way he dealt with it, but other children and other families deal with it in a different way, you have to find your way."" Mr Clegg said: ""His lymphoma was all over his chest and his neck and he gets tested every three months, I think for a couple of years, so there is always a slight spike of anxiety with us every three months, but basically he is on the road to recovery. ""Interestingly, the thing he was most concerned about was sort of falling behind his classmates. His anxiety was more about keeping up with his classmates, keeping up at school. So, it was very impressive actually."" He added the couple's other children, Alberto and Miguel, had taken the news well. ""Once they heard from us that he will be OK, again they are just so, so practical - just, 'OK then,'"" he said. Mr Clegg praised the way Antonio had handled the diagnosis and treatment, which resulted in severe side effects including hair loss, vomiting and fatigue. Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma, cancer of the lymph circulation system Symptoms can include enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, under the arm or in the groin It is the most common cancer among children and young people More than 1,100 people under the age of 24 are diagnosed in the UK every year The Cleggs are trying to raise awareness of the charity Bloodwise, whichlaunched a report on Wednesday urging more research into less toxic treatments,externalfor children with cancer. Ms Gonzalez Durantez said: ""[With] chemotherapy, they poison your body so that you can get cured and it's a shock to see it happen. ""We do realise how incredibly lucky we are both with the fact that the treatment has worked and how well he seems."" Dr Alasdair Rankin, Bloodwise's director of research, said: ""The reality is that one in five children diagnosed with the most common type of leukaemia still do not survive, and that those who do often experience devastating side effects both during and after treatment. ""This is simply not good enough. We need to save every child's life, make the treatment process much kinder and give them the life they would have had without cancer.""

"Facial recognition technology was used at Notting Hill Carnival The ""rapid"" growth of a police facial recognition database could lead to innocent people being unfairly targeted, a watchdog has warned. Biometrics Commissioner Paul Wiles said the Police National Database (PND) now had at least 19 million custody photographs on it. But it is thought that hundreds of thousands are of innocent people. The Home Office said police should delete images of unconvicted people if asked to do so. Prof Wiles said that police have taken ""mug shots"" of people upon arresting them since Victorian times, but technical developments today - which allow digital pictures to be uploaded to a searchable national database - have moved ""much faster"" than the legislation. Pictures of people who are entitled to the presumption of innocence - that is those who have not been convicted - are being kept on a national file for up to six years, he said. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it's very worrying because if we're not careful the public will lose confidence in the police."" In a government review published in February, the Home Office concluded that those who are not convicted have the right to request that their custody image is deleted from all police databases. A High Court ruling in 2012 said retaining the custody images of unconvicted people amounted to a breach of human rights. The PND contains custody images, taken at police stations after someone is arrested. Of these, more than 16 million have been enrolled in a gallery which can be searched using facial recognition software, including pictures of individuals who are released without charge or later cleared. Prof Wiles told the BBC that new biometrics - such as voice and facial recognition - can be ""equally useful"" to the police as DNA and fingerprinting, adding that the police ""are quite right to be experimenting with this"". But he warned that there was a ""legislative deficit"" around them which needs to be addressed first. He pointed out in his annual report that facial imaging was also being used in public places, including to check Notting Hill carnival-goers against a watch list. ""The use of facial images by the police has gone far beyond using them for custody purposes,"" he said. Prof Wiles, who has held the post since last year, warned wrongful allegations could occur from the ""very rapid growth"" of the database. Currently, different forces use their own systems to upload images to the central database, with ""varying degrees of image quality"", the report said. ""This situation could easily produce differential decision making and potentially runs the risk of false intelligence or wrongful allegations,"" it added. Prof Wiles, whose job is to scrutinise how police and other authorities retain information including DNA samples, profiles and fingerprints, said hundreds of thousands of innocent people were on the PND. This is because they were later released or cleared in court, but never deleted from the database. But Prof Wiles pointed out that police have the discretion to refuse such a request and warned that the ""complex"" proposals could result in a ""postcode lottery"". He said: ""I have said that to the government [that] I think what they've put in place is a much more complicated process - that would be much simpler if deletion was simply automatic."" Renate Samson, chief executive of Big Brother Watch, welcomed the watchdog's warnings, saying: ""It is of very serious concern that the Home Office appear to be so unwaveringly set on embedding facial biometric recognition technology into policing without debate, regulation, legislation or independent scrutiny.""

"Brook House is operated privately by G4S on behalf of the Home Office Documents seen by the BBC's Panorama suggest G4S has been making significant profits from running two immigration removal centres near Gatwick Airport. One, Brook House, was the focus of a Panorama investigation,which exposed chaos, bullying and the abusive treatment of detaineesby some staff. The BBC has seen a presentation stating G4S earned more than Â£2.4m in pre-tax profits from the centre in 2013. G4S said the sum was ""significantly overstated"". The company said the figures were based on ""incomplete information"", adding: ""The Home Office has full access to financial information regarding the contract performance. ""Substantial savings have been passed on to the Home Office over the life of the Brook House contract."" Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, said G4S had ""serious questions"" to answer about its profits. ""Clearly it would be unacceptable for a private company to be making excessive profits out of a contract where there appears to have been abuse taking place,"" she said. The BBC has seen a slide presentation, dated January 2014, that was shown to senior G4S managers. It states that in 2013 the company made a profit of just under 20% before tax on the running of Brook House Immigration Removal Centre near Gatwick - a figure of more than Â£2.4m. What I saw when I went undercover at Brook House It is understood that the original agreement with the Home Office envisaged that the company would make significantly less. The BBC has also seen more financial documents for a number of years from the period 2009 to 2016 which suggest the company has been making significant profits. The slide presentation states that in 2013 Tinsley House Immigration Removal centre, which shares the site at Gatwick with Brook House, made a profit of 27.3% before tax, about Â£1.5m. Separately, a former senior manager with the company has told the BBC that he sat in meetings where those profits were discussed. Nathan Ward,who quit the company in April 2014, said profits were ""far in excess of what was meant to be made"" from the Brook House contract. ""During those meetings profit margins at the end of the year that I left were declared at around 20% for the Brook House contract,"" he said. Mr Ward, who is now a priest, said people would be asked not to recruit staff in order to save money. ""And actually the motive behind it for managers locally was that if you didn't make the profit you didn't get your bonus,"" he said. He added: ""If you are not recruiting the staff you need you have to offer overtime to existing staff who are already working extraordinarily long shifts."" He said this put staff ""under more stress"" and made them less able to deal with people in their care in a ""decent humane way"". Nathan Ward is now a priest The Home Office said it was ""committed"" to ensuring immigration removal centre contractors provided a high level of service to detainees and value for money to the taxpayer. ""The G4S contract for Brook House and Tinsley House is no exception,"" it said. The Home Office said G4S, like other firms contracted by the government, were required to meet set service standards - including ensuring minimum staffing levels are met and providing quarterly financial reports to the Home Office and Cabinet Office. It added: ""Savings identified by G4S through smarter working practices have been, and continue to be, reported to the Home Office."" After the BBC shared the slideshow with the Home Office, a spokesperson responded: ""We do not recognise the profit margins quoted and they do not reflect those reported to the Home Office, which include all overheads and shared services."" Callum Tulley, 21, agreed to go undercover at Brook House Last week, an undercover investigation by BBC One's Panorama showed staff working in Brook House Immigration Removal Centre under huge pressure - with drugs rife and self-harm common place amongst detainees awaiting deportation. A 21-year-old detainee custody officer, Callum Tulley, had become so concerned by what he was seeing he decided to blow the whistle. Wearing a secret camera, he was able to capture on film a chaotic place. Some officers were doing their best in difficult circumstances, others were seen bullying, abusing, and in one case allegedly choking a detainee. G4S has suspended 10 staff whilst it investigates the allegations made in the programme. An 11th person, who now works for the Home Office, has also been suspended from his job.

"Paterson is serving a 20-year sentence for wounding patients About 750 victims of rogue breast surgeon Ian Paterson are to be paid compensation from a new Â£37m fund. Private healthcare firm Spire has agreed to pay Â£27.2m, with Â£10m coming from Paterson's insurers and the Heart of England NHS Trust. Paterson wasfound guiltyof 17 counts of wounding with intent in April after a trial at Nottingham Crown Court. In August, he had his 15-year jail term increased to 20 years after the Appeal Court ruled his term was too lenient. This video can not be played Ian Paterson: CV reveals ""a rogue and a medical conman"" The payments concern patients treated at private Spire Healthcare hospitals in the West Midlands, who Paterson worked for when he carried out hundreds of botched operations. The fund is intended to halt legal proceedings by patients against the group and account for any new claims. Surgeon 'psychopathic like Shipman' Surgeon 'played God' with women's bodies 'He took a pound of flesh for money' Heart of England NHS Trust was part of the civil action because patients said it failed to notify Spire of Paterson's dangerous methods discovered while working for Solihull Hospital. The NHS has already paid out Â£9.49m in damages, as well as Â£8.31m costs, to hundreds of others treated by Paterson, 59, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester. Ian Paterson's victims fall broadly into two camps. Those who underwent unnecessary surgery, and those who did need operations but were left prone to cancer returning because of the untried technique he used. The criminal trial dealt with cases from the first group - nine women and a man who were either subjected to intrusive surgery or had their breasts removed despite there being no evidence that there was anything wrong them. The civil case which was settled today involved the many others whose cases did not come to court, as well as those who were treated using something called a cleavage-sparing operation in which tumours were removed but potentially cancerous tissue was left behind. The technique was something that was only ever performed by Paterson and never properly tested. The surgeon's trial heard he wildly exaggerated his patients' cancer symptoms, leading them to have several needless operations which left them scarred for life physically and emotionally. Fellow medics at Solihull Hospital first raised concerns about his conduct in 2002 when it emerged Paterson, who grew up in County Down, Northern Ireland, was carrying out unregulated'cleavage-sparing' mastectomieson cancer patients, which left them at higher risk of the disease returning. Despite three reports into his actions, he carried on working until 2011 when he was suspended by the trust. The payout concerns patients treated at private Spire Healthcare hospitals in the West Midlands Hundreds of Paterson's private patients were due to take their case for compensation to the High Court in October. In its statement, Spire said the agreement was conditional on all parties agreeing, and the court approving, the terms of a formal court order. It said the order would also ""provide for a portion of the fund to be set aside to provide compensation for any former patient of Mr Paterson who has not yet brought a legitimate claim against Spire Healthcare and the other defendants, but does so prior to 30 October 2018."" Simon Gordon, interim chief executive at Spire, said: ""Earlier this year a criminal court decided that Ian Paterson must bear responsibility for his actions, finding him guilty of assaulting a number of his patients. ""He behaved with clear criminal intent and abused the trust of those who looked to him for his care and relied upon his expertise."" This video can not be played What is cleavage-sparing surgery? Mr Gordon added: ""However, whilst nothing diminishes Mr Paterson's responsibility for his actions, these events took place in our hospitals, and this should not have happened. ""We accept that better clinical governance in the private hospitals where Mr Paterson practised, as well as in his NHS trust, might have led to action being taken sooner, and it is right that we have made a material contribution to the settlement announced today. ""We have apologised unreservedly to Mr Paterson's patients for their suffering and distress and we would like to repeat that apology."" Emma Doughty, a specialist medical negligence lawyer from Slater and Gordon, which represents more than 100 of Paterson's victims, said no financial settlement would heal the physical and mental scars inflicted on their clients but added they were relieved to have won their battle for justice. Lawyers Irwin Mitchell, which represents 30 patients, echoed the sentiment but said questions still remain about the redress that private healthcare patients have if they are the victims of negligent treatment. It also said the sum set aside by Spire is likely to be less than the patients will need.

" Elon Musk's SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches from Cape Canaveral From its early days with the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and Yuri Gagarin’s flight in 1961, human exploration of space has been dominated by the Cold War rivalry between the USSR and US - and in particular the race to be first to the Moon. Throughout this tumultuous struggle for the “high ground of space”, business took a back seat - it was governments that paid for and sustained the space effort. True, the world’s first commercial satellite - Early Bird - had been launched in 1965 but until recently the commercial development of space was largely limited to big telecommunications satellites. Costing several hundred million dollars each and weighing several tonnes, these satellites are designed to last up to 15 years so investors can recoup the expense of building them in the first place. But a revolution has been taking place. Technological advances are overturning traditional models for operating in space. A host of firms are promising cheaper access to space, with innovations such as renewable rockets and horizontal launch systems. Satellites are getting smaller and becoming cheaper to build – and there are now about 1,500 of them orbiting above us. A flood of data and imagery is flowing from space and new players are now processing, interpreting – and marketing - this information revolution. “We can now do something in a shoebox that previously would have taken the size of a bus,” says Stuart Martin, chief executive of Satellite Applications Catapult, a UK business incubator helping space start-ups. That means we can really change and rethink the way we use space.” Investment is pouring into the space sector. In 2016, the global space economy totalled $329bn with three-quarters of that coming from commercial activity – not governments. Rockets are our gateway to space, the essential delivery trucks. To outsiders they encapsulate our endeavours to become a true spacefaring civilisation. And indeed when it comes to rockets, it’s billionaires who are leading the way. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is using its Falcon 9 rockets to supply the International Space Station, while Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is developing its New Shepard and New Glenn launchers. Both firms have demonstrated revolutionary techniques which enable vertical landing – a significant step in the drive for reusable rockets. Meanwhile Richard Branson’s Virgin Group is working on developing launching satellites from the air – alongside its plans for sub-orbital tourist flights. One new player hoping to change the way in which space is used is New Zealand’s Rocket Lab. Still in its infancy, it is the only rocket firm in the world with its own launch complex, on North Island’s Mahia Peninsula. At the moment, no launch companies work purely on a commercial basis.  “They are all heavily government subsidised one way or another,” says Stuart Martin. While rockets haven’t changed that much since Sputnik in 1957 - you still have to get your payload out of the Earth’s gravity and into orbit - it would be a mistake to think of Rocket Lab as simply another traditional rocket manufacturer, argues founder Peter Beck. The whole purpose of the company is not to build rockets [but] to enable access to space...The kind of access and frequency to space we’re proposing has never ever been created.” Currently the average cost of a satellite launch is about $200m, and in the US last year, for example, there were just 22 launches. Peter Beck says once his rocket is operational he’s looking to go to space for $5m, and “as frequently as once a week”. At the heart of Rocket Lab’s sales pitch is its Electron rocket, designed specially to take small satellites into orbit. The rocket is mainly carbon fibre and its engines are all 3D-printed. Whereas it would normally take months to produce an engine, “we can produce it in 24 hours,” says Beck. In its first test flight this May, the rocket successfully entered space but did not reach orbit. Two more test flights are planned. At the moment, small satellite makers often hitch rides on existing launches, which have a big satellite as their main cargo but still have some room to spare. However, with demand for Earth observation increasing - weather, travel, maps - manufacturers need flexible ways to arrange getting into space. It is this gap that Beck says Rocket Lab is planning to fill. Instead of waiting for a suitable space on a big rocket,  “now you can just go online and click a few buttons and you’ve bought a launch”. One firm keen to use Rocket Lab’s Electron launcher is San Francisco’s Planet Labs, which designs and builds its own miniature “cube sats” weighing just 4kg. There is a big green field opportunity for fleets of small satellites that do a variety of missions.” Unlike traditional commercial communications satellites in high geostationary orbits, 35,700km (22,200 miles) above the Earth, Planet Lab’s satellites (called Doves) fly much lower at just 500km – that’s the distance from London to Cologne in Germany. This lower orbit means the spacecraft can use smaller cameras and still get decent image resolutions – bringing the weight and cost down to a fraction of traditional satellites. Being small and relatively cheap means new designs can be tested and built quickly, the firm says. “We have completely taken the supply constraints off and brought the costs of the pictures we’re taking down – in many orders of magnitude,” says Will Marshall. And he adds, that means not only lower prices for customers, but also ensures the data is available to a broader range of people. “It’s not just the governments and the big companies that can buy our data. Anyone [can] access our data – whether they’re a small or medium sized business, an NGO, or researcher at a university.” Planet Labs photo of Mailiao Refinery in Taiwan (Previous image: Singapore) Infra-red cameras revealed damage to crops from hail in Idaho, US The Kashagan oilfield in Kazakhstan where production restarted earlier this year The Kokpatas gold mine in Uzbekistan Repeated shots can reveal changes such as deforestation here in the Amazon Repeated shots can reveal changes such as deforestation here in the Amazon Images taken over time can indicate significant changes, such as deforestation here in the Amazon. Image Yet while developments in rockets and satellites - the hardware of space - often grab the headlines, the biggest changes are in the practical uses of the information which has been gathered. Farmers, and oil, gas and mining companies are already using such data. Farmers can be warned about problems with soil conditions that could help preparations for poor harvests; fishermen can be told about ocean temperatures and thus where to find fish. With increasingly accurate photographs, individual trees can be tracked as they are logged for timber – a valuable check on deforestation. One firm which is squeezing the maximum amount of information out of this flood of data is the UK’s Terrabotics. “In a normal image you’re limited by the pixel size, but there is rich information between pixels that is captured but that is not obvious,” says chief executive Gareth Morgan. “We do sub-pixel image processing before any more analytics is done on them, we super-resolve the images and make them into 3D data sets, then we put that into AI [artificial intelligence] systems. “We transform our images into signals, a bit like radio waves. That frees us from the constraints of the pixels.” “For instance, we can look at a mine and determine that it has changed – say it’s got deeper or the waste stockpile has become bigger.” (Terrabotics image of the Jwaneng diamond mine in Botswana are pictured.) Prize competitions are also driving disruptive innovations. The Ansari XPrize  encouraged inventors to develop a reusable manned spacecraft. And now the Google Lunar XPrize is offering $20m for the first team to land a robot craft on the Moon which can travel 500m and beam back images. It’s all about spurring innovation and new ways of thinking about space, says Rahul Narayan, the founder of Team Indus in Bangalore, who says he had no experience of space beforehand. “None of the people who started this had any background of space science, engineering, technology."" “It’s good that we didn’t,” he says, because if they had been space engineers “we would never undertake a challenge this big”. The first thing we did after we got selected was to go on Google and type in 'How do you land on the Moon?'” His team are now refining their 6kg lunar rover – one of the lightest ever set to land on a planetary body - which is scheduled for launch in the coming months. “For us it’s been a long journey,” he says, acknowledging the debt they owe to ISRO, the government-run Indian Space Research Organisation, some of whose retired scientists have been helping the mission. “To my mind they are the giants and we are a much smaller company on the shoulders of those giants,” he says. While getting a rover to the Moon may not have an immediate commercial payoff, Narayan argues that if the planned landing succeeds, it will be “a quantum step for every company, every private space company in the world, to go out there and do more stuff in the future”. It’s a vision of a world in which low-cost satellites are carried on affordable rockets that launch when you want – all ordered at the click of a button with no need to wait for slow-moving government-funded space missions. Yet this latest space race also presents its own challenges, says Terrabotics’ Gareth Morgan. The sheer volume of space imagery and data means that AI systems being used to automatically analyse it are having to catch up. “Current AI systems need an extraordinary amount of ‘label training’ so they can then independently recognise different features on their own. We need a change in the way AI works. Progress is being made but it is very new.” More information may generally be a good thing, but there are ethical considerations – after all, everyone is potentially being photographed from space every day. And who has access to this data? As private satellites proliferate and the big data revolution advances, critics argue there needs to be a debate about public and private roles in space. It’s a point that Planet Labs’ Will Marshall accepts. “One of the things that’s important to us is that our imagery cannot see a person let alone recognise a person. Of course that doesn’t mean there are no negative implications. “We as technologists have to be the best stewards we can of that data.” Then there is space debris – there are already some 30,000 objects, large and small, in orbit: “Ultimately we will have to deal with that problem,” agrees Will Marshall. “The industry will have to start bringing those things down and that’s not going to be an easy challenge.” While the potential rewards for investors may be great, so are the risks. Rockets can blow up, fail to launch, or put satellites into the wrong orbit. “Rockets aren’t the way you make money from space,” says Matt Perkins, who was for 10 years the chief executive of industry leader Surrey Satellites and is now head of Oxford University Innovation. “The way you make money is in the downstream end - by using all this information coming from space. As this becomes cheaper that’s going to open up commercial opportunities – with data being used in ways that people haven’t yet thought of.” As he says, there’s a whole range of data from space. In this new business frontier, it will be up to the ingenuity of humans to take commercial advantage of that. Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9953921
"The Skye bridge was opened in 1995 An MSP has questioned whether Skye is a ""real island"" on account of the bridge linking it to the mainland. But what is a ""real"" island? To put it another way, when is an island not an island? John Masonprovoked an audible intake of breathfrom the rural economy committee when he suggested that Skye ""doesn't have the problems of ferries and transport which real islands do"" on account of its bridge. The committee's convener Edward Mountain - not a real mountain - was quick to underline that ""I'm sure we can all agree that Skye is an island"", and Skye MSP Kate Forbes noted that ""we'd have to rewrite the Skye Boat Song"" if Mr Mason was right. But this is not the first row over what is or is not an island in Scotland. In 2011, Argyll and Bute Council saw its budget shrink due to Seil being declared no longer deserving of island funding, on account of its road bridge. So what are the facts behind this? To start with, this is not an issue unique to Scotland. The South China Sea is currently a hotbed of rather more serious tensions over the status ofvarious artificial islands, which have been built on top of coral atolls and rocks. At one point in 2003, the EU claimed that Britain wasnot an island,external, in a proposed new definition that excluded anything ""attached to the mainland by a rigid structure"". And to consider the contents of this rabbit-hole on an even greater scale, Australia, at 7 million square kilometres, is considered a continent, not an island, while the smaller but still massive Greenland, at 2 million sq km, is an island, not a continent. The Scottish government'sIslands Bill, which prompted Mr Mason's chin-stroking, describes an island as ""a naturally formed area of land which is surrounded on all sides by the sea (ignoring artificial structures such as bridges), and above water at high tide"". That seems fairly reasonable, but it appears to go against a move the government itself made in 2011, when it apparently reclassified the island status of Seil. Seil has been linked to the Scottish mainland by the Clachan Bridge since 1792. The bridge is only about 22 metres long, but spans a channel linked to the ocean at both ends, leading to its nickname: ""the bridge over the Atlantic"". However, in 2011 the government reviewed areas in receipt of the Special Islands Needs Allowance, and concluded that Seil no longer met the criteria - ultimately costing the local authority, Argyll and Bute Council, some Â£400,000 in funding. Is Skye (left) an island, while Seil (right) is not? Government officials justified the inclusion of Skye in the Islands Bill by citing the 2011 census, which listed 93 ""inhabited islands"" in Scotland. These range from relatively heavily populated area like Lewis and Harris, Shetland and Orkney down to five tiny islands which each have a single occupant. The census defines an island as being ""a mass of land surrounded by water, separate from the Scottish mainland"", and adds that: ""Islands are still classified as individual islands even when they are linked to other islands or to the mainland by connections such as a bridge, causeway or ford."" This certainly describes Skye - but it also describes Seil. In fact, the census report actually includes both in the list of 93 inhabited islands. So far, so baffling. The Clachan Bridge links Seil to the mainland - which has cost the local council Â£400,000 The answer to this conundrum lies in the specific funding mechanism disputed in the case of Seil. TheSpecial Islands Needs Allowance,externalis designed to funnel cash to councils with needs and ""characteristics unique to island communities"". Some 85% of its budget goes to the three ""islands councils"" - in Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles. Crucially, this fund does not apply to islands linked to the mainland by bridges - ""islands with road bridge links are not eligible, as it is clearly easier to get there by road"". The government justified this in the case of Seil on the grounds that ""in many cases the costs of providing public services on such islands [with bridges] will be similar to rural communities on the mainland, which are already accommodated for under the general distribution formula"". This refers to the fact that councils with a large number of islands in their local area - like Argyll and Bute, Highland and North Ayrshire - receive block funding grants per head of population above the Scottish average. So both Skye and Seil are islands, but thanks to their bridges neither get specific islands funding. When is an island not an island? The answer appears to be, when money is involved.

"The claim:A police officer starting in 2010 would, by now, have received a 32% increase in pay in real terms. Reality Check verdict:That's right, but it is not representative of police officers as a whole. Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons on Wednesday that a police officer who had started in 2010 would, by now, have seen their pay rise by 32% in real terms. Now, 32% over seven years is 4% a year, which sounds high. The Police Federation initially said her statement was a ""joke"" and a ""downright lie"". Downing Street gave the figures behind the claim. A typical police officer joining the force in 2010 would have earned Â£23,259, taking home Â£17,972 after deductions for tax and national insurance. After seven years' service, the same officer would earn Â£35,478, taking home Â£27,405 after tax and national insurance. This is an increase of Â£9,433. When you adjust for inflation, the increase is just under Â£6,000, which is indeed an increase of 32%. The Police Federation confirmed that a new officer starting in 2010 would have earned about Â£23,000, rising to about Â£35,000 today. But the Police Federation stressed that this was not a typical example and that those who had started in 2010 made up less than 4% of all officers. It also said that most officers were now at top of their pay scale and so would not benefit from progression payments.

"NHS bosses are warning we should be braced for a bad flu season. They cite the experience of Australia and New Zealand, which have just gone through their winters. What happens there, they say, tends to be a good pointer to how flu spreads in the UK. They've certainly had their worst flu season for a number of years. Like the UK, the past few winters have seen pretty low levels of flu circulating. But this winter it has been different. Figures up to the end of August - not even the end of their winter - suggest there was nearly double the number of cases of flu than the average over the past five winters. Reports have emerged of hospitals struggling, which is why NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens raised the alarm in a speech on Tuesday. Last year, the NHS went through its worst winter in a generation. And already hospital bosses have warned this winter could be worse given long waiting times and bed shortages over the summer. Mr Stevens is concerned flu could tip the health service over the edge as well as posing a threat to vulnerable groups, such as the elderly. There is nothing particularly special about this flu - just that there is lots of it around. The symptoms include a high temperature, tiredness, weakness, general aches and pains and a dry, chesty cough. High-risk groups, such as older people, pregnant women and those who have long-term medical conditions or a weakened immune system, are at risk of complications. The most common of which are chest infections. Every winter there are a few strains circulating. But one normally becomes dominant. In Australia and New Zealand that was the H3N2 strain. Will the same happen here? It's not a given - and there's certainly some debate about how closely our winters match the pattern elsewhere. But if it does, the good news is that the early indications are that the vaccine that has been produced this year is pretty effective against that strain. That's not always the case. Last year the vaccine was less effective among the elderly than other groups. You can get the flu jab free on the NHS if you are aged over 65, pregnant or have an underlying health condition which puts you at risk of serious complications from flu. Children aged six months to two years at risk of flu are also entitled to a free flu jab. A flu nasal spray is available free to three-year-olds and some children at primary school. Front-line health and social care workers are also eligible to receive the flu vaccine. GP surgeries will be able to give the jab and some local pharmacies may be able to as well. If you want to protect yourself against flu and you're not in one of the groups above, you can buy the flu jab from high street pharmacies. Very few people are unable to have the jab, but you should avoid it if you have had a serious allergic reaction to it before. Flu strains often change and so protection given by the flu vaccine gradually decreases over time. That's why new flu jabs are produced each year and why vulnerable adults and children are advised to have it every year too.

"In the firing line - Barack Obama, the New York Times, Jill Stein and Bernie Sanders The beauty of Hillary Clinton's new book title, What Happened, is it can be interpreted in so many ways. Perhaps it's a definitive account of the 2016 presidential election. ""Here's what happened"". Maybe it's an exclamation, like someone reacting to an unexpectedly loud noise (or an electoral earthquake). ""Yikes! What happened!?"" Then again, it could be a stern mom, who just walked in on the mess her children (the voters) made in the living room. ""Whaaaaat happened â¦"" Or is she the dazed boxer, picking herself up off the canvas after getting knocked out by a surprise punch from her opponent. ""Wha-, wha-, what happened???"" It's up to readers to decide for themselves, but in Mrs Clinton's recent interviews and in her book, which was formally released on Tuesday, she offers plenty of explanations from which to choose. Here's a list of just some of the factors to blame for the fact that she's hitting book stores across the country, while Donald Trump is redecorating the Oval Office. ""If not for the dramatic intervention of the FBI director in the final days we would have won the White House."" This isn't the first time Mrs Clinton has said the former FBI director - who wrote a letter informing Congress that he had reopened the investigation into the handling of classified material on Mrs Clinton's personal email server as secretary of state - is the main culprit behind her defeat. In her book, Mrs Clinton calls the use of that server a ""dumb mistake"", but the resulting scandal was ""even dumber"". And in Mrs Clinton's eyes, Mr Comey's blame for the matter extends to his public announcement that he would not bring charges against Mrs Clinton, despite the fact that she had been ""extremely careless"" in her handling of classified material. This video can not be played Trump's love-hate relationship with Comey over a tumultuous year ""I don't know quite what audience he was playing to, other than maybe some right-wing commentators, right-wing members of Congress, whatever,"" Mrs Clinton said of Mr Comey's press conference in July 2016. Did it matter?Heading into the election home stretch, Mrs Clinton appeared to have all the momentum. Mr Trump was reeling after the decade-old Access Hollywood tape revealed he had boasted of making unwanted sexual advances. Then Comey's letter happened, and for nearly a week the story dominated the media, casting a cloud over Mrs Clinton and giving Mr Trump room to win back his Republican base. In a race as close as this one turned out to be, it was likely enough to tip the balance to the Republican. ""I never imagined that he would have the audacity to launch a massive covert attack against our own democracy, right under our noses - and that he'd get away with it."" Although few knew it at the time, there was mounting evidence over the course of the 2016 election that Russia was attempting to influence the outcome. Through hacking of Democratic Party emails and state electoral databases, social media advert purchases and bots, and the proliferation of political propaganda, the US intelligence community has concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin was attempting to put his finger on the electoral scale in favour of the Republican. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Mrs Clinton, needless to say, is not amused. What's more, she is convinced that members of the Trump team colluded with Russia to help get the Republican nominee elected. ""There certainly was communication and there certainly was an understanding of some sort,"" she said in an interview with USA Today. Did it matter?If what we know Russia did is all that Russia actually did, then it almost certainly wasn't enough to hand Mr Trump the election (although it is, and should be, a major cause for concern going forward). Mrs Clinton compares Russian influence to the equivalent of a major outside political action committee contributing to a candidate. Of course, the Democrat had plenty of those kind of organisations at her disposal - and vastly outspent her opponent - and she still lost. ""I do wonder sometimes about what would have happened if President Obama had made a televised address to the nation in the fall of 2016 warning that our democracy was under attack. Maybe more Americans would have woken up to the threat in time. "" According to media reports, part of the reason why the nation didn't know about the evidence implicating Russia in election meddling until after the election is because President Barack Obama wouldn't go public unless he had the support of Republicans in Congress. Without that support, the president kept quiet - concerned that any action he took would be viewed as being done for partisan benefit. Mrs Clinton has plenty of words for Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, as well, who she said shamefully put partisanship ahead of national security. ""McConnell knew better,"" she writes, ""but he did it anyway."" Did it matter?During the campaign Mrs Clinton tried to make the case that Mr Trump was a Russian ""puppet"", who took too soft a stand against Mr Putin's aggressive foreign policy. ""You're the puppet,"" was the Republican's famous debate-night retort. Americans largely shrugged it all off, but perhaps the attacks would have stuck if it had been clear that Russia's machinations reached well beyond Ukraine. What went wrong for Hillary Clinton? Democrats struggle to find a message The dark depths of hatred for Hillary Clinton ""Many in the political media â¦ can't bear to face their own role in helping elect Trump, from providing him free airtime to giving my emails three times more coverage than all the issues affecting people's lives combined."" It's no secret that Mrs Clinton isn't happy about the way the media covered the presidential race. She singles out the New York Times, in particular, which she accuses of ""shoddy reporting"" about her use of a private email server and over-hyping Mr Comey's election-eve letter announcing the FBI was reopening its investigation. ""The Times was by no means been the only - or even the worst - offender,"" she writes, ""but its treatment has stung the most."" Did it matter?Mr Trump was an unconventional candidate who garnered an unprecedented amount of media attention - and ratings. His regular disregard for political norms, his seeming invulnerability to scandals that would sink typical politicians meant reporters were hard-pressed to cover the race in the traditional both-sides-get-their-say manner. Mrs Clinton may complain that the media weren't being fair, but Mr Trump was playing by a different set of rules. Bernie Sanders campaigned for Clinton in the autumn, but it's his primary shots she remembers ""His attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump's 'Crooked Hillary' campaign."" Mrs Clinton still has a bone to pick with her Democratic primary opponent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, as well. She writes that he impugned her character, made unrealistic promises that put her in the position of being a wet-blanket realist and did little to confront those in his movement who were launching ""ugly and more than a little sexist"" attacks on her supporters. Mrs Clinton also points out that Mr Sanders is not a member of the Democratic Party and, consequently, may not always have the party's best interests in mind. ""I am proud to be a Democrat, and I wish Bernie were, too,"" she writes. Did it matter?According to several post-election surveys, as many as 12% of Sanders supporters ended up voting for Mr Trump. If they had opted for Mrs Clinton, that would have been more than enough to put her over the top in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - and give her the White House. Then again, the percentage of cross-party voting in 2016 wasn't unusual compared to historical norms. ""There were more than enough Stein voters to swing the result, just like Ralph Nader did in Florida and New Hampshire in 2000."" The last time a presidential candidate won the popular vote but lost the election thanks to the state-by-state idiosyncrasies of the Electoral College was in 2000, when Republican George W Bush beat Democrat Al Gore. This historical quirk was clearly in Mrs Clinton's mind as she wrote this book, as she draws a comparison between Mr Nader's Green Party campaign and Jill Stein's in 2016. The 2000 gap between Mr Bush and Mr Gore in Florida was 537 votes, so just a fraction of the 97,488 votes Mr Nader received in that state would have tipped the election to the Democrat. Did it matter?In 2016 Ms Stein received 1,457,216 votes, the first time since 2000 that the Green Party had topped the million mark. Put Ms Stein's Pennsylvanian, Wisconsin and Michigan voters in Mrs Clinton's column, and the Democrat wins. Given that Ms Stein didn't have much visibility during the election cycle, however, her performance probably was more a reflection of dissatisfaction with Ms Clinton, than anything the Green Party candidate did or didn't do. ""This has to be said. Sexism and misogyny played a role in the 2016 presidential election. Exhibit A is that the flagrantly sexist candidate won."" Mrs Clinton was the first woman to be a major party presidential nominee. At key moments - such as when she locked up the nomination during the primaries and when she gave her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention - she explicitly acknowledged this fact. Other times, she downplayed it. The groundbreaking nature of her campaign, however, was always in the background. On election day, women put flowers on the graves of famous leaders of the women's suffrage movement, in anticipation of a historic night to come. That, of course, didn't happen - and, in Mrs Clinton's view, her gender was an obstacle she had to overcome. ""I started the campaign knowing that I would have to work extra hard to make women and men feel comfortable with the idea of a woman president,"" she said during a CBS interview. ""It doesn't fit into the stereotypes we all carry around in our head. And a lot of the sexism and the misogyny was in service of these attitudes. Like, you know, 'We really don't want a woman commander in chief'."" Did it matter?The thing about historic firsts is that there is no standard by which to judge them. Mrs Clinton had remarkably high negative ratings for a modern presidential nominee (as did Mr Trump). Was this because of her gender or an aspect of her personality that some voters found off-putting? ""What makes me such a lightning rod for fury?"" Mrs Clinton writes. ""I'm really asking. I'm at a loss."" Until there's another female nominee (or more), it will be difficult to know for certain. ""He was quite successful in referencing a nostalgia that would give hope, comfort, settle grievances, for millions of people who were upset about gains that were made by others â¦ millions of white people."" Mrs Clinton accuses the president of stoking racial anger Mrs Clinton has plenty of criticism of Mr Trump in her book, from his naivete to his sexism to his dangerous and ill-conceived policies. During her interview with CBS, however, the former Democratic nominee was particularly blunt about what she viewed as the explicit attempts by the Trump campaign to stoke racial resentment among white working-class voters. Her critique picks up on a particularly testy exchange between Trump and Clinton campaign aides in a post-election forum, where Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said Mr Trump gave a platform to white supremacists and that she would ""rather lose than win the way you guys did"". Did it matter?Whether you call it playing to racial grievances or giving hope to socially and economically anxious voters, there's no question that Mr Trump had a message that resonated with many members of the white working-class. ""You can blame the data, blame the message, blame anything you want - but I was the candidate. It was my campaign. Those were my decisions."" Political analyst Mark Shields likes to note that in few professions is failure on such prominent display as in the world of politics. If the average Joe doesn't get a promotion, the local paper won't devote entire articles to what character flaw or personal mistake is to blame. ""Politicians boldly risk public rejection of the kind that the rest of us will go to any lengths to avoid,"" he writes. Clinton is left wondering what happened - and what might have been Any attempt by Mrs Clinton to explain ""what happened"" in 2016 was going to be ripe for criticism. Is she talking out too much? Or not enough? Why is she blaming other people? Will she devote 300 pages to delving into why people just don't seem to connect with her? Although Mrs Clinton in her book is liberal with apportioning responsibility for her defeat, she sets aside plenty of space to point the finger at herself. She calls her labelling of a certain segment of Mr Trump's base as being in a ""basket of deplorables"" as a ""political gift"" to her opponent. She says she deeply regrets her remarks about how government policies were going to put coal workers ""out of business"", even if she insists they were taken out of context. She laments that she was unable to connect with the anger and resentment that many Americans felt after the financial crash in 2008. Most of all, she says she understands that something just didn't click between her and many US voters. ""I have come to terms with the fact that a lot of people - millions and millions of people - decided they just didn't like me,"" she writes. ""Imagine what that feels like."" Did it matter?Mrs Clinton has written her book and stated her case that, despite any personal flaws, it was a perfect political storm that dashed her presidential dreams.

"Bright blue berries on the shrub, harlequin glorybower Berries are appearing on plants and hedgerows early this year because of the unusual weather patterns. The combination of a warm, dry spring, followed by July and August rains, has led to a plethora of berries, according to horticulturists. ""Berries are a vital part of gardens and wildlife, and things have come together this year to make an abundant and beautiful crop,"" said Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). Plants that are already bearing berries include spindle bushes (Euonymus) and firethorn (Pyracantha), while crab apples are also ripening early. The fruits are likely to coincide with the appearance of autumn colour on leaves. Skimmia japonica: The glossy green fruit ripen to bright red in autumn Firethorn (Pyracantha) ""At some stage, the autumn colours will form and you will get these wonderful colour combinations of reds, blacks, yellows and purples - something to look forward to,"" he added. Trevor Dines of the charity, Plantlife, said there have been near-perfect conditions for good fruit in our hedgerows this year. The dry warm spring encouraged pollinating bees, wasps and flies to be out at peak flowering times in April and May. Then, the warm, wet summer was perfect for fruit development, with water around to swell the berries. Meanwhile, autumn colour is also on display in some areas. ""With the return to wetter conditions over summer, it's been a bit of an extended growing season and so it's not surprising that we're now seeing fruit set and autumn colours arriving three to five weeks earlier than normal,"" said Dr Dines. ""Oak trees in north Wales are already starting to turn colour - you'd normally not see that until late October."" Berries can be seen on many plants at RHS Wisley in Surrey Berries are a valuable source of food for wildlife, particularly birds. Thrushes, blackbirds, redwings and fieldfares feast on berries throughout the winter. The seeds pass out through the bird's gut and are often deposited far away, helping to spread plants far and wide. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"For 20 years the military and Aung San Suu Kyi were bitterly opposed, but must work together The huge exodus of Rohingya from Myanmar's Rakhine State, and the brutal tactics of the security forces, have stirred up strong condemnations of the Nobel Laureate and de-facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has defended her government's actions as a legitimate response to terrorism. As it emergesMs Suu Kyi will miss next week's UN General Assembly debate, how much power does she really have inside her country? Aung San Suu Kyi's formal title is ""state counsellor"". It is a position she created to get around a clause in the constitution - aimed specifically at her - that bars anyone with a foreign spouse or foreign children from the presidency. Ms Suu Kyi is by far the most popular political figure in Myanmar and she led her National League for Democracy (NLD) to a landslide victory in the 2015 election. She makes most of the important decisions in her party and cabinet. She also holds the position of foreign minister. In practice, the actual president, Htin Kyaw, answers to her. Profile: Aung San Suu Kyi The Rohingya crisis: Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Myanmar conflict: Aung San Suu Kyi 'must step in' Myanmar: What sparked latest violence in Rakhine? The constitution was drafted by the previous military government, which had been in power in one form or another since 1962. It was approved in a questionable referendum in 2008. At the time, it was not recognised by the NLD or Ms Suu Kyi. It was the key to the military's declared plan to ensure it still had a guiding role in what it called a ""discipline-flourishing democracy"". Under it, the armed forces are guaranteed one quarter of the seats in parliament. Although Htin Kyaw is Myanmar's president, in practice he answers to Aung San Suu Kyi The military retains control of three vital ministries - home affairs, defence and border affairs. That means it also controls the police. Six out of 11 seats on the powerful National Defence and Security Council, which has the power to suspend democratic government, are military appointees. Former military personnel occupy many top civil positions. The military also still has significant business interests. Defence spending is still 14% of the budget, more than health and education combined. For more than 20 years the military and Aung San Suu Kyi were bitterly opposed. She spent 15 of those years under house arrest. Ms Suu Kyi addresses supporters after her temporary release from house arrest in 1995 After the election, they had to find ways to work together. She had the mandate. The generals had the real power. They still disagreed on important issues, like amending the constitution, which she wants, and the pace of peace talks with the various ethnic armies that have been fighting the government from Myanmar's borders for the past 70 years. But they agreed on the need to reform and improve the economy and the need for stability - ""rule of law"" is Ms Suu Kyi's favourite mantra - at a time when rapid change has been stirring up social tension. But on the issue of the Rohingya, Ms Suu Kyi must tread carefully. There is little public sympathy for the Rohingya. Much of the Burmese population agrees with the official view that they are not citizens of Myanmar, but illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, even though many Rohingya families have been in the country for generations. This video can not be played Watch: Who are the Rohingya? That hostility has increased markedly after the attacks on police posts by militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army in October last year and this August. Myanmar: Who are the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army? Inside Rakhine State, the local Buddhist population are even more hostile. Conflict between them and the Rohingya - who they refer to as Bengalis - goes back many decades. Many Rakhine Buddhists believe they will eventually become a minority, and fear that their identity will be destroyed. The Rakhine nationalist party, the ANP, dominates the local assembly, one of the few not controlled by Ms Suu Kyi's NLD. Gen Mn Aung Hlaing has made it clear he has little sympathy for the Rohingyas There is strong sympathy for them among the police - almost half of whose officers are Rakhine Buddhist - and the military. The military is the real power in northern Rakhine State, along the border with Bangladesh, where access is tightly controlled. And the powerful armed forces commander, Gen Min Aung Hlaing, has made it clear he has little sympathy for the Rohingya. He has referred to the current ""clearance"" operations there as necessary to finish a problem that dates back to 1942, a period of shifting front lines between Japanese and British forces that saw bitter communal fighting between Rohingya and Rakhine Buddhists. The military sees itself now as fighting an externally funded terrorist movement, a view shared by much of the public. It seems to be applying its ""four cuts"" strategy, used in other conflict areas, in which soldiers destroy and terrorise communities thought to be giving support to insurgencies. This video can not be played Who is burning down Rohingya villages? The media is also a factor. One of the biggest changes in Myanmar over the past five years has been the proliferation of new, independent media outlets, and the dramatic growth of mobile phone and internet use, in a country that scarcely had landlines a decade ago. But very few media have shown what is happening inside Bangladesh, or the suffering of the Rohingya. Most have focused instead on displaced Buddhists and Hindus inside Rakhine, who are far fewer in number. The popularity of social media has allowed disinformation and hate speech to spread quickly. Myanmar conflict: Fake photos inflame tension So Aung San Suu Kyi has very little power over events in Rakhine State. And speaking out in support of the Rohingya would almost certainly prompt an angry reaction from Buddhist nationalists. Whether, with her immense moral authority, it might start to change public prejudice against the Rohingya, is an open question. She has calculated that it is a gamble not worth taking. She is known to be very stubborn once she has made up her mind. Ms Suu Kyi has been widely condemned internationally over the Rohingya crisis Is there a risk that the military might step in and replace her, should she challenge what they are doing in Rakhine? They have the power to do so. In the current climate, they might even have some public support. But it is worth remembering that the current power-sharing arrangements with the NLD are more or less what the military was aiming for when it announced its Seven Stage Roadmap to Democracy back in 2003. At the time this was dismissed as a sham. But it turns out Myanmar's political development over the next 14 years followed that roadmap closely. Even after its own political party was trounced in 2015's election, the military remains by far the most powerful institution in the country. Only this time, it has Aung San Suu Kyi as a shield, to be battered by the international outcry over its actions.

"Unions have threatened strikes if the public sector pay cap remains in place In August 2013, the Bank of England Governor said he would consider raising interest rates when the unemployment rate came down to 7%. At the time, it was 7.8% - today it is at a 42 year low of 4.3% and rather than raising rates, the only adjustment the bank has made is to cut rates further in the aftermath of the referendum result. He thought, along with most economists, that as unemployment came down, wages would start to rise and that would be the sensible time to consider returning interest rates to normal levels rather than levels associated with economic intensive care. What happened? And more importantly what should the Bank of England do now? Usually, as the unemployment rate falls, competition for available workers increases and, therefore, so do wages. This relationship is called the Phillips Curve but it has become increasingly apparent that someone, or something, has taken a Phillips screwdriver to this mechanism. We have the lowest unemployment since 1975 and yet wage growth is weak. There are several competing theories as to what has happened to alter this relationship. The most hotly debated of these explanations is that we have an inexhaustible supply of cheap labour from the EU which is holding down wages. Wages continue to lag behind inflation A Bank of England research paper found that in low skilled occupations, every 10% increase in the ratio of migrant to native worker created a 1.88% fall in wages. There was no evidence it affected higher skilled jobs at all and so the impact on overall UK wages would be, in the words of the author Stephen Nickell, ""infinitesimally small"". It's also worth noting that stagnant wage growth is a global phenomenon to be found in the US and also Japan where net migration is negligible. The business lobby points out that an array of additional burdens on them such as the introduction of the apprenticeship levy (affecting big businesses), the introduction of the living wage, and the roll out of auto-enrolment (affects smaller businesses more) means they simply can't afford to offer higher wages. It makes intuitive sense that an increase in overall labour costs would make it harder to raise basic pay. Pay growth did indeed fall around the time of auto-enrolments introduction in 2013 but in the years since, wage growth has fluctuated from 1% to 3% so there doesn't appear to be any lasting impact. Some argue Uber does not pay its drivers enough Also, it would presumably act as an equally powerful disincentive to hiring people in the first place which it clearly hasn't. The changing nature of work is also a suspect in this mystery. The economist Martin Beck has made powerful arguments that companies which offer less secure forms of employment, like Uber, can switch their demand for labour on and off based on its cost - meaning pay rates no longer move upward as unemployment moves downward. This has the important knock-on effect, argues Beck, that workers become so cheap that companies are tempted to use them rather than invest in more productive machines and processes so worker productivity (and the ability to pay them more per hour) declines. One of the least discussed explanations is the decline in power of labour organisations. Unions experienced their biggest fall in membership since records began last year losing 275,000 members. Unite boss Len McCluskey wields influence, but union membership has been falling Union membership has halved since the late 1970s and both the rise in self employment and the fall in public sector roles could make it hard to reverse that decline. There are probably elements of all of these factors at work. What really matters it not so much whether your pay is going up 1% or 3% but more, what your wages are doing compared to inflation. Right now more of us are working than ever before and yet on average we are getting a bit poorer every day as inflation devours any income growth. The question is when will it change - and why? The Bank of England expects wage growth to exceed inflation next year for two reasons. The first one is a pretty solid bet. Inflation will fall as the effect of sterling's post-referendum drop works its way through the system. Comparing prices of imports now to the same time last year will stop showing such a big rise. The second reason is that it's convinced we must now be near the threshold when low unemployment begins to push wages higher. It's been wrong on this before of course, but there is increasing evidence from recruitment firms that scarcity of available workers is beginning to force employers to offer higher salaries in some sectors. The Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, could vote for a rate rise Presiding over an economy in which working people are getting poorer every day is not a very comfortable political position to be in. We have seen the cap on public sector workers' pay loosened this week, under pressure from a TUC threatening strike action and a rejuvenated Jeremy Corbyn. The government will be dearly hoping the Bank is right this time. We will get an inkling of how confident the Bank is in this prediction when it votes on interest rates tomorrow. Last time only two out of the nine rate setters thought the time was right to nudge rates higher. Previously one other, Chief Economist Andy Haldane, has said he might join them later this year. It will be worth keeping an eye out for how he votes.

Police evacuated 115 residents on Wednesday from the facility, whose air conditioning was cut by the storm. Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief said three were found dead at the nursing home in the city of Hollywood. Five others died in hospital. Ten million people are still without power in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas after Hurricane Irma. The storm - which has claimed more than two dozen lives in the US - struck southwestern Florida on Sunday morning as a category four hurricane before weakening to a tropical depression on Monday. Irma earlier left a trail of destruction in the Caribbean, where nearly 40 people were killed. Cuba stunned and suffering 'Island looks like a bomb site' Why did Caribbean get worst of storm? Hollywood Police Chief Tomas Sanchez said the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills facility has been sealed off and police are conducting a criminal investigation. State investigators from the Florida Office of Attorney General were also at the scene, city officials said in a statement. ""It may be related to a loss of power in the storm,"" Mr Sanchez said, adding that officers were checking in on 42 other assisted living facilities and nursing homes throughout the city. Florida Governor Rick Scott also ordered emergency workers to check on nursing homes and assisted living facilities to ensure residents are safe. ""This situation is unfathomable,"" he said.

Rare animals survive devastation In pictures: Irma blasts Florida An estimated 150 facilities out of the nearly 700 in the state are currently without full power services, the association said. Popular with retirees, Florida is home to more than 680 nursing homes, which house about 73,000 residents, according to the Florida Health Care Association. Assisted living facilities across the state serve an additional 92,000 residents. But concern for the safety of Florida's 3.6 million senior citizens is growing as officials struggle to restore power amid sweltering temperatures. The association said it was working with officials to prioritise ""the locations with the greatest need"". Power has yet to be restored at 150 of the nearly 700 of Florida's assisted living facilities, officials say Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said officials were providing ice to 27 senior residence facilities still without power,local media reported,external. More than half of a large retirement community in Pembroke Pines, Florida, still had no electricity by Wednesday afternoon, leaving elderly residents stuck in rooms with no access to lifts.

"This video can not be played Brexit is ""a very sad and tragic moment in our history"" The UK will ""soon regret"" leaving the EU, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said. Mr Juncker told the European Parliament that Brexit would be a ""sad, tragic"" moment for the EU but that the 27-member union would ""move on"". ""Brexit is not the future of Europe. It is not the be all and end all."" But, speaking in the same debate, ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the EU had ""learnt nothing"" from Brexit and was ploughing ""full steam ahead"". In his state of the union speech in Strasbourg, Mr Juncker proposed an EU summit on the day after Brexit, 30 March 2019, in the Romanian city of Sibiu to map out the future of the European Union. He called for closer economic and defence co-operation among member states, including more support for states outside the eurozone to prepare them to join the single currency, and reforms to the single market. Live: Juncker's state of union speech Juncker sees reform window of opportunity Brexit talks delayed 'for consultation' Reflecting on the economic and political challenges that the continent had faced in recent years, he said the ""wind is back in Europe's sails"". While he respected the choice of the British people to go their own way, he said the UK's exit would prove a ""very sad, tragic moment in our history"" which we ""will always regret"". Responding to UKIP MEPs in the chamber, who had cheered the mention of the UK's exit, he added - in an off-the-cuff remark not included in advance copies of the speech - ""I think you will regret it as well soon, if I might say."" But he went on to stress that Brexit ""was not everything"" and an increasingly confident EU would continue to advance, focusing as he put it on the big strategic challenges rather than ""the small things"". Mr Farage, the best known campaigner in the Parliament for the UK's withdrawal from the EU, attacked what he said were ""truly worrying"" plans to create a single president of the EU, an EU finance minister and a ""strong EU army in a militarised Europe"". He said what was being proposed was ""more Europe in every single direction... without the consent of the people"". The EU would further centralise power after Brexit, Mr Farage said He also warned the idea of allowing future candidates to the European Parliament to stand on transnational tickets, rather than representing nation states, was anti-democratic and ""reminiscent of regimes of old"". ""You have learnt nothing from Brexit. If you had offered David Cameron concessions, particularly on immigration, I would have to admit that the Brexit vote would never ever have happened,"" he said. Telling MEPs ""thank God we are leaving"", Mr Farage said the EU was ""deluding itself"" if it believed the ""populist wave"" of protests against the established European political order was over. Responding to Mr Juncker's comments, justice minister Sam Gyimah said his initial reaction was ""he would say that, wouldn't he"" and he had signalled a future direction for Europe that ""Britain was never going to go in"". Rather than ""berating Britain"", the Conservative MP told the BBC's Daily Politics that the EU's best interests would be served by agreeing a Brexit deal which made the whole of Europe more prosperous and secure. Negotiations between the UK and EU are continuing although the latest round of talks, due to begin on Monday, have been put back a week to allow ""more time for consultation"". Speaking on Tuesday, former Brexit minister Lord Bridges said the UK must be ""honest"" about the ""complexity and scale"" of leaving the EU as well as the lack of time to reach agreement with the EU. And France's economy minister has sounded a warning that it will aggressively target new business as it seeks to make Paris the pre-eminent financial centre on the continent. Changes to the country's labour laws meant France would become the ""place to be"" for financial services, Benjamin Griveaux told BBC Radio 4's Today, while acknowledging London would remain a major player. ""We need to have a fair Brexit, but we need to move on and we need probably more clarity and less ambiguity from the British government regarding the target of Brexit,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Ms Ntuli was attacked as she returned from work The prospect of losing the only copy of her master's thesis during a robbery was just too much for one South African student to bear. Noxolo Ntuli, 26, grappled with armed attackers to hold on to it during the incident in Johannesburg on Tuesday. ""There's no way I will let them take it,"" she told the BBC. But she also said her actions were ""not very smart"" and advised others to give robbers what they ask for. ""You can always write again,"" she said. Ms Ntuli, a medical scientist at the National Health Laboratory Service, had her molecular zoology master's thesis on a hard drive when a car drew up beside her and two men jumped out, one brandishing a gun. But while the attackers were able to take her lunch bag, Ms Ntuli refused to let go of the bag containing the hard drive. ""I was thinking about my masters. I'm almost done with what I'm writing, there's no way I will let them take it,"" she said. ""I was just pulling myself into a ball. They were trying to put me in the car, I think, but I made myself so heavy that they just gave up."" During the attack, one of the robbers pressed a gun to her head and repeatedly threatened to shoot her. The alleged robbers were later arrested But Ms Ntuli held on. Losing the thesis would have meant having to ask for an extension until next year, she said. ""I really want to finish so badly, I want to do it now. Nothing got in the way of that, but it was very dangerous,"" she said. Footage of the struggle was recorded on security cameras attached to nearby homes in the suburb of Auckland Park. Ms Ntuli has since backed up her work and said she would not advise others to follow her example. ""You can always write again if you are worried about your work,"" she said. The alleged robbers were later arrested and found to be in possession of a gas gun.

"The former Liverpool striker has relatives in Barbuda, which was devastated by the hurricane Former England footballer Emile Heskey has revealed some of his family have been missing since Hurricane Irma struck the Caribbean. The ex-Liverpool striker said his parents in Antigua were safe, but his mother has had no contact with relatives in Barbuda for almost a week.

Most of the island's population of just over 1,600 live in the town of Codrington, where an initial assessment using satellite images appears to show most of the buildings have been damaged. Many buildings have been completely destroyed and debris litters the town. Heskey said his family were still awaiting news.

"As this year's TUC conference draws to a close, counter-intuitively the government has forged a high degree of unity within the union movement. Expectations on the lifting of the pay cap were raised, then dashed, when the awards to police officers were above the pay cap but palpably below inflation. The unions feel they are winning the argument on pay after seven years of restraint. But there is less unity over how to respond if the government fails to use its new flexibility to award bigger increases next year or if any increases come at the expense of existing departmental budgets rather than from the Treasury. So the unions will be poring over the small print of the November Budget. They agreed this week to push for a 5% increase for public service workers and to co-ordinate strike action if necessary. But scratch beneath the surface and there are significant tactical differences. First there is Len McCluskey's oft-repeated call for illegal industrial action. He first advanced the case for this in 2015 when the then majority Conservative government pushed ahead with plans to increase the threshold for strike action. But there was, to put it mildly, huge frustration from other union leaders when he reminded shop stewards at a meeting open to the public and the press on Sunday that he had changed his union rule book to allow members to strike outside the law. Both the BBC and Sky reported this. But the story, Lazarus-like, rose again when Len McCluskey warmed to his theme in a pre-recorded interview for the Today programme two days later. The reaction in Brighton from senior union officials ranged from groans - ""he plays into the stereotype of a union leader"" to frustration - ""talk of this is a diversion from our agenda"" - and to anger ""he was just worried he wasn't getting enough media... I'm extremely angry"". (""extremely"" is a polite form of the word that was used). But however unwelcome his intervention, the question is whether there is a realistic prospect of illegal action. TUC sources put the likelihood between ""zero and nothing"". What's significant is that other union leaders every bit as left-wing as Len McCluskey - and maybe even more so - are not singing from the same hymn sheet. Sure, they want the union laws scrapped. But they believe the level of frustration amongst their members over pay restraint would mean the government's higher thresholds for industrial action would be exceeded. The left-led civil service union the PCS will hold a consultative ballot next month to test the water. And some union leaders fear their funds could be sequestered if the McCluskey rhetoric ever became reality.  So it fails the cost/benefit test. They want the focus to remain on the pay issue, not illegality. Indeed one union leader refused all media bids for interviews yesterday in case his appearances were dominated by questions about illegal strikes rather than public sector pay. Frances O'Grady said co-ordinated strike action was a ""last resort"" However, the second option - co-ordinated legal action, last carried out in 2011 - is real. The PCS, GMB, and the Fire Brigades Union, amongst others, met to discuss this privately here at the TUC yesterday. There is anger that the 55% of public service workers not covered by Pay Review Bodies might get left behind. Co-ordinated action is unlikely to begin until early next year - once the unions have assessed the generosity or otherwise of the budget and further tested the mood of their members. But while co-ordinated action is the official policy of the TUC, its general secretary Frances O'Grady stressed to me that this was very much ""a last resort"". And a long-standing official in one of the big public service unions was cautious about co-ordinating action with other unions and extremely sceptical it would happen at all. Indeed some unions - and one big public sector union in particular - favour a more subtle option. Pleased as they are with the Corbyn-led Labour Party's willingness to support co-ordinated strikes, the focus of their lobbying efforts are Conservative MPs. They see Tories who heard voters' frustration with pay restraint on the doorstep at the election as potential allies. The unions were delighted when some Conservatives who had worked in the public services or the military before entering Parliament spoke out in favour of lifting the pay cap and they feel they can pile more pressure on backbenchers to in turn pressure the government to make further concessions. Combined with a public campaign, they feel this might be more effective than asking already hard-pressed workers to lose pay by going on strike. But it's easy to overdo the differences. The unions do stand united in their message that pay restraint has run its course and this week's announcements seem only to have strengthened their resolve.

"This video can not be played Florida nursing home survivors evacuated Eight people at a Florida nursing home that was left without power for days after Hurricane Irma have died. Police evacuated 115 residents on Wednesday from the facility, whose air conditioning was cut by the storm. Broward County Mayor Barbara Sharief said three were found dead at the nursing home in the city of Hollywood. Five others died in hospital. Ten million people are still without power in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas after Hurricane Irma. The storm - which has claimed more than two dozen lives in the US - struck southwestern Florida on Sunday morning as a category four hurricane before weakening to a tropical depression on Monday. Irma earlier left a trail of destruction in the Caribbean, where nearly 40 people were killed. Cuba stunned and suffering 'Island looks like a bomb site' Why did Caribbean get worst of storm? Hollywood Police Chief Tomas Sanchez said the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills facility has been sealed off and police are conducting a criminal investigation. State investigators from the Florida Office of Attorney General were also at the scene, city officials said in a statement. ""It may be related to a loss of power in the storm,"" Mr Sanchez said, adding that officers were checking in on 42 other assisted living facilities and nursing homes throughout the city. Florida Governor Rick Scott also ordered emergency workers to check on nursing homes and assisted living facilities to ensure residents are safe. ""This situation is unfathomable,"" he said. Hollywood Fire Rescue found several patients ""in varying degree of medical distress and immediately began treatment"" when they arrived at the Hollywood Hills facility on Wednesday morning, according to the city's statement. Some residents there awoke sick,the Miami Herald reported,external. Kitchen worker Jean Lindor told the newspaper a generator allowed staff to cook but did not provide the facility with air conditioning. Rescue crews found several patients in ""medical distress"" Temperatures on Tuesday in Hollywood reached 32C (90F), according to theNational Weather Service,external. The nursing home has had brushes with the regulators in recent years for violating federal rules on its power system, a generator and because of a faulty alarm,according to records,external. The Florida Health Care Association called Wednesday's deaths a ""profound tragedy within the larger tragedy of Hurricane Irma"". Bobby Owens, 84 Manuel Mario Medieta, 96 Miguel Antonio Franco, 92 Estella Hendricks, 71 Gail Nova, 71 Carolyn Eatherly, 78 Betty Hibbard, 84 Albertina Vega, 99 The facility is not the only Florida nursing home that has been left without power by Irma. Rare animals survive devastation In pictures: Irma blasts Florida An estimated 150 facilities out of the nearly 700 in the state are currently without full power services, the association said. Popular with retirees, Florida is home to more than 680 nursing homes, which house about 73,000 residents, according to the Florida Health Care Association. Assisted living facilities across the state serve an additional 92,000 residents. But concern for the safety of Florida's 3.6 million senior citizens is growing as officials struggle to restore power amid sweltering temperatures. The association said it was working with officials to prioritise ""the locations with the greatest need"". Power has yet to be restored at 150 of the nearly 700 of Florida's assisted living facilities, officials say Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said officials were providing ice to 27 senior residence facilities still without power,local media reported,external. More than half of a large retirement community in Pembroke Pines, Florida, still had no electricity by Wednesday afternoon, leaving elderly residents stuck in rooms with no access to lifts. Pembroke Pines police spokeswoman Amanda Conwell told the Miami Herald that officers were at the scene. She said some of the 15,000 residents at Century Village were vulnerable and ""we are concerned about their welfare"".

"The London institution is the most popular visitor attraction in Britain The British Museum has apologised after a tweet from one of its curators saw it accused of racism and dumbing down.

""We have to be careful about using too many,"" she continued, prompting a string of critical tweets.

"The spice saffron is known as ""red gold"" The spice saffron, as well as being famously expensive, is packed with antioxidants. It is said to help combat depression and lower blood pressure, to soften your skin and hair and is essential in a broad range of dishes from Swedish buns to paella. So what's stopping it becoming as fashionable as turmeric and cinnamon? Is it just its high price? In my palm I have five tiny strands, like pieces of slightly fraying dark red sewing thread, which smell rather like a fruity tobacco. Four of them I'm placing into a cup and dousing with warm water; they're destined for the cooking pot. The fifth I place on my tongue. I'm told this taste test is essential to check that what I'm using is proper saffron. After all, if you've spent more than Â£5 for a gram of anything, you want to be sure it's the real thing. And after a few seconds I'm gratified that, despite having languished at the back of my spice cupboard for quite some time, the tiny threads are still capable of imparting the heady floral aroma, the honey notes, and the slight astringency I've been promised. And the strands in the water are leaching an orangey hue, as they should. Saffron is central to national cuisines from Morocco to the Himalayas, essential to dishes from risotto Milanese to Kashmiri curry. As well as being a sought-after culinary ingredient the versatile spice is also increasingly being added to medications and cosmetics. Cleopatra used it to infuse her bathwater. Alexander the Great bathed his battle wounds with it and drank saffron tea. In the 14th Century it was used to combat bubonic plague It is a key ingredient in dishes from Spanish paella, to Persian rice dishes and Indian curries It is added to products from coffee to salt, skin creams to shampoos. Saffron has been used in traditional medicine to treat menstrual problems, depression, asthma and sexual dysfunction It has been trialled in research for conditions from memory loss to cancer, but the evidence so far is inconclusive And yet the reputation of the spice, dubbed ""red gold"", still does not glister quite as brightly as perhaps it should. Keith Alaniz, an American soldier-turned-entrepreneur, thinks he understands why. After serving in Afghanistan, he and two other veterans decided to establish a social enterprise based on a crop that could offer locals better returns than illegal opium poppy cultivation. Rumi Spice co-founder Keith Alaniz with Afghan crocus farmers Their company, Rumi Spice, buys saffron crocuses from local growers and employs 380 Afghan women to do the painstaking work of separating the tiny rust-red stigmas in the centre of the crocus from its petals, stamens and the rest of the flower head, prior to being dried and packed for export. It's those long laborious hours of work that makes saffron so expensive. Rumi Spice sells its saffron - higher grade than the one from my kitchen cupboard - for $18 (Â£14) per gram. Mr Alaniz says saffron's high price tag is the reason it has so much promise in war torn Afghanistan. But it is also in many ways the root of its biggest problem: it makes it extremely tempting for counterfeiters. ""A lot of the reason saffron hasn't taken off is because of the adulteration that you've seen."" He says they're battling against the disappointment some shoppers have felt in the past. They've spent money on an extravagant product, only to find it didn't have much flavour because it was substandard or even fake saffron. ""What we've seen with chefs and foodies is, once they see what high quality saffron tastes like, they're blown away by the flavour and aroma,"" says Mr Alaniz. The tiny rust-red stigmas need to be painstakingly separated from the petals, stamens and the rest of the flower head Their saffron is now doing well with specialist buyers and high end restaurants. And they hope to rebuild its reputation amongst ordinary consumers in the same way. But the plan will only work if the product consistently delivers on its promise; and despite recent efforts to introduce more rigorous standards, stories continue to circulate of horse hairs, corn silks, and shredded paper, all masquerading as saffron. Earlier this year there were reports of the synthetic food colourings tartrazine and sunset yellow being used in counterfeit powdered saffron. Sally Francis, botanist and saffron grower, says only a few weeks ago she saw safflower, a common substitute from the unrelated thistle family, being sold as saffron in a street market in the Netherlands. And she's met plenty of tourists returning from exotic holidays with what they thought was bargain saffron, only to find out it was bogus. Even legitimate saffron can vary enormously depending on how it's produced, she says. ""You can have a huge range in saffron quality, with no indication on the packaging as to what you are buying,"" says Ms Francis. Often it's simply that careless harvesting has meant some of the flavourless parts of the crocus have found their way into the final mix. It's still saffron but rather than ""packing a punch"" like the purest spice, what you're basically getting is ""expensive yellow food colouring,"" she says. ""The difference between a grade I and a grade III that's huge. You're talking Trabant and Lamborghini,"" she says. Check it has strands which are frayed at one end Look for a deep red hue that colours water orangey-yellow when submerged Smell it and put it on your tongue - fake saffron has very little aroma or flavour Real saffron will smell slightly fruity and floral It should taste sweet and bitter at the same time Ms Francis produces saffron on a small scale in Norfolk. The UK is a tiny player in the global saffron market, despite a saffron tradition going back several centuries. But it is one of many countries from New Zealand to Germany, Greece to India, where producers are recognising the potential for high-grade saffron, with transparent country of origin and quality labelling, to reassure consumers that it is worth the high price tag. In Iran which supplies around 90% of the world's saffron, there are signs that traceability and certification are becoming priorities. ""We are trying to show the quality of Iranian saffron to other people in the world,"" says Mehrdad Rowhani, chief executive of a family-owned wholesaler from Mashhad, the city at the heart of Iran's saffron growing region. After years hampered by American sanctions, which meant a lot of Iranian saffron ended up exported in bulk to be repackaged and sold as ""produce of Spain"" or sold via backdoor bartering deals, Iranian producers are again able to sell directly to western customers. Under sanctions Iran struggled to make the most of its saffron potential This could have more impact than anything else on the standard of saffron available to ordinary shoppers, as Iran's producers embrace the opportunity to emphasise the authenticity, origin and quality of their product. Mr Rowhani says his firm's exports have already more than doubled since sanctions were lifted. ""We started exporting to the United States and we have good - and big - customers from there,"" he says. Now he's focusing on improving every step of the production process from planting, harvesting and drying, to selling in smaller, better designed packaging. ""When they see Persian saffron is of high quality, they want to buy more,"" he adds.

"Rashan Charles died after being apprehended by police in Dalston A Metropolitan Police officer is being investigated for gross misconduct over the death of Rashan Charles in London, the police watchdog has said. Mr Charles, 20, died after being apprehendedby police officers in Dalston, east London, on 22 July. He became ill after trying to swallow an object and was later pronounced dead in hospital. The Met Police said it was vital to establish the truth of how Mr Charles died as quickly as possible. A post-mortem examination found a package containing ""a mixture of paracetamol and caffeine"" in Mr Charles' throat. Mr Charles' death led toangry clashes in Hackneywith protesters hurling fireworks and bottles at riot police, blocking parts of Kingsland Road and setting mattresses alight. On Wednesday the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had formally notified the police officer that he was being investigated for gross misconduct. Violence broke out in Kingsland Road during a protest over the death of Mr Charles IPCC commissioner Cindy Butts said: ""The officer may have breached the police standards of professional behaviour regarding the detention and restraint of Rashan as well as how he dealt with Rashan's medical emergency. ""Our investigators have analysed the CCTV and body-worn video evidence we gathered and considered the officer's detailed statement as well as statements from other witnesses to the incident. ""We have also considered the relevant policies and procedures."" She added that while the IPCC investigation was moving into a new phase it did not ""necessarily mean misconduct proceedings will follow"". In a statement the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) said: ""It is absolutely vital that the facts of what took place are thoroughly established as quickly as possible through an independent examination of all the available evidence. ""The thoughts of the MPS are with the family of Mr Charles at this incredibly difficult time for them. ""All police officers are fully aware that they will be asked to account for their actions. No officer is above the law and they would not wish to be."" The Met said the officer and other colleagues were fully co-operating with the IPCC investigation. It added it was now reviewing what restrictions, if any, should be placed on the officer.

"Craig Williamson used some of the money to pay off gambling debts A wedding planner who defrauded Â£130,000 from couples booking ceremonies at an Angus castle has been jailed for 30 months. Craig Williamson, 42, diverted money from 39 couples who had booked weddings at Guthrie Castle into his own accounts before fleeing to Ibiza. The castle's owner had to cover the cost of refunding the couples defrauded by Williamson. A sheriff told Williamson he had committed a ""despicable"" crime. Dundee Sheriff Court was told previouslythat some couples' events were double booked and others left in limbo weeks before their weddings. Williamson had used some of the money to finance his gambling habit. One bride paid Â£19,000 to Williamson and found out her wedding was not on the books only a week before the event, but it went ahead after the castle's owner Dan Pena met the cost. Guthrie Castle's owner had to cover the cost of refunding the couples Williamson defrauded Williamson was hired as castle and estate manager in November 2014. In early April this year he told colleagues he was going to visit his father in Glasgow, but did not return their calls. A missing person's inquiry was launched and it was established Williamson had withdrawn Â£6,000 in cash and boarded a Eurostar train to Paris before travelling to Ibiza. The court heard that Guthrie Castle stopped taking bookings for weddings at the venue after December 2017 as a result of Williamson's fraud. Williamson, a prisoner at HMP Perth, admitted a charge of fraud committed between July 2015 and April 2017. Solicitor Billy Rennie, defending, said Williamson had developed a gambling addiction which led to the ""initial temptation"". Mr Rennie said: ""The losses began and he ended up robbing Peter to pay Paul and ends up in this sorry mess. ""He realises it will be a different world facing him on his release from prison."" Sheriff Alastair Carmichael told Williamson: ""It was despicable to take money in good faith from people who made wedding bookings. ""One couple have had to move their wedding to 2019. ""As a result, a successful business of 12 years has been closed down due to this crime. ""Jobs have been lost and couples left in doubt about weddings.""

"As children across the UK are settling into the new school year, many families are facing hefty bills for compulsory school uniforms. For older children - or those who are taller than average - school uniforms, as well as all other clothing and shoes, attract the full standardVAT rate of 20%. Reality Check explores why these families are paying more and why successive governments haven't acted. Clothing and shoes for young children have been charged a zero rate of VAT since the introduction of the tax on 1 April 1973. The problem is that there is no definition of the term ""young children"" in VAT law. Instead, the VAT relief is based on the maximum size an average child will be on their 14th birthday. So clothes for older children, as well as many children under the age of 14 who are larger than average, are taxed at 20%. And this includes school uniform. Source: HM Revenue and Customs,external The policy would be very popular with parents, and it has been considered in the past, but it has never been taken up. Way back in 1980, HM Customs & Excise considered thepossibility of scrapping VAT on school uniforms,external, but concluded that the zero rate, aimed at children, would be exploited by adults in the larger sizes. After all, the uniform in a great number of secondary schools includes plain trousers, skirts and shirts - items that adults could wear too. There were proposals that elements of school uniform clearly identified as being from a particular school, by a logo for example, could be made exempt from VAT. In 1997, Conservative MP Tim Loughton proposed that such a policy could be policed by the production of a school identification card, or the uniform could be ordered through the school. But the Labour government of the time did not support it. Other MPs have raised the issue since then. Last week, Labour MP Sarah Jones asked Steven Baker, a minister at the Department for Exiting the European Union, whether Brexit might result in a change in policy. EU countries have been co-ordinating VAT rates since 1992 to ensure there is no unfair competition across national borders. Under EU rules, countries must apply a minimum standard VAT rate of 15%, but 0% VAT is also allowed for the goods which were taxed at that rate before 1991. So children's clothing and footwear in the UK are protected. The UK's standard VAT rate is 20% and the EU rules would not stop the government from reducing the standard rate by five percentage points now, if it wanted to. But if the government wanted to add all school uniform to the list of the goods that are taxed at 0%, it would need the agreement of all other EU countries to do so. No UK government has ever tried this. After the UK leaves the EU, there is unlikely to be such a restriction. Mr Baker said any future decisions on VAT would be taken by the chancellor as part of the normal Budget process. He pointed out that VAT raised Â£120bn last year and provided funding for public services including education. For now, it seems unlikely that any change in policy would be on the cards even after Brexit. If a school is exclusively for pupils under 14 years of age, the zero rate can be applied irrespective of the size of the garment, as long as the garment is unique to that school by design, such as a prominent badge. So, for instance, a uniform for a private prep school which caters for children up to the age of 13 only, attracts 0% VAT irrespective of the size, but the parents of older or taller children in a typical state secondary school with pupils up to the age of 16, have to pay an extra 20% to cover the VAT. The zero rate also applies to organisations such as Beavers or Brownies, for the clothing items that form the uniform regardless of the size, as long as these organisations cater exclusively for under-14s.

"When a group of Indonesian mothers sharing pictures of their children stumbled upon news of an online paedophile group earlier this year, they decided to infiltrate it to expose those behind it. The BBC's Christine Franciska followed the story. Capturing and posting the funny, sweet and memorable moments of children on social media is common for many proud parents in Indonesia and around the world. Risrona Simorangkir has been uploading photos of her seven-year-old daughter and toddler son on Facebook ever since they were born. But one day in March she stumbled across a blog about a group that shares child abuse pictures. ""This [Facebook] group has thousands of members, they share pictures and videos. Some of them said they produce the materials by themselves - taken from neighbour's children or even relatives,"" the article said. The group's members called their victims ""lolly"" - short for lollipop candy. Risrona Simorangkir infiltrated a paedophilia group on Facebook Mrs Simorangkir, 29, warned her friends immediately and they decided to find out more by joining the group - which the BBC is not naming. Indonesian president says castration 'to end paedophilia' How child sexual abuse is tackled around the world - BBC Newsbeat ""We have an online community for mothers talking about parenting, life, and anything. After I posted [the article], some of us tried to get into [the group] to collect evidence and we discussed the findings,"" says Mrs Simorangkir. ""I joined the group for only four hours. I could not stand it. The content was so horrible. They are not human [for posting like that],"" says Mrs Simorangkir. ""They talk about how you can approach and seduce a kid to have sex with you, what you can do to make sure those kids don't say anything to their parents, and how you can have sex with children without making them bleed."" ""One person told a story about his victim and how he has been doing it to his nephew. It was terrifying."" Michelle Lestari, Mrs Simorangkir's friend, says they began to save and screen capture evidence, including conversations, administrators' profile links, and even phone numbers. ""I reported it to the police,"" said Mrs Lestari. Other parenting groups had been reporting the group to Facebook, said Ms Lestari, and the social media giant took it down. A Facebook spokesperson also told the BBC that further investigations were conducting into the individuals. On 14 March police arrested five suspects. The case was heavily discussed in the local media and the efforts of the parents have been widely praised. ""The power of mothers,"" said one Twitter user. This group had more than 7,000 members, who produced and distributed at least 400 videos and 100 photos of child abuse, Indonesian police said after the arrests. The police said that they were co-ordinating with United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as they suspected some members were linked to international networks. ""One of the suspects joined 11 WhatsApp groups that linked 11 countries. They exchange pornographic material between countries. Indonesia sends one and someone in North America sends another,"" said Jakarta Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Argo Yuwono to the BBC. Child sex abuse online is a real threat in Indonesia, but society's reaction in tackling online child sex abuse is still too lax, said the head of Indonesia's Child Protection Commission (KPAI) Arist Merdeka Sirait. ""In Indonesia's cultural context, people still think that paedophilia or sexual abuse is only related to penetration -committing rape. They have to realise that grabbing a child's bottom is also considered molestation, for example,"" said Mr Sirait. Last year, the country's parliamentpassed controversial lawsauthorising chemical castration and execution for convicted paedophiles. But what Mrs Simorangkir and many internet users have done, by infiltrating the paedophile group, is dangerous because they are exposing their own identities, activists say. ""It is the equivalent of neighbourhood patrols, which is great but you need to realise the danger,"" said the executive director of Indonesia's civil society organisation ICT Watch Donny B.U. ""It is best if you just report it to the police. What you can do is be actively involved in building digital literacy in your community and take preventive action by being knowledgeable about data privacy,"" he explains. And this kind of action won't necessarily solve the larger problem, he says. ""This particular case is just the tip of the ice berg. People easily found it because they used Facebook as a platform, which is quite amateur. There are more threats in the dark web, encrypted."" Mrs Simorangkir says she doesn't regret what she did. Her four-hour experience in the paedophile group makes her more afraid of the people around her family, but it also ""opened my eyes to be more careful and teach my children about their private parts"". ""But I still have this disgusted feeling when I remember the kinds of thing they posted."" She says she has now changed her Facebook setting to private mode. But before that, ""I uploaded maybe thousands of pictures of my children online,"" she says.

"Director David Freyne with Ellen Page and Sam Keeley, stars of The Cured Movies which generally attract awards buzz at film festivals like Toronto are dramas - and ideally ones based on true stories. This year is no different with The Current War, Kings, Darkest Hour and I, Tonya among the hotly-tipped films. Few comedies will stand a chance of taking home any best picture prizes - and horror films are also rarely acknowledged. Such movies are often dismissed in awards season, but zombie films in particular have a loyal fanbase - one which seems to be growing all the time. ""I think there is for sure [a snobbery], but I think it is changing,"" says Ellen Page, whose film The Cured premiered at Toronto. The actress cites the 1970s as a golden era of horror in general, adding: ""I think it's been coming back these last few years, with these amazing films, like The Babadook and It Follows. The Cured is David Freyne's first feature film as a director ""And when I think of how difficult it is to pull this genre off, as to how David [Freyne, director of The Cured] did it, it just blows my mind."" The film begins with the discovery of a cure for a disease which turns people into zombie-like monsters. As the infected are reintegrated into society, they face hostility from sections of society who can't forgive their previous behaviour, leading to social unrest and government interference. The film deals with themes of second chances and forgiveness - complex issues which aren't dissimilar to those you'd find in any standard Oscar-fodder biopic. ""When I started writing it, it was very much inspired by the recession we were suffering in Ireland,"" says Freyne. ""It was about the anger that I was experiencing, and people around me were experiencing - there were people losing jobs and being blamed for things beyond their control, just as the cured are in the film, and that was very much the starting point. Sam, Ellen and David at the world premiere of The Cured ""That anger fuelled the script. We didn't predict what was going to happen over the next few years but what's happened is a symptom of it. ""But like all great genre films, I think they do reflect what's happening on society - they always have. "" Interestingly, despite it being loosely billed as a zombie thriller, the word ""zombie"" isn't uttered once in the film. Instead, those who have been cured are referred to as ""the infected"". ""It is very deliberate not to use the term [zombie],"" says Freyne. ""We wanted to be very careful that we create our own very distinct creature in the infected. ""They're not undead, they're not mindless brain-eaters - they hunt and behave like a pack, like wolves."" But the director says he's not trying to shy away from it being labelled as a zombie movie, as he's a big fan of the genre. ""I adore zombie films, but the idea was 'what would happen next? What's the film that starts where most films end?' And the idea of somebody being cured. ""So I'm inspired by them, and I pray to be in that genre, but if you were in this world, I think you'd naturally say infected rather than zombie. ""Zombie generally means undead, and these guys aren't undead - it's an animal infection."" Page is known for her roles in Juno and the X-Men films So, given that a zombie film has never won best picture at the Oscars, does Page think it's about time one did? ""Absolutely I do!"" she laughs. ""I got sent the script for The Cured and was blown away. I was so compelled, I thought it was suspenseful and thought-provoking. It's like an intense family drama, but also a genre movie."" She co-stars in the film with Irish actor Sam Keeley, who praised Freyne for dealing with complex themes without being too preachy. ""You open any newspaper, turn on any news channel, it's all there, particularly in the last few years, the dramatic change in politics, the refugee crisis, Charlottesville - it's all insanity that's going on around us all the time,"" he says. ""But David did a clever thing by not beating people over the head with a message. He wrapped it in a way that people could absorb and then take that away.""

"Paterson is serving a 20-year sentence for wounding patients About 750 victims of rogue breast surgeon Ian Paterson are to be paid compensation from a new Â£37m fund. Private healthcare firm Spire has agreed to pay Â£27.2m, with Â£10m coming from Paterson's insurers and the Heart of England NHS Trust. Paterson wasfound guiltyof 17 counts of wounding with intent in April after a trial at Nottingham Crown Court. In August, he had his 15-year jail term increased to 20 years after the Appeal Court ruled his term was too lenient. This video can not be played Ian Paterson: CV reveals ""a rogue and a medical conman"" The payments concern patients treated at private Spire Healthcare hospitals in the West Midlands, who Paterson worked for when he carried out hundreds of botched operations. The fund is intended to halt legal proceedings by patients against the group and account for any new claims. Surgeon 'psychopathic like Shipman' Surgeon 'played God' with women's bodies 'He took a pound of flesh for money' Heart of England NHS Trust was part of the civil action because patients said it failed to notify Spire of Paterson's dangerous methods discovered while working for Solihull Hospital. The NHS has already paid out Â£9.49m in damages, as well as Â£8.31m costs, to hundreds of others treated by Paterson, 59, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester. Ian Paterson's victims fall broadly into two camps. Those who underwent unnecessary surgery, and those who did need operations but were left prone to cancer returning because of the untried technique he used. The criminal trial dealt with cases from the first group - nine women and a man who were either subjected to intrusive surgery or had their breasts removed despite there being no evidence that there was anything wrong them. The civil case which was settled today involved the many others whose cases did not come to court, as well as those who were treated using something called a cleavage-sparing operation in which tumours were removed but potentially cancerous tissue was left behind. The technique was something that was only ever performed by Paterson and never properly tested. The surgeon's trial heard he wildly exaggerated his patients' cancer symptoms, leading them to have several needless operations which left them scarred for life physically and emotionally. Fellow medics at Solihull Hospital first raised concerns about his conduct in 2002 when it emerged Paterson, who grew up in County Down, Northern Ireland, was carrying out unregulated'cleavage-sparing' mastectomieson cancer patients, which left them at higher risk of the disease returning. Despite three reports into his actions, he carried on working until 2011 when he was suspended by the trust. The payout concerns patients treated at private Spire Healthcare hospitals in the West Midlands Hundreds of Paterson's private patients were due to take their case for compensation to the High Court in October. In its statement, Spire said the agreement was conditional on all parties agreeing, and the court approving, the terms of a formal court order. It said the order would also ""provide for a portion of the fund to be set aside to provide compensation for any former patient of Mr Paterson who has not yet brought a legitimate claim against Spire Healthcare and the other defendants, but does so prior to 30 October 2018."" Simon Gordon, interim chief executive at Spire, said: ""Earlier this year a criminal court decided that Ian Paterson must bear responsibility for his actions, finding him guilty of assaulting a number of his patients. ""He behaved with clear criminal intent and abused the trust of those who looked to him for his care and relied upon his expertise."" This video can not be played What is cleavage-sparing surgery? Mr Gordon added: ""However, whilst nothing diminishes Mr Paterson's responsibility for his actions, these events took place in our hospitals, and this should not have happened. ""We accept that better clinical governance in the private hospitals where Mr Paterson practised, as well as in his NHS trust, might have led to action being taken sooner, and it is right that we have made a material contribution to the settlement announced today. ""We have apologised unreservedly to Mr Paterson's patients for their suffering and distress and we would like to repeat that apology."" Emma Doughty, a specialist medical negligence lawyer from Slater and Gordon, which represents more than 100 of Paterson's victims, said no financial settlement would heal the physical and mental scars inflicted on their clients but added they were relieved to have won their battle for justice. Lawyers Irwin Mitchell, which represents 30 patients, echoed the sentiment but said questions still remain about the redress that private healthcare patients have if they are the victims of negligent treatment. It also said the sum set aside by Spire is likely to be less than the patients will need.

"Police in India have reopened the case of a 10-year-old girl after forensic tests revealed that her baby's DNA samples did not match those of her uncle who is charged with raping her. After the Supreme Court denied her permission to abort, she gave birth to a baby girl last month. The 10-year-old was not aware of her pregnancy. She was told her bulge was because she had a stone in her stomach. She alleges she was raped several times in the past seven months by the uncle. The accused, who is in his 40s, was arrested and is being tried in a special court dealing with crimes against children. He is in prison and has made no statement so far. The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi says the result of the DNA test has now led to questions over whether the girl was abused by others. The girl's father had earlier told the BBC that the accused had not denied the charges against him. Police said the uncle had admitted to the allegations, our correspondent reports. ""So far no-one had thought of any other possibility. The girl had testified to the court on video conferencing and in her statement, she had very clearly named the uncle and revealed facts about her abuse,"" an official involved with the investigation told the BBC on Wednesday. The girl's mother has reportedly told the investigators that they do not suspect anyone else, so the case has taken a very strange turn, the official added. On Tuesday, police and counsellors visited the family again to speak to the 10-year-old. A senior police official told BBC Punjabi that they would ask for a re-check of the forensic tests to ensure there had been no error in the DNA report. The pregnant child caught in a media storm No abortion for 10-year-old rape victim Her pregnancy was discovered in mid-July when she complained of stomach ache and her parents took her to hospital. A local court in Chandigarh turned down the abortion plea on the grounds that she was too far into her pregnancy after a doctors' panel advised that termination of the pregnancy would be ""too risky"". Later, the Supreme Court also refused to allow an abortion for her on similar grounds. As her family refused to have anything to do with the newborn, the baby is in the care of child welfare personnel and will be put up for adoption. The landmark case dominated global headlines for weeks, with officials saying they had never heard of a mother so young giving birth in an Indian hospital. Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors certify that the mother's life is in danger. But in recent years, the courts have received several petitions, many from child rape survivors, seeking to terminate pregnancies after 20 weeks. In most cases, these pregnancies are discovered late because the children themselves are not aware of their condition. Last Friday, a 13-year-old girl who was 32 weeks pregnant gave birth to a baby boy after the court allowed her to terminate her pregnancy. Theinfant diedtwo days later. In May, a similar case was reported from the northern state of Haryana where a 10-year-old, allegedly raped by her stepfather, was allowed to abort. She was about 20 weeks pregnant, doctors said. None of the girls can be named for legal reasons. A child under 16 is raped every 155 minutes, a child under 10 every 13 hours More than 10,000 children were raped in 2015 240 million women living in India were married before they turned 18 53.22% of children who participatedin a government study,externalreported some form of sexual abuse 50% of abusers are known to the child or are ""persons in trust and care-givers"" Sources: Indian government, Unicef The pregnant child caught in a media storm No abortion for 10-year-old rape victim At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"This video can not be played Fiona Mozley says she finds selling customers her own novel ""strange and embarrassing"" A 29-year-old writer who works part-time at a bookshop in York has been shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize for her debut novel. Fiona Mozley, the second-youngest author to be up for the prestigious literary prize, wrote Elmet while commuting between London and York. Emily Fridlund, another debut novelist, is also up for the Â£50,000 award. So are fellow Americans Paul Auster and George Saunders, Britain's Ali Smith and Pakistan-born Mohsin Hamid. The winning book will be announced on 17 October. Paul Auster, 4 3 2 1 In a nutshell: A young man growing up in New Jersey in the 1950s and 60s leads four parallel lives. Judges' comment: ""An ambitious, complex, epic narrative... that is essentially both human and humane."" Emily Fridlund (above), History of Wolves In a nutshell: A 14-year-old girl living on a commune in the US Midwest befriends some new arrivals. Judges' comment: ""A novel of silver prose and disquieting power that asks very difficult questions."" Mohsin Hamid, Exit West In a nutshell: A boy and girl fall in love, move in together and consider leaving their unnamed country. Judges' comment: ""A subtle, compact piece of writing about a relationship, its blossoming and digressions."" Fiona Mozley, Elmet In a nutshell: A boy remembers his life in a house his father built with his bare hands in an isolated wood. Judges' comment: ""Timeless in its epic mixture of violence and love, it is also timely... with no punches pulled."" George Saunders (above), Lincoln in the Bardo In a nutshell: President Abraham Lincoln goes to a Georgetown cemetery to grieve following his young son's death. Judges' comment: ""Daring and accomplished, this is a novel with a rare capriciousness of mind and heart."" Ali Smith, Autumn In a nutshell: A dying 101-year-old man is watched over by his closest and only friend. Judges' comment: ""An elegy for lost time, squandered beauty but also for the loss of connections."" Mozley, a PhD student at the University of York's Centre for Medieval Studies, is one of three female writers on a shortlist evenly divided between the sexes. The authortold Woman's Hourthe issue of home ownership was on her mind while writing her novel, which takes its title from the old name for the West Riding in Yorkshire. Veteran writer Paul Auster has been shortlisted at the age of 70 for 4 3 2 1. The book, which runs to 866 pages, is Auster's first novel in seven years. Hamid is best known for his 2007 novel The Reluctant Fundamentalist Smith, who has been shortlisted for the Booker three times, makes the cut again with Autumn, the first in a quartet of books named after the seasons. Hamid, shortlisted in 2007 in The Reluctant Fundamentalist, is once more in contention thanks to Exit West. US writer Saunders, best known for his short stories and novellas, is shortlisted for Lincoln in the Bardo, his first full-length novel. The shortlist is completed by History of Wolves, the first novel from US writer Fridlund. The prize has been open to American writers since 2014 and was awarded toits first American winner, Paul Beatty, last year. Auster's 4 3 2 1 took him more than three years to write This is a really interesting shortlist - a good mix of established literary names and newer voices. At the top of the tree is Paul Auster, the oldest and most high-profile author. 4 3 2 1 took him three-and-a-half years to write, working six-and-a-half days a week. Do not be put off by its 866 pages. It is a richly rewarding and entertaining novel, though probably easier to follow in physical book form than on an E-reader. He is joined by his compatriots George Saunders and Emily Fridlund. Those who feared American dominance of the prize may raise eyebrows that half the authors on this year's list are from the United States. No room, yet again, for Indian, African or Australian writers. It is a huge achievement for Fiona Mozley to be shortlisted for her debut novel. It is a coup too for her editor Becky Walsh. It was the first book she acquired when she joined the small imprint JM Originals. Four-times nominated Ali Smith is catching up with the perpetual Booker bridesmaid Beryl Bainbridge, who was shortlisted five times without winning. Her novel Autumn is a timely book - a response, in part, to Brexit - while Mohsin Hamid's Exit West is also topical, imagining a world where mass migration is the norm. This is the fourth time Ali Smith has been shortlisted for the prize Baroness Lola Young, chair of the 2017 judging panel, said the six shortlisted novels ""collectively push against the borders of convention"". She said: ""The emotional, cultural, political and intellectual range of these books is remarkable, and the ways in which they challenge our thinking is a testament to the power of literature."" Her fellow judges include novelist Sarah Hall, artist Tom Phillips and the travel writer Colin Thubron. The shortlist was whittled down from a longlist of 15 novels that wasannounced in July. Sebastian Barry, Arundhati Roy and Zadie Smith are among the big-name writers whose works were on the longlist but have not made the final cut.

"Rebel Wilson celebrating in June after a jury found in her favour Actress Rebel Wilson has been awarded A$4.5m (Â£2.7m; $3.6m) in Australia's largest payout for a defamation case. Wilson successfully argued that a series of magazine articles had wrongly portrayed her as a serial liar. In June a jury unanimously sidedwith the star, who had claimed the articles stifled her career in Hollywood. She has said she will give the money away. Bauer Media has always denied the articles were defamatory. A lawyer said it would consider the judgement. Wilson sought A$7m during the trial but had offered to settle for A$200,000 before it went to court. Justice John Dixon told the Supreme Court of Victoria that the defamation case was ""unprecedented in this country"" because of its international reach. ""Substantial vindication can only be achieved by an award of damages that underscores that Ms Wilson's reputation as an actress of integrity was wrongly damaged in a manner that affected her marketability in a huge worldwide marketplace,"" he said on Wednesday.

Wilson sat in court for every day of the three-week trial and spent six days in the witness box. She claimed that eight articles published by Bauer magazines in 2015 had portrayed her as a serial liar, and that this resulted in her being sacked from two feature films. A six-woman jury rejected Bauer Media's arguments that the articles were substantially true, trivial and did not affect Wilson's acting career. A 12-person jury is not required for civil cases in Victoria. Wilson said the verdict had exposed the ""disgusting and disgraceful"" conduct of some tabloid media.

The girl's father had earlier told the BBC that the accused had not denied the charges against him. Police said the uncle had admitted to the allegations, our correspondent reports. ""So far no-one had thought of any other possibility. The girl had testified to the court on video conferencing and in her statement, she had very clearly named the uncle and revealed facts about her abuse,"" an official involved with the investigation told the BBC on Wednesday. The girl's mother has reportedly told the investigators that they do not suspect anyone else, so the case has taken a very strange turn, the official added. On Tuesday, police and counsellors visited the family again to speak to the 10-year-old. A senior police official told BBC Punjabi that they would ask for a re-check of the forensic tests to ensure there had been no error in the DNA report. The pregnant child caught in a media storm No abortion for 10-year-old rape victim Her pregnancy was discovered in mid-July when she complained of stomach ache and her parents took her to hospital. A local court in Chandigarh turned down the abortion plea on the grounds that she was too far into her pregnancy after a doctors' panel advised that termination of the pregnancy would be ""too risky"". Later, the Supreme Court also refused to allow an abortion for her on similar grounds. As her family refused to have anything to do with the newborn, the baby is in the care of child welfare personnel and will be put up for adoption. The landmark case dominated global headlines for weeks, with officials saying they had never heard of a mother so young giving birth in an Indian hospital. Indian law does not allow terminations after 20 weeks unless doctors certify that the mother's life is in danger. But in recent years, the courts have received several petitions, many from child rape survivors, seeking to terminate pregnancies after 20 weeks. In most cases, these pregnancies are discovered late because the children themselves are not aware of their condition. Last Friday, a 13-year-old girl who was 32 weeks pregnant gave birth to a baby boy after the court allowed her to terminate her pregnancy. Theinfant diedtwo days later. In May, a similar case was reported from the northern state of Haryana where a 10-year-old, allegedly raped by her stepfather, was allowed to abort. She was about 20 weeks pregnant, doctors said. None of the girls can be named for legal reasons.

"More than half of Britain has seen wages rise faster than house prices in the last 10 years, research by a mortgage lender has suggested. Edinburgh and Birmingham are among the 54% of areas where pay has outpaced property prices since 2007, the Yorkshire Building Society found. Yet the gap between wages and house prices has widened dramatically in other areas. The building society suggested this had accentuated a north-south divide. Across London and much of southern England, it has become ""increasingly difficult for first-time buyers and those wanting to move up the housing ladder"", said Andrew McPhillips, chief economist at the Yorkshire Building Society. ""However, the north of England, Wales and Scotland present a different picture entirely, with many places more affordable than they were before the credit crunch,"" he said. ""While some northern cities, such as Manchester, are less affordable than they were in 2007, in much of the north of England, Scotland and Wales, the gap between earnings and house prices is around a third of the average for London."" Housing costs rising fastest in the East Midlands Police and prison staff to get more than 1% pay cap One in 10 adults owns second home The analysis compares earnings data for each area from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) with Land Registry house price data at local authority level. This is a relatively narrow definition of ""affordability"" as it ignores issues such as falling mortgage rates and the decreasing proportion of disposable income that is spent on home loan repayments. Overall, the Yorkshire concludes that wage rises have effectively kept pace with increasing property prices in Britain compared with 10 years ago. In England, house prices rose faster, with the typical home costing 8.2 times median average pre-tax earnings for a single full-time employee compared with 7.9 times in 2007. In Scotland, wages rose faster - with the current house price five times the size of typical average earnings in Scotland, compared with 6.2 times in 2007. The same was true in Wales where the ratio has changed from 6.9 times earnings in 2007 to 5.7 times now. Three areas of Scotland have seen the biggest shift in wages rising faster than house prices compared with 10 years ago, according to the analysis. They include Inverclyde, where house prices are 3.67 times average full-time gross earnings in the area now compared to 6.38 times a decade ago. The other two biggest movers were North Ayrshire and West Dunbartonshire. At the other end of the scale was the Three Rivers local authority area in Hertfordshire, which has seen house prices rise from 9.83 times typical full-time earnings in that area in 2007 to 15.83 times now. The next two biggest movers in that direction were the London borough of Haringey, where house prices are 17.5 times that area's typical earnings, and the London borough of Westminster which sees the average home cost more than Â£1m, or 24 times average earnings there.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""You can't but be affected by the scale of the devastation"" The UK is to give an extra Â£25m of funding to help with the recovery effort following Hurricane Irma, Theresa May has said. The prime minister pledged the extra money in the Commons amid criticism of the government's response to the disaster in the Caribbean.

"This video can not be played Brexit is ""a very sad and tragic moment in our history"" The ""wind is back in Europe's sails"", European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said in his annual state of the union address. Hetold the European Parliament,externalthere was a ""window of opportunity"" to build a stronger, more united union - but it ""wouldn't stay open forever"". Mr Juncker said Europe's economy was ""bouncing back"" and the EU had to move beyond Brexit. He called for the union to embrace reforms and forge new trade deals. UK will soon regret Brexit - Juncker Last year, the EU was ""battered and bruised by a year that shook our very foundation"", Mr Juncker said - facing the challenges of Brexit, the migrant crisis and the rise of populism. In his speech of more than an hour, during which he switched from English to French to German, Mr Juncker said member states ""chose unity"" and the union was ""slowly but surely gathering momentum"". The speech was markedly different from recent years, says the BBC Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas. Gone was the sense of crises besetting the EU - instead Mr Juncker mentioned Brexit just once in an address focused on a post-Brexit vision for the EU. Addressing the UK'sdecision to leave the EUon 29 March 2019, he said that ""we will always regret this"" and, departing from his script, he added ""and you will regret it soon, too"". ""We will move on because Brexit isn't everything. It isn't the future of Europe - it's not the be all and end all."" He called for a summit in Romania on 30 March 2019 for decisions to be taken on a ""more united, stronger and democratic Europe"". The state of the union address gives the Commission's president a chance to outline the political objectives of the EU executive. Juncker's speech: as it happened Mr Juncker hailed a European Union where membership of the banking union, eurozone and the Schengen border-free zone would be standard. Ontrade, Mr Juncker hailed recent deals with Canada and Japan, and said deals with Mexico and South America were in the pipeline. Trade talks should open with Australia and New Zealand, he said, and be completed by late 2019. But he said there had to be reciprocity in trade deals: ""We have to get as much as we give."" And he promised new openness in trade negotiations and - amid concern about Chinese investment in strategic European assets - said investors in the EU would be screened. Mr Juncker praised Europe's progress onmigration, saying it protected its external borders in a more efficient manner. He highlighted Italy's ""perseverance and generosity"" in helping to manage irregular migration from Africa. But work needed to be done opening legal migration routes, ending ""scandalous"" conditions in Libya and investing in Africa. Mr Juncker said the EU must embrace the value of equality - between member states, workers and consumers. Referring to growing controversy overdifferent food standards across the union, Mr Juncker said he ""would not accept that in some parts of Europe, people are sold food of lower quality than in other countries, despite the packaging and branding being identical"". Europe had to pursue a ""credibleenlargementproject to the countries of the western Balkans"", and it was high time for Romania and Bulgaria to be brought into the EU's border-free Schengen zone, along with Croatia when it was ready, he said. Mr Juncker joined the chorus of criticism against Turkey's imprisonment of journalists But he sternly reminded member states that final jurisdiction in the union belonged to the European Court of Justice, and said the rule of law was not optional. That might have been a tacit reference to countries such as Poland, which have defied judicial decisions from the EU on a number of issues. In the EU ""the rule of law, justice and fundamental rights"" took priority, he said - and ""that rules out EU membership forTurkeyfor the foreseeable future"". He demanded that Ankara free imprisoned journalists and stop personal attacks on European leaders. ""Stop calling our leaders fascists and Nazis!"" he demanded, to applause from the assembly. Mr Juncker also called for a number of keyreformsto the union's organisation. He suggested his own role of Commission president should be merged with that of the Council president, and elected following a ""pan-European campaign"". This proposal, he added, did not ""target in any way"" the work of his ""excellent friend"" Donald Tusk - the current incumbent of the Council presidency. Any attempt to merge the two roles would require a change to EU treaties. The Commission leader also proposed the creation of a Europe-wide finance minister, enabling deeper integration of the eurozone. In response, Denmark's Prime Minister Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen said he agreed with Mr Juncker that there should not be treaty changes. ""No new grand projects or institutional discussions,"" hetweeted,external. But the role of the Council president was important,he said,external, and needed as a voice of member states.

"This video can not be played Dame Kiri Te Kanawa announces her retirement on Radio 4's Today Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, one of opera's most celebrated stars, has told the BBC she will never sing in public again. Dame Kiri, 73, said she stopped performing a year ago, but had not announced her retirement until now. ""I don't want to hear my voice,"" said the soprano, whose career has spanned more than half a century. ""It is in the past. When I'm teaching young singers and hearing beautiful young fresh voices, I don't want to put my voice next to theirs."" Dame Kiri has appeared at all the world's major opera houses and concert halls. She made her name in 1971 when she was cast as the Countess in The Marriage of Figaro at Covent Garden. At the time she was barely known. Her career took off after playing the Countess in The Marriage of Figaro ""I've had such an amazing career,"" the New Zealander said. But she was adamant she wanted to decide ""when it was going to be the last note"". However, she admitted it took her five years ""to say the goodbye in my own mind"", adding: ""I've taken that time."" What turned out to be her final performance was a concert in Ballarat near Melbourne in Australia last October. ""Before I'd gone on, I said, right, this it. And that was the end."" Dame Kiri, who is of part-Maori ancestry, said she now never even sings in the shower but has no regrets and doesn't miss singing. She said: ""Look what I had. The memories are lovely."" This video can not be played Dame Kiri te Kanawa marked her birthday with a performance of Donizetti's comic opera La Fille du Regiment She has certainly achieved a level of fame rare for a classical performer. Six hundred million people heard her sing Let the Bright Seraphim by Handel at the wedding of the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1981. ""I was told two or three months before, you will sing this song,"" she revealed. ""Can you imagine holding that inside you for months and months, not being able to mention it to anyone?"" But after the death of the Princess of Wales in 1997, she never sang it again. ""I never wanted to,"" she said. ""When she died, I felt that I should put that song away forever."" She has not even listened to the piece again since then. ""In sort of respect for her, and the death and everything about it was such a terrible thing that I never wanted to hear it again."" Dame Kiri runs her own Foundation to support young New Zealand singers Dame Kiri was also the first singer to perform the Rugby World Cup anthem World in Union in 1991. Her other career highlights include a guest appearance in ITV's Downton Abbey in 2013. Her focus now, she said, was training what she called the future stars of opera through her own Foundation. And she is being honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the Gramophone Classical Music Awards.  ""It's very, very special,"" she said. Nonetheless, she thinks it is ""self-indulgent"" to dwell on the past. And she insisted that when she did reflect on her career, she never felt completely satisfied. ""I never really achieved perfection of the 100% that I would have liked to. ""I never actually came off stage saying, 'I've really nailed it.' Never. I always thought there was a mistake in it. ""I was constantly analysing through the whole of the performance what I'd done."" But, she added with a wry smile: ""I did keep trying.""

"UK unemployment fell by 75,000 in the three months to July, bringing the jobless rate down to 4.3% from 4.4% in the previous quarter. The rate remains at its lowest since 1975, but a squeeze on real incomes continues, according to theOffice for National Statistics figures,external. Wages in the period were 2.1% up on a year earlier, little changed from the previous months' growth rates. With inflation hitting 2.9% in August, wages are failing to keep up. In real terms, wages have fallen by 0.4% over the last year. Matt Hughes, a senior ONS statistician, said: ""Another record high employment rate and a record low inactivity rate suggest the labour market continues to be strong. ""In particular, the number of people aged 16 to 64 not in the labour force because they are looking after family or home is the lowest since records began, at less than 2.1 million. Inflation has picked up sharply since the pound fell after the Brexit vote last year. Employment minister Damian Hinds said: ""The strength of the economy is helping people of all ages find work, from someone starting their first job after leaving education, to those who might be starting a new career later in life. ""But there is more to do, and we will continue to build on our achievements through our employment programmes and the work of Jobcentre Plus."" Economists have been pondering what the latest data means for the course of interest rates. The panel that sets interest rates at the Bank of England, the Monetary Policy Committee, will make its announcement on Thursday. Last month two committee members backed a rate rise, and there has been speculation that the Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane could join them this week. That would still leave the committee split 6-3 against raising rates from the record low 0.25%. Some economists think that the latest data will favour the so-called doves, who argue in favour of keeping rates on hold. ""While the continued strength of employment will be welcomed by the MPC, the continued absence of a pick-up in wage growth is likely to keep the doves in the majority,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist for Capital Economics. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The latest labour market data are, on balance, a setback for the hawks on the MPC arguing for higher interest rates,"" he said. ""The three-month average number of job vacancies in August was 0.9% lower than in the previous three months, pointing to a slowdown in employment growth ahead."" The sluggish figures on wage growth were blamed for a fall in value of the pound against the dollar. Sterling, which had been higher in morning trading, fell back after the ONS figures were released. The pound was trading as high as $1.3329 before the data, but gave up those gains to trade at $1.3275. Wage stagnation and an ever increasing cost of living have left many people feeling poorer over the last few years.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Dave Lee gets hands on with the new iPhone X When Apple chief Tim Cook declared the iPhone X ""the biggest leap forward since the first iPhone"" at his latest launch extravaganza, you couldn't help but wonder if he was referring to its features or its price. With the top-end model costing Â£1,149, customers are paying a premium to swap their fingerprint sensor for a facial scanner and the ability to make an animated monkey or poo emoji copy their bemused looks. In opting to refer to the model as ""ten"" rather than ""x"", the firm has also thrown its naming convention into a bit of confusion - will there ever be an iPhone 9 - or indeed IX? Of course, that's a problem for another day. And the internet has had plenty else to chew over in the meantime... Some critics believe the iPhone X makes the new iPhone 8 models look outdated Cnet,external The two biggest questions for me focus on the iPhone X's most daring design change, ditching the home button. Will it actually make the phone more convenient to use? And will using your face to unlock the phone benefit you, or is it just a workaround? The Verge,external The iPhone X may be the most powerful iPhone ever, but compared to almost any other Android flagships, it's hard to pick out a category where it leads the pack - at least on paper when comparing raw specifications. But if Apple has shown one thing time and again with every iPhone generation, it's that optimisation of hardware and software matter just as much - if not more. Wall Street Journal,external The iPhone X's new design - a 5.8in, edge-to-edge display -has raised hopes that it can reverse Apple's fortunes in China, where sales have fallen six straight quarters. Chinese consumers are more influenced by a phone's appearance than consumers in other markets, and Apple had kept the same appearance for three years. Bloomberg,external A $1,000 iPhone could add as much as 6% to Apple's 2018 earnings per share... but that depends on the iPhone X being a hit, and there's more competition from lower-cost Chinese competitors such as Huawei and Xiaomi, which timed the introduction of their new phones around Apple's launch to attract customers who may be deterred by the iPhone X's price. Slashgear,external Apple has crafted a stunning new flagship. In a time when existing iPhones were starting to look a little - dare I say - pedestrian in comparison to what Samsung, LG, and others were doing in hardware, the iPhone X has accelerated through and can spar with the best of them. Engadget,external What did bother me a little more than expected were the bezels that run around the screen... Given that Apple's competition has done an incredible job trimming the cruft from around their displays, I can't help but feel that the iPhone X's design doesn't have the same kind of impact as, say, the Essential or Samsung's recent Galaxys. Wired,external The very notion of using your face as the key to your digital secrets presents some fundamental problems... It's very hard to hide your face from someone who wants to coerce you to unlock your phone, like a mugger, a customs agent, or a policeman who has just arrested you. In some cases, criminal suspects in the US can invoke the Fifth Amendment protections from self-incrimination to refuse to give up their phone's passcode. That same protection doesn't apply to your face. Financial Times,external All the focus today was on the innovations in the X.But it all made the new 8 look like a rather boring, ""plain old"" iPhone - and the price for that has just gone up $50 as well. Techcrunch,external The X is the best iPhone, no questions, and it's quickly jumped to the top of the best phones, period. Yeah, it's going to cost you, but you already knew that. This video can not be played WATCH: Apple's event in two minutes ""I gaze into the iPhone and the iPhone gazes back at me""  - Nietzsche.@ericasadun,external I'm not sure how the iPhone X face recognition will distinguish between me with make-up and without make-up.

It'll look at your face and tell you that you can't afford it.  -Abhimanyu Singh,external Face ID seems like an over-engineered fix that they were forced to include because they couldn't integrate a fingerprint scanner into the screen -Nick Farina,external How on earth can they justify the same price in $s as in Â£s... utterly shameful! I won't be buying on that basis alone. -Darren Taylor,external They made the 8 almost identical to the 7 so people would have to spend the extra money for the X. And I'm sure I'll buy one even though I know what they did. -Patrick Michael,external Google has just been given a gift.

"UK unemployment fell by 75,000 in the three months to July, bringing the jobless rate down to 4.3% from 4.4% in the previous quarter. The rate remains at its lowest since 1975, but a squeeze on real incomes continues, according to theOffice for National Statistics figures,external. Wages in the period were 2.1% up on a year earlier, little changed from the previous months' growth rates. With inflation hitting 2.9% in August, wages are failing to keep up. In real terms, wages have fallen by 0.4% over the last year. Matt Hughes, a senior ONS statistician, said: ""Another record high employment rate and a record low inactivity rate suggest the labour market continues to be strong. ""In particular, the number of people aged 16 to 64 not in the labour force because they are looking after family or home is the lowest since records began, at less than 2.1 million. Inflation has picked up sharply since the pound fell after the Brexit vote last year. Employment minister Damian Hinds said: ""The strength of the economy is helping people of all ages find work, from someone starting their first job after leaving education, to those who might be starting a new career later in life. ""But there is more to do, and we will continue to build on our achievements through our employment programmes and the work of Jobcentre Plus."" Economists have been pondering what the latest data means for the course of interest rates. The panel that sets interest rates at the Bank of England, the Monetary Policy Committee, will make its announcement on Thursday. Last month two committee members backed a rate rise, and there has been speculation that the Bank's chief economist Andy Haldane could join them this week. That would still leave the committee split 6-3 against raising rates from the record low 0.25%. Some economists think that the latest data will favour the so-called doves, who argue in favour of keeping rates on hold. ""While the continued strength of employment will be welcomed by the MPC, the continued absence of a pick-up in wage growth is likely to keep the doves in the majority,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist for Capital Economics. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""The latest labour market data are, on balance, a setback for the hawks on the MPC arguing for higher interest rates,"" he said. ""The three-month average number of job vacancies in August was 0.9% lower than in the previous three months, pointing to a slowdown in employment growth ahead."" The sluggish figures on wage growth were blamed for a fall in value of the pound against the dollar. Sterling, which had been higher in morning trading, fell back after the ONS figures were released. The pound was trading as high as $1.3329 before the data, but gave up those gains to trade at $1.3275. Wage stagnation and an ever increasing cost of living have left many people feeling poorer over the last few years.

"Florence Cheptoo began to learn to read when her grandchild brought home a library book What's it like to read your first words at the age of 60? What difference does it make after a lifetime of getting by without reading? If you think about how much written information we consume every hour - going through emails at work or flicking through messages on mobile phones - it's hard to imagine being without these ways of communicating. But Florence Cheptoo, who lives in an isolated rural village near Chesongoch, in Kenya, has turned her first page as a 60-year-old. Her path to reading began when her granddaughter brought home books from primary school. The school had been given a small lending library of books, through the Book Aid International charity that distributes books donated by UK publishers. But many of the parents and grandparents of the schoolchildren were themselves unable to read, and teachers began literacy lessons for adults. Florence, forwarding her answers to the BBC through a local librarian, said she now felt ""part of those who are in the modern world"". Adult literacy classes began after the library was opened When she had been younger, there had been no support for her to become literate, she said. Her parents had wanted her to marry and to get a dowry and stay tending livestock - and there had never been a chance to learn. ""My parents did not value the need for education,"" she said. It meant that she couldn't sign her name or read any legal documents or check if she was being cheated over payments. Now, Florence has begun reading and lists the practical differences it has made in her life. She can read the information on medicine she is prescribed, she can look at newspapers and find out about the outside world and take charge of her own personal records. Florence says that learning to read has brought more control over her life, as well as pleasure There are things she said she particularly enjoyed: reading storybooks for the first time, getting letters from her family and being able to read the Bible for herself. The world of maps has been opened up. ""I like knowing where other parts of the country are located,"" she said. And she has been getting books on agriculture ""so that I can learn how to farm"". When her grandchildren get school reports, she can see how they are progressing. It had given her a new confidence, she said, letting her feel more knowledgeable and able to have an opinion alongside people, either literate or illiterate. ""I am able to identify what is good and bad in society."" Florence wasn't the oldest member of this adult literacy class. There was also a man in his 80s. His eyesight wasn't very good and he didn't really think he would become much of a reader - but he told the teachers that he wanted to be seen regularly at the class to send a message to the rest of the village that this was important.

The Book Aid International charity distributes a million free books a year, new from publishers, with further grants to buy books locally and to train librarians and teaching staff. Most of the books go to projects in Africa, where they are shared in libraries. The village is in a remote part of Kenya Emma Taylor, from Book Aid International, has visited the scheme in Kenya where Florence is learning and says there is a great demand for learning there - which the library helps to serve. ""It's an incredibly powerful experience,"" she said, seeing people reading for the first time. ""It opens the door to so many different things that we take so much for granted."" Setting up libraries in deprived communities had a particular value, she said. In the slums of Nairobi, she said, libraries had become a place of safety for young people, where they could feel protected, and then could begin exploring the books around them and opening up their minds to ideas. ""There's something really special about a library. It's not just putting books in a room,"" she said.

"Rebel Wilson celebrating in June after a jury found in her favour Actress Rebel Wilson has been awarded A$4.5m (Â£2.7m; $3.6m) in Australia's largest payout for a defamation case. Wilson successfully argued that a series of magazine articles had wrongly portrayed her as a serial liar. In June a jury unanimously sidedwith the star, who had claimed the articles stifled her career in Hollywood. She has said she will give the money away. Bauer Media has always denied the articles were defamatory. A lawyer said it would consider the judgement. Wilson sought A$7m during the trial but had offered to settle for A$200,000 before it went to court. Justice John Dixon told the Supreme Court of Victoria that the defamation case was ""unprecedented in this country"" because of its international reach. ""Substantial vindication can only be achieved by an award of damages that underscores that Ms Wilson's reputation as an actress of integrity was wrongly damaged in a manner that affected her marketability in a huge worldwide marketplace,"" he said on Wednesday. The Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect actress was not in court on Wednesday, butshe later tweeted,externalthat Bauer Media ""viciously tried to take [her] down with a series of false articles""and,external""subjected [her] to a sustained and malicious attack"". ""The judge accepted without qualification that I had an extremely high reputation and that the damage inflicted on me was substantial,""she wrote,external. Allow Twitter content?

Wilson sat in court for every day of the three-week trial and spent six days in the witness box. She claimed that eight articles published by Bauer magazines in 2015 had portrayed her as a serial liar, and that this resulted in her being sacked from two feature films. A six-woman jury rejected Bauer Media's arguments that the articles were substantially true, trivial and did not affect Wilson's acting career. A 12-person jury is not required for civil cases in Victoria. Wilson said the verdict had exposed the ""disgusting and disgraceful"" conduct of some tabloid media.

The latest images show homes torn apart after the storm pummelled the region with winds of up to 120mph (192km/h). Search and rescue teams are moving through the worst affected areas with emergency supplies of food and water. US President Donald Trump will visit Florida on Thursday to view the damage caused as Irma tore through the state. It will be Mr Trump's third trip related to hurricanes in two weeks and he will be joined this week by his wife Melania, the first lady. Residents of Vilano Beach in Florida are returning to find their homes destroyed About 90,000 residents returning to the Florida Keys and Miami Beach have been warned that most fuel stations remain closed and mobile phone signals are patchy.

"This video can not be played Brexit is ""a very sad and tragic moment in our history"" The ""wind is back in Europe's sails"", European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said in his annual state of the union address. Hetold the European Parliament,externalthere was a ""window of opportunity"" to build a stronger, more united union - but it ""wouldn't stay open forever"". Mr Juncker said Europe's economy was ""bouncing back"" and the EU had to move beyond Brexit. He called for the union to embrace reforms and forge new trade deals. UK will soon regret Brexit - Juncker Last year, the EU was ""battered and bruised by a year that shook our very foundation"", Mr Juncker said - facing the challenges of Brexit, the migrant crisis and the rise of populism. In his speech of more than an hour, during which he switched from English to French to German, Mr Juncker said member states ""chose unity"" and the union was ""slowly but surely gathering momentum"". The speech was markedly different from recent years, says the BBC Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas. Gone was the sense of crises besetting the EU - instead Mr Juncker mentioned Brexit just once in an address focused on a post-Brexit vision for the EU. Addressing the UK'sdecision to leave the EUon 29 March 2019, he said that ""we will always regret this"" and, departing from his script, he added ""and you will regret it soon, too"". ""We will move on because Brexit isn't everything. It isn't the future of Europe - it's not the be all and end all."" He called for a summit in Romania on 30 March 2019 for decisions to be taken on a ""more united, stronger and democratic Europe"". The state of the union address gives the Commission's president a chance to outline the political objectives of the EU executive. Juncker's speech: as it happened Mr Juncker hailed a European Union where membership of the banking union, eurozone and the Schengen border-free zone would be standard. Ontrade, Mr Juncker hailed recent deals with Canada and Japan, and said deals with Mexico and South America were in the pipeline. Trade talks should open with Australia and New Zealand, he said, and be completed by late 2019. But he said there had to be reciprocity in trade deals: ""We have to get as much as we give."" And he promised new openness in trade negotiations and - amid concern about Chinese investment in strategic European assets - said investors in the EU would be screened. Mr Juncker praised Europe's progress onmigration, saying it protected its external borders in a more efficient manner. He highlighted Italy's ""perseverance and generosity"" in helping to manage irregular migration from Africa. But work needed to be done opening legal migration routes, ending ""scandalous"" conditions in Libya and investing in Africa. Mr Juncker said the EU must embrace the value of equality - between member states, workers and consumers. Referring to growing controversy overdifferent food standards across the union, Mr Juncker said he ""would not accept that in some parts of Europe, people are sold food of lower quality than in other countries, despite the packaging and branding being identical"". Europe had to pursue a ""credibleenlargementproject to the countries of the western Balkans"", and it was high time for Romania and Bulgaria to be brought into the EU's border-free Schengen zone, along with Croatia when it was ready, he said. Mr Juncker joined the chorus of criticism against Turkey's imprisonment of journalists But he sternly reminded member states that final jurisdiction in the union belonged to the European Court of Justice, and said the rule of law was not optional. That might have been a tacit reference to countries such as Poland, which have defied judicial decisions from the EU on a number of issues. In the EU ""the rule of law, justice and fundamental rights"" took priority, he said - and ""that rules out EU membership forTurkeyfor the foreseeable future"". He demanded that Ankara free imprisoned journalists and stop personal attacks on European leaders. ""Stop calling our leaders fascists and Nazis!"" he demanded, to applause from the assembly. Mr Juncker also called for a number of keyreformsto the union's organisation. He suggested his own role of Commission president should be merged with that of the Council president, and elected following a ""pan-European campaign"". This proposal, he added, did not ""target in any way"" the work of his ""excellent friend"" Donald Tusk - the current incumbent of the Council presidency. Any attempt to merge the two roles would require a change to EU treaties. The Commission leader also proposed the creation of a Europe-wide finance minister, enabling deeper integration of the eurozone. In response, Denmark's Prime Minister Lars LÃ¸kke Rasmussen said he agreed with Mr Juncker that there should not be treaty changes. ""No new grand projects or institutional discussions,"" hetweeted,external. But the role of the Council president was important,he said,external, and needed as a voice of member states.

"This video can not be played Odette spent two years sleeping rough in London The number of homeless families in the UK has risen by more than 60% and is ""likely to have been driven"" by the government's welfare reforms, the public spending watchdog has said. Homelessness of all kinds has increased ""significantly"" over the last six years, said the National Audit Office. It accused the government of having a ""light touch approach"" to tackling the problem. The government said it was investing Â£550m by 2020 to address the issue. There has been a 60% rise in households living in temporary accommodation - which includes 120,540 children - since 2010/11, the NAO said. A snapshot overnight count last autumn found there were 4,134 rough sleepers - an increase of 134% since the Conservatives came into government, it added. A report by the watchdog found rents in England have risen at the same time as households have seen a cut to some benefits. Homelessness cost more than Â£1bn a year to deal with, it said. Reforms to the local housing allowance are ""likely to have contributed"" to making it more expensive for claimants to rent privately and ""are an element of the increase in homelessness,"" the report added. Welfare reforms announced by the government in 2015 included a four-year freeze to housing benefit - which was implemented in April 2016. Auditor General Sir Amyas Morse said the Department for Work and Pensions had failed to evaluate the impact of the benefit changes on homelessness. ""It is difficult to understand why the department persisted with its light touch approach in the face of such a visibly growing problem. ""Its recent performance in reducing homelessness therefore cannot be considered value for money."" The ending of private sector tenancies - rather than a change in personal circumstances - has become the main cause of homelessness in England, with numbers tripling since 2010/11, said the NAO. Its analysis found private sector rents in England have gone up by three times as much as wages since 2010 - apart from in the north and East Midlands. While in London, costs have risen by 24% - eight times the average wage increase. Reforms to the local housing allowance are ""likely to have contributed"" to homelessness, says the NAO Councils spent Â£1.1bn on homelessness in 2015/16 - with Â£845m going to pay for temporary accommodation, the NAO said. It found that local authorities in London have been buying properties outside the capital to house families. Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said: ""It is a national scandal that more and more people are made homeless every year. ""This reports illustrates the very real human cost of the government's failure to ensure people have access to affordable housing."" The Local Government Association - which represents councils - said local authorities were having to house ""the equivalent of an extra secondary school's worth of homeless children in temporary accommodation every month."" ""The net cost to councils of doing this has tripled in the last three years, as they plug the gap between rising rents and frozen housing benefit."" It called on the government to support councils by allowing them to invest in building affordable homes and ""provide the support and resources they need to help prevent people becoming homeless in the first place"". Homelessness charity Shelter said it wants the government to end the freeze on housing benefit and commit to building affordable homes. The government said tackling homelessness was a ""complex issue"" but it was determined to help the most vulnerable in society. It said it was implementing the Homelessness Reduction Act which ""means more people get the help they need earlier to prevent them from becoming homeless in the first place"". A spokesman added: ""Our welfare reforms restore fairness to the system with a strong safety net in place to support the most vulnerable, including Â£24bn through the housing benefit. ""There's more to do to make sure people always have a roof over their head and ministers will set out further plans shortly, including delivering on our commitment to eliminate rough sleeping entirely.""

"A hugely successful internet reality show has put hip-hop music into the national spotlight for the first time in China. With more than 2.5 billion views on China's largest online video hosting website, iQiyi, the Rap of China has seen dozens of Chinese rappers shoot to stardom. Showcasing young and feisty contestants locked in rap battle in front of a panel of celebrity judges, the show sparked debate, memes and catchphrases across the Chinese-speaking web. ""Can you freestyle?"" became a buzzword, after one of the celebrity judges, Kris Wu, used it to repeatedly grill contestants as he was questioned over his own hip hop legitimacy. Hip hop terms like ""diss"" - to put someone down - have crept into everyday conversation. The 12-episode show, which wrapped up last weekend, was hugely successful in bringing underground rappers such as HipHopMan, Tizzy T, PG One, Jony J, or VAVA to public attention. This video can not be played Is the world ready for Chinese hip hop? ""It's like they ripped open a gap and found it full of gold,"" Wang Ke, or MC Bigdog, one of the contestants featured in the show, told the BBC. ""Chinese rappers have been underestimated and neglected,"" Wang said. ""Our net worth has grown exponentially after the show, but it should have done so a long time ago."" Judge Kris Wu (centre) was challenged over his legitimacy on the panel Rappers like MC Bigdog were around long before Rap of China. The genre started gaining momentum in the early 2000s, influenced by American rappers like Eminem and Jay-Z. Rappers who did well might be signed to labels, music festivals and fashion brands. Some got to perform in clubs. The number of hip hop music venues and clubs has grown over the years, and national competitions like the China Iron Mic helped to spur on the scene in many cities. Yet in a society that doesn't encourage self expression, the rebel spirit of hip hop never really managed to take centre stage but stayed in its own ecosystem. For most rappers it has remained a hobby - some would even pay out of their own pockets to record albums. Rap of China, therefore, was a game changer. It was said to be the most expensive reality show in history with an investment of 200 million yuan ($30m; Â£23.7m). Some 700 aspiring rappers auditioned. Al Rocco mainly raps in English. He was eliminated in Rap of China in the first round because he didn't rap in Chinese. He then wrote an expletive-laden song, The Rap of China DISS, to show his contempt for the format. Al Rocco says the show is about drama, not music Although the show provided money for hip hop music to grow, ""it's not real hip hop that is in the show,"" Al Rocco complains. He thinks the programme focuses on drama rather than the music itself so people who didn't know about hip hop would tune in to see it. ""China is a hard market,"" says Al Rocco, a Hong Kong-born rapper who lives in Shanghai. ""Hip hop is so small in China even though we've been doing it for so many years. You need money to bring that to the world,"" he says. Adding drama was not the only criticism Rap of China faces. Many have accused it of having an unfair selection process that favoured some contestants, and others pointed out that the set-up and theme were strikingly similar to South Korean hip hop reality TV show Show Me the Money. But the criticism that matters most to rappers and diehard underground hip hop fans in China is whether going mainstream would mean the end of what they see as ""real hip hop"". Wang Bo, or MC Webber, who many consider to be China's hip hop authority, was one of the many underground rappers who tried to steer clear of the show. Wang thinks even Xi Ha, the Chinese translation of ""hip hop"", was created to help make a quick profit. Over-commercialising hip hop will drain the creativity of young people and reduce the songs to ""fast food music"", he wrote on his microblog. However, MC Hotdog, who now has his own hip hop business managing rappers and performances, says he's hopeful about the new changes. ""It was hard to keep hip hop real before in China because of all the politics in China,"" MC Hotdog said. ""Now that the money problem is solved, hip hop artists don't have to worry about their livelihood. They will have more room to keep it real."" ""Real hip hop"", MC Hotdog says, is for those underdogs in society to have a voice of peace, love, independence and unity. ""We are not highly commercialised like in the US where hip hop is just about money and sex,"" MC Hotdog says. ""What China offers is our long history and deeply cultured literature."" This is not the only thing that China will offer though. Rap of China also had to face China's increasingly stringent internet censorship. MC Sun Bayi says yes to hip hop - albeit in line with Socialist values The latest restriction is for online multimedia content like mini movies, reality shows and commentary programmes to avoid producing content that is vulgar, sensational or political. The ""healthy and positive"" environment the authorities require is not entirely in line with what's considered ""real hip hop"", but what we already see is hip hop living in harmony with Chinese characteristics. ""Like Chairman Mao said, borrow what's good from the West and use it in China,"" says one of the contestants MC Sun Bayi, who is known for performing in formal business attire. ""The Chinese invented gunpowder and the Westerners made firearms with it. Now they have hip hop, and we will make it Chinese."" ""I don't like rapping about what I shouldn't rap about anyway, especially things not in line with Socialist values,"" MC Sun Bayi says, shrugging off concerns that hip hop is losing its edge. ""This is the Chinese version of hip hop,"" he concludes.

"At least 80 people died at Grenfell Tower London's fire commissioner says the Grenfell Tower blaze must be a ""turning point"",  calling for sprinklers in all high-rise council flats. At least 80 people died when fire engulfed the west London block in June. A BBC Breakfast investigation which focused on half the UK's council and housing association-owned tower blocks found just 2% have full sprinkler systems. Of those, 68% have just one staircase through which to evacuate. A public inquiry will look at the causes of the fire, the adequacy of high-rise regulations, Grenfell Tower's refurbishment, and the actions of public authorities before and after the blaze. The inquirywill hold its first hearing on Thursday, with an initial report due by Easter. The Department for Communities and Local Government says it will consider whether to retrofit sprinklers based on the inquiry's recommendations. This video can not be played London Fire Brigade commissioner Dany Cotton says she supports retrofitting fire sprinklers Dany Cotton, commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, said: ""I think Grenfell should be a turning point. ""I support retrofitting - for me where you can save one life then it's worth doing. ""This can't be optional, it can't be a nice to have, this is something that must happen. ""If that isn't one of the recommendations (of the Grenfell Tower inquiry) then I will be so very disappointed."" In 2007, sprinklers were made compulsory in new-build high rises over 98 feet (30m) tall in England. This requirement was not applied retroactively so did not apply to Grenfell Tower, which was built in 1974. Tower block fires: Did government act on advice? Reality Check: Why don't all high-rises have sprinklers? Croydon Council, in south London, has taken the decision to retrofit sprinklers in its 25 high-rise blocks at a cost of Â£10m. Councillor Alison Butler, Croydon's deputy leader and cabinet member for homes, regeneration and planning, said: ""Grenfell changed everything. It was horrifying. ""It brings home to you as a council that there are a lot of things you do, but this one is about saving lives."" The council says the Department of Communities and Local Government failed to offer any financial support to install sprinklers when the council requested it earlier this year. In a letter to the council, Housing Minister Alok Sharma said ""It is the landlord's responsibility to ensure people are safe, and cost considerations should not get in the way of this."" He did say support would be provided to prevent crucial safety work from falling through on cost grounds. The report into the Lakanal House fire in 2009 supported the introduction of sprinklers After the inquest into tower block fire in 2009, coroner Frances Kirkham recommended the government ""encourage"" housing providers to retrofit sprinkler systems in high rise flats. Six people were killed in the fire in Lakanal House, in Southwark, London, in July 2009. Alan Brinson, executive director of campaign group the European Fire Sprinkler Network, said that sprinklers could significantly reduce fire deaths. ""Nothing compares to them in saving lives,"" he said. Evidence from the US shows thatdeaths per thousand reported fires were 87% lower,externalwhere sprinklers were fitted. Major fires in high rises with sprinklers in which nobody died Marina Torch Tower, Dubai: 2015 and 2017 The Address, Dubai: 2015 Lacrosse Building, Melbourne: 2014 Polat Tower, Istanbul: 2012 Monte Carlo Hotel, Las Vegas: 2008 Ann Jones pushed through stronger fire regulations in Wales In Wales, all new homes built from 2016 now have to be fitted with sprinkler systems. Ann Jones, Labour AM for the Vale of Clywd, pushed reforms through the Welsh Assembly. ""After 30 years in the fire service, I saw many firefighters coming back from incidents of fires where they had lost people, and the devastation that that causes,"" she said. ""I decided I was going to try to put in a system that would help fire safety, and for me, sprinklers in all new build homes was that opportunity."" Scotland also has stronger regulation than England, with new residential buildings taller than 18m requiring sprinklers. BBC research found 30% of the blocks investigated had some kind of cladding, though not the same ACM cladding that played a role at Grenfell. Some of this cladding will have passed safety tests, and some will still be undergoing checks. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""The results from the BBC investigation should be a source of concern to us all. ""The Grenfell public inquiry must report as soon as possible so that action can be taken."" A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""Public safety is paramount. ""Following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, the government established a comprehensive building safety programme to ensure a fire like this can never happen again. ""This included commissioning an independent review of building regulations and fire safety. We will consider this issue in light of the recommendations of this review and the findings of the Public Inquiry."" The BBC questioned 56 local authorities and housing associations in towns and cities across the UK with requests under the Freedom of Information act, for high-rise properties for which they hold the freehold. These responses covered about half of the UK's estimated 4,000 tower blocks. Reality Check: Why don't all high-rises have sprinklers? Tower block fires: Did government act on advice?

"This video can not be played WATCH: Dave Lee gets hands on with the new iPhone X When Apple chief Tim Cook declared the iPhone X ""the biggest leap forward since the first iPhone"" at his latest launch extravaganza, you couldn't help but wonder if he was referring to its features or its price. With the top-end model costing Â£1,149, customers are paying a premium to swap their fingerprint sensor for a facial scanner and the ability to make an animated monkey or poo emoji copy their bemused looks. In opting to refer to the model as ""ten"" rather than ""x"", the firm has also thrown its naming convention into a bit of confusion - will there ever be an iPhone 9 - or indeed IX? Of course, that's a problem for another day. And the internet has had plenty else to chew over in the meantime... Some critics believe the iPhone X makes the new iPhone 8 models look outdated Cnet,external The two biggest questions for me focus on the iPhone X's most daring design change, ditching the home button. Will it actually make the phone more convenient to use? And will using your face to unlock the phone benefit you, or is it just a workaround? The Verge,external The iPhone X may be the most powerful iPhone ever, but compared to almost any other Android flagships, it's hard to pick out a category where it leads the pack - at least on paper when comparing raw specifications. But if Apple has shown one thing time and again with every iPhone generation, it's that optimisation of hardware and software matter just as much - if not more. Wall Street Journal,external The iPhone X's new design - a 5.8in, edge-to-edge display -has raised hopes that it can reverse Apple's fortunes in China, where sales have fallen six straight quarters. Chinese consumers are more influenced by a phone's appearance than consumers in other markets, and Apple had kept the same appearance for three years. Bloomberg,external A $1,000 iPhone could add as much as 6% to Apple's 2018 earnings per share... but that depends on the iPhone X being a hit, and there's more competition from lower-cost Chinese competitors such as Huawei and Xiaomi, which timed the introduction of their new phones around Apple's launch to attract customers who may be deterred by the iPhone X's price. Slashgear,external Apple has crafted a stunning new flagship. In a time when existing iPhones were starting to look a little - dare I say - pedestrian in comparison to what Samsung, LG, and others were doing in hardware, the iPhone X has accelerated through and can spar with the best of them. Engadget,external What did bother me a little more than expected were the bezels that run around the screen... Given that Apple's competition has done an incredible job trimming the cruft from around their displays, I can't help but feel that the iPhone X's design doesn't have the same kind of impact as, say, the Essential or Samsung's recent Galaxys. Wired,external The very notion of using your face as the key to your digital secrets presents some fundamental problems... It's very hard to hide your face from someone who wants to coerce you to unlock your phone, like a mugger, a customs agent, or a policeman who has just arrested you. In some cases, criminal suspects in the US can invoke the Fifth Amendment protections from self-incrimination to refuse to give up their phone's passcode. That same protection doesn't apply to your face. Financial Times,external All the focus today was on the innovations in the X.But it all made the new 8 look like a rather boring, ""plain old"" iPhone - and the price for that has just gone up $50 as well. Techcrunch,external The X is the best iPhone, no questions, and it's quickly jumped to the top of the best phones, period. Yeah, it's going to cost you, but you already knew that.

"Rebecca with her daughter, Hannah, and baby Alistair, who was treated for Strep B All pregnant women who go into labour too soon should be given antibiotics to protect their baby from a potentially deadly infection called Group B Strep (GBS), say new guidelines. Hundreds of newborn babies a year in the UK catch it. With prompt treatment, most can make a full recovery. Currently, two in every 20 infected babies develops a disability and one in every 20 dies. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists wants to change this. It says any woman who goes into labour before 37 weeks should be offered antibiotics as a precaution, even if her waters have not broken and the protective amniotic sac surrounding the baby in the womb is still intact. Group B Strep bacteria can live harmlessly in the lower vaginal tract - about one in four women has it - and it can be passed on to the baby during delivery. Most women will not realise they are a carrier. The updated guidelines from the RCOG say pregnant women should be given information about the condition to raise awareness. They also say women who have tested positive for GBS in a previous pregnancy can be tested at 35 to 37 weeks in subsequent pregnancies to see if they also need antibiotics in labour. But they do not go as far as recommending routine screening of mothers-to-be. The RCOG says there is no clear evidence that this would be beneficial, as previously stated by the government's National Screening Committee but campaigners disagree. Group B Strep Support would like every pregnant woman to be offered the opportunity to be tested for the bacteria. Chief executive Jane Plumb said: ""The RCOG guideline is a significant improvement on previous editions, however, the UK National Screening Committee still recommends against offering GBS screening to all pregnant women, ignoring international evidence that shows such screening reduces GBS infection, disability and death in newborn babies."" Baby Alistair was unaffected by GBS after his mother was given antibiotics after her waters broke Rebecca Gunn, 32 and from Wakefield, had GBS during her second pregnancy. ""I had gone in to hospital after experiencing some bleeding at 17 weeks, and that is when they picked up that I was a GBS carrier. ""The diagnosis came out of the blue. I was really surprised, as GBS hadn't even crossed my mind."" Rebecca went into labour at 38 weeks and was given intravenous antibiotics after her waters broke. She gave birth to her son, Alistair, who was fortunately unaffected by GBS. ""I knew nothing about GBS. I'm not saying this to scare people, but it's important they are informed and aware of the risks,"" she said. GBS is not a sexually transmitted disease. Treating a woman carrying GBS does not prevent these normal bacteria that many adults carry from returning A woman who has it will not usually have symptoms or side-effects Testing is the only way to know if you are carrying GBS If you are pregnant and found to have it, steps can be taken to reduce the risk of GBS to your baby Follow Michelleon Twitter,external Mum calls for bug test after baby death Newborns at risk from deadly bacteria Aimee was left disabled after contracting Group B Strep Group B Strep Support Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

" Elon Musk's SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches from Cape Canaveral From its early days with the launch of Sputnik in 1957 and Yuri Gagarin’s flight in 1961, human exploration of space has been dominated by the Cold War rivalry between the USSR and US - and in particular the race to be first to the Moon. Throughout this tumultuous struggle for the “high ground of space”, business took a back seat - it was governments that paid for and sustained the space effort. True, the world’s first commercial satellite - Early Bird - had been launched in 1965 but until recently the commercial development of space was largely limited to big telecommunications satellites. Costing several hundred million dollars each and weighing several tonnes, these satellites are designed to last up to 15 years so investors can recoup the expense of building them in the first place. But a revolution has been taking place. Technological advances are overturning traditional models for operating in space. A host of firms are promising cheaper access to space, with innovations such as renewable rockets and horizontal launch systems. Satellites are getting smaller and becoming cheaper to build – and there are now about 1,500 of them orbiting above us. A flood of data and imagery is flowing from space and new players are now processing, interpreting – and marketing - this information revolution. “We can now do something in a shoebox that previously would have taken the size of a bus,” says Stuart Martin, chief executive of Satellite Applications Catapult, a UK business incubator helping space start-ups. That means we can really change and rethink the way we use space.” Investment is pouring into the space sector. In 2016, the global space economy totalled $329bn with three-quarters of that coming from commercial activity – not governments. Rockets are our gateway to space, the essential delivery trucks. To outsiders they encapsulate our endeavours to become a true spacefaring civilisation. And indeed when it comes to rockets, it’s billionaires who are leading the way. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is using its Falcon 9 rockets to supply the International Space Station, while Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin is developing its New Shepard and New Glenn launchers. Both firms have demonstrated revolutionary techniques which enable vertical landing – a significant step in the drive for reusable rockets. Meanwhile Richard Branson’s Virgin Group is working on developing launching satellites from the air – alongside its plans for sub-orbital tourist flights. One new player hoping to change the way in which space is used is New Zealand’s Rocket Lab. Still in its infancy, it is the only rocket firm in the world with its own launch complex, on North Island’s Mahia Peninsula. At the moment, no launch companies work purely on a commercial basis.  “They are all heavily government subsidised one way or another,” says Stuart Martin. While rockets haven’t changed that much since Sputnik in 1957 - you still have to get your payload out of the Earth’s gravity and into orbit - it would be a mistake to think of Rocket Lab as simply another traditional rocket manufacturer, argues founder Peter Beck. The whole purpose of the company is not to build rockets [but] to enable access to space...The kind of access and frequency to space we’re proposing has never ever been created.” Currently the average cost of a satellite launch is about $200m, and in the US last year, for example, there were just 22 launches. Peter Beck says once his rocket is operational he’s looking to go to space for $5m, and “as frequently as once a week”. At the heart of Rocket Lab’s sales pitch is its Electron rocket, designed specially to take small satellites into orbit. The rocket is mainly carbon fibre and its engines are all 3D-printed. Whereas it would normally take months to produce an engine, “we can produce it in 24 hours,” says Beck. In its first test flight this May, the rocket successfully entered space but did not reach orbit. Two more test flights are planned. At the moment, small satellite makers often hitch rides on existing launches, which have a big satellite as their main cargo but still have some room to spare. However, with demand for Earth observation increasing - weather, travel, maps - manufacturers need flexible ways to arrange getting into space. It is this gap that Beck says Rocket Lab is planning to fill. Instead of waiting for a suitable space on a big rocket,  “now you can just go online and click a few buttons and you’ve bought a launch”. One firm keen to use Rocket Lab’s Electron launcher is San Francisco’s Planet Labs, which designs and builds its own miniature “cube sats” weighing just 4kg. There is a big green field opportunity for fleets of small satellites that do a variety of missions.” Unlike traditional commercial communications satellites in high geostationary orbits, 35,700km (22,200 miles) above the Earth, Planet Lab’s satellites (called Doves) fly much lower at just 500km – that’s the distance from London to Cologne in Germany. This lower orbit means the spacecraft can use smaller cameras and still get decent image resolutions – bringing the weight and cost down to a fraction of traditional satellites. Being small and relatively cheap means new designs can be tested and built quickly, the firm says. “We have completely taken the supply constraints off and brought the costs of the pictures we’re taking down – in many orders of magnitude,” says Will Marshall. And he adds, that means not only lower prices for customers, but also ensures the data is available to a broader range of people. “It’s not just the governments and the big companies that can buy our data. Anyone [can] access our data – whether they’re a small or medium sized business, an NGO, or researcher at a university.” Planet Labs photo of Mailiao Refinery in Taiwan (Previous image: Singapore) Infra-red cameras revealed damage to crops from hail in Idaho, US The Kashagan oilfield in Kazakhstan where production restarted earlier this year The Kokpatas gold mine in Uzbekistan Repeated shots can reveal changes such as deforestation here in the Amazon Repeated shots can reveal changes such as deforestation here in the Amazon Images taken over time can indicate significant changes, such as deforestation here in the Amazon. Image Yet while developments in rockets and satellites - the hardware of space - often grab the headlines, the biggest changes are in the practical uses of the information which has been gathered. Farmers, and oil, gas and mining companies are already using such data. Farmers can be warned about problems with soil conditions that could help preparations for poor harvests; fishermen can be told about ocean temperatures and thus where to find fish. With increasingly accurate photographs, individual trees can be tracked as they are logged for timber – a valuable check on deforestation. One firm which is squeezing the maximum amount of information out of this flood of data is the UK’s Terrabotics. “In a normal image you’re limited by the pixel size, but there is rich information between pixels that is captured but that is not obvious,” says chief executive Gareth Morgan. “We do sub-pixel image processing before any more analytics is done on them, we super-resolve the images and make them into 3D data sets, then we put that into AI [artificial intelligence] systems. “We transform our images into signals, a bit like radio waves. That frees us from the constraints of the pixels.” “For instance, we can look at a mine and determine that it has changed – say it’s got deeper or the waste stockpile has become bigger.” (Terrabotics image of the Jwaneng diamond mine in Botswana are pictured.) Prize competitions are also driving disruptive innovations. The Ansari XPrize  encouraged inventors to develop a reusable manned spacecraft. And now the Google Lunar XPrize is offering $20m for the first team to land a robot craft on the Moon which can travel 500m and beam back images. It’s all about spurring innovation and new ways of thinking about space, says Rahul Narayan, the founder of Team Indus in Bangalore, who says he had no experience of space beforehand. “None of the people who started this had any background of space science, engineering, technology."" “It’s good that we didn’t,” he says, because if they had been space engineers “we would never undertake a challenge this big”. The first thing we did after we got selected was to go on Google and type in 'How do you land on the Moon?'” His team are now refining their 6kg lunar rover – one of the lightest ever set to land on a planetary body - which is scheduled for launch in the coming months. “For us it’s been a long journey,” he says, acknowledging the debt they owe to ISRO, the government-run Indian Space Research Organisation, some of whose retired scientists have been helping the mission. “To my mind they are the giants and we are a much smaller company on the shoulders of those giants,” he says. While getting a rover to the Moon may not have an immediate commercial payoff, Narayan argues that if the planned landing succeeds, it will be “a quantum step for every company, every private space company in the world, to go out there and do more stuff in the future”. It’s a vision of a world in which low-cost satellites are carried on affordable rockets that launch when you want – all ordered at the click of a button with no need to wait for slow-moving government-funded space missions. Yet this latest space race also presents its own challenges, says Terrabotics’ Gareth Morgan. The sheer volume of space imagery and data means that AI systems being used to automatically analyse it are having to catch up. “Current AI systems need an extraordinary amount of ‘label training’ so they can then independently recognise different features on their own. We need a change in the way AI works. Progress is being made but it is very new.” More information may generally be a good thing, but there are ethical considerations – after all, everyone is potentially being photographed from space every day. And who has access to this data? As private satellites proliferate and the big data revolution advances, critics argue there needs to be a debate about public and private roles in space. It’s a point that Planet Labs’ Will Marshall accepts. “One of the things that’s important to us is that our imagery cannot see a person let alone recognise a person. Of course that doesn’t mean there are no negative implications. “We as technologists have to be the best stewards we can of that data.” Then there is space debris – there are already some 30,000 objects, large and small, in orbit: “Ultimately we will have to deal with that problem,” agrees Will Marshall. “The industry will have to start bringing those things down and that’s not going to be an easy challenge.” While the potential rewards for investors may be great, so are the risks. Rockets can blow up, fail to launch, or put satellites into the wrong orbit. “Rockets aren’t the way you make money from space,” says Matt Perkins, who was for 10 years the chief executive of industry leader Surrey Satellites and is now head of Oxford University Innovation. “The way you make money is in the downstream end - by using all this information coming from space. As this becomes cheaper that’s going to open up commercial opportunities – with data being used in ways that people haven’t yet thought of.” As he says, there’s a whole range of data from space. In this new business frontier, it will be up to the ingenuity of humans to take commercial advantage of that. Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0

"A former Brexit minister has said the UK must be ""honest"" about the ""complexity and scale"" of leaving the EU. Lord Bridges also urged honesty about the lack of time to reach agreement with the EU over the UK's withdrawal. The Tory peer, who left government after June's general election, emphasised the need for a transitional arrangement after March 2019. That is when the UK is due to leave the EU under the Article 50 process. Negotiations are under way, and ministers have said some form of interim arrangement - ending before the next general election - would help avoid a ""cliff edge"" scenario as new arrangements kick in. On Tuesday evening, peers debated the recent series of papers published by the UK government setting out its position on key negotiation subjects. Lord Bridges, who campaigned for Remain in last year's EU referendum, said: ""We must be honest about the task we face, and its complexity and scale. ""We should be honest about the need to compromise. Honest about the lack of time we, and the EU, have to come to an agreement on our withdrawal."" He said the transitional arrangement must have a clear end point to avoid fuelling suspicion that ""it would be a means to stay in the EU permanently by stealth"". ""During this period we should keep, as far as possible, the existing arrangements we have with the EU,"" he said, adding that the UK should make it clear it will carry on paying into the EU budget until the current ""financial framework"" ends in 2020. As parliamentary under-secretary in the Department for Exiting the EU, Lord Bridges was a member of the ministerial team led by Brexit Secretary David Davis. Saying the government will not be ""defined by Brexit"" - as Theresa May has done - is ""careless talk"" that will distract the government from the ""task at hand"", he said. ""The priority for every department must be to help ministers get the best possible deal, prepare us for Brexit, and ensure we prosper once we have left. Nothing is more important."" Lord Bridges added that the question of what sort of country the UK will be when it regains powers from Brussels was ""unanswered"". The fourth round of UK-EU negotiations, will start on 25 September after they were put back a week. Negotiations are focusing on any ""divorce bill"" to be paid by the UK, citizens' rights and Northern Ireland. The EU says talks cannot move on to trade until it is happy sufficient progress on the initial subjects.

"About 1,000 British troops are in the region providing aid in the wake of the hurricane A number of prisoners are still on the run after more than 100 escaped when Hurricane Irma hit the British Virgin Islands. Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said there was a ""serious threat of the complete breakdown of law and order"". Police and troops have been sent to recapture the prisoners, the Foreign Office said, but some remain at large. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has arrived in the Caribbean, amid criticism over the UK's response. Speaking during the flight, Mr Johnson said his visit was a ""very important statement"" to show people the government was ""here for UK nationals"" in a time of need. More than 500,000 British nationals have been in the path of Hurricane Irma, Sir Alan said, adding that five people are now known to have died in the British Virgin Islands and four in Anguilla. 'Our hotel roof blew off during Irma' Florida to re-open storm-ravaged Keys What are the UK's commitments to overseas territories? Addressing the House of Commons, Sir Alan said there were 997 troops in the region and 47 police officers had been sent to the British Virgin Islands (BVI). ""We have maintained and kept law and order on the BVI which at one point could have dramatically threatened the already unfortunate plight of those that have been hit by the hurricane."" This video can not be played The hurricane-hit islands' needs are ""unprecedented"", says the international development secretary He added that dealing with the security breach ""was what ministers and the ministry of defence was for"". The Foreign Office said the BVI was a ""priority"" and it was working as quickly as possible to fully restore law and order. British overseas territories, including Anguilla, Turks and Caicos and the British Virgin Islands, are self-governing but rely on the UK government for protection against natural disasters. How the British Virgin Islands look now France, UK and Netherlands step up response The UK relief fund of Â£32m has so far provided more than 40 tonnes of aid including 2,608 shelter kits and 2,304 solar lanterns. RFA Mounts Bay, which was pre-positioned in the Caribbean ahead of hurricane season, started helping in Anguilla on 7 September. Meanwhile, a second ship HMS Ocean has been deployed to provide aid and assist the reconstruction effort. Some 250 military personnel will be sent to the Caribbean ""in the next few days"" bringing the total to around 1,250. The foreign secretary said the UK's military presence on the islands was ""really ratcheting up"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says his visit is a ""very important statement"" to reassure the UK nationals Some people in the British Virgin Islands are still lacking basic supplies Another flight of supplies arrives in the BVI ready to be dispatched by soldiers But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the British government's response was ""too little and too late"" and talking about potential evacuation a week on from the disaster was ""alarming"". The first flights for holidaymakers stranded by the hurricane in Florida, Cuba and the Caribbean will start to arrive back in the UK on Wednesday morning. The international development secretary said the UK was in the region for the ""long haul"" and would help reconstruct the British territories. Priti Patel told the BBC: ""We are in no doubt this is an open-ended operation - the support will continue."" She said the needs were ""unprecedented"", but admitted getting kit and people into the region had been challenging. Anguilla:Hit by the full blast of the hurricane on 6 September, killing four. British Virgin Islands:At least five people have died. Expected to require extensive humanitarian assistance. Montserrat:""Swiped"" by Irma but suffered less serious damage. Turks and Caicos:Battered by the hurricane on 7 September, with roofs ripped off, streets flooded, utility poles snapped and a widespread black-out on the main island of Grand Turk.

"Controversial changes giving the government control of key Parliamentary committees have been agreed by MPs. The vote gives the Tories a majority on the public bill committees in charge of the detailed scrutiny of legislation. Opposition MPs said it was a ""constitutional outrage"" and a ""power grab"" from a government lacking a Commons majority. But ministers said they should be able to make progress on getting legislation through Parliament. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said the Tories had a ""working majority"" due to their arrangement with the Democratic Unionist Party, which was agreed after June's general election left the UK with a hung Parliament. The public, she said, ""rightly has an expectation for government to deliver business through the House in a timely fashion"". But Labour's Angela Eagle said the DUP deal did not entitle the government to ""gerrymander the selection of standing committees in order to make life easier"". The SNP's Pete Wishart said it was an ""incredible, totally undemocratic power grab from a government that does not command a majority in this House"". The DUP had already confirmed it would be supporting the government in Tuesday night's vote, and the motion was passed by 320 votes to 301.
