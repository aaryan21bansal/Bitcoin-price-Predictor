"Chicago's frozen shoreline At least 21 people have died in one of the worst cold snaps to hit the US Midwest in decades. Ninety million people - a third of the US - have seen temperatures of -17C (0F) or below. Some 250 million Americans overall have experienced the ""polar vortex"" conditions. Hospitals have been treating patients reporting frostbite as parts of the country ground to a halt. Temperatures are expected to swing to above average over the weekend. Homeless people have been particularly at risk, with warming shelters set up across cities. But some still braved the freezing conditions and one woman, aged 60, was found dead in an abandoned house in Lorain, Ohio. Kindness melting hearts in the polar vortex The city with no homeless on its streets A hospital in Chicago has already treated 50 patients for frostbite,external, and some may end up losing a limb, CNN reports. Half of those patients were homeless individuals , while others had jobs that required them to be outdoors. Some people were found dead a short walk from their homes: A Michigan man who froze to death in his neighbourhood had been ""inadequately dressed for the weather"", officials said In a wind chill of -46C (-51F) an 18-year-old student was found unresponsive a short walk from his dorm on Wednesday and later died in hospital On Tuesday, a man froze to death in a garage in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, having ""apparently collapsed after shovelling snow"", according to a medical examiner Dangerous roads have also been a factor in the deaths. A man was fatally struck by a snow plough near Chicago on Monday and in northern Indiana, a 22-year-old police officer and his wife died after a collision on icy roads. This video can not be played So what actually is a polar vortex...? The icy cold is expected to loosen its grip on Friday. By the end of the weekend, Chicago could see temperatures as high as 10C (50F). ""It's going to be at least a 60-degree swing for Chicago,"" David Hamrick, a National Weather Service forecaster, told Reuters news agency. The sudden weather change coming this weekend may be the fastest warm-up on record, meteorologists say. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But as the temperatures abruptly turn warmer, US emergency officials warn of flooding and utility risks. Pipes can burst with such temperature fluctuations, and rapidly melting snow and ice could cause flooding, the Federal Emergency Management Agency cautioned. More than 30 record lows were broken across the Midwest. Cotton, Minnesota, was the coldest place in the US on Thursday with a low of -48C (-56F) based on preliminary data. Chicago passed the record low for 31 January, while Mount Carroll has probably beaten the Illinois record with a morning temperature of -39C (-38F). Allow Twitter content?

Niagara falls covered with snow Areas across the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan, and in the north, remain under extreme cold warnings. But many parts of the country are moving towards more seasonable temperatures on Friday and over the weekend. In Toronto, wind chills near -30C (-22F) were expected to continue early Friday before beginning to warm. There were also winter storm and blizzards warnings active across the country from the east to the west coast. Environment Canada was urging residents to limit their exposure to cold and keep pets indoors. Canada did not experience a spate of deaths linked to the polar vortex like the US. Stephen Hwang, an associate professor with the University of Toronto's department of medicine, suggested that Canadian cities and public health authorities probably had more experience dealing with the deep cold. Most homeless shelters also already had protocols in place for when the extreme cold hits. But he said it was still ""fortunate"" that cities like Toronto, where homeless shelters have been stretched for resources in recent months, did not see any cold-related deaths among its most vulnerable citizens.

"The UK has objected to Gibraltar being described as a ""colony"" in European Union legislation allowing UK nationals to travel to the EU after Brexit. The EU proposed allowing visa-free travel for Britons in November. The Spanish government has since insisted a footnote be added describing Gibraltar as a ""colony"" and referring to ""controversy"" over its status. The UK's ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, objected to it at a meeting in Brussels earlier. UK travellers to pay â¬7 to visit EU after Brexit Gibraltar: What's it got to do with Brexit? Spain threatens to vote against Brexit deal A UK government spokesperson said: ""The EU's provisions for visa-free travel into and out of the [passport-free] Schengen area cover Gibraltar, and mean that in any scenario, British nationals from Gibraltar will be able to travel for short stays in and out of Spain and other countries in the Schengen area. ""Gibraltar is not a colony and it is completely inappropriate to describe it in this way. ""Gibraltar is a full part of the UK family and has a mature and modern constitutional relationship with the UK. ""This will not change due to our exit from the EU. All parties should respect the people of Gibraltar's democratic wish to be British."" Downing Street also condemned the description of Gibraltar as a ""colony"" in the draft EU document. Fabian Picardo accused Spain of ""bullying"" Gibraltar Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Madrid of trying to ""bully"" the British Overseas Territory by rejecting British demands for the footnote to be removed. ""No one will be surprised to hear the Spanish government making provocative statements in respect of Gibraltar. ""The 32,000 people of Gibraltar are used to the constant attempts by successive Spanish governments to bully us in every possible way. ""This is no different to the sort of abuse we have had from former Spanish administrations."" Gibraltar is a limestone outcrop on the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula, adjacent to Spain, with a population of about 32,000 Gibraltarians are British citizens but they run their own affairs under a chief minister The territory is self-governing in all matters - including taxation - except foreign policy and defence, which are dealt with by the UK government Despite its small size, Gibraltar is strategically important, standing only 12 miles from the north coast of Africa. It has a UK military base, including a port and airstrip Find out more in the BBC's Gibraltar country profile In November, the European Commission offered visa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay in the event of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March, as long as the UK offers the same in return. At a meeting of EU ambassadors earlier, member states agreed their position on the proposed new law. The European Council document says in a footnote:,external""Gibraltar is a colony of the British Crown. ""There is a controversy between Spain and the United Kingdom concerning the sovereignty over Gibraltar, a territory for which a solution has to be reached in light of the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly of the United Nations."" The document will now be discussed by the European Parliament and the European Commission before becoming law. The EU withdrawal agreement agreed with the UK, proposes a special protocol creating several working groups between Madrid and London to discuss the future of Gibraltar. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the Spanish government sees this as giving it a bigger say in the status of Gibraltar, and the issue is likely to be raised again as Brexit approaches, and beyond. But the UK insists the protocol is just about the technicalities of how Brexit will work in Gibraltar, he added. Gibraltar was ceded to Great Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but Spain has continued to press its claim for sovereignty - which is rejected by both the UK and the residents of Gibraltar itself. In December, the United Nations called on Spain and Britain to find a ""definitive solution"" to their long-running dispute. The UN General Assembly adopted a recommendation from its Decolonisation Committee for the two countries to reach a solution through ""dialogue and co-operation"". Gibraltarians rejected by 99% to 1% the idea of the UK sharing sovereignty with Spain in a vote in 2002 and in a previous referendum in 1967. But Gibraltar voted by 96% to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum.

"This video can not be played Six Nations: Wales beat France in comeback in opening game Six Nations: France v Wales France (16) 19 Tries: Picamoles, HugetPens: Lopez 2Drop-goal: Lopez Wales (0) 24 Tries: T Williams, North 2Cons: Anscombe 2, BiggarPens: Biggar Wales made a dramatic winning start to the Six Nations as they staged a second-half revival to beat France. The hosts started superbly and surged into a 16-0 half-time lead with tries from Louis Picamoles and Yoann Huget. After an error-strewn first 40 minutes, Wales were unrecognisable in the second as Tomos Williams and George North crossed to put them 17-16 ahead. Camille Lopez put France back in front but North intercepted a wild pass to seal Wales' 10th straight win. The match-winning score came after a moment of madness from French lock Sebastien Vahaamahina, who undermined his side's earlier good work by throwing a recklessly high-risk miss-pass which North picked off and juggled before speeding to the line. The British and Irish Lions wing had shown a similarly predatory instinct for his first try, pouncing on Huget's calamitous fumble on his own line. It was fitting that Wales' triumph should come from their ability to seize on French mistakes, as this was a match littered with errors and defined by wildly fluctuating swings of momentum. For Wales, it was also a result of huge relief after a first half which threatened to derail their Six Nations before it had begun in earnest. A clean sweep of victories in the autumn series earlier this season had helped build a groundswell of optimism around Welsh rugby with this year's World Cup on the horizon. Yet that sense of buoyancy threatened to be punctured by a limp first 40 minutes, ruthlessly exploited by an impressive French side. But Wales' second-half resurgence turned the game on its head and secured a 10th successive win for the first time since 1999. Relive Wales' stunning fightback as it happened Coach, father, leader: Who is the real Gatland? This video can not be played 'A super bit of play' - Huget scores France's second try Wales head coach Warren Gatland had declared in typically bullish fashion that he believed his side would go on to win the Six Nations if they triumphed in Paris. The New Zealander had some reason to be optimistic, having led Wales to seven victories from their 13 meetings with France during his reign. However, 2017's defeat - a chaotic match which ended with 20 minutes of added time - meant Gatland had lost on three of his five visits to the Stade de France with Wales. This, his final trip to the French capital as Wales coach, he hoped would be a different story - and it was, in as much as this was nothing like the tight contests these two sides have produced in recent years. Instead, Wales were blown away by a French side playing their best rugby for an age. Having handed France the initiative with Picamoles' sixth-minute try - well finished, albeit against less than fierce tackling - Wales faced torrential pressure in the early exchanges. The visitors made matters worse with a raft of handling errors and missed tackles and, even when they fashioned a scoring opportunity, they squandered it. Liam Williams, one of the few bright sparks for Wales in the first half with his menacing runs in open play, had supporting runners either side of him when he broke clear but, after ignoring them, he crossed the line only for his try to be disallowed by the television match official as replays showed him to have knocked on. After Huget crossed for France's second try, Wales were staring at a heavy defeat but, after some wayward goal-kicking from Morgan Parra a half-time deficit of 16-0 felt like some form of mercy for Gatland's men. This video can not be played Six Nations: George North crosses after Yoann Huget mistake Gatland and defence coach Shaun Edwards are not men to mince their words, so you would safely assume they will have given Wales' players an unflinchingly honest assessment of their performance at half-time. Whatever it is they said, it had the desired effect as Wales emerged for the second half a team transformed. Williams got the ball rolling six minutes after the restart, scampering to the line after Josh Adams had drifted infield from the left wing to make an incisive break. Less than five minutes later, Wales had cut the French lead to just two points. With a penalty advantage, Hadleigh Parkes tried his luck with a speculative grubber kick which looked like a simple one to gather but Huget inexplicably dithered and dropped the ball, which North then smartly picked up and dived over in one swift movement. Around the hour mark, Wales made a raft of changes and it was one of those introduced at that point, Dan Biggar, who gave them the lead for the first time, his nerveless penalty sailing over from 40 yards. France were not done, though. After pulverising a Welsh scrum, Les Bleus were awarded a penalty in front of the posts which Camille Lopez sent over to regain the lead and set up a tense final 10 minutes. The hosts had wrestled momentum back but, just as it looked like they were about to strengthen their grip on the game, they pressed the self-destruct button again as Vahaamahina's brainless long pass was intercepted by North. This video can not be played 'Brilliant' North crosses for second try as Wales gain five-point lead France had been in a rut having won just one of their previous seven matches, and their miserable autumn campaign was rounded off with a home defeat against Fiji. Head coach Jacques Brunel sought to arrest that slump with some bold selections, replacing the experienced and exceptionally bulky centre Mathieu Bastareaud with 19-year-old debutant Romain Ntamack, son of former France wing Emile Ntamack. If Bastareaud's surprising omission from the matchday squad meant a little less weight among the backs, there was no shortage of ballast in a pack of forwards weighing close to 20 stone each. The intention was clear: France were looking to outmuscle Wales. They did that initially, and then some. Les Bleus were quicker and smarter than their lacklustre opponents and, as well as the brawn of the pack, they had the brains of their backs - with Parra marshalling the side from scrum-half. While much of the pre-match attention was focused on new faces such as Ntamack and debutant lock Paul Willemse, it was France's more established players who inspired their first-half domination. Picamoles was prominent in defence and attack and took his try well, as did Huget as he sped to the corner. But then in keeping with their deeply-ingrained tradition of being as erratic as they are talented, France imploded. Huget's fumble was dreadful but, if he was scrambling for excuses, he might have pointed to the difficult conditions that came with the rain. That would have been charitable to allow that as a reason - but there was no excusing Vahaamahina's rush of blood to the head. Even by France's recent standards, it was an act of astounding self-destruction but, for North and Wales, it was an opportunity they grasped with relish.

"Facebook works with more than 30 fact-checking agencies Two leading fact-checking agencies have stopped their work with Facebook, striking a blow to the network's efforts to fight fake news. The social network had paid the Associated Press and Snopes to combat its misinformation crisis. But both firms confirmed they are no longer checking articles. The AP told the BBC it was in ""ongoing conversations"" about work in future. Facebook said it was committed to fighting fake news. The company said it would expand its efforts in 2019. ""Fighting misinformation takes a multi-pronged approach from across the industry,"" a Facebook spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We are committed to fighting this through many tactics, and the work that third-party fact-checkers do is a valued and important piece of this effort. ""We have strong relationships with 34 fact-checking partners around the world who fact-check content in 16 languages, and we plan to expand the programme this year by adding new partners and languages."" A spokeswoman for the AP told the BBC: ""AP constantly evaluates how to best deploy its fact-checking resources, and that includes ongoing conversations with Facebook about opportunities to do important fact-checking work on its platform."" Snopes said it needed to ""determine with certainty that our efforts to aid any particular platform are a net positive for our online community, publication and staffâ. The site's founder David Mikkelson, and head of operations Vinny Green,said in a blog post that the firm did not rule out working with Facebook in future,external. ""We hope to keep an open dialogue going with Facebook to discuss approaches to combating misinformation that are beneficial to platforms, fact-checking organisations and the user community alike,"" the company said. The blog post acknowledged that choosing not to renew its work with Facebook would have financial repercussions for the company. In 2017, Facebook paid Snopes $100,000 (Â£76,500) for its work. Snopes has not yet released its financial disclosures for 2018. ""Forgoing an economic opportunity is not a decision that we or any other journalistic enterprise can take lightly in the current publishing landscape,"" the company said. Late last year, theGuardian published a report,externalthat suggested fact-checking firms were frustrated by Facebookâs lack of transparency. The article quoted former Snopes managing editor Brooke Binkowski as saying: âTheyâve essentially used us for crisis PR. Theyâre not taking anything seriously. They are more interested in making themselves look good and passing the buckâ¦ They clearly donât care.â In a blog post, Facebook disputed the Guardian's report,external, saying it had ""several inaccuracies"". Speaking about the news Snopes and the AP had pulled out, Ms Binkowski said she felt Facebook was too controlling over the fact-checking companies. ""Facebook can't handle any kind of pushback, any kind of public criticism,"" she told the BBC, adding that she felt the fact-checking programme at Facebook had been ""mishandled"". Facebook has worked with two other fact-checking agencies in the US. One, Politifact, told the BBC it intended to continue working with Facebook in 2019. The other, Factcheck.org, did not respond to requests for comment at the time of publication.

"This video can not be played CCTV shows Neal pushing over her neighbour's plant pots A 79-year-old woman has been sentenced to 28 days in prison for what officials have described as a ""campaign of intimidation"" against her neighbours. Kathleen Neal, of Castle Donington, Leicestershire, sprayed weed killer and poured urine on to plants belonging to her neighbour Susan Brookes. CCTV shows Neal pushing over her neighbour's plant pots, having removed a fence panel. She was sentenced in her absence at Nottingham County Court on Monday. Neal was also ordered to pay legal costs of Â£4,323 after seven breaches of an injunction placed on her in 2016. Leicestershire Police said a warrant had been issued and Neal was arrested earlier. The court said she was due to appear on Friday. Susan Brookes says she wonders if the harassment was triggered by Neal finding out she grew up in a council house Mrs Brookes, 67, said her neighbour had ""relentlessly"" targeted her and husband Keith, 70, since the year after they moved into the property in 2002. ""She certainly has been a neighbour from hell,"" she said. ""For somebody who's 79, she's pretty sprightly. ""She comes over as this poor little old lady but you should see her climbing over the 5ft fence to get into our garden."" The court heard Neal's catalogue of anti-social behaviour included trespassing on the Brookes property and conducting a campaign of silent phone calls made from a pay-as-you-go mobile phone. She also deliberately lit smoky bonfires in her garden and caused criminal damage. ""It's been terrible,"" Mrs Brookes told the BBC. ""Your whole life becomes about 'what's she going to do next?'. ""We haven't wanted to go away on holiday. Once when we were away she chopped down a tree and threw it into our garden. ""We've had to get CCTV and I have folders and folders of evidence about what she's done. I think the law needs to speed up a little bit in cases like this."" Mrs Brookes said she did not know what had sparked the harassment campaign but thought it might have been prompted by Neal finding out she used to live in a council house. ""This is the posh side of town,"" she said. ""She used to say things to me like, 'We don't want your sort around here'."" Neal was caught spraying weed killer into her neighbour's garden Mrs Brookes said the prison sentence had come as ""a relief"". ""No-one wants to see an elderly lady go to prison but Mrs Neal has shown no remorse for her actions,"" she said. ""My husband and I therefore now hope that the shock and shame of serving a short sentence in prison will finally change her ways."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Insp Richard Jackson, from North West Leicestershire neighbourhood policing area, said: ""No-one should live in fear of their neighbour and unfortunately Neal has repeatedly refused to put a stop to her campaign. ""It is our hope that this sentence will finally put a stop to the behaviour which has blighted one family's lives for some considerable time.""

"Lauren Laverne and Sam Baker founded The Pool in 2015 The editor of online women's magazine The Pool has said she is ""absolutely gutted"" the venture is to fold after almost four years. Cate Sevilla said she was ""heartbroken"" more than 20 members of staff faced redundancy from the firm, which was co-founded by broadcaster Lauren Laverne. Staff were not paid in January and some freelancers are owed sizeable payments. The collapse of the firm raises questions about whether women-focused journalism can thrive online. One industry expert said The Pool was caught in a ""deadly vortex"" of declining advertising revenues. 'Thrown to the wolves' - the women who drive for Uber and Lyft Could women solve the global pilot shortage? What I learned when I stopped shaving The site, styled as a ""platform for women too busy to browse"", went live in 2015 and signed up a collection of prominent female writers and contributors. The Pool's editor Cate Sevilla said in a series of Twitter posts: ""I don't really know what to say. I'm absolutely gutted. ""This has been an extremely frustrating situation, and I'm heartbroken for my team. For our freelancers. For our readers. ""I always wanted to work at The Pool, and I can't quite believe what's happened."" A GoFundMe page to help pay The Pool's staff and freelancers had raised more than Â£8,000 of a Â£24,000 target by Friday evening. Eleanor Mills, chairwoman of Women in Journalism, which supports female workers in the industry, said online news websites were suffering because Google and Facebook were so dominant and took such a large share of all digital revenue, which she estimated at 95%. Ms Mills, who is also the editorial director of the Sunday Times, said women's magazines faced pressure from beauty and fashion brands choosing increasingly to advertise with so-called ""influencers"" ""The Pool found itself in a deadly vortex fed by both of these trends - the unviability of online advertising supported publishing and a shake up and turndown in fashion and beauty advertising,"" she said. Lauren Laverne, who resigned as a director of The Pool last year, said on Twitter: ""I haven't had an official role at @thepooluk for a while, but I am extremely sad to hear about its closure. ""However I am also very proud of what we achieved. It was an honour to work alongside such an inspiring and creative team, on something people loved."" Allow Twitter content?

""But as the media industry moves with them, it is struggling to find a business model that can sustain its journalism. The publication is calling on Google and Facebook to take less money from online advertising.

A tailings dam at the mine failed at around 13:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on 25 January. The resulting torrent of toxic sludge buried residential buildings, the mining plant's cafeteria where hundreds of workers were believed to be eating, the administrative buildings and the loading terminal for trains. Correspondents say the alarm system the company had installed to warn residents of any risk did not go off. Those who live nearby reported hearing a loud noise at the time of the collapse. By David Shukman, BBC science editor in Brumadinho At the edge of the disaster zone, where the dangerous red sludge reached its height, we spotted a man kneeling in the dirt, praying over a Bible placed on the ground in front of him. Local businessman Leandro Gil was mourning a family now missing in the mud. No sooner had we started to talk than his eyes filled with tears and he turned to my translator with a request - could he have a hug from the reporter who had made the long trek from England to report on this disaster? Stunned by the tragedy, Leandro was full of questions many are asking here, some more angrily than others. How could our world have become so lacking in compassion? How could values have eroded so far that someone - working on the dam - just thought about himself? Whoever that was, Leandro said, he didn't protect the dam properly. This is a region of pretty hills and iron-rich geology, where thousands depend on the mines. But many are grieving and wondering if the mining companies and the authorities are watching the next vulnerable dam and doing enough to avoid another catastrophe. Dozens of trapped people, many of them covered in mud, had to be evacuated by helicopter as roads were destroyed. Vale says the cause of the collapse is being investigated and that instruments used to measure dam pressure had not detected any problems. The company's president, Fabio Schvartsman, said the accident may have occurred too quickly for any alarm to be activated. A state official told Reuters that all evidence suggested the dam burst was caused by liquefaction - a process by which a solid material such as sand loses strength and stiffness and turns to liquid. The BBC's Julia Carneiro says liquefaction was the cause of a separate dam collapse three years ago in Mariana, owned by a Vale subsidiary. Both structures are upstream dams, mostly built with dried mining waste or tailings, a mixture of sand and clay-like mud. As hopes of finding anyone alive dwindle, thoughts are now turning to how to deal with the 12 million cubic metres of mud that was released. The UN's Special Rapporteur on Toxics, Baskut Tuncak, has called for an inquiry into the toxicity of the waste and urged the Brazilian government to take immediate precautionary measures.

"Swift spent six years playing Richard to Patricia Routledge's Hyacinth Actor Clive Swift, known to millions as Hyacinth Bucket's hen-pecked husband Richard in BBC One's 90s sitcom Keeping Up Appearances, has died aged 82. Swift, who spent 10 years at the RSC before breaking into television, also acted in such series as Peak Practice, Born and Bred and The Old Guys. He spent six years playing Richard opposite Dame Patricia Routledge. The role saw him patiently tolerate her ham-fisted and invariably thwarted attempts at social climbing. Dame Patricia said she was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of her former co-star's death. ""Clive was a skilful and inventive actor with wide experience, as his successful career proved,"" she said. ""I so much admire what he brought to the barely sketched role of Hyacinth's husband and treasure the memories of our happy collaboration."" Off-screen he co-founded The Actors Centre, a meeting place for members of his profession in central London. He went on to appear with Roger Lloyd Pack in The Old Guys Born in Liverpool in 1936, he had three children with his ex-wife, the novelist Margaret Drabble. Swift's many roles included a part in Alfred Hitchcock's 1972 film Frenzy and as King Arthur's adopted father in 1981 film Excalibur. Many years later, he would play Hitchcock in a BBC radio play called Strangers on a Film. Swift made a number of appearances in Doctor Who, most recently in the 2007 episode Voyage of the Damned. According to his agent, the actor died at his home on Friday after a short illness, surrounded by his family. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"George Mason and two other men took part in ""various sexual acts"" in the ""presence of the travelling public"" A porn actor who filmed himself and his ex-partner having a threesome in front of passengers on the London Underground has been fined Â£1,000. George Mason, 35, and Nicholas Mullan, 24, had sex with an unknown third man between Leicester Square and Waterloo stations, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. A video was posted on Twitter with the caption ""100% genuine footage"". Mason, of Southwark, admitted outraging public decency. Mullan, of Belfast, was not fined but told to pay Â£170 costs and carry out a 12-month community order. The incident happened in July 2017, but it was not reported until February last year, when it was posted on Twitter. Magistrates were told the pair had been returning to Mason's flat following a day out in London Prosecutor Robert Simpson said ""the two men in the dock engaged in various sexual acts"" on the Tube ""in the presence of the travelling public"". Mr Simpson said: ""The incident is recorded by them and the video of what happened was subsequently uploaded on to Twitter, where another gay man saw it, thought that had crossed the line of what was acceptable behaviour and the incident was reported to the police."" Tube commuters fainting at 'alarming levels' Tube injuries up since Night Tube launch An investigation discovered the footage was posted to an account linked to Mason. Mullan was traced after another clip linked to an escort website in Northern Ireland, where he shared his mobile number under the name Toby. The third man was never traced. Defending both Mason and Mullan, Howard Cohen said the video was recorded as the pair travelled back to Mason's flat after a day out.

Chairing the bench, Lucinda Lubbock described the offence as ""unpleasant and serious"".

"Empire actor Jussie Smollett says he's doing ""ok"" after being attacked in Chicago. It's the first time the 36-year-old has spoken about what happened. Police are searching for two people who punched him, poured an ""unknown chemical substance"" over him and put a rope around his neck. In a statement, he has thanked fans for their support and says that love ""can't be kicked out of me"". ""Let me start by saying that I'm ok,"" he says. ""My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words."" Jussie has told police his attackers also made reference to ""Maga"" (Make America Great Again). The slogan was used by Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential campaign. Police are investigating whether the actor was the victim of a hate crime. Chicago police have released this image of two ""people of interest"" in the case While Jussie's had a huge amount of support, others have questioned his version of what happened. The actress Ellen Page spoke about the case on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert - criticising some of the media for questioning whether it should be treated as a hate crime. ""It's absurd. This isn't a debate,"" she says. You need to go to around 6m55 in this video. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

"Swift spent six years playing Richard to Patricia Routledge's Hyacinth Actor Clive Swift, known to millions as Hyacinth Bucket's hen-pecked husband Richard in BBC One's 90s sitcom Keeping Up Appearances, has died aged 82. Swift, who spent 10 years at the RSC before breaking into television, also acted in such series as Peak Practice, Born and Bred and The Old Guys. He spent six years playing Richard opposite Dame Patricia Routledge. The role saw him patiently tolerate her ham-fisted and invariably thwarted attempts at social climbing. Dame Patricia said she was ""deeply saddened"" to hear of her former co-star's death. ""Clive was a skilful and inventive actor with wide experience, as his successful career proved,"" she said. ""I so much admire what he brought to the barely sketched role of Hyacinth's husband and treasure the memories of our happy collaboration."" Off-screen he co-founded The Actors Centre, a meeting place for members of his profession in central London. He went on to appear with Roger Lloyd Pack in The Old Guys Born in Liverpool in 1936, he had three children with his ex-wife, the novelist Margaret Drabble. Swift's many roles included a part in Alfred Hitchcock's 1972 film Frenzy and as King Arthur's adopted father in 1981 film Excalibur. Many years later, he would play Hitchcock in a BBC radio play called Strangers on a Film. Swift made a number of appearances in Doctor Who, most recently in the 2007 episode Voyage of the Damned. According to his agent, the actor died at his home on Friday after a short illness, surrounded by his family. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played The student says she feels her experience has been for nothing A student threatened with rape by men in an online chat has told the BBC her university's investigation into the messages made her feel like she was ""on trial"". Five male students were banned from the University of Warwick last year, after details of the chat emerged. Several students in the chat encouraged others to rape women on campus. The university said it ""stands by the investigation process"", but it planned to review its disciplinary procedures. A statement from the university, accompanying an open letter by vice-chancellor Professor Stuart Croft, said the university ""will ensure sexual misconduct is considered specifically as part of our review of disciplinary processes"". Jennifer - not her real name - spoke out after the BBC reported on Thursday that two of the students, initially banned for 10 years, had had their punishments reduced after an appeal. They could return to classes this year. Rape chat students have bans reduced My disgust at Uni rape chat decision' Jennifer said this left her ""devastated"" and that all of her ""traumatic experiences"" had been ""for nothing"". ""These people are still going to be back and they're still going to be dangerous ... and Warwick University are allowing that to happen."" The Facebook group chat was first reported last summer by Warwick student newspaperThe Boar.,external Jennifer said: ""There were a lot of threats of gang rape. ""One of them spoke about wanting to gang rape me and then after they discarded my body they wanted to ejaculate all over it. ""They talked about my friend, they wanted to genitally mutilate her."" Other posts included a racially offensive term and anti-Semitic language. Student newspapers obtained the screenshots after complaints were made to the university After Jennifer and another student officially complained to the university, both were interviewed as part of the subsequent investigation. ""We were made to feel the entire time that we had to justify why we were upset,"" she said. ""It was very aggressive questioning. It was as if we were on trial. ""We were given a list of male individuals involved, and we were taken through it one by one and asked our sexual history with each of them - which obviously was really traumatic. Not having anyone really there to represent me. ""I didn't know if I was supposed to be answering these kind of questions and it was really upsetting."" The university's director of press, whose job it is to promote the university and protect its reputation, was appointed as the official investigator. Jennifer said that this was a ""clear conflict of interest"". A spokesman from the University of Warwick admitted there was a ""potential for conflict"". But he said: ""During the length of the investigation media relations were delegated to other members of the press and media relations team."" He added: ""All those who were interviewed as part of the investigation were asked about whether there were prior or existing relationships with those also involved. ""The detail of any relationship was neither questioned or explored."" In a lengthy statement,,externalwith afurther list of questions and answers,externalattached, Professor Croft said the punished students' comments had been ""dehumanising, humiliating, and revolting"" and ""against everything that everyone holds dear in any society"". But he said that, despite calls for the 11 individuals involved to be banned from campus, he did not have the authority to make such a decision. He said that the university had a duty of care to all those involved and that he was not going to immediately propose a way forward ""because I think that there is a lot more listening to do first"". In the accompanying FAQs, the university clarified: ""The male students are not allowed on campus at the present time and, should they return to complete their studies next year, their access to campus facilities and to learning opportunities will be carefully managed in line with conditions laid out in the initial punishment."" On Thursday, Prof Christine Ennew, a member of the executive team at Warwick University, said the university was sorry the decision to allow the students back early had ""upset so many members of our own community and beyond"". She added the penalties were intended to allow the complainants time to finish their studies before the disciplined students were given the opportunity to return.

"The Oddbins off-licence chain has gone into administration, putting hundreds of jobs at risk. Administrator Duff & Phelps (D&P) has been appointed to run the business while they attempt to find a buyer. Oddbins' owner European Food Brokers (EFB) blamed tough High Street conditions and economic uncertainty created by Brexit for the situation. Oddbins has about 45 outlets. Other brands affected include Wine Cellar Trading and Whittalls Wines Merchants. D&P said EFB has about 550 staff and 101 off-licences, but could not confirm exactly how many Oddbins' shops and staff were affected. But the D&P statement said that ""EFB continues to trade and is not an entity that has entered into administration"". Phil Duffy, joint administrator, said Oddbins was a victim of tough times on the High Street, with a decline in consumer spending pointing to a squeeze on household finances. ""Add into that mix rising business rates and rents, and traditional bricks and mortar retailers are undoubtedly feeling the strain."" he said. However, Oddbins faced specific challenges, according to experts. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, the consultancy and insolvency specialist, said Oddbins had been ""slipping down the pecking order for consumers as it struggled to compete with supermarkets offering a selection of discounted and premium wines"". The retailer has also faced stronger competition from rival Majestic, which did well over the Christmas period, she said. Chris Hunt, head of retail at law firm Gowling WLG, also pointed to the challenge from Majestic, which he said appears to have done well from in-store experiences. ""In terms of a direct comparison, the likes of Majestic hold wine tasting and other in-store events to drive footfall over and above their online successes,"" he said. It was a lesson for the entire retail industry, he said, adding: ""Hobbycraft recently reported that in-store demonstrations were its lifeline over the Christmas period, allowing it to report record sales throughout its outlets."" The appointment of administrators to Oddbins came as now surprise, as EFB warned this week that it was on the brink. The company said ""The deterioration of the High Street, combined with the continuing economic uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, has resulted in an unsustainable, tough physical retail market,"" it said. Oddbinswent into administration in 2011after HM Revenue & Customs refused to support a deal with its creditors. EFB, which is run by businessman Raj Chatha, bought up some of the Oddbins stores at the time through its Whittalls subsidiary.

There were also winter storm and blizzards warnings active across the country from the east to the west coast. Environment Canada was urging residents to limit their exposure to cold and keep pets indoors. Canada did not experience a spate of deaths linked to the polar vortex like the US. Stephen Hwang, an associate professor with the University of Toronto's department of medicine, suggested that Canadian cities and public health authorities probably had more experience dealing with the deep cold. Most homeless shelters also already had protocols in place for when the extreme cold hits. But he said it was still ""fortunate"" that cities like Toronto, where homeless shelters have been stretched for resources in recent months, did not see any cold-related deaths among its most vulnerable citizens.

"Mr Banks founded Leave.EU and owns Eldon Insurance Leave.EU and an insurance company owned by its founder Arron Banks have been fined Â£120,000 over data law breaches. It represents a reduction in the Â£135,000 total previouslyannounced by the Information Commissioner's office. The pro-Brexit Leave.EU group's Â£60,000 fine was reduced to Â£45,000 after ""considering the company's representations"", the ICO said. Leave.EU said it was a ""politically motivated attack against our involvement in Brexit"". A spokesman said it was ""disappointed but not surprised"" and would be appealing against the fine in court. Leave.EU and insurance firm face Â£135,000 in fines The fines follow anInformation Commissioner investigation,externalinto the misuse of personal data by political campaigns. The report says more than a million emails sent to Leave.EU subscribers contained marketing for the Eldon Insurance firm's GoSkippy services. Eldon Insurance has been fined Â£60,000 for the breach. In addition to the Â£45,000 fine for that breach, Leave.EU was also fined Â£15,000 for ""using Eldon Insurance customers' details unlawfully to send almost 300,000 political marketing messages"". The ICO confirmed on Friday it would be reviewing how both are complying with data protection laws, including looking at how personal data is processed and staff training. The watchdog will also be interviewing the directors, staff and data protection officers at both organisations. Eldon Insurance has also been issued with an enforcement notice, ordering it to take steps to make sure it complies with electronic marketing regulations. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: ""It is deeply concerning that sensitive personal data gathered for political purposes was later used for insurance purposes; and vice versa. It should never have happened. ""We have been told both organisations have made improvements and learned from these events. ""But the ICO will now audit the organisations to determine how they are using customers' personal information."" In November, Mr Banks defended himself on Twitter. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), he said, had found ""we may have accidentally sent a newsletter to customers"" but ""no evidence of a grand data conspiracy"". He added: ""Gosh we communicated with our supporters and offered them a 10% Brexit discount after the vote! So what?""

Speaking to the BBC on Friday, impressionist Rory Bremner remembered his friend as ""a kind and compassionate man"" who ""cared more for people and causes than fame and fortune"". ""He was unique in the way he delivered thoughtful, intelligent comedy,"" he continued, revealing Hardy had been ""ill for a few months"" and that ""very few people"" had known about it. This video can not be played Rory Bremner on Jeremy Hardy: ""He cared so much more for people and causes than for fame and fortune"" Comic and friend Jack Dee told the BBC Hardy ""spoke fluent comedy"", adding: ""He could take any subject and make it funny"". When asked if he could recall a moment that stood out, he said: ""I remember dropping him at the hospital at one of his earlier appointments. ""He told the staff: 'This is my friend Jack, he's on work experience for when he gets cancer'."" Born in Farnborough in Hampshire, in 1961, Hardy studied modern history and politics at the University of Southampton before embarking on his stand-up career. From the outset, he worked his socialist politics into his topical act. He made his television debut in 1986 in Now - Something Else, an early vehicle for Bremner. Hardy was a featured writer and also played the role of Jeremy the Trainee. Hardy also appeared as Corporal Perkins in an episode of the BBC comedy Blackadder Goes Forth in 1989. Seven years later, he presented an episode of Top of the Pops. This video can not be played Jeremy Hardy ""could do satire without being a smart arse"", says Jack Dee Also in 1996, Hardy teamed up with comedian Jack Dee to write Channel 4 sketch show Jack and Jeremy's Real Lives. The pair would later work together again on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Hardy became well-known for his comically bad singing on the long-running radio panel game. He also fronted Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation, a series of comedy lectures for BBC Radio 4, from 1993. Episodes were based around subjects as diverse as how to be a father and how to meet the challenge of the 21st Century. The show's 10th series was broadcast in 2014. Hardy often worked his socialist politics into his act And he appeared on BBC Radio 4 with his first wife, American actress and comedian Kit Hollerbach, in the sitcoms Unnatural Acts and At Home with the Hardys. They adopted a daughter, Elizabeth, in 1990. As a life-long socialist, Hardy's political views were often reflected in his work. Until 2001, Hardy wrote a column for The Guardian newspaper in which he regularly expressed his support for the Socialist Alliance. His final column for the paper,externalcriticised the news media for its ""increasingly humorous tone"". His opinions didn't always prove popular with his audience. In 2000, he was booed by members of the Just A Minute audience when he used the subject ""parasites"" to begin a rant against the royal family. In 2004,Burnley Council cancelled one of Hardy's performances,externalafter saying in an episode of his Speaks to the Nation show that members and supporters of the British National Party (BNP) should be shot. Hardy's second wife was the film-maker Katie Barlow Hardy was one of a number of names from the world of showbusiness to campaign to clear the name ofDanny McNamee,external, who was found guilty of the IRA's 1982 Hyde Park bombing, which killed four members of the Household Cavalry and seven horses. McNamee's conviction was overturned in 1998. Hardy was also a keen advocate for the rights of Palestinians, travelling to the occupied West Bank in 2002 to film the documentary Jeremy Hardy vs the Israeli Army. Hardy is survived by his second wife, film-maker and photographer Katie Barlow, and his daughter.

"A web browser warning that said the Daily Mail's website failed to maintain ""basic standards of accuracy or accountability"" has been changed. The newspaper had complained that the NewsGuard plug-in gave its Mail Online website a negative review. NewsGuard now gives Mail Online a positive green shield after discussions with a Daily Mail executive. But the company said Mail Online still failed to gather and present information responsibly. NewsGuard rates news sources to help people weigh up whether a website is trustworthy, or likely to publish fake news. NewsGuard used to display a warning about Mail Online Its ratings attracted attention in January after Microsoft included the plug-in with its Edge web browser for Android and iOS devices. NewsGuard originally said Mail Online: failed to gather and present information responsibly failed to handle the difference between news and opinion failed to avoid deceptive headlines failed to reveal who is in charge of the website and any conflicts of interest failed to provide the names of writers repeatedly published false content A spokesman for Mail Online said it was an ""egregiously erroneous classification"". NewsGuard has now changed its review and says Mail Online ""generally maintains basic standards of accuracy and accountability"". It said it had originally considered how many complaints were made about Mail Online to the Independent Press Standards Organisation, but had not weighed this up against how many stories the website publishes. However it still warns that Mail Online: fails to gather and present information responsibly fails to handle the difference between news and opinion fails to provide the names of writers NewsGuard refused to change one of the ratings because Mail Online did not disclose ""its conservative orientation"". Despite this, the website now gets a green shield logo overall. The NewsGuard plug-in must be switched on by users of Microsoft's Edge app, but the BBC understands there are plans for it to become the default option in the future. The New York-based service - which is independent of Microsoft - also has ambitions to include its tool in further products from the Windows developer as well as other tech firms. It can also be used as an add-on extension in the desktop version of web browsers including Edge, Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple's Safari.

"The world could put a stop to female genital mutilation (FGM) within a generation, international leaders and campaigners say. (This report contains graphic descriptions of the practices involved). The ambitious pledge to end FGM comes from aUK summit,externaldedicated to the topic, hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron. So what is FGM, and why is it still being carried out on millions of women and girls around the world? Female genital mutilation (FGM) includes any procedure that alters or injures the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. In its most severe form, after removing the sensitive clitoris, the genitals are cut and stitched closed so that the woman cannot have or enjoy sex. A tiny piece of wood or reed is inserted to leave a small opening for the necessary flow of urine, and monthly blood when she comes of age (most FGM is carried out on infants or young girls before they reach puberty). When she is ready to have sex and a baby, she is ""unstitched"" - and then sewn back up again after to keep her what is described by proponents as ""hygienic, chaste and faithful"". In societies where FGM is commonplace, a woman can bring shame on herself and her family if she does not comply. Some see it as a religious necessity - though no scriptures explicitly prescribe it. â¢Clitoridectomy - partial or total removal of the clitoris â¢Excision - removal of the clitoris and inner labia (lips), with or without the outer labia â¢Infibulation - cutting, removing and sewing up the genitalia â¢Any other type of intentional damage to the female genitalia (burning, scraping et cetera) Most often, the procedure is carried out by traditional circumcisers or preachers, using crude, accessible tools, such as thorns and thread, broken glass or razor blades, and without anaesthetic. The pain is part of the centuries-old ritual - to prove that the woman is strong and can endure it. Corrosive substances may also be inserted into the vagina to scar, tighten and narrow it. But about a fifth of all FGM is now performed by healthcare workers in hospital settings - bespoke clinics that use scalpels and antiseptics - and the trend towards medicalisation is increasing, says the World Health Organization. This is partly to counter the argument that FGM isunsafe,external. A big risk with FGM is dangerous bleeding and infection. By doing it in a clinic, these risks can be minimised. Another compelling reason is money. Doctors and midwives in poor countries can boost their salary by selling their services. Efua Dorkenoo, senior FGM advisor at Equality Now, who has been campaigning for decades to put an end to FGM, said: ""In Egypt, around 70% of FGM is done by medical doctors. In Kenya and Nigeria, local midwives are cutting. ""The medical professionals, they think that if it can't be stopped it's best to do it in the medical setting. And some are doing it for money."" And it's not just something that's done outside of the West. There have been numerous reports of the practice documented in the UK, even though it is illegal. While it is hard to get a handle on the true scale, figures suggest at least 4,000 women and girls have been treated for FGM in London's hospitals since 2009. As yet, there have been no convictions for these crimes. And it's something that's been going on quietly for decades, says Ms Dorkenoo. Unicef estimates that more than 130 million girls and women alive in the world today have undergone FGM, mostly for cultural, religious and social reasons, although support for FGM is falling. There are no health benefits, but many risks associated with FGM even when it is done in a hygienic setting. An obvious one is severe pain - both physical and psychological. Victims recall fighting to get free as they were held down and their legs forcibly spread for the cutting. Isa, who was cut when she was six, recalls: ""I can still remember the shouting. I can still remember the blood coming through. I can still remember the pain."" She's since had surgery and, as a trained midwife, helps other women who have undergone FGM. Surgery may reverse some of the damage, but it cannot restore sensitive tissue that has been removed. Nor can it repair emotional scars. Janet Fyle, who is the Royal College of Midwives' lead advisor on FGM, says: ""Some women have flashbacks similar to soldiers who have been in battle. FGM is shrouded in secrecy and some women are too fearful to speak out ""If they were kidnapped on their way to collect water or someone held them down, its a trauma to them psychologically and its very difficult to deal with those scars."" She hopes that FGM will become a thing of the past. ""I have hopes that we will end it in a generation. At least here in the UK. ""The younger girls are more aware of it. We need to educate and empower them."" But she says FGM is deeply embedded in many cultures - and that could take a long time to change. Efua Dorkenoo agrees: ""In the most bizarre way, women have become the perpetrators and practisers of this and keep the tradition going. If you speak to women, they may say they want it because it's linked to them being accepted by society. It's at the core of controlling a woman's sexuality. ""Because it's to do with sexuality, it's still very taboo to talk about."" Mother-of-three Asseta was cut when she was seven years old. In Burkina Faso, where Asseta lives, more than 75% of girls and women have been cut. Asseta says: ""I was told there were some eggs to eat - so me and my friends rushed over. But when we got there, there was blood all over the floor from other girls. It was very difficult - being cut is an event I will never forget. ""Deciding not to get my daughters cut was a tough decision to make. ""Going against tradition can be difficult. First you need to convince yourself that the decision you're making is the best one - you need to know the facts in order to do that. ""I hope my daughter will have a better life, better health because of my decision. And I hope she will do the same for her daughters and avoid cutting."" Asseta's daughter, 13-year-old Fatmata, says: ""I had heard about FGM and I've seen it happen - a friend of mine was cut when she was 12 years old. Seeing it happen made me feel scared. I don't want to be cut, and I'm happy knowing my parents aren't going to make me do it."" In many places where FGM is done, there is no law against it, or if there is, it's not implemented. And politicians have been afraid to push too far, says Efua Dorkenoo, who has herself received death threats for speaking out against FGM. There was a UN resolution in 2012 to ban FGM worldwide. ""Now is the time for the international community to make this happen,"" says Ms Dorkenoo. Men in court over UK FGM charges The Maasai who insist on cutting their girls.

Hibo, now 46, was subjected to what is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as ""type three"" mutilation when she was six. This means all of her labia were cut off and she was then stitched together, leaving a tiny hole she compares to the size of a matchstick. Her clitoris was also removed. She grew up in Somalia, where 98% of women and girls between 15 and 49 have had their genitals forcibly mutilated. ""An open wound rubbed with salt or hot chilli - it felt like that,"" she recalls. ""And then you realise your wee isn't coming out the way it used to come. It's coming out as droplets, and every drop was worse than the one before. This takes four or five minutes -  and in that four or five minutes you're experiencing horrific pain."" Hibo came to the UK when she was 18, and within months visited a doctor to see if they could relieve the pain she experienced when she passed urine and during her periods. Her translator didn't want to interpret her request, but the GP managed to understand. Eventually Hibo underwent a  procedure called defibulation, when the labia is opened surgically. This widened the hole and exposed her urethra. It is by no means an outright fix, and can never restore sensitive tissue that was removed, but it did make it slightly easier to urinate. Hibo Wardere was speaking to Jane Garvey on BBC Radio 4'sWoman's Hour-catch up on BBC iPlayer Radio Sex, however, presented a new hurdle. ""Even if the doctor has opened you up, what they've left you with is a very tiny space,"" says Hibo. ""Things that were supposed to be expanding have gone. So the hole that you have is very small and sex is very difficult. You do get pleasures - but it's once in a blue moon."" The trauma of the assault also had a bearing on intimate situations with her partner. ""First you have a psychological block because the only thing you associate with that part of you is pain,"" says Hibo. ""The other part is the trauma you experienced. So anything that's happening down there, you never see it as a good thing."" Figures released by Unicef in February raised the number of estimated FGM survivors by around 70 million to 200 million worldwide, with Indonesia, Egypt and Ethiopia accounting for half of all victims. In the UK, FGM has been banned since 2003. Last year the government introduced a new law requiring professionals to report known cases of FGM in under-18s to the police. Activists and the police have raised awareness about the risk of British school girls being flown out of the UK specifically to be stripped of their genitals during what is known as the ""cutting season"" over the summer. However, little is known about how the millions of survivors - including at least 137,000 in the UK - cope. The repercussions of a procedure that either involves removing the clitoris (type one), removing the clitoris and the inner smaller labia (type two), removing the labia and a forced narrowing of the vaginal opening - usually, as in Hibo's case, removing the clitoris too (type three), or any kind of harmful mutilation in the genitals (sometimes referred to as type four), are wide-ranging. The symptoms are not normally discussed in the open, partly because FGM is so normalised among some communities that women don't think of it as a problem, or even connect their myriad health problems with their experience of FGM as a child, says Janet Fyle, professional policy advisor at the Royal College of Midwives (RCM). Last year, Fyle was awarded an MBE for her work in tackling FGM. The day-to-day reality for survivors can be bleak. TheNHS lists,externalurinary tract infections, uterine infections, kidney infections, cysts, reproductive issues and pain during sex as just some of the consequences. A ""reversal"" surgery, as defibulation is sometimes termed, can help to relieve some of the symptoms by opening up the lower vagina. ""But it's not as simple as carrying out the physical care, which we can carry out as clinicians,"" says Fyle, who comes from Sierra Leone, where FGM is widespread. ""It's about the long-term (psychological) consequences - some people describe it as worse than PTS (post-traumatic stress), which soldiers in the battlefield have."" Tools used for FGM procedures in Kenya When Hibo became pregnant for the first time in 1991, aged 22, she says she was tortured by the idea of medical staff looking at her genitals, which had been physically altered. ""I remember taking the pillow and just putting it on my face because I didn't want the humiliation, the pain,"" she says. ""Knowing all those eyes were going to look at me, was too much."" During the birth, she experienced flashbacks of being cut - which is a common experience of survivors. At the time, she was the first FGM survivor that staff at the hospital in Surrey had seen. Neither she, nor they, had any idea how to try to make the birth easier. ""Before they could even think of what was going to happen and how they're going to deliver this boy, my son came, They had to cut me. My son actually ripped parts of me as well because he was coming with such a force,"" Hibo recalls. ""They were still very shocked and didn't know what to do with me. It was horrific, and I ended up having a long time to recuperate."" ""What I saw took the breath from my body. The woman was right. There was only one word for it - devastating. For the first time, I could see what I had been left with. It was just a hole. Everything else had been chopped off and sealed up. Despite the doctor opening my skin up to expose my urethra so I could wee, there were no fleshy labia like other women had. No protection, no beauty, the area between my legs looked like dark brown sand that someone had dragged a faint line through, then as if someone had poked a stick into the sand, there at the bottom of the line was a hole. My vagina. I could see it was a little bigger than it had originally been stitched thanks to the doctor who opened me slightly. But there it was. The only clue that I was a woman. The rest of my genitals had been sliced off and discarded."" Despite the experience, Hibo went on to have six more children, and the subsequent births were much less traumatic. Her second child was delivered via Caesarean section, and she praises the NHS for the increased awareness and support for FGM victims. In the UK, a defibulation procedure is now offered as a matter of course before birth, along with psychological support and contact with survivor groups. Midwives say this is vital to those women who may have suppressed memories of the attack and find it difficult to even recognise what was done to them. Hibo credits her husband Yusuf, who she met just a few months after having her medical procedure in the UK, for his unwavering support in her decision to have surgery and speak out about a practice that is so common in the community she is from. A protest against FGM in Somalia Despite her worst fears, she has found more happiness and intimacy than she ever thought possible. But the couple and their family have not managed to escape the expectations of the culture they are from. Hibo's decision to make a stand against FGM meant confronting her mother's beliefs and put a huge strain on their relationship. In her early years, they had ""such a close bond"". And yet it was her mother who took Hibo to have her genitals cut off and sewn up, reinforcing a widespread cultural belief that such a practice is essential for girls' reputations and future marriage prospects. ""My mum did love me, and she did this out of love,"" says Hibo now. ""She thought this was protection for me. She thought she was protecting the family honour. She herself was a victim - [and] her mother, her grandmother. Generations have undergone FGM - they didn't see anything wrong with it. ""They thought if you weren't cut, you're going to be talked about, you're going to be stigmatised, no-one is going to marry you. You're going to be seen as someone who sleeps around with other men. For them, it was protection for the family and protection for you."" Hibo and her mother managed to resolve any tension before she passed away. But her in-laws have been ""up in arms"" about the couple's decision not to cut their three girls. ""They believe that I have done something wrong for the kids, they believe that my girls - who's going to marry them?"" says Hibo. ""And here I was thinking; 'Do I care about the marriage part, or do I care about their health? Do I want them to suffer what I've suffered? Do I want them to go through what I go through?' No way."" Girls in parts of Tanzania are often forced to undergo female genital mutilation, even though the practice is illegal. Faced with FGM, many had nowhere to turn - until now. A safe house has opened in the north of the country to offer protection when they need it most.

"Police said they found evidence of ""witchcraft"" in the woman's home, including limes stuffed with written curses A woman who mutilated her three-year-old daughter has become the first person in the UK to be found guilty of female genital mutilation (FGM). The 37-year-old mother from east London wept in the dock as she was convicted after a trial at the Old Bailey. Spells and curses intended to deter police and social workers from investigating were found at the Ugandan woman's home, the trial heard. Her 43-year-old partner was acquitted by the jury. Prosecutors said the mother ""coached"" her daughter ""to lie to the police so she wouldn't get caught"". The defendants, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, denied FGM and an alternative charge of failing to protect a girl from risk of genital mutilation. Mrs Justice Whipple warned of a ""lengthy"" jail term as she remanded the woman into custody to be sentenced on 8 March. More than 5,000 newly-recorded FGM cases in England Anatomy of female genital mutilation 'This is what it's like to pee after female genital mutilation' FGM - intentionally altering or injuring the female external genitalia for non-medical reasons - carries a sentence of up to 14 years in jail. During the trial, the woman claimed her daughter, then aged three, ""fell on metal and it's ripped her private parts"" after she had climbed to get a biscuit in August 2017. Medics alerted police to the girl's injuries after they treated her at Whipps Cross Hospital, in Leytonstone. She ""lost a significant amount of blood as a result of the injuries they had delivered and inflicted on her"", jurors were told. While the parents were on bail, police searched the mother's home and said they found evidence of ""witchcraft"". Prosecutor Caroline Carberry QC said two cow tongues were ""bound in wire with nails and a small blunt knife"" embedded in them. Forty limes and other fruit were found with pieces of paper with names written on them stuffed inside, including those of police officers and a social worker involved in the investigation. ""These people were to 'shut up' and 'freeze their mouths',"" Ms Carberry said. ""There was a jar with a picture of a social worker in pepper found hidden behind the toilet in the bathroom,"" she added.

The previous cases led to acquittals. FGM campaigner Aneeta Prem, from Freedom Charity, said convictions were hard to secure because cuttings were ""hidden in secrecy"". ""People are scared to come forward, professionals are scared to come forward to report this,"" she told the BBC. ""The fact that we have a conviction today is a really historic moment."" FGM survivor describes witnessing her sister being cut UK pledges Â£50m to help end FGM in Africa Home Secretary Sajid Javid said FGM was a ""medieval practice"". ""We will not tolerate FGM and not rest until perpetrators of this horrific crime are brought to justice,"" he added. Police also found two cow tongues with nails in them Lynette Woodrow, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said the ""sickening"" offence had been committed against a victim with ""no power to resist or fight back"". ""We can only imagine how much pain this vulnerable young girl suffered and how terrified she was,"" she said. ""Her mother then coached her to lie to the police so she wouldn't get caught, but this ultimately failed."" Ms Woodrow said FGM victims were often affected physically and emotionally for ""their entire life"". Includes ""the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" Practised in 30 countries in Africa and some countries in Asia and the Middle East An estimated three million girls and women worldwide are at risk each year About 125 million victims estimated to be living with the consequences It is commonly carried out on young girls, often between infancy and the age of 15 Often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, to prepare a girl or woman for adulthood and marriage and to ensure ""pure femininity"" Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility and increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths Source:World Health Organization,external The mother was born in Uganda but has lived in the UK for a number of years. FGM is banned in both countries, the CPS said. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the conviction sent ""a clear message to those who practise this barbaric act"".

" Asia Bibi's former home in the village of Ittanwala, Punjab, Pakistan Warning: This article describes events that some readers may find upsetting. Asia Bibi left the home she shared with her husband and children and headed for the fields. The village of Ittanwala, some 40 miles south-east of Lahore, is surrounded by green fields and fruit orchards. It is one of the most fertile in the Punjab. Asia Bibi Like many of the women in the village, Asia worked as a farm labourer. It was June and the women were to spend the day picking berries. After working for hours under the scorching sun, the thirsty, exhausted women stopped for a break. Asia was asked to fetch some water from the nearby well. She set off, jug in hand. But on her way back she took a sip of the water before handing it over to her Muslim co-workers. They were furious. Asia is a Christian. In Pakistan, many conservative Muslims don’t like to eat or drink with people of other faiths. They believe that non-Muslims are impure. Asia’s co-workers  told her that she was “dirty” and not worthy of drinking from the same cup   as them. An argument erupted and fierce words were exchanged on both sides. The water pump from which Asia collected water Five days later, the police barged their way into Asia’s house and accused her of insulting the Prophet Muhammad. Outside was a mob, including the village cleric who had accused her of blasphemy. Asia was dragged outside. The mob brazenly began to beat her, right in front of the police. She was arrested and charged with blasphemy. During the trial Asia maintained her innocence, but in 2010 she was sentenced to death. She has spent the past nine years of her life in solitary confinement. In Pakistan, the punishment for blasphemy against Islam and its prophet is either life imprisonment, or death. But all too often the allegation is misused as a way to settle personal scores. Once someone has been accused of blasphemy, before their case has even gone to trial, they and their families come under attack. I met Ashiq, Asia’s husband, at a secret location almost a year ago. Ashiq and his children had been on the run ever since Asia’s arrest. “If a loved one is dead, the heart heals after some time. But when a mother is alive, and she gets separated from her children, the way Asia was taken away from us, the agony is endless,” Ashiq explained. Ashiq Mesih (R) and Eisham Ashiq (L), the husband and daughter of Asia Bibi Sitting on the covered veranda, Ashiq’s face was sombre as he tried to keep himself composed. “We are living in constant fear, there is always a feeling of anxiety and insecurity, that anything could happen to us. I just let the children go to school - they are not allowed to play outside, we have lost our freedom.” Despite the years of insecurity and uncertainty, Ashiq had never given up on Asia. “I have lost my freedom, my livelihood and my home, but I am not ready to give up hope. I will keep struggling for Asia’s release.” Then late last year, on 31 October, nine years after Asia’s arrest, Ashiq’s prayers were finally answered. Against the expectations of thousands of conservative Muslims, the country’s Supreme Court overturned the earlier verdict because of a lack of evidence and allowed Asia Bibi to walk free. Within hours, outraged by the landmark ruling, demonstrators took to the streets demanding one thing - that Asia Bibi be put to death. For three consecutive days protesters attempted to force their nation and government into submission. Main roads were blocked, cars and buses were set alight, toll booths ransacked and police officers attacked. Particularly in the eastern province of Punjab, many offices, businesses, and even schools were forced to close as commuting became impossible. The country watched in horror while their government seemed barely visible. Supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) block a street during a protest At first the Prime Minister Imran Khan, in a television address to the nation, issued a warning to the protesters, telling them not to “clash with the state”. But after three days of escalating chaos, the government said that in order to avoid any bloodshed they would strike a deal with those leading the revolt. Supporters of the TLP Immediately after Asia’s release, Khadim Hussain Rizvi and his religious political party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) had taken to social media advocating civil disorder and violence. They called for the judges who acquitted Asia to be killed, and encouraged mutiny within the army, declaring that the chief of the army was an apostate - that he had renounced Islam. Supporters of TLP They rallied public support from well beyond their own party, with video clips on social media prompting thousands of men from all sections of society to take to the streets. Rizvi's tweet on the day of the Supreme Court's decision Rizvi also accused the West of encouraging blasphemy against Islam and the Prophet Muhammad. In one of his tweets he said that people deliberately committed blasphemy so they could get money and be granted asylum by Western countries. Leader of Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) party, Khadim Hussain Rizvi Only a few years before, Rizvi had been working as cleric at a small local mosque. He was a government employee and a marginal figure, but even then he was renowned for his controversial sermons. While preaching, Rizvi would frequently glorify the murder of Salman Taseer. Taseer was one of two prominent politicians who were murdered for openly sympathising with Asia and publicly advocating the blasphemy laws be revised. A police official takes the thumb print of Asia Bibi (C) during a visit from Governor Salman Taseer (R) at the central jail in Sheikhupura As the governor of Punjab, Taseer had visited Asia Bibi at Sheikhupura prison in 2010. In a televised press conference, with Asia sitting veiled beside him, Taseer had appealed to the president of Pakistan to pardon her. Only a few weeks later, on a cold January day, Taseer was assassinated in broad daylight by his own security guard. In the middle of Islamabad’s busy Kohsaar market, Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri, a young police commando, shot the governor 27 times at point-blank range. After appearing in court Pakistani bodyguard Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri (L) shouts 'We are ready to sacrifice our life for the prestige of the Prophet Muhammad' Overnight Qadri became a hero to millions. Handing himself over to the authorities, Qadri told the police he didn’t have any regrets over killing Taseer - it was his religious duty. “The punishment of a blasphemer is death,” he told the police officials. At his trial, which was held only few days later, rushed through because of security concerns, Qadri was cheered on by hundreds of fans and showered with rose petals. He was sentenced to death, and executed in 2016. Supporters gather around an ambulance carrying the body of Mumtaz Qadri to his funeral Rizvi was eventually sacked from his job as a cleric over sermons which praised Qadri as a martyr. He turned to politics and founded the TLP. Within months of establishing the party, Rizvi’s activists blocked a main highway, paralysing the capital city Islamabad for 20 days. Rizvi accused the government of blasphemy after a reference to the finality of the Prophet Muhammad was left out of a revised version of the electoral oath. Then in last year’s election, declaring themselves defenders of Muhammad’s honour, this tiny populist party attracted more than two million votes. Throughout the campaign, their posters and banners bore photographs of Qadri, idolised as a martyr to the cause. Khadim Hussain Rizvi (C) In October, after three days of demonstrations across Pakistan spearheaded by the TLP, the government caved in.  They agreed not to oppose a court petition to reverse Asia’s release, and barred her from leaving the country. The petition was filed, the mob dispersed, and Asia was freed from prison, but was taken into protective custody. It was to take three months for Asia to finally get her freedom. There was disorder over a blasphemy row in the eastern city of Lahore in 2013 For the past 30 years blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad has been punishable by death in Pakistan. But no-one has been executed. There have been 1,549 known cases of the most serious charges - either blasphemy against Muhammad or desecration of the Koran - according to Pakistan’s Centre for Social Justice. In those cases, 75 accused people have been murdered before their trials. Many were killed in police custody, or by mobs.

One such incident took place almost 30 miles south of the city of Lahore, in the small town of Kot Radha Kishan, named after two Hindu gods. All around are lush flat green fields. But every half a mile or so in every direction, are the tall smoking chimneys of brick kilns. By each one, hundreds of bricks are stacked up in rows. It was in one of these kilns that Shahzad and Shama Maseeh, a Christian couple accused of blasphemy, were burned alive by a mob in 2014. Local journalist Rana Khalid recalls the events that led up to the killings. The room where Shahzad and Shama took shelter He points towards a small structure close to the brick kiln. “The couple were locked up in this room so they could be protected from the mob,” he says. Led by a local cleric, the mob were so angry that several members climbed on top of the roof. They broke their way in through the ceiling and dragged the couple out. “They were brutally beaten by clubs and bricks and dragged by the angry men of the village to the brick kiln and were thrown inside.” Shama was four months pregnant. The mob believed that 24-hours earlier, Shahzad and Shama had burned several pages of the Koran, along with some rubbish. Shahzad’s family still deny this, saying that the couple were burning some of his father’s old documents. For the murder of  Shama and Shahzad, five people, including the local cleric, were sentenced to death while eight others were given two years in prison for inciting violence.

It’s not only Christians who bear the brunt of the country’s controversial law.  It has also been used to persecute Pakistan’s Ahmadi Muslims. The community is regarded by the government as a non-Muslim religious minority. By law, Ahmadis cannot call their places of worship mosques or recite from the Koran or display their faith in public in any way. Aslam Jameel (not his real name), an Ahmadi farmer, was working in his wheat fields in the south of Punjab in 2009, when he was approached by a couple of local villagers. They told him he needed to run. Aslam had been accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad by a local imam and a mob was after him. “The cleric alleged that, God forbid, I prompted four Ahmadi boys to write the prophet’s name in a toilet,” says Aslam, his voice choked with tears. Aslam Jameel Aslam waited until after dark before sneaking out of his back door and making a run for it.  He didn't get far before realising that running away would probably land him in even more trouble. Where would he even go? The next morning, he handed himself in at a local police station. It took almost two years for his case to go to trial, and he spent six months in prison. “The judge was under immense pressure,” says Aslam, his face flushed. “The courtroom was full of clerics, but he [the judge] showed great courage.” Aslam’s case was dismissed because of a lack of evidence. But after returning home to find his house looted and his livestock stolen, he knew he had to leave the country. He sought asylum in Canada. “My family was threatened and harassed, my life and livelihood ruined, we had to abandon the village to save our lives.” For those put on trial and found guilty of blasphemy, the stigma follows them even from the courtroom, to behind bars. Shakeel Wajid (not his real name), another Ahmadi, says that mobs gather during trials. “The judges of the lower courts are under more pressure [than the higher courts] from religious extremists, who gather in large numbers during the hearings,” Shakeel explains. “The judges have poor security and have to look out for their own lives as well.” After being found guilty of blasphemy, Shakeel spent two years in three different high security prisons in Punjab. Shakeel Wajid He describes how blasphemy prisoners are kept in separate, high-security barracks, often with other prisoners who are mentally ill. Most of the time they are kept locked in their cells and for their own safety, are banned from eating with the other inmates in case someone attempts to poison them. “One of my fellow prisoners in Rawalpindi was a university professor. A student didn’t agree with his interpretation of ‘heaven’ and ‘hell’ and lodged a blasphemy complaint against him.” Shakeel believes that he was exceptionally lucky that he was able to get his freedom back. But more than freedom, he was desperate to get his name cleared of the allegation. “The label of blasphemer is worse than the fear of death. It’s such a serious accusation that I didn’t want to die with it. I wanted my name to be cleared so my family could survive with dignity in the society.” Pakistan’s blasphemy laws became more severe in the 1980s, against a backdrop of increasing polarisation in the country. In 1979, when Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviet Union and the US started its covert operations in the country to help Islamist fighters, Pakistan was America’s frontline ally. There were significant economic gains from Pakistan’s participation in the Afghan jihad, but it also boosted religious fanaticism. During the next decade, the political and social clout of radical groups increased dramatically. Pakistani President Zia ul-Haq, 1987 They became more visible and vocal. The state openly promoted the ultra-conservative Wahhabi form of Islam, under the leadership of General Zia ul-Haq. Laws were enacted and amended to enforce Sharia and to make Pakistan a “truly Islamic” nation. Against this background, the blasphemy laws were changed by parliament in 1986. Originally the law was codified by the British in 1860. The purpose was to contain religious strife between Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Sikhs across British-ruled India. It protected places of worship and sacred objects and made it a crime to disturb religious assemblies, to trespass on burial sites, and to deliberately insult religious beliefs of any person, punishable by up to ten years in prison. In 1927, during a time of political tension and antagonism between different communities, the law was tightened. But the blasphemy laws didn’t favour any specific religion until 1986 when Pakistan’s parliament introduced new amendments and inserted a clause which made the use of derogatory remarks against the Prophet Muhammad a crime punishable by death, or life imprisonment. The clause was 295-C and only one politician opposed it. His name was Muhammad Hamza. Muhammad Hamza Now in his 90s, Hamza describes the day when the measure was being debated at the National Assembly. During his speech in 1986, Hamza argued that the Islamic texts being cited by those advocating for the death penalty needed to be comprehensively reviewed by religious scholars before any change in the law could be passed. He claimed parliament was being irresponsible by avoiding a deeper debate on the issue. “I have a firm opinion,” says Hamza, “you cannot run the country on selective justice. What is the purpose of the law if it’s destructive for the society? “Our people lack depth, they are unreasonably emotional about religion, so I knew that the law would be misused - that’s why I opposed it.” Hamza’s was the only voice of opposition in the parliament that day - 295-C was passed immediately. Hamza still lives in his old constituency, the Punjabi city of Gojra. In 2009, the same year Asia was arrested, Gojra made international headlines after a series of attacks targeted the city’s biggest Christian settlement. A woman walks with her child in Gojra Sparked by rumours that pages of the Koran had been desecrated, an Islamist mob had attacked and looted several houses before setting them alight. Eight Christians were burned alive. In a solemn, low voice, Hamza recounts the attacks. “It was a sad day. The allegation was completely unfounded, but the mob was charged. They didn’t pay heed to what the authorities were trying to tell them and then the situation got out of control.” Two Pakistani Christians stand in their burnt-out house in Gojra, 2009 Since the introduction of the death penalty the total number of people accused of blasphemy has increased massively, according to Pakistan’s Centre for Social Justice. “I feel dejected, the way this law is being misused against vulnerable people, religion has turned into a powerful political tool, it’s not a blessing anymore, and it has become a curse unfortunately,” Hamza says. Critics of the law believe the violence against those accused of blasphemy is down to a misinterpretation of the holy texts at a grassroots level. In Pakistan, thousands of children are sent to madrassas or Islamic boarding schools - a free alternative to the often underfunded public alternative. Many madrassas teach a deeply conservative interpretation of Islam, including a constant rhetoric around blasphemy. So deep-rooted is the shame of blasphemy in the psyche of some followers, they are even willing to self-harm. At 16, Muhammad Anwar was a typical teenager. Living in a small village in the Okara district, like other boys of his age, he often used to help his father on the farm. As is common in many rural parts of Pakistan with low levels of literacy, the teenager and his family would look to their local imam as the final authority on all religious matters. Anwar's local mosque In January, 2016, he was attending a gathering at his local mosque. The cleric leading the proceedings, in an attempt to whip the crowd up into a religious fervour, posed a question: “Who among you is a follower of Muhammad?” While the boy was dozing off,  the rest of the crowd raised their hands. The cleric called to the crowd again: “Who among you doesn’t believe in the teachings of Muhammad?” The teenager, half asleep, unwittingly raised his hand. Inside Anwar's mosque The room fell silent, until finally the cleric publicly shamed the boy, accusing him of dishonouring the Prophet. The teenager was deeply disturbed. After everyone else had gone home, he stayed behind at the mosque, searching for solace. “I wanted to prove my love for Muhammad,” he said sincerely. As an act of adoration for his faith, the teenager decided his best course of action was to cut off his own hand. Placing his right hand in a grass-cutting machine he severed it at the wrist in a single chop. The grass-cutting machine “There was no question of pain, I did it for the love of my prophet, may peace be upon him.” He placed his severed hand on a tray, covered it with a white cloth, and returned to the mosque seeking absolution from the cleric. Over the next few days, people from nearby villages and towns came to pay their respects to Muhammad Anwar, praising him for his love of the Prophet. Two years on, he now spends most of his time reading the Koran at a local madrassa. But he maintains, he has no regrets. “I don’t care about what people say, it’s between me and my prophet. You cannot understand it.” Image: Muhammad Anwar Asia Bibi The Lahore High Court dwarfs the adjacent buildings along the city’s historic Mall Road. With its red bricks and high round white domes, it’s one of the many structures in the city that remind people of its colonial past. Surrounding the High Court, narrow alleyways accommodate many lawyers’ chambers, often in shabby, cramped offices. In a small plaza just behind the High Court, above a busy teashop, Ghulam Mustafa Chaudhry has his chambers. Chaudhry is the president of an anti-blasphemy lawyers’ alliance called Khatam-e-Nabuwat, which roughly translates as “finality of the prophet”. They offer free legal advice for any Muslim filing a case of blasphemy. Lawyer Ghulam Mustafa Chaudhry (C) The alliance has around 800 volunteer lawyers working all over the country. “Whenever we notice any such incident [of blasphemy] anywhere in the country, we reach out to the complainants and offer them free of charge legal assistance,” explains Chaudhry. “We do this to please Allah and to protect the honour of the Prophet Muhammad - there is no material motivation.” Chaudhry founded the forum almost 18 years ago, after he started practising as a lawyer. Now in his 50s, he says he is even more driven in his mission. “It’s very unfortunate - blasphemy has become rampant. There are 40 blasphemy cases under trial in Lahore city alone. “People who commit blasphemy are glorified like heroes, this is sad.” He is unhappy at how the Asia Bibi case has played out. “She has insulted the prophet, but she has become a hero for the West.” Chaudhry (L) representing a petitioner (R) against Asia Bibi at Lahore's Supreme Court, 2015 Chaudhry was also the defence lawyer of Mumtaz Qadri, the former bodyguard turned assassin of the governor Salman Taseer. He says that the blasphemy law is a “blessing” and is actually a “deterrent” to mob justice. “Mumtaz Qadri approached the police to lodge a [blasphemy] complaint against the former governor, but his complaint was not entertained”. “He would not have been forced to take gun in his hands, if the law would have taken its course” he added. In Asia’s case, the law did take its course, to the very highest court in the land, and despite the ruling that there wasn't enough evidence to convict her, violent protests still erupted. Asia Bibi's lawyer Saif-ul-Mulook (C) speaks to the media after the Supreme Court rejected the review appeal against Asia,29 January 2019 In its landmark decision on 31 October, the judges wrote: “It is ironical that in the Arabic language the appellant’s name Asia means ‘sinful’, but in the circumstances of the present case she appears to be a person, in the words of Shakespeare’s King Lear, ‘more sinned against than sinning’.” Still, the government agreed there could be a review of the Supreme Court’s judgment on Asia’s acquittal. They wanted to disperse the protesters, but later cracked down on Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan. Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the firebrand leader of the TLP was also taken into custody by the police. Asia’s family was kept at a secret location for almost three more months; she had been acquitted by the court, but was not free. Asia's husband Ashiq Masih (L) sits with daughters Esham (R) and Esha (C) Finally the Supreme Court took up the review petition on 29 January. The proceedings lasted for a few hours. Ghulam Mustafa Chaudhry represented Qari Salim, the complainant in Bibi’s case. He failed to pinpoint any error in the verdict of Asia’s acquittal. The court rejected the petition and upheld its earlier decision to release Asia. The chief justice said there were inconsistencies in witnesses’ statements against Asia. “How could we hang someone on a false witness statement?” Qari Salim (L) and his lawyer Ghulam Mustafa Chaudhry (R) speak to the media outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad In retrospect, it’s ironic how a case based on false statements ripped the social fabric of the country for eight years. But the state finally showed its muscle and the rule of law prevailed. The message was clear - that mobs cannot dictate and rule Pakistan. It also made clear that misuse of blasphemy laws will not be allowed in the country anymore. It was a watershed moment for Pakistan. But the law is still there, and still nobody dares talk about amending or repealing it. The murders of Salman Taseer and minority ministerShahbaz Bhattistill haunt the psyche of the nation.

"Steven Sidebottom (left) denied murdering and robbing Brian McKandie A man has been convicted of the brutal murder and robbery of a handyman in Aberdeenshire. Brian McKandie, 67, was found dead in his cottage near Rothienorman on 12 March 2016. Police initially treated Mr McKandie's death as an accident but a post-mortem examination later found he had suffered at least 15 blows to the head. Steven Sidebottom, 25, denied murder and robbery but a jury returned a guilty verdict by majority. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some members of the jury - who spent almost 11 hours considering the verdict over the past three days - were visibly upset. At the High Court in Aberdeen, the judge, Lord Uist, deferred sentence on Sidebottom, who showed no emotion. The 'accidental death' that was a brutal murder An ordinary man with Â£200,000 hidden in his cottage Lord Uist told the father-of-one and first offender: ""You have been convicted by the jury of the crimes of murder and robbery of Brian McKandie, a man who lived alone in his cottage. ""He was brutally murdered by being struck at least 15 times on the head in order to obtain money which you gave to other people and used yourself. ""The sentence for murder is fixed by law - it's imprisonment for life. You will in due course be sentenced to imprisonment for life."" Outside court, members of Mr McKandie's family welcomed the verdict after an 18-day trial, but said they still did not know the reasons behind his murder. A statement read out on their behalf said: ""The reality is we will never understand why Brian - a complete gentleman - died in such a brutal and senseless way, and it is something we will never come to terms with."" For many decades, Mr McKandie was known as someone who carried out cash-in-hand car repairs at the garage at his home, as well as fixing electrical items. He would often joke with customers that the money would ""top up"" his ""shoebox"". Almost seven weeks after his body was found in his rural cottage, police found a number of sweet and biscuit tins and shoeboxes containing about Â£200,000. Police found about Â£200,000 in notes kept in sweet tins and shoe boxes at Mr McKandie's cottage After the case became a murder inquiry, Mr McKandie's death featured on Crimewatch and a Â£10,000 reward was offered. In the months that followed, police attention turned to Steven Sidebottom, who knew Mr McKandie and lived locally. Officers saw discrepancies in the information he had given them about being outside the pensioner's home in the days before he died. Members of Mr McKandie's family said they still did not understand why he had been murdered The court heard evidence he suddenly had what appeared to be ""thousands"" of pounds around the time of the murder, and had ""lavished"" gifts on his student girlfriend. It was also claimed he had been planning a criminal job to get money. However, his defence counsel Ian Duguid QC argued that there was no evidence any money had been taken from Mr McKandie's home. Lord Uist told the jury that in order to convict Sidebottom, they would have to accept the ""whole package"" of the circumstantial case presented by the prosecution. The victim worked in the garage next to his cottage The judge noted that no DNA was found linking the accused to the crime, nor any fingerprints. He said there were no eyewitnesses, no bloodied clothing, and that no witnesses had been asked what Sidebottom had been wearing on the day of the murder. Following the guilty verdict, members of Mr McKandie's family described him as ""a hard-working and quiet man who wouldn't have done anyone a bad turn"". Brian McKandie lived in the cottage most of his life They said: ""Every day we think about what happened to Brian in the home he lived his whole life, and every day we struggle to understand why this happened to him. ""As a family we are extremely pleased with and welcome today's outcome, however it doesn't bring Brian back. ""We would like to thank the public for your help and support throughout this investigation and to everyone involved in bringing this case to court."" Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team welcomed Sidebottom's conviction for ""the cold and calculated murder"". Det Supt Iain Smith said: ""Given the private person Brian was, he didn't have a lot of close friends and didn't let anyone into his home. ""The fact he was murdered within his own house - the place he had lived since he was two years old - made this crime all the more callous."" He said Sidebottom went to ""extreme efforts to cover his tracks and spun a web of lies to deceive the people around him"". Det Supt Smith said police had apologised to Mr McKandie's family for his death not initially being recognised as being murder. Sidebottom will be sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh on 6 March.

"Mr Banks founded Leave.EU and owns Eldon Insurance Leave.EU and an insurance company owned by its founder Arron Banks have been fined Â£120,000 over data law breaches. It represents a reduction in the Â£135,000 total previouslyannounced by the Information Commissioner's office. The pro-Brexit Leave.EU group's Â£60,000 fine was reduced to Â£45,000 after ""considering the company's representations"", the ICO said. Leave.EU said it was a ""politically motivated attack against our involvement in Brexit"". A spokesman said it was ""disappointed but not surprised"" and would be appealing against the fine in court. Leave.EU and insurance firm face Â£135,000 in fines The fines follow anInformation Commissioner investigation,externalinto the misuse of personal data by political campaigns. The report says more than a million emails sent to Leave.EU subscribers contained marketing for the Eldon Insurance firm's GoSkippy services. Eldon Insurance has been fined Â£60,000 for the breach. In addition to the Â£45,000 fine for that breach, Leave.EU was also fined Â£15,000 for ""using Eldon Insurance customers' details unlawfully to send almost 300,000 political marketing messages"". The ICO confirmed on Friday it would be reviewing how both are complying with data protection laws, including looking at how personal data is processed and staff training. The watchdog will also be interviewing the directors, staff and data protection officers at both organisations. Eldon Insurance has also been issued with an enforcement notice, ordering it to take steps to make sure it complies with electronic marketing regulations. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: ""It is deeply concerning that sensitive personal data gathered for political purposes was later used for insurance purposes; and vice versa. It should never have happened. ""We have been told both organisations have made improvements and learned from these events. ""But the ICO will now audit the organisations to determine how they are using customers' personal information."" In November, Mr Banks defended himself on Twitter.

"George Mason and two other men took part in ""various sexual acts"" in the ""presence of the travelling public"" A porn actor who filmed himself and his ex-partner having a threesome in front of passengers on the London Underground has been fined Â£1,000. George Mason, 35, and Nicholas Mullan, 24, had sex with an unknown third man between Leicester Square and Waterloo stations, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. A video was posted on Twitter with the caption ""100% genuine footage"". Mason, of Southwark, admitted outraging public decency. Mullan, of Belfast, was not fined but told to pay Â£170 costs and carry out a 12-month community order. The incident happened in July 2017, but it was not reported until February last year, when it was posted on Twitter. Magistrates were told the pair had been returning to Mason's flat following a day out in London Prosecutor Robert Simpson said ""the two men in the dock engaged in various sexual acts"" on the Tube ""in the presence of the travelling public"". Mr Simpson said: ""The incident is recorded by them and the video of what happened was subsequently uploaded on to Twitter, where another gay man saw it, thought that had crossed the line of what was acceptable behaviour and the incident was reported to the police."" Tube commuters fainting at 'alarming levels' Tube injuries up since Night Tube launch An investigation discovered the footage was posted to an account linked to Mason. Mullan was traced after another clip linked to an escort website in Northern Ireland, where he shared his mobile number under the name Toby. The third man was never traced. Defending both Mason and Mullan, Howard Cohen said the video was recorded as the pair travelled back to Mason's flat after a day out. He said: ""During the course of the journey, the idea came about that they would have sexual relations on the train."" Chairing the bench, Lucinda Lubbock described the offence as ""unpleasant and serious"". ""The way it took place back in July, the seriousness of the offence, is exacerbated by the fact that it went on social media,"" she said. ""We feel that this is a lesson to both of you.

"The UK has objected to Gibraltar being described as a ""colony"" in European Union legislation allowing UK nationals to travel to the EU after Brexit. The EU proposed allowing visa-free travel for Britons in November. The Spanish government has since insisted a footnote be added describing Gibraltar as a ""colony"" and referring to ""controversy"" over its status. The UK's ambassador to the EU, Sir Tim Barrow, objected to it at a meeting in Brussels earlier. UK travellers to pay â¬7 to visit EU after Brexit Gibraltar: What's it got to do with Brexit? Spain threatens to vote against Brexit deal A UK government spokesperson said: ""The EU's provisions for visa-free travel into and out of the [passport-free] Schengen area cover Gibraltar, and mean that in any scenario, British nationals from Gibraltar will be able to travel for short stays in and out of Spain and other countries in the Schengen area. ""Gibraltar is not a colony and it is completely inappropriate to describe it in this way. ""Gibraltar is a full part of the UK family and has a mature and modern constitutional relationship with the UK. ""This will not change due to our exit from the EU. All parties should respect the people of Gibraltar's democratic wish to be British."" Downing Street also condemned the description of Gibraltar as a ""colony"" in the draft EU document. Fabian Picardo accused Spain of ""bullying"" Gibraltar Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo accused Madrid of trying to ""bully"" the British Overseas Territory by rejecting British demands for the footnote to be removed. ""No one will be surprised to hear the Spanish government making provocative statements in respect of Gibraltar. ""The 32,000 people of Gibraltar are used to the constant attempts by successive Spanish governments to bully us in every possible way. ""This is no different to the sort of abuse we have had from former Spanish administrations."" Gibraltar is a limestone outcrop on the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula, adjacent to Spain, with a population of about 32,000 Gibraltarians are British citizens but they run their own affairs under a chief minister The territory is self-governing in all matters - including taxation - except foreign policy and defence, which are dealt with by the UK government Despite its small size, Gibraltar is strategically important, standing only 12 miles from the north coast of Africa. It has a UK military base, including a port and airstrip Find out more in the BBC's Gibraltar country profile In November, the European Commission offered visa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay in the event of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March, as long as the UK offers the same in return. At a meeting of EU ambassadors earlier, member states agreed their position on the proposed new law. The European Council document says in a footnote:,external""Gibraltar is a colony of the British Crown. ""There is a controversy between Spain and the United Kingdom concerning the sovereignty over Gibraltar, a territory for which a solution has to be reached in light of the relevant resolutions and decisions of the General Assembly of the United Nations."" The document will now be discussed by the European Parliament and the European Commission before becoming law. The EU withdrawal agreement agreed with the UK, proposes a special protocol creating several working groups between Madrid and London to discuss the future of Gibraltar. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the Spanish government sees this as giving it a bigger say in the status of Gibraltar, and the issue is likely to be raised again as Brexit approaches, and beyond. But the UK insists the protocol is just about the technicalities of how Brexit will work in Gibraltar, he added. Gibraltar was ceded to Great Britain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, but Spain has continued to press its claim for sovereignty - which is rejected by both the UK and the residents of Gibraltar itself. In December, the United Nations called on Spain and Britain to find a ""definitive solution"" to their long-running dispute. The UN General Assembly adopted a recommendation from its Decolonisation Committee for the two countries to reach a solution through ""dialogue and co-operation"". Gibraltarians rejected by 99% to 1% the idea of the UK sharing sovereignty with Spain in a vote in 2002 and in a previous referendum in 1967. But Gibraltar voted by 96% to stay in the EU in the 2016 referendum.

"This video can not be played Pangolin: The most trafficked mammal in the world A record eight tonnes of pangolin scales and more than 1,000 elephant tusks have been seized from a shipping container in Hong Kong, officials say. The container, from Nigeria and said to be carrying frozen beef, was searched after a tip-off. The illegal cargo has an estimated value of about $8m (Â£6m). Two arrests were made, officials say. The scales of the pangolin, an endangered anteater, are said to have medicinal value in parts of Asia. Customs officers in Hong Kong said the shipment contained 8,300kg of pangolin scales (left) They have previously been smuggled into countries from Africa in huge quantities, with the pangolin thought to be the world's most trafficked mammal. Pangolin survival: How 'following the money' could save lives On Friday, Hong Kong customs officers said they had seized some 8,300kg of pangolin scales and 2,100kg of ivory tusks hidden inside the container, AFP news agency reports. They added that the shipment, which was bound for Vietnam, was ""a record quantity for a seizure of pangolin scales"". Pangolins are sought after for the unproven medicinal properties of their scales A man and a woman from a trading company were arrested in Hong Kong, the customs department said. It is difficult to determine how many pangolins would have been killed to make 8,300kg of scales as there are three species of the anteater ranging in weight from about 2kg to 35kg, Dr Helen O'Neill from the Zoological Society of London told the BBC. These unusual-looking creatures are the world's most scaly animal. All eight species are endangered because they are hunted for their scales and meat - and are now protected under international law. The scales, which are made from nothing more than keratin, the same material that makes up human fingernails and hair, are sought after for their unproven medicinal properties. Huge haul of pangolin scales displayed in Thailand Some 100,000 pangolins are snatched every year from the wild and sent to Vietnam and China. This has led to their numbers falling drastically.

"UK manufacturers prepared for Brexit by stockpiling raw materials at a record pace last month, a closely-watched survey has suggested. The research, by IHS Markit/CIPS,,externalfound companies were stockpiling goods in January at the fastest pace in the survey's 27-year history. Employment in the sector fell, and the survey warned that export orders were ""near-stagnant"". It added that there was a risk of the sector slipping into recession. Overall, the survey's Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 52.8 last month from 54.2 in December, which was a three-month low and the second weakest reading since July 2016. While the figure above 50 still implies activity in the sector is expanding, IHS Markit/CIPS said manufacturing had made a ""lacklustre"" start to the year. How has business been affected by Brexit? Unilever stockpiles Ben & Jerry's and Magnum ice creams With two months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU, the lack of clarity over the terms of the UK's departure means firms are having to make contingency plans. ""The start of 2019 saw UK manufacturers continue their preparations for Brexit,"" said Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit. ""Stocks of inputs increased at the sharpest pace in the 27-year history, as buying activity was stepped up to mitigate against potential supply-chain disruptions in coming months. ""There were also signs that inventories of finished goods were being bolstered to ensure warehouses are well stocked to meet ongoing contractual obligations."" An equivalent survey of eurozone manufacturers,externalalso found the sector struggling in the 19-nation bloc. The PMI reading of 50.5 for January indicated minimal growth and was the lowest reading since November 2014. The eurozone survey also found new orders were falling at the fastest rate in nearly six years, By Dharshini David, BBC economics correspondent With clarity as yet elusive, manufacturers are intensifying efforts to prepare for a possible a no-deal Brexit. Both raw materials and finished goods are being stockpiled at an unprecedented rate, to avoid disruption to supply chains and gaps on warehouse and shop shelves. So on the face of it, the overall PMI activity balance for this survey suggests greater manufacturing momentum last month in the UK than in  France or Germany. But away from the buzz of stockbuilding, orders, particularly for export, are struggling.  Overseas customers may be more reluctant to order goods, in case they face delays or tariffs on delivery in the event of a no-deal. This survey tends to be more volatile than official manufacturing figures. But there is increasing evidence of dwindling export demand in many sectors. Orders for British malting barley, for example, from the rest of the EU has dried up, as that crop could attract particularly steep charges. The report referred to some UK supply chains as being ""closer to breaking point"" It noted there had been ""a marked slowdown"" in the growth of new orders, and those companies that did report an increase in output ""mainly linked this to stock-building activity"". ""January also saw manufacturing jobs being cut for only the second time since mid-2016 as confidence about the outlook slipped to a 30-month low, often reflecting ongoing concerns about Brexit and signs of a European economic slowdown,"" said Mr Dobson. ""With neither of these headwinds likely to abate in the near-term, there is a clear risk of manufacturing sliding into recession."" How has business been affected by Brexit?

Labour's Brexit tribes Senior Tory 'could accept Brexit delay' Brexit: All you need to know Writing on the Labour List website,external, Mr Lavery, the former general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers and a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, accused Mrs May of playing ""divide and rule"" over Brexit.

""Any Labour MP seriously considering discussions with the PM should remember her record and that of her party going back generations. Quite simply, taking such a bribe would be fool's gold."" The government is understood to be considering proposals from a group of Labour MPs in predominantly Leave-supporting constituencies, to allocate more funds to their communities for big infrastructure projects.

John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, a former coal mining area in Nottinghamshire, met cabinet office officials in Whitehall on Thursday and told reporters: ""I want to see, when we leave the European Union, significant investment in new technologies, new jobs, science and industry in areas like mine and all the other areas in the country like mine. ""This isn't transactional politics, this is about getting a national fund ... the areas that voted Leave the most are the areas that have not had that investment."" A couple of weeks ago, a Labour MP confessed quietly that they would vote for Theresa May's Brexit deal in the end. But they wanted something to show for it, suggesting, half-teasingly, that they wanted the PFI debt of their local hospital paid off. That MP was frustrated that the government had taken so long, as they saw it, to try to reach out to get them on board. But they predicted that we would soon see what they described as ""transactional politics"", in a way that we haven't seen before in this country. With Number 10 in a frantic hunt for support, maybe that time has arrived. Read more from Laura It comes as ministers continue to try to win support for the withdrawal deal Theresa May has negotiated with the EU, which was rejected by a historic margin in a Commons vote more than two weeks ago. Mr Mann was one of only three Labour MPs to back the deal. Downing Street says that ministers are looking at a programme of ""national renewal"" following Brexit, to tackle inequality and rebuild communities but has denied any funding amounted to ""cash for votes"". Tottenham MP David Lammy is part of the People's Vote campaign for another referendum Asked if the government was trying to bribe Labour MPs, Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""No it doesn't work like that I'm afraid. ""What we are doing is looking at some of the drivers behind the Brexit vote. ""What was it that felt that made so many communities feel that they didn't have a stake in the way our economy was operating? ""And making sure we are investing in, for example, former coalfield communities to ensure they can keep up with the changes that are happening across the economy and that they too can share in our future prosperity."" But David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, in north London,tweeted his response,externalto headlines suggesting the PM was preparing to ""woo Labour MPs with cash to back Brexit"" saying: ""Cowards and facilitators. History will be brutal."" And his colleague Chuka Umunna, who like Mr Lammy campaigns for another EU referendum, said on Twitter: ""Government by bung is WRONG - whether involving DUP MPs or those from any other party. ""Funding should be based on the needs of the people not on the needs of an incompetent Tory PM to secure the votes of MPs for a deal which will make the UK poorer."" Allow Twitter content?

Asked about Mr Lammy's comments, the former Labour MP Frank Field, who now sits as an independent, said: ""David would say that, he is in London. He isn't going to get any money and they are well provided for by the amount of rates they get in most areas and the wealth the business community brings to London."" The veteran MP for Birkenhead, on Merseyside, who backs Brexit, told BBC Newsnight Labour MPs representing Leave constituencies ""should be fighting me to get to the front of the queue to get those funds"". He added: ""That's how politics operates. The Tory party in government is very good at shoving money their way to their constituencies. I wish Labour were as effective."" But Anna Turley, MP for Redcar, a Teesside coastal town, which voted to leave the EU, told the same programme she found the idea ""appalling"". ""We have had nearly a decade now of austerity that has seen constituencies like mine absolutely hammered, Â£6bn has come out of public spending in the North by this government and if [there is] a programme or national renewal, I'm afraid it's too little too late.""

"The interview came after Mr Trump contacted the New York Times' publisher US President Donald Trump has dismissed the federal investigation into alleged Russian collusion in the 2016 election and talks about a proposed border wall. His lawyers had been reassured he was not a target in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, he said. Talks in Congress about wall funding - the issue behind the recent government shutdown - were a ""waste of time"". Mr Trump was interviewed by the New York Times, a paper he repeatedly described as ""failing"" in the past. The paper's interview with Mr Trump,externalcame after he contacted its publisher, AG Sulzberger. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Sulzberger asked the president to stop his attacks on the medialast year, saying they could ""lead to violence"" against journalists. The interview with Mr Trump covered a wide range of topics: ""I'll continue to build the wall, and we'll get the wall finished,"" the president said, dismissing the talks between congressional Republicans and Democrats over the impasse and implying he could declare a national emergency to ensure the barrier is built. Tapping into emergency presidential powers could enable Mr Trump to bypass Congress and access the money and resources needed to complete the project. Critics have said the situation at the border does not constitute a true emergency and invoking one would be an abuse of power. Mr Trump has sought $5.7 billion (Â£4.4bn) for a wall on the southern border. The Democrats refuse to provide it, arguing it is immoral and ineffective. The divide led tothe longest government shutdown in US history, which will resume on 15 February if no budget can be agreed. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall Mr Trump slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the interview over the border wall. ""I've actually always gotten along with her, but now I don't think I will any more,"" he said. ""I think she's doing a tremendous disservice to the country."" Ms Pelosi told reporters on Thursday there would be no money for a wall in planned border security legislation. Speaking to two New York Times reporters in the Oval Office, the president said he had received assurances from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. ""Rod told me I'm not a target of the investigation,"" Mr Trump said. He then suggested that he may not have spoken to him in person, adding: ""The lawyers ask him. They say: 'He's not a target of the investigation'."" It is not clear when Mr Rosenstein made the comments attributed to him by Mr Trump. Mr Rosenstein oversaw Mr Mueller's investigation until last November, whenthe president transferred control to acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker. Mr Rosenstein and Mr Mueller have not said whether Mr Trump is a target in the investigation. Some reports have suggested that the term ""target"" would not be used for Mr Trump because sitting presidents are immune from prosecution. Mr Mueller's investigation is still ongoing and it is unclear when he will submit his findings to the attorney general. Rod Rosenstein previously oversaw Robert Mueller's investigation The president also insisted he ""never did"" speak to his long-time associate Roger Stone about stolen Democratic emails published by Wikileaks in 2016. Mr Stone has been charged with seven counts in the Mueller inquiry related to the emails - charges he denies. Defiant Trump ally rejects Russia charges Stone - a political agitator and Nixon fan President Trump did however attack the FBI raid on Mr Stone's home, calling it ""a very sad thing for this country"". ""I like Roger, he's a character,"" Mr Trump said. The president said his lawyer Rudy Giuliani had been ""wrong"" to say that talks over a project to construct a Trump building in Moscow had continued up to the 2016 US election. Mr Giuliani had already rowed back on the comments, saying that he had been mistaken. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress at least three times about the project - including telling Congress that the project was dissolved in January 2016. In fact, negotiations continued through June 2016, when Mr Trump was already the Republican presidential nominee. Last monthMr Mueller's office disputed a claim in a Buzzfeed report that said Mr Trump had told Cohen to lie to Congressabout when the Moscow project had ended. The Buzzfeed report also said Mr Trump had allegedly encouraged Cohen to plan a trip to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during the election campaign. Trump's tower in Moscow that never was Mr Trump told the New York Times his last conversation about the project had been in ""early to middle"" 2016. He said Cohen might have been involved with the project ""a little bit longer than that"". ""I was running for president; I was doing really well. The last thing I cared about was building a building,"" he added. ""I love this job,"" Mr Trump insisted, dismissing talk he might not run for re-election in 2020. He did however tell the paper he had lost ""massive amounts of money"" working as president. He also spoke of Democratic candidates in next year's vote. Which Democrats are running in 2020? The US state looking to take down Trump California Senator Kamala Harris has had ""the best opening so far"", he said.She announced her plan to run for president last month. But another possible candidate, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, had been ""hurt badly"" by Mr Trump's mockery of her claims to Native American heritage, he said. Last year Mr Trump described her as a ""fake Pocahontas""and challenged her to take a DNA test. She did and the subsequent DNA report concluded that ""the vast majority"" of Ms Warren's ancestry was European, but ""the results strongly"" supported a Native American ancestor. ""I may be wrong, but I think that was a big part of her credibility and now all of a sudden it's gone,"" Mr Trump told the New York Times.

"MPs have demanded more information on the financial risks of purchasing F-35 stealth jets The Ministry of Defence has a funding black hole of at least Â£7bn in its 10-year plan to equip the UK's armed forces, according to a report by the Commons spending watchdog. The Public Accounts Committee said the MoD lacked the ability to ""accurately cost programmes"" and that the shortfall could reach Â£14.8bn by 2028. MPs added the government did not have a ""coherent and credible"" funding plan. The MoD said it was ""addressing the financial challenges"" it is facing. A spokesman for the department added: ""We are confident that we will deliver the equipment plan within budget this year, as we did last year, as we strive to ensure our military have the very best ships, aircraft and vehicles."" The MoD plans to spend more than Â£180bn on new warships, submarines, jets and armoured vehicles over the next decade. But the PAC's chairwoman, Labour MP Meg Hillier, said the department was ""a repeat offender"" when it came to ""poor financial planning"". Three firms in warship build contest MoD announces Â£160m investment at base No-deal 'redeployment' for defence staff She added that progress in addressing concerns raised by the committee in May 2018 had been ""woeful"". Ms Hillier told the BBC's Today programme: ""There's a very big funding gap in what the Ministry of Defence says it wants to do and the money available. If they don't plug that gap there's going to be ongoing problems."" Asked if the MoD was always facing funding difficulties, Ms Hiller said: ""It does feel a bit like Groundhog Day. There just needs to be a clear decision about what the priorities are. ""Any indecision or any delay has a huge knock-on effect. Small delays can cost millions, if not billions, of pounds."" Lord Dannatt, a former head of the Army, told the programme the defence secretary had ""a very strong case to make"" for increasing the military budget. A defence and security review that followed the 2010 general election had ""slashed and burned a lot of our capabilities"", he said. ""The Americans wring their hands now and say that we're not the reliable allies that we were because we haven't got the fully rounded capabilities. ""You can't have a nation like ours' defence on the cheap. Two per cent of GDP is the lowest we've ever spent on our defence since the second world war, and it's bought us the smallest army, navy and air force we've ever had.""

"Amelia Campbell was born at Treliske Hospital nearly three weeks before her expected due date A woman who went into premature labour in heavy snowfall has been helped by a customer and Asda staff as she waited more than three hours for an ambulance. Roxanne Campbell walked into the store in Bodmin, Cornwall for help when her contractions began nearly three weeks early at about 17:00 GMT on Thursday. Heavy snow delayed the ambulance and scores of vehicles were abandoned on the A30 in Bodmin overnight. Amelia Campbell was born at Treliske Hospital at 20:21 and weighed 5lb 5oz. Her delighted father Alex Campbell said his wife and daughter were ""doing great"" now and praised the Asda staff and Jess Creasey, a trained first aider, who responded to a store announcement for medical assistance. He said when the contractions started he was ""panicking a bit"". ""Basically we had to get all the way to Truro from Bodmin, and there was no buses, no trains, and none of us drive,"" he continued. ""We just got stranded outside the front here. It was the nearest place that was warm."" Asda manager Lee Coshall thanked Jess Creasey for her help Store manager Lee Coshall organised for Mrs Campbell to be taken into a backroom for privacy, and tried to keep her warm and calm while they waited. Mrs Creasey, from Bude, said: ""They were amazing, they gave us everything we needed for free, straight off the shelf."" The ambulance was called at about 17:00 and eventually made its way through the traffic and weather at 20:00. Other motorists were not so lucky and resorted to abandoning their cars on the A30 as heavy snow caused traffic chaos on Thursday. Kate Bullen was told her dog Bert was not allowed in the Premier Inn hotel In Bodmin, a woman was thrown out of a Premier Inn in a snow storm because she had a dog with her. Kate Bullen and 13-year-old Bert went to The Callywith as heavy snow fell in the area but staff told the her no dogs were allowed in the hotel and asked her to leave. The 38-year-old graphic designer had been sent home from work as the weather worsened and was eventually forced to abandon her car.

""Why would you turn anyone out into a blizzard?"" Premier Inn said its staff could have handled the situation ""differently"" and apologised ""for any upset caused"". Staff at Jamaica Inn have laid out makeshift beds for stranded motorists More than 100 people stranded on the A30 were given emergency shelter overnight in the nearby Jamaica Inn, made famous by Daphne Du Maurier's classic novel of the same name. General manager Sammy Wheeler said people had trudged through the snow for up to five miles to reach them as ""people were fed up of being in a cold car and they were running out of fuel"". Despite their difficult journey she said spirits were ""incredibly high"" among the guests, who included about a dozen children and an eight-month-old baby. Meanwhile about 300 stranded students slept at Callywith College overnight. This video can not be played Indi and Chris told BBC Breakfast that the atmosphere overnight at Callywith College had been pretty good Police said the A30 had become ""passable"" by noon but the Highways Agency said its efforts to clear the road had been hampered by scores of abandoned vehicles. Devon and Cornwall Police said it had dealt with about 600 snow-related incidents on Thursday and overnight and the A38 was closed after a HGV crashed in the snow. Ch Insp Adrian Leisk said Thursday was as busy as New Year's Eve so resources were ""extremely stretched"". Paul Davies, who was stranded for eight and a half hours, said: ""The heavens opened and the snow came down and it became very deep and impassable very quickly. ""We were on Bodmin Moor about to go down a very steep hill and that became impassable so everyone just ground to a halt."" Motorists who abandoned their vehicles were urged to return to them to help clear the roads Snow was being cleared from the A30 on Friday morning Many schools wereclosed across the South Weston Friday and Newquay Airport was closed until 12:00 GMT. The sports hall at Callywith College in Cornwall became a makeshift dormitory for 300 students who because of the weather had been unable to leave either in their own vehicles or the college-run bus service. One student Indi said: ""It was just too thick to drive through."" Fellow student Chris left his car at a petrol station and walked an hour and half back to the college. He said: ""It was the right decision in the end as we would have been freezing out there."" ""We had around 300 people all in the sports hall, obviously we're all good friends so it's not too bad, we made the best of a bad situation,"" he added.

"TSB's computer meltdown pushed the bank into a Â£105.4m loss last year, from a Â£162.7m profit in 2017. The disastrous IT upgrade resulted in Â£330.2m in costs, to be partly offset by Â£153m that TSB said it expected to recover from computer provider Sabis. About 80,000 customers switched their bank account away from TSB in 2018 - 30,000 more than 2017 - after some people went weeks without services. There was also the cost of customer compensation and fraud. TSB said it had resolved about 90% (181,000) of the 204,000 customer complaints received since the IT chaos. Of the Â£330m in extra costs, about Â£125m was for customer compensation and sorting out their problems, Â£49m was due to fraud and operational losses, Â£122m for extra help and advice to sort out the IT problems, and Â£33m in lost income from waived fees and charges. In recognition of the extra work for its employees, the bank said it had awarded staff - excluding executives - Â£1,500 each in December. No bonuses are being paid to executives for 2018. Richard Meddings, TSB executive chairman, said in a statement:,external""Last year was TSB's most challenging year. But we enter 2019 with renewed ambition to re-emerge as the leading challenger bank in the UK - firmly on the side of the customer."" Analysis: Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter The management of TSB are talking up 2019 and attempting to move on from the IT failure that ruined last year for the bank. It also disrupted weddings and house moves, as well giving fraudsters opportunities to exploit TSB customers. This moment only marks a comma, rather than a full stop, in the saga as three inquiries into the meltdown are still open. MPs on the Treasury Committee still have an open inquiry. TSB itself commissioned an independent review from lawyers Slaughter and May to detail what went wrong and what lessons need to be learned. The results are expected in the next few weeks. But the most significant of all is an inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, which has powers to issue fines of many millions of pounds. Last summer it was critical of TSB's response to the crisis, but its in-depth investigation - undertaken jointly with the Bank's of England's Prudential Regulation Authority - could take months to complete. TSB, owned by Spanish banking giant Sabadell, was stung by the IT crisis last April that left up to 1.9 million users of its digital and mobile banking locked out of their accounts. The tech troubles were triggered by the movement of customer data from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by Sabadell. Banks told to reveal tech meltdown plans TSB appoints new boss after IT fiasco TSB boss to step down after IT fiasco Chief executive Paul Pester stepped down in the wake of the fiasco. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said at the time that Mr Pester ""set the tone for TSB's complacent and misleading public communications"". The bank announced his replacement, former CYBG chief operating officer Ms Debbie Crosbie in November. She will join the business in the spring. TSB also said that customer deposits fell by 4.7% to Â£29.1bn last year, which the bank said was due to planned changes in savings products. Customer lending also decreased by 2.7% to Â£30bn. Despite customers switching away at the height of the crisis, a total of 140,000 customers opened a new account with TSB. The bank said that economic and market conditions remained uncertain for a number of reasons, including Britain's impending departure from the European Union. But it maintained that it was ""one of the most strongly capitalised banks in the UK and, with a healthy liquidity reserve, is well positioned to weather economic uncertainty or shocks"". TSB's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio - a key measure of financial strength - stands at 19.5% and is among the strongest of UK banks.

"MPs have demanded more information on the financial risks of purchasing F-35 stealth jets The Ministry of Defence has a funding black hole of at least Â£7bn in its 10-year plan to equip the UK's armed forces, according to a report by the Commons spending watchdog. The Public Accounts Committee said the MoD lacked the ability to ""accurately cost programmes"" and that the shortfall could reach Â£14.8bn by 2028. MPs added the government did not have a ""coherent and credible"" funding plan. The MoD said it was ""addressing the financial challenges"" it is facing. A spokesman for the department added: ""We are confident that we will deliver the equipment plan within budget this year, as we did last year, as we strive to ensure our military have the very best ships, aircraft and vehicles."" The MoD plans to spend more than Â£180bn on new warships, submarines, jets and armoured vehicles over the next decade. But the PAC's chairwoman, Labour MP Meg Hillier, said the department was ""a repeat offender"" when it came to ""poor financial planning"". Three firms in warship build contest MoD announces Â£160m investment at base No-deal 'redeployment' for defence staff She added that progress in addressing concerns raised by the committee in May 2018 had been ""woeful"". Ms Hillier told the BBC's Today programme: ""There's a very big funding gap in what the Ministry of Defence says it wants to do and the money available. If they don't plug that gap there's going to be ongoing problems."" Asked if the MoD was always facing funding difficulties, Ms Hiller said: ""It does feel a bit like Groundhog Day. There just needs to be a clear decision about what the priorities are. ""Any indecision or any delay has a huge knock-on effect. Small delays can cost millions, if not billions, of pounds."" Lord Dannatt, a former head of the Army, told the programme the defence secretary had ""a very strong case to make"" for increasing the military budget. A defence and security review that followed the 2010 general election had ""slashed and burned a lot of our capabilities"", he said. ""The Americans wring their hands now and say that we're not the reliable allies that we were because we haven't got the fully rounded capabilities. ""You can't have a nation like ours' defence on the cheap. Two per cent of GDP is the lowest we've ever spent on our defence since the second world war, and it's bought us the smallest army, navy and air force we've ever had."" British soldier sues Army over Q fever Reservists on standby for no-deal Brexit Lost medals replaced for veteran, 100 In its report, the PAC demanded more information on the risks associated with major projects, including the purchase of F-35 stealth jets and Type 31e frigates. Part of the problem, the committee said, was that the government had dithered over which projects to fully finance and which to cancel or scale back.

"None of the three main health screening programmes in England - for bowel, breast or cervical cancer - met their targets last year, according to a report by the National Audit Office. There were also delays in cervical screening results reaching half of women tested, with a backlog of nearly 100,000 samples. Bowel screening performed best, narrowly missing its 60% target. A health think tank said the report was ""deeply concerning"". But ministers said they were committed to making improvements to keep screening programmes ""among the best in the world"". The NAO report,externalcomes after two recent incidents withbreastandcervical screeningraised concerns about about the management and organisation of both programmes. While bowel and breast screening met their minimum targets in 2017-18, neither met their upper target for the percentage of eligible people screened for signs of cancer. However, with 72% of women eligible for cervical screening being tested last year, even the lower target of 75% was not met. Many women also experienced delays getting their results after having smear tests, or cervical screening. According to the Department of Health and Social Care, results should be received within 14 days, but this target has not been met since 2015. In March 2018, a third of women received their results on time, improving to just over half (55%) by the end of last year. But in October, 98,628 samples were still waiting to be tested in labs across England, the report said. It is thought that a change in the way tests are carried out affected staffing in labs, leading to the delays. Half of women experienced delays receiving their cervical screening results The report also highlights variation in the percentage of people screened across the country, with the lowest levels of coverage mostly in London. And it describes issues with complex, ageing IT systems, with the cervical screening programme relying on an estimated 350 different systems to make it work. Complicated IT problems are reported to have resulted in 5,000 women not being invited for breast screening. The report also raises questions about the way screening programmes are governed and monitored. However, the report says NHS England and Public Health England have succeeded in introducing bowel scope screening, although only half of GP practices were linked to a screening centre delivering the service in 2016-17. By September 2018, 166,000 people had been invited for this type of screening against a target of nearly 500,000. Rebecca Fisher, a GP and policy fellow at the Health Foundation, said the report painted ""a deeply concerning picture of the state of screening programmes in England, with missed targets, inconsistent coverage, and ageing IT systems"". She said screening saved lives but the public must be able to trust the quality of the services being offered. The report said complicated IT systems were one reason for screening delays and errors ""Today's report highlights an urgent need for investment in the IT and equipment required to make improvements,"" she said. ""Policymakers must also consider how to most efficiently run screening programmes to ensure that these potentially lifesaving services are equally available right across the country."" Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the MPs' committee of public accounts, said: ""Those responsible for screening programmes are not always capable of picking up when people are not invited for a screening appointment, or ensuring that people receive their test results on time. ""It is unacceptable that these important screening programmes are being let down by complex and ageing IT. The Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and Public Health England need to get this fixed."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Our screening programmes are widely recognised as among the best in the world, and we are committed to making any improvements needed to keep our offer to patients world-class. ""Prevention and early diagnosis of cancer are key priorities for this government, and we are already working closely with NHS England and Public Health England to address the issues this useful report highlights.""

"TSB's computer meltdown pushed the bank into a Â£105.4m loss last year, from a Â£162.7m profit in 2017. The disastrous IT upgrade resulted in Â£330.2m in costs, to be partly offset by Â£153m that TSB said it expected to recover from computer provider Sabis. About 80,000 customers switched their bank account away from TSB in 2018 - 30,000 more than 2017 - after some people went weeks without services. There was also the cost of customer compensation and fraud. TSB said it had resolved about 90% (181,000) of the 204,000 customer complaints received since the IT chaos. Of the Â£330m in extra costs, about Â£125m was for customer compensation and sorting out their problems, Â£49m was due to fraud and operational losses, Â£122m for extra help and advice to sort out the IT problems, and Â£33m in lost income from waived fees and charges. In recognition of the extra work for its employees, the bank said it had awarded staff - excluding executives - Â£1,500 each in December. No bonuses are being paid to executives for 2018. Richard Meddings, TSB executive chairman, said in a statement:,external""Last year was TSB's most challenging year. But we enter 2019 with renewed ambition to re-emerge as the leading challenger bank in the UK - firmly on the side of the customer."" Analysis: Kevin Peachey, personal finance reporter The management of TSB are talking up 2019 and attempting to move on from the IT failure that ruined last year for the bank. It also disrupted weddings and house moves, as well giving fraudsters opportunities to exploit TSB customers. This moment only marks a comma, rather than a full stop, in the saga as three inquiries into the meltdown are still open. MPs on the Treasury Committee still have an open inquiry. TSB itself commissioned an independent review from lawyers Slaughter and May to detail what went wrong and what lessons need to be learned. The results are expected in the next few weeks. But the most significant of all is an inquiry by the Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, which has powers to issue fines of many millions of pounds. Last summer it was critical of TSB's response to the crisis, but its in-depth investigation - undertaken jointly with the Bank's of England's Prudential Regulation Authority - could take months to complete. TSB, owned by Spanish banking giant Sabadell, was stung by the IT crisis last April that left up to 1.9 million users of its digital and mobile banking locked out of their accounts. The tech troubles were triggered by the movement of customer data from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by Sabadell. Banks told to reveal tech meltdown plans TSB appoints new boss after IT fiasco TSB boss to step down after IT fiasco Chief executive Paul Pester stepped down in the wake of the fiasco. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said at the time that Mr Pester ""set the tone for TSB's complacent and misleading public communications"". The bank announced his replacement, former CYBG chief operating officer Ms Debbie Crosbie in November. She will join the business in the spring. TSB also said that customer deposits fell by 4.7% to Â£29.1bn last year, which the bank said was due to planned changes in savings products. Customer lending also decreased by 2.7% to Â£30bn. Despite customers switching away at the height of the crisis, a total of 140,000 customers opened a new account with TSB. The bank said that economic and market conditions remained uncertain for a number of reasons, including Britain's impending departure from the European Union. But it maintained that it was ""one of the most strongly capitalised banks in the UK and, with a healthy liquidity reserve, is well positioned to weather economic uncertainty or shocks"". TSB's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio - a key measure of financial strength - stands at 19.5% and is among the strongest of UK banks.

Speaking to the BBC on Friday, impressionist Rory Bremner remembered his friend as ""a kind and compassionate man"" who ""cared more for people and causes than fame and fortune"". ""He was unique in the way he delivered thoughtful, intelligent comedy,"" he continued, revealing Hardy had been ""ill for a few months"" and that ""very few people"" had known about it. This video can not be played Rory Bremner on Jeremy Hardy: ""He cared so much more for people and causes than for fame and fortune"" Comic and friend Jack Dee told the BBC Hardy ""spoke fluent comedy"", adding: ""He could take any subject and make it funny"". When asked if he could recall a moment that stood out, he said: ""I remember dropping him at the hospital at one of his earlier appointments. ""He told the staff: 'This is my friend Jack, he's on work experience for when he gets cancer'."" Born in Farnborough in Hampshire, in 1961, Hardy studied modern history and politics at the University of Southampton before embarking on his stand-up career. From the outset, he worked his socialist politics into his topical act. He made his television debut in 1986 in Now - Something Else, an early vehicle for Bremner. Hardy was a featured writer and also played the role of Jeremy the Trainee. Hardy also appeared as Corporal Perkins in an episode of the BBC comedy Blackadder Goes Forth in 1989. Seven years later, he presented an episode of Top of the Pops. This video can not be played Jeremy Hardy ""could do satire without being a smart arse"", says Jack Dee Also in 1996, Hardy teamed up with comedian Jack Dee to write Channel 4 sketch show Jack and Jeremy's Real Lives. The pair would later work together again on I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue. Hardy became well-known for his comically bad singing on the long-running radio panel game. He also fronted Jeremy Hardy Speaks to the Nation, a series of comedy lectures for BBC Radio 4, from 1993. Episodes were based around subjects as diverse as how to be a father and how to meet the challenge of the 21st Century. The show's 10th series was broadcast in 2014. Hardy often worked his socialist politics into his act And he appeared on BBC Radio 4 with his first wife, American actress and comedian Kit Hollerbach, in the sitcoms Unnatural Acts and At Home with the Hardys. They adopted a daughter, Elizabeth, in 1990. As a life-long socialist, Hardy's political views were often reflected in his work. Until 2001, Hardy wrote a column for The Guardian newspaper in which he regularly expressed his support for the Socialist Alliance. His final column for the paper,externalcriticised the news media for its ""increasingly humorous tone"". His opinions didn't always prove popular with his audience. In 2000, he was booed by members of the Just A Minute audience when he used the subject ""parasites"" to begin a rant against the royal family. In 2004,Burnley Council cancelled one of Hardy's performances,externalafter saying in an episode of his Speaks to the Nation show that members and supporters of the British National Party (BNP) should be shot. Hardy's second wife was the film-maker Katie Barlow Hardy was one of a number of names from the world of showbusiness to campaign to clear the name ofDanny McNamee,external, who was found guilty of the IRA's 1982 Hyde Park bombing, which killed four members of the Household Cavalry and seven horses. McNamee's conviction was overturned in 1998.

" Asia Bibi's former home in the village of Ittanwala, Punjab, Pakistan Warning: This article describes events that some readers may find upsetting. Asia Bibi left the home she shared with her husband and children and headed for the fields. The village of Ittanwala, some 40 miles south-east of Lahore, is surrounded by green fields and fruit orchards. It is one of the most fertile in the Punjab. Asia Bibi Like many of the women in the village, Asia worked as a farm labourer. It was June and the women were to spend the day picking berries. After working for hours under the scorching sun, the thirsty, exhausted women stopped for a break. Asia was asked to fetch some water from the nearby well. She set off, jug in hand. But on her way back she took a sip of the water before handing it over to her Muslim co-workers. They were furious. Asia is a Christian. In Pakistan, many conservative Muslims don’t like to eat or drink with people of other faiths. They believe that non-Muslims are impure. Asia’s co-workers  told her that she was “dirty” and not worthy of drinking from the same cup   as them. An argument erupted and fierce words were exchanged on both sides. The water pump from which Asia collected water Five days later, the police barged their way into Asia’s house and accused her of insulting the Prophet Muhammad. Outside was a mob, including the village cleric who had accused her of blasphemy. Asia was dragged outside. The mob brazenly began to beat her, right in front of the police. She was arrested and charged with blasphemy. During the trial Asia maintained her innocence, but in 2010 she was sentenced to death. She has spent the past nine years of her life in solitary confinement. In Pakistan, the punishment for blasphemy against Islam and its prophet is either life imprisonment, or death. But all too often the allegation is misused as a way to settle personal scores. Once someone has been accused of blasphemy, before their case has even gone to trial, they and their families come under attack. I met Ashiq, Asia’s husband, at a secret location almost a year ago. Ashiq and his children had been on the run ever since Asia’s arrest. “If a loved one is dead, the heart heals after some time. But when a mother is alive, and she gets separated from her children, the way Asia was taken away from us, the agony is endless,” Ashiq explained. Ashiq Mesih (R) and Eisham Ashiq (L), the husband and daughter of Asia Bibi Sitting on the covered veranda, Ashiq’s face was sombre as he tried to keep himself composed. “We are living in constant fear, there is always a feeling of anxiety and insecurity, that anything could happen to us. I just let the children go to school - they are not allowed to play outside, we have lost our freedom.” Despite the years of insecurity and uncertainty, Ashiq had never given up on Asia. “I have lost my freedom, my livelihood and my home, but I am not ready to give up hope. I will keep struggling for Asia’s release.” Then late last year, on 31 October, nine years after Asia’s arrest, Ashiq’s prayers were finally answered. Against the expectations of thousands of conservative Muslims, the country’s Supreme Court overturned the earlier verdict because of a lack of evidence and allowed Asia Bibi to walk free. Within hours, outraged by the landmark ruling, demonstrators took to the streets demanding one thing - that Asia Bibi be put to death. For three consecutive days protesters attempted to force their nation and government into submission. Main roads were blocked, cars and buses were set alight, toll booths ransacked and police officers attacked. Particularly in the eastern province of Punjab, many offices, businesses, and even schools were forced to close as commuting became impossible. The country watched in horror while their government seemed barely visible. Supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) block a street during a protest At first the Prime Minister Imran Khan, in a television address to the nation, issued a warning to the protesters, telling them not to “clash with the state”. But after three days of escalating chaos, the government said that in order to avoid any bloodshed they would strike a deal with those leading the revolt. Supporters of the TLP Immediately after Asia’s release, Khadim Hussain Rizvi and his religious political party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) had taken to social media advocating civil disorder and violence. They called for the judges who acquitted Asia to be killed, and encouraged mutiny within the army, declaring that the chief of the army was an apostate - that he had renounced Islam. Supporters of TLP They rallied public support from well beyond their own party, with video clips on social media prompting thousands of men from all sections of society to take to the streets. Rizvi's tweet on the day of the Supreme Court's decision Rizvi also accused the West of encouraging blasphemy against Islam and the Prophet Muhammad. In one of his tweets he said that people deliberately committed blasphemy so they could get money and be granted asylum by Western countries. Leader of Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) party, Khadim Hussain Rizvi Only a few years before, Rizvi had been working as cleric at a small local mosque. He was a government employee and a marginal figure, but even then he was renowned for his controversial sermons. While preaching, Rizvi would frequently glorify the murder of Salman Taseer. Taseer was one of two prominent politicians who were murdered for openly sympathising with Asia and publicly advocating the blasphemy laws be revised. A police official takes the thumb print of Asia Bibi (C) during a visit from Governor Salman Taseer (R) at the central jail in Sheikhupura As the governor of Punjab, Taseer had visited Asia Bibi at Sheikhupura prison in 2010. In a televised press conference, with Asia sitting veiled beside him, Taseer had appealed to the president of Pakistan to pardon her. Only a few weeks later, on a cold January day, Taseer was assassinated in broad daylight by his own security guard. In the middle of Islamabad’s busy Kohsaar market, Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri, a young police commando, shot the governor 27 times at point-blank range. After appearing in court Pakistani bodyguard Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri (L) shouts 'We are ready to sacrifice our life for the prestige of the Prophet Muhammad' Overnight Qadri became a hero to millions. Handing himself over to the authorities, Qadri told the police he didn’t have any regrets over killing Taseer - it was his religious duty. “The punishment of a blasphemer is death,” he told the police officials. At his trial, which was held only few days later, rushed through because of security concerns, Qadri was cheered on by hundreds of fans and showered with rose petals. He was sentenced to death, and executed in 2016. Supporters gather around an ambulance carrying the body of Mumtaz Qadri to his funeral Rizvi was eventually sacked from his job as a cleric over sermons which praised Qadri as a martyr. He turned to politics and founded the TLP. Within months of establishing the party, Rizvi’s activists blocked a main highway, paralysing the capital city Islamabad for 20 days. Rizvi accused the government of blasphemy after a reference to the finality of the Prophet Muhammad was left out of a revised version of the electoral oath. Then in last year’s election, declaring themselves defenders of Muhammad’s honour, this tiny populist party attracted more than two million votes. Throughout the campaign, their posters and banners bore photographs of Qadri, idolised as a martyr to the cause. Khadim Hussain Rizvi (C) In October, after three days of demonstrations across Pakistan spearheaded by the TLP, the government caved in.  They agreed not to oppose a court petition to reverse Asia’s release, and barred her from leaving the country. The petition was filed, the mob dispersed, and Asia was freed from prison, but was taken into protective custody. It was to take three months for Asia to finally get her freedom. There was disorder over a blasphemy row in the eastern city of Lahore in 2013 For the past 30 years blasphemy against the Prophet Muhammad has been punishable by death in Pakistan. But no-one has been executed. There have been 1,549 known cases of the most serious charges - either blasphemy against Muhammad or desecration of the Koran - according to Pakistan’s Centre for Social Justice. In those cases, 75 accused people have been murdered before their trials. Many were killed in police custody, or by mobs.

One such incident took place almost 30 miles south of the city of Lahore, in the small town of Kot Radha Kishan, named after two Hindu gods. All around are lush flat green fields. But every half a mile or so in every direction, are the tall smoking chimneys of brick kilns. By each one, hundreds of bricks are stacked up in rows. It was in one of these kilns that Shahzad and Shama Maseeh, a Christian couple accused of blasphemy, were burned alive by a mob in 2014. Local journalist Rana Khalid recalls the events that led up to the killings. The room where Shahzad and Shama took shelter He points towards a small structure close to the brick kiln. “The couple were locked up in this room so they could be protected from the mob,” he says. Led by a local cleric, the mob were so angry that several members climbed on top of the roof. They broke their way in through the ceiling and dragged the couple out. “They were brutally beaten by clubs and bricks and dragged by the angry men of the village to the brick kiln and were thrown inside.” Shama was four months pregnant. The mob believed that 24-hours earlier, Shahzad and Shama had burned several pages of the Koran, along with some rubbish. Shahzad’s family still deny this, saying that the couple were burning some of his father’s old documents. For the murder of  Shama and Shahzad, five people, including the local cleric, were sentenced to death while eight others were given two years in prison for inciting violence.

It’s not only Christians who bear the brunt of the country’s controversial law.  It has also been used to persecute Pakistan’s Ahmadi Muslims. The community is regarded by the government as a non-Muslim religious minority. By law, Ahmadis cannot call their places of worship mosques or recite from the Koran or display their faith in public in any way. Aslam Jameel (not his real name), an Ahmadi farmer, was working in his wheat fields in the south of Punjab in 2009, when he was approached by a couple of local villagers. They told him he needed to run. Aslam had been accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad by a local imam and a mob was after him. “The cleric alleged that, God forbid, I prompted four Ahmadi boys to write the prophet’s name in a toilet,” says Aslam, his voice choked with tears. Aslam Jameel Aslam waited until after dark before sneaking out of his back door and making a run for it.  He didn't get far before realising that running away would probably land him in even more trouble. Where would he even go? The next morning, he handed himself in at a local police station. It took almost two years for his case to go to trial, and he spent six months in prison. “The judge was under immense pressure,” says Aslam, his face flushed. “The courtroom was full of clerics, but he [the judge] showed great courage.” Aslam’s case was dismissed because of a lack of evidence. But after returning home to find his house looted and his livestock stolen, he knew he had to leave the country. He sought asylum in Canada. “My family was threatened and harassed, my life and livelihood ruined, we had to abandon the village to save our lives.” For those put on trial and found guilty of blasphemy, the stigma follows them even from the courtroom, to behind bars. Shakeel Wajid (not his real name), another Ahmadi, says that mobs gather during trials. “The judges of the lower courts are under more pressure [than the higher courts] from religious extremists, who gather in large numbers during the hearings,” Shakeel explains. “The judges have poor security and have to look out for their own lives as well.” After being found guilty of blasphemy, Shakeel spent two years in three different high security prisons in Punjab. Shakeel Wajid He describes how blasphemy prisoners are kept in separate, high-security barracks, often with other prisoners who are mentally ill. Most of the time they are kept locked in their cells and for their own safety, are banned from eating with the other inmates in case someone attempts to poison them. “One of my fellow prisoners in Rawalpindi was a university professor. A student didn’t agree with his interpretation of ‘heaven’ and ‘hell’ and lodged a blasphemy complaint against him.” Shakeel believes that he was exceptionally lucky that he was able to get his freedom back. But more than freedom, he was desperate to get his name cleared of the allegation. “The label of blasphemer is worse than the fear of death. It’s such a serious accusation that I didn’t want to die with it. I wanted my name to be cleared so my family could survive with dignity in the society.” Pakistan’s blasphemy laws became more severe in the 1980s, against a backdrop of increasing polarisation in the country. In 1979, when Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviet Union and the US started its covert operations in the country to help Islamist fighters, Pakistan was America’s frontline ally. There were significant economic gains from Pakistan’s participation in the Afghan jihad, but it also boosted religious fanaticism. During the next decade, the political and social clout of radical groups increased dramatically. Pakistani President Zia ul-Haq, 1987 They became more visible and vocal. The state openly promoted the ultra-conservative Wahhabi form of Islam, under the leadership of General Zia ul-Haq. Laws were enacted and amended to enforce Sharia and to make Pakistan a “truly Islamic” nation. Against this background, the blasphemy laws were changed by parliament in 1986. Originally the law was codified by the British in 1860. The purpose was to contain religious strife between Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Sikhs across British-ruled India. It protected places of worship and sacred objects and made it a crime to disturb religious assemblies, to trespass on burial sites, and to deliberately insult religious beliefs of any person, punishable by up to ten years in prison. In 1927, during a time of political tension and antagonism between different communities, the law was tightened. But the blasphemy laws didn’t favour any specific religion until 1986 when Pakistan’s parliament introduced new amendments and inserted a clause which made the use of derogatory remarks against the Prophet Muhammad a crime punishable by death, or life imprisonment. The clause was 295-C and only one politician opposed it. His name was Muhammad Hamza. Muhammad Hamza Now in his 90s, Hamza describes the day when the measure was being debated at the National Assembly. During his speech in 1986, Hamza argued that the Islamic texts being cited by those advocating for the death penalty needed to be comprehensively reviewed by religious scholars before any change in the law could be passed. He claimed parliament was being irresponsible by avoiding a deeper debate on the issue. “I have a firm opinion,” says Hamza, “you cannot run the country on selective justice. What is the purpose of the law if it’s destructive for the society? “Our people lack depth, they are unreasonably emotional about religion, so I knew that the law would be misused - that’s why I opposed it.” Hamza’s was the only voice of opposition in the parliament that day - 295-C was passed immediately. Hamza still lives in his old constituency, the Punjabi city of Gojra. In 2009, the same year Asia was arrested, Gojra made international headlines after a series of attacks targeted the city’s biggest Christian settlement. A woman walks with her child in Gojra Sparked by rumours that pages of the Koran had been desecrated, an Islamist mob had attacked and looted several houses before setting them alight. Eight Christians were burned alive. In a solemn, low voice, Hamza recounts the attacks. “It was a sad day. The allegation was completely unfounded, but the mob was charged. They didn’t pay heed to what the authorities were trying to tell them and then the situation got out of control.” Two Pakistani Christians stand in their burnt-out house in Gojra, 2009 Since the introduction of the death penalty the total number of people accused of blasphemy has increased massively, according to Pakistan’s Centre for Social Justice. “I feel dejected, the way this law is being misused against vulnerable people, religion has turned into a powerful political tool, it’s not a blessing anymore, and it has become a curse unfortunately,” Hamza says. Critics of the law believe the violence against those accused of blasphemy is down to a misinterpretation of the holy texts at a grassroots level. In Pakistan, thousands of children are sent to madrassas or Islamic boarding schools - a free alternative to the often underfunded public alternative. Many madrassas teach a deeply conservative interpretation of Islam, including a constant rhetoric around blasphemy. So deep-rooted is the shame of blasphemy in the psyche of some followers, they are even willing to self-harm. At 16, Muhammad Anwar was a typical teenager. Living in a small village in the Okara district, like other boys of his age, he often used to help his father on the farm. As is common in many rural parts of Pakistan with low levels of literacy, the teenager and his family would look to their local imam as the final authority on all religious matters. Anwar's local mosque In January, 2016, he was attending a gathering at his local mosque. The cleric leading the proceedings, in an attempt to whip the crowd up into a religious fervour, posed a question: “Who among you is a follower of Muhammad?” While the boy was dozing off,  the rest of the crowd raised their hands. The cleric called to the crowd again: “Who among you doesn’t believe in the teachings of Muhammad?” The teenager, half asleep, unwittingly raised his hand. Inside Anwar's mosque The room fell silent, until finally the cleric publicly shamed the boy, accusing him of dishonouring the Prophet. The teenager was deeply disturbed. After everyone else had gone home, he stayed behind at the mosque, searching for solace. “I wanted to prove my love for Muhammad,” he said sincerely. As an act of adoration for his faith, the teenager decided his best course of action was to cut off his own hand. Placing his right hand in a grass-cutting machine he severed it at the wrist in a single chop. The grass-cutting machine “There was no question of pain, I did it for the love of my prophet, may peace be upon him.” He placed his severed hand on a tray, covered it with a white cloth, and returned to the mosque seeking absolution from the cleric. Over the next few days, people from nearby villages and towns came to pay their respects to Muhammad Anwar, praising him for his love of the Prophet. Two years on, he now spends most of his time reading the Koran at a local madrassa. But he maintains, he has no regrets. “I don’t care about what people say, it’s between me and my prophet. You cannot understand it.” Image: Muhammad Anwar Asia Bibi The Lahore High Court dwarfs the adjacent buildings along the city’s historic Mall Road. With its red bricks and high round white domes, it’s one of the many structures in the city that remind people of its colonial past. Surrounding the High Court, narrow alleyways accommodate many lawyers’ chambers, often in shabby, cramped offices. In a small plaza just behind the High Court, above a busy teashop, Ghulam Mustafa Chaudhry has his chambers. Chaudhry is the president of an anti-blasphemy lawyers’ alliance called Khatam-e-Nabuwat, which roughly translates as “finality of the prophet”. They offer free legal advice for any Muslim filing a case of blasphemy. Lawyer Ghulam Mustafa Chaudhry (C) The alliance has around 800 volunteer lawyers working all over the country. “Whenever we notice any such incident [of blasphemy] anywhere in the country, we reach out to the complainants and offer them free of charge legal assistance,” explains Chaudhry. “We do this to please Allah and to protect the honour of the Prophet Muhammad - there is no material motivation.” Chaudhry founded the forum almost 18 years ago, after he started practising as a lawyer. Now in his 50s, he says he is even more driven in his mission. “It’s very unfortunate - blasphemy has become rampant. There are 40 blasphemy cases under trial in Lahore city alone. “People who commit blasphemy are glorified like heroes, this is sad.” He is unhappy at how the Asia Bibi case has played out. “She has insulted the prophet, but she has become a hero for the West.” Chaudhry (L) representing a petitioner (R) against Asia Bibi at Lahore's Supreme Court, 2015 Chaudhry was also the defence lawyer of Mumtaz Qadri, the former bodyguard turned assassin of the governor Salman Taseer. He says that the blasphemy law is a “blessing” and is actually a “deterrent” to mob justice. “Mumtaz Qadri approached the police to lodge a [blasphemy] complaint against the former governor, but his complaint was not entertained”. “He would not have been forced to take gun in his hands, if the law would have taken its course” he added. In Asia’s case, the law did take its course, to the very highest court in the land, and despite the ruling that there wasn't enough evidence to convict her, violent protests still erupted. Asia Bibi's lawyer Saif-ul-Mulook (C) speaks to the media after the Supreme Court rejected the review appeal against Asia,29 January 2019 In its landmark decision on 31 October, the judges wrote: “It is ironical that in the Arabic language the appellant’s name Asia means ‘sinful’, but in the circumstances of the present case she appears to be a person, in the words of Shakespeare’s King Lear, ‘more sinned against than sinning’.” Still, the government agreed there could be a review of the Supreme Court’s judgment on Asia’s acquittal. They wanted to disperse the protesters, but later cracked down on Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan. Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the firebrand leader of the TLP was also taken into custody by the police. Asia’s family was kept at a secret location for almost three more months; she had been acquitted by the court, but was not free. Asia's husband Ashiq Masih (L) sits with daughters Esham (R) and Esha (C) Finally the Supreme Court took up the review petition on 29 January. The proceedings lasted for a few hours. Ghulam Mustafa Chaudhry represented Qari Salim, the complainant in Bibi’s case. He failed to pinpoint any error in the verdict of Asia’s acquittal. The court rejected the petition and upheld its earlier decision to release Asia. The chief justice said there were inconsistencies in witnesses’ statements against Asia. “How could we hang someone on a false witness statement?” Qari Salim (L) and his lawyer Ghulam Mustafa Chaudhry (R) speak to the media outside the Supreme Court in Islamabad In retrospect, it’s ironic how a case based on false statements ripped the social fabric of the country for eight years. But the state finally showed its muscle and the rule of law prevailed. The message was clear - that mobs cannot dictate and rule Pakistan. It also made clear that misuse of blasphemy laws will not be allowed in the country anymore. It was a watershed moment for Pakistan. But the law is still there, and still nobody dares talk about amending or repealing it. The murders of Salman Taseer and minority ministerShahbaz Bhattistill haunt the psyche of the nation.

"US special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun revealed the pledge in a Stanford University speech North Korea has pledged to destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities, according to the US special envoy for the country, Stephen Biegun. He said the promise had been made to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when he visited North Korea in October. However Pyongyang has not confirmed making any such pledge. Mr Biegun also said that North Korea must provide a complete list of its nuclear assets before any deal can be reached. Experts believe the North has more than one undeclared nuclear fuel enrichment site aside from the known facility at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, and question how the destruction of all facilities could be fully verified. President Donald Trump had earlier claimed ""tremendous progress"" in talks between the countries. Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, the president said he would soon announce the date and location of a planned second summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Second Trump-Kim meeting 'within weeks' When Trump met Kim: What happened next? The pair met in Singapore last year, the first meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, and signed an optimistic but vague declaration of their commitment to denuclearisation. Since then little progress has been made. Stephen Biegun has been Washington's top envoy to North Korea for five months buthe gave a detailed public accounting of his approach for the first time in a speech at Stanford University in California,external. Mr Biegun said President Trump was ""ready to end this war"". ""We're not going to invade North Korea. We are not seeking to topple the regime,"" he said. Mr Biegun - who will travel to South Korea on Sunday before meeting North Korean officials - also said Washington was willing to discuss a range of trust-building measures with Pyongyang. He said Kim Jong-un had committed, in his talks with Mr Pompeo, to ""the dismantlement and destruction"" of all its plutonium and uranium facilities, which provide the material for nuclear weapons. But he reiterated that the US would not lift sanctions until denuclearisation was complete, demanding ""a complete understanding of the full extent of the North Korean WMD [weapons of mass destruction] and missile programmes through a comprehensive declaration"". Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? North Korea's breakdown of communication North Korea has long refused to give a full account of its nuclear capacity, and the means by which any surrendering or dismantling of nuclear arms will be verified has always been a sticking point in negotiations. The country has one known nuclear fuel production facility at Yongbyon, which has been the source of plutonium for its nuclear weapons programme. Uranium is also enriched there, according to experts. However there is believed to be at least one other undeclared facility to enrich nuclear fuel in North Korea. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme US intelligence officials believe Pyongyang has stepped up the enrichment of uranium,externaleven while it continues talks with Washington, according to reports. So far Kim Jong-un has committed to allowing experts to verify the destruction of two sites - the Tongchang-ri missile engine testing site andthe Punggye-ri nuclear test site. But Mr Biegun admitted that these facilities are ""not critical parts of the current North Korean missile or nuclear programmes"". North Korea carried out a series of long-range missile tests in 2017 He said the US position remained that it would not lift sanctions ""until denuclearisation is complete"", but indicated it could provide assistance in other ways, saying: ""We did not say we will not do anything until you do everything."" He also admitted that North Korea and the US did not have a shared definition of what denuclearisation actually meant. ""We do not have a specific and agreed definition of what final, fully verified denuclearisation or comprehensive, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation - whatever your preferred term of art - is,"" he said. He also said there had been no discussion with North Korea on whether the 28,500 US military personnel stationed in South Korea could be withdrawn as a concessional move. Mr Biegun said the US had ""contingencies"" in place if the diplomatic process collapsed. North Korea has always said its nuclear programme is essential to its survival and that it will never unilaterally give it up unless it no longer faces a nuclear threat from the US. Kim Jong-un, left, has met South Korea's Moon Jae-in several times Despite positive noises from the White House, there are still sceptics on the Korean peninsula and in the US. US intelligence chiefs presentedthe annual Worldwide Threat Assessment report,externalto the US Senate earlier this week, which assessed thatNorth Korea is ""unlikely to give up"" its weapons programme. The report also said Iran was not developing nuclear weapons, as the Trump administration has said, prompting a tweet from the president telling the intelligence heads to ""go back to school"". A further tweet on Thursday said the Senate report had been ""mischaracterised by the media"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Delays are hitting road and rail travellers in southern England on their way home for the weekend. Parts of Hampshire near Basingstoke are proving a particular trouble spot. Ross Carradice, who was travelling from Southampton, tells the BBC he's been stranded on a train after a tree fell on the line - and then another fell and hit his train. ""Weâve been here an hour already and the driver says weâll
be here at least another hour,"" he says. ""The driver and the train manager have been outside trying
to remove the tree in front of us."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There was clearly a Doctor Who fan having fun in Wiltshire on Friday. This snow Dalek was spotted in the market town of Marlborough. Dr Who has filmed in the town in the past, according to BBC colleagues from the area. A Dalek was assembled in Marlborough, Wiltshire Children go sledging as they enjoy a day off school due to the weather in Poundbury in Dorset. As the snow continues to fall across much of the UK, here is our picture gallery of some of the most striking images that have been taken. As snow falls on large parts of the UK, we look at some of the most striking wintry images. There are severe delays on parts of the M3 in Hampshire. The motorway is blocked in both directions due to a jackknifed lorry and snow between M3 (Winchester Services) and Junction 5
A287 (Hook). There are three jackknifed lorries around Junction 6 and Junction 7. The M3
is virtually impassable because of the snow and lorries struggling on the
inclines. Police warn not to attempt travelling around the Basingstoke area
unless absolutely necessary. Meanwhile, the M3 in Surrey is now cleared, with all lanes open, after a broken-down vehicle was removed on the M3 southbound at Junction 2 of the M25. The Corridor shopping centre in Bath was closed on Friday after two separate roof collapses due to snow. Large blocks of stone were pulled from the parapets above its glass roof by a pigeon net weighted down with snow, a local shopkeeper said. There were two separate incidents, which he described as ""very serious - they could easily have caused a fatality if they had hit someone"". The first was on Friday morning when members of the public were in the centre. A second collapse happened at around 3.30pm, the witness said. But Friday's snow meant that not many shoppers were around and no-one was hurt. Bath Rugby says that ""despite huge efforts from our grounds team"" it hasn't been able to clear the pitch of snow in time for tomorrow's scheduled match with Gloucester without damaging the playing surface. The team says it hopes to reschedule the match for Sunday at 14:30 GMT, but that it is ""most likely"" to be delayed until Monday at 19:45. A final decision on the timing is due to be made on Saturday at 10:00. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

They originate from climates that can be extreme, so they are very well adapted to cold spells like this, though they still have cosy, warm enclosures to live in.

Among the stories that have emerged from the snow chaos is that of mum Roxanne Campbell, who went into premature labour while stranded on the A30 in Bodmin, in Cornwall, on Thursday. Pregnant Roxanne and husband Alex went into Asda as ""it was the nearest place where it was warm"" - but soon the contractions were coming fast. Alex said when the contractions started he was ""panicking a bit"". Store manager Lee Coshall said: ""The contractions were getting closer together, I brought them down into the office. ""We got to the point where they were coming every minute and a half. So that's when we asked her to lay down and have a look and then she started breaching. ""It got to the point the baby was almost here and thankfully the paramedics did turn up."" The couple were taken to hospital and baby Amelia was born at Treliske Hospital at 20:21, weighing 5lb 5oz.

"Michy Batshuayi, Miguel Almiron, Peter Crouch and Youri Tielemans all completed Premier League moves on deadline day Premier League January spending fell for the first time since 2012 with a quiet deadline day capping off a relatively low-spending window. Deadline-day and January spending were less than half of last year's totals, with 12 deals on 31 January totalling Â£50m - bringing the month's spending to Â£180m, according to figures from the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. January 2018 saw Â£430m spent by Premier League clubs, with Â£150m on deadline day alone. However, the Premier League was still the highest-spending league in European football in the most recent window, outstripping Italy's Serie A by around Â£140m. The biggest deal on transfer deadline sawNewcastle break their record to sign Â£20m Paraguayan playmaker Miguel Almironfrom MLS side Atlanta United - as well as signing Monaco defender Antonio Barreca on loan. Wolves signed Atletico Madrid full-back Jonny Castro Otto for Â£15m after a successful loan spell. The next highest fee was Â£7m as Ante Palaversa moved to Manchester City but immediately returned to Hajduk Split on loan. Leicester signed Monaco midfielder Youri Tielemans on loan - sending Adrien Silva the other way. Fulham confirmed thesigning of Liverpool winger Lazar Markovicon a short-term deal 90 minutes after the deadline passed, having signed Hoffenheim midfielder Havard Nordtveit on loan earlier in the day. Crystal Palace signed Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayion loan, revealing the news after midnight. Peter Crouch will have the chance to add to his 108 Premier League goals after joining Burnley from Stoke, with Sam Vokes going the other way. Cardiff spent Â£4m on Reading midfielder Leandro Bacuna. The only other Premier League signings sawBrighton recruit two youngstersand send them back to their clubs on loan. League One Sunderland have agreed a Â£4m deal with Wigan for striker Will Grigg - a move which would be in the country's 10 most expensive signings of the window if it is confirmed on 1 February. English youngsters Reece Oxford (West Ham to Augsburg) and Emile Smith-Rowe (Arsenal to RB Leipzig) completed loan moves to the Bundesliga. Scottish champions Celtic signed Borussia Dortmund right-back Jeremy Toljan on loan - as well as Ukrainian winger Maryan Shved and American defenders Manny Perez and Andrew Gutman, but have loaned the three youngsters back out. Football Daily podcast: Crouch, Batshuayi and Tielemans - Deadline Day Special Full list of completed deals here Top Premier League signings of the window. In addition, Argentine striker Emiliano Sala joined Cardiff from Nantes for Â£15m. The 28-year-old was on board a light aircraft that disappeared over the Channel Islands on 21 January. Watford signed one player for their under-23s all month, while Brighton brought in three players - but loaned them all out to their previous clubs. Manchester City's only signing - Ante Palaversa - also immediately left on loan. Burnley and Leicester made their only signings of the month on deadline day. Tottenham will go the entire 2018-19 season without signing anyone after a second successive window without addition to their squad. Liverpool, Manchester United, Everton and Southampton were the other sides not to make a signing during January. Deloitte say the reduction is because of: reduced activity from the 'big six' clubs a perceived lack of value in the transfer market the strongest ever financial position of Premier League clubs, reducing the need to sell their best talent in order to ensure financial stability the global value of Premier League broadcast rights, with the 2019-20 to 2021-22 cycle being only slightly higher than the previous cycle, thereby reducing clubs' desire to spend significantly in the transfer market. The 2018-19 season has seen the second-highest spend in Premier League history Across the summer and January transfer windows combined, Premier League clubs spent an estimated Â£1.4bn. That figure is the second highest for an entire season following record spend of Â£1.9 billion in 2017-18. The Premier League remains the highest importer of overseas talent, with 72% of the players bought by clubs in 2018-19 coming from abroad. Arsenal failed with bids to sign Inter Milan winger Ivan Perisic, Dalian Yifang wide man Yannick Carrasco and Paris St-Germain midfielder Christopher Nkunku. Real Betis and Schalke expressed interest in signing Tottenham striker Vincent Janssen but neither move materialised. Everton rejected an offer of Â£26.2m from Paris St-Germain for midfielder Idrissa Gueye in the closing stages of the transfer window. Leeds' prospective loan deal for Swansea winger Daniel James - which could have become permanent for Â£8.5m - fell through at the last moment. Former England internationals Danny Drinkwater and Gary Cahill, who reportedly turned down Juventus, Monaco and Fulham, stayed at Chelsea despite limited prospects of getting in the team. England Under-17 World Cup winner Callum Hudson-Odoi also remained at Stamford Bridge despite putting in a transfer request and being the subject of a Â£35m bid from Bayern Munich. West Ham's proposed Â£45m signing of Celta Vigo striker Maxi Gomez never happened, while Che Adams stayed at Birmingham despite reported interest from Burnley and Southampton. In England the deadline was at 23:00 GMT on Thursday - although clubs were allowed to complete deals later as long as they completed a deal sheet in time - and in Scotland it was midnight. Spain, Germany, Italy, France and the Netherlands also had 31 January deadlines. Portugal (2 February), Russia (22 February) and China (28 February) are among nations who can still sign players. Chelsea completed the biggest signing with the acquisition of winger Christian Pulisicfrom Borussia Dortmund for Â£58m,but they loaned the USA international back to the Bundesliga leaders until the end of the season. The Blues also brought in Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuainon loan from Juventusfor the remainder of the campaign - with the option to buy him outright for 36m euros (Â£31.4m) this summer. Bournemouth were one of the busiest clubs, completing three deals. Striker Dominic Solanke came infrom Liverpool for Â£19m,as did right-back Nathaniel Clyneon loan,while Wales defender Chris Mepham joined from Championship sideBrentford for Â£12m.

The newborn was discovered in East Ham, east London, when a woman walking her dog heard the baby crying in a play area off Roman Road at 22:15 GMT. The child was taken to hospital and is said to be in a stable condition. Detectives say they are growing ""increasingly concerned"" for the mother, who may be ""in need of urgent medical attention"". Hospital staff have been calling the baby Roman after the road where she was found.

"More people over the age of 75 should be taking statins, scientists have said, following a review of research. There had been a lack of evidence about how much the cholesterol-lowering drugs benefit this age group. But the review found they cut the risk of major cardiovascular disease in all ages studied, including the over-75s. Researchers said thousands of lives could be saved each year if more than the estimated third of UK over-75s who do take statins, were given them. They also said it could improve quality of life for many people. Cardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people in the UK each year, with two-thirds of these occurring in people over the age of 75. Statins reduce the build-up of fatty plaques that lead to blockages in blood vessels, though reported side effects and the extent of how often they are prescribed has attracted controversy. Reality Check: Who should take statins? Statins benefits 'underestimated' Q&A: Statins The review, which looked at 28 randomised controlled trials - often called the ""gold standard"" of studies - involving nearly 190,000 patients, found statins lowered the risk of major cardiovascular disease in the ages studied, from under-55s to over-75s. There were similar reductions in risk for stroke and for coronary stenting or bypass surgery. Authors of the paper said there had until now been an ""evidence gap"" around how effective the drugs are for the elderly. They estimate that about a third of the 5.5 million people in the UK over 75 take a statin,when the ""vast majority"" of these would meet the medicine regulator's guidelines,externalfor being prescribed the drug. Prof Colin Baigent, one of the authors of the paper, said: ""One of the issues we have is that very often doctors are unwilling to consider statin therapy for elderly people simply because they're old, and that, I think, is an attitude that is preventing us from making use of the tools we have available to us."" Researchers said statins may help people avoid disability caused by cardiovascular disease The benefits were strongest in people who have already had vascular disease. There wasn't enough data in people over the age of 75 who haven't had it to show a benefit. Experts have called for more data to guide prescription for these people. However, the authors said even a smaller reduction in risk was significant because the elderly have a higher baseline risk for cardiovascular disease in the first place. The more people reduced their low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol, the more the risk of cardiovascular disease was lowered, the study found. A 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol lowered the risk of major vascular events by about a fifth and a major coronary event by a quarter, when results from all age groups were combined. To put this into perspective, about 2.5% of 63-year-olds with no history of vascular disease would be expected to have their first major vascular event per year, compared with 4% of 78-year-olds. Reducing those risks by a fifth would prevent first major vascular events from occurring each year in 50 people aged 63 and 80 people aged 78 per 10,000 people treated. Prof Baigent said there was an argument for giving statins to people over the age of 75 who have a ""normal"" level of LDL cholesterol. He said: ""In many circumstances, the person may be very healthy, they may be able to avoid having a stroke or having a heart attack simply by taking a cheap and safe tablet every day. ""That may be a choice they're willing to take. At the moment I feel we're not taking the opportunity to offer that."" There has been controversy about statin side effects and how often they are prescribed, especially in otherwise healthy people. Common side effects,externalinclude muscle pain, increased risk of type 2 diabetes and digestive problems. It is possible to lower cholesterol levels without drugs by making lifestyle changes, such as by cutting down on saturated fat and eating more fruit, vegetables and fibre. Prof Baigent said side effects were ""massively outweighed, both in middle age and the elderly, by the benefits of statin therapy that we already know about"". And he also said he was not calling for people to pick statins over exercise and lifestyle changes. ""I think it's not an either/or,"" he added. The Royal College of GPs welcomed the research and said it was ""particularly reassuring"" to see evidence of the benefit of statins in over-75s. Prof Martin Marshall, vice-chairman of the college, said some patients would not want to be on long-term medication. ""But GPs are highly trained to prescribe and will only recommend the drugs if they think they will genuinely help the person sitting in front of them, based on their individual circumstances - and after a frank conversation about the potential risks and benefits.""

"The interview came after Mr Trump contacted the New York Times' publisher US President Donald Trump has dismissed the federal investigation into alleged Russian collusion in the 2016 election and talks about a proposed border wall. His lawyers had been reassured he was not a target in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, he said. Talks in Congress about wall funding - the issue behind the recent government shutdown - were a ""waste of time"". Mr Trump was interviewed by the New York Times, a paper he repeatedly described as ""failing"" in the past. The paper's interview with Mr Trump,externalcame after he contacted its publisher, AG Sulzberger. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Sulzberger asked the president to stop his attacks on the medialast year, saying they could ""lead to violence"" against journalists. The interview with Mr Trump covered a wide range of topics: ""I'll continue to build the wall, and we'll get the wall finished,"" the president said, dismissing the talks between congressional Republicans and Democrats over the impasse and implying he could declare a national emergency to ensure the barrier is built. Tapping into emergency presidential powers could enable Mr Trump to bypass Congress and access the money and resources needed to complete the project. Critics have said the situation at the border does not constitute a true emergency and invoking one would be an abuse of power. Mr Trump has sought $5.7 billion (Â£4.4bn) for a wall on the southern border. The Democrats refuse to provide it, arguing it is immoral and ineffective. The divide led tothe longest government shutdown in US history, which will resume on 15 February if no budget can be agreed. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall Mr Trump slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the interview over the border wall. ""I've actually always gotten along with her, but now I don't think I will any more,"" he said. ""I think she's doing a tremendous disservice to the country."" Ms Pelosi told reporters on Thursday there would be no money for a wall in planned border security legislation. Speaking to two New York Times reporters in the Oval Office, the president said he had received assurances from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. ""Rod told me I'm not a target of the investigation,"" Mr Trump said. He then suggested that he may not have spoken to him in person, adding: ""The lawyers ask him. They say: 'He's not a target of the investigation'."" It is not clear when Mr Rosenstein made the comments attributed to him by Mr Trump. Mr Rosenstein oversaw Mr Mueller's investigation until last November, whenthe president transferred control to acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker. Mr Rosenstein and Mr Mueller have not said whether Mr Trump is a target in the investigation. Some reports have suggested that the term ""target"" would not be used for Mr Trump because sitting presidents are immune from prosecution. Mr Mueller's investigation is still ongoing and it is unclear when he will submit his findings to the attorney general. Rod Rosenstein previously oversaw Robert Mueller's investigation The president also insisted he ""never did"" speak to his long-time associate Roger Stone about stolen Democratic emails published by Wikileaks in 2016. Mr Stone has been charged with seven counts in the Mueller inquiry related to the emails - charges he denies. Defiant Trump ally rejects Russia charges Stone - a political agitator and Nixon fan President Trump did however attack the FBI raid on Mr Stone's home, calling it ""a very sad thing for this country"". ""I like Roger, he's a character,"" Mr Trump said. The president said his lawyer Rudy Giuliani had been ""wrong"" to say that talks over a project to construct a Trump building in Moscow had continued up to the 2016 US election. Mr Giuliani had already rowed back on the comments, saying that he had been mistaken. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress at least three times about the project - including telling Congress that the project was dissolved in January 2016. In fact, negotiations continued through June 2016, when Mr Trump was already the Republican presidential nominee. Last monthMr Mueller's office disputed a claim in a Buzzfeed report that said Mr Trump had told Cohen to lie to Congressabout when the Moscow project had ended. The Buzzfeed report also said Mr Trump had allegedly encouraged Cohen to plan a trip to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin during the election campaign. Trump's tower in Moscow that never was Mr Trump told the New York Times his last conversation about the project had been in ""early to middle"" 2016. He said Cohen might have been involved with the project ""a little bit longer than that"". ""I was running for president; I was doing really well. The last thing I cared about was building a building,"" he added. ""I love this job,"" Mr Trump insisted, dismissing talk he might not run for re-election in 2020. He did however tell the paper he had lost ""massive amounts of money"" working as president. He also spoke of Democratic candidates in next year's vote. Which Democrats are running in 2020? The US state looking to take down Trump California Senator Kamala Harris has had ""the best opening so far"", he said.She announced her plan to run for president last month. But another possible candidate, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, had been ""hurt badly"" by Mr Trump's mockery of her claims to Native American heritage, he said. Last year Mr Trump described her as a ""fake Pocahontas""and challenged her to take a DNA test. She did and the subsequent DNA report concluded that ""the vast majority"" of Ms Warren's ancestry was European, but ""the results strongly"" supported a Native American ancestor. ""I may be wrong, but I think that was a big part of her credibility and now all of a sudden it's gone,"" Mr Trump told the New York Times.

"US special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun revealed the pledge in a Stanford University speech North Korea has pledged to destroy all its nuclear material enrichment facilities, according to the US special envoy for the country, Stephen Biegun. He said the promise had been made to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo when he visited North Korea in October. However Pyongyang has not confirmed making any such pledge. Mr Biegun also said that North Korea must provide a complete list of its nuclear assets before any deal can be reached. Experts believe the North has more than one undeclared nuclear fuel enrichment site aside from the known facility at Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, and question how the destruction of all facilities could be fully verified. President Donald Trump had earlier claimed ""tremendous progress"" in talks between the countries. Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, the president said he would soon announce the date and location of a planned second summit with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Second Trump-Kim meeting 'within weeks' When Trump met Kim: What happened next? The pair met in Singapore last year, the first meeting between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, and signed an optimistic but vague declaration of their commitment to denuclearisation. Since then little progress has been made. Stephen Biegun has been Washington's top envoy to North Korea for five months buthe gave a detailed public accounting of his approach for the first time in a speech at Stanford University in California,external. Mr Biegun said President Trump was ""ready to end this war"". ""We're not going to invade North Korea. We are not seeking to topple the regime,"" he said. Mr Biegun - who will travel to South Korea on Sunday before meeting North Korean officials - also said Washington was willing to discuss a range of trust-building measures with Pyongyang. He said Kim Jong-un had committed, in his talks with Mr Pompeo, to ""the dismantlement and destruction"" of all its plutonium and uranium facilities, which provide the material for nuclear weapons. But he reiterated that the US would not lift sanctions until denuclearisation was complete, demanding ""a complete understanding of the full extent of the North Korean WMD [weapons of mass destruction] and missile programmes through a comprehensive declaration"". Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? North Korea's breakdown of communication North Korea has long refused to give a full account of its nuclear capacity, and the means by which any surrendering or dismantling of nuclear arms will be verified has always been a sticking point in negotiations. The country has one known nuclear fuel production facility at Yongbyon, which has been the source of plutonium for its nuclear weapons programme. Uranium is also enriched there, according to experts. However there is believed to be at least one other undeclared facility to enrich nuclear fuel in North Korea. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme US intelligence officials believe Pyongyang has stepped up the enrichment of uranium,externaleven while it continues talks with Washington, according to reports. So far Kim Jong-un has committed to allowing experts to verify the destruction of two sites - the Tongchang-ri missile engine testing site andthe Punggye-ri nuclear test site. But Mr Biegun admitted that these facilities are ""not critical parts of the current North Korean missile or nuclear programmes"". North Korea carried out a series of long-range missile tests in 2017 He said the US position remained that it would not lift sanctions ""until denuclearisation is complete"", but indicated it could provide assistance in other ways, saying: ""We did not say we will not do anything until you do everything."" He also admitted that North Korea and the US did not have a shared definition of what denuclearisation actually meant. ""We do not have a specific and agreed definition of what final, fully verified denuclearisation or comprehensive, verifiable, irreversible denuclearisation - whatever your preferred term of art - is,"" he said. He also said there had been no discussion with North Korea on whether the 28,500 US military personnel stationed in South Korea could be withdrawn as a concessional move. Mr Biegun said the US had ""contingencies"" in place if the diplomatic process collapsed. North Korea has always said its nuclear programme is essential to its survival and that it will never unilaterally give it up unless it no longer faces a nuclear threat from the US. Kim Jong-un, left, has met South Korea's Moon Jae-in several times Despite positive noises from the White House, there are still sceptics on the Korean peninsula and in the US. US intelligence chiefs presentedthe annual Worldwide Threat Assessment report,externalto the US Senate earlier this week, which assessed thatNorth Korea is ""unlikely to give up"" its weapons programme. The report also said Iran was not developing nuclear weapons, as the Trump administration has said, prompting a tweet from the president telling the intelligence heads to ""go back to school"". A further tweet on Thursday said the Senate report had been ""mischaracterised by the media"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The uranium was offered on a Yahoo auction site Japanese police are investigating how a substance thought to be uranium was offered in an online auction. The seller and several bidders have been taken in for questioning, local media citing sources in the investigation say. The product packed in a glass tube was offered as ""Uranium 99.9%"" in an auction on Yahoo. According to the Kyodo news agency, a first test of the powder suggested it was radioactive. The online auction was brought to the attention of the country's nuclear regulation authority in 2017. The agency thought the material was likely to be depleted uranium and uranium powder, the Mainichi reports. The paper also says the seller claims to have bought the substance on a website outside Japan. The agency contacted Yahoo over the surprising sale, the auction was stopped and the case referred to the police. It is not confirmed whether the material was indeed uranium and if so whether it was enriched. The sale of nuclear fuel materials is prohibited in Japan and according to local media can lead to up to one year in prison.

"The uranium was offered on a Yahoo auction site Japanese police are investigating how a substance thought to be uranium was offered in an online auction. The seller and several bidders have been taken in for questioning, local media citing sources in the investigation say. The product packed in a glass tube was offered as ""Uranium 99.9%"" in an auction on Yahoo. According to the Kyodo news agency, a first test of the powder suggested it was radioactive. The online auction was brought to the attention of the country's nuclear regulation authority in 2017. The agency thought the material was likely to be depleted uranium and uranium powder, the Mainichi reports. The paper also says the seller claims to have bought the substance on a website outside Japan. The agency contacted Yahoo over the surprising sale, the auction was stopped and the case referred to the police. It is not confirmed whether the material was indeed uranium and if so whether it was enriched.

"Vice Premier Liu He and President Donald Trump talk to the press about trade China's trade delegation says it made ""important progress"" in the latest round of talks with the US, China's state media reports. At the end of a two-day meeting in Washington, no deal was reached but China pledged to buy more US soybeans. US President Donald Trump touted the promise as proof that the two sides were making progress. They are pushing to reach a deal by 1 March to avert an escalation in tariffs. At a press conference with Vice Premier Liu He on Thursday, President Trump said he hoped to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping to hash out a final agreement by the looming deadline. ""We have made tremendous progress,"" President Trump said. ""That doesn't mean you're going to have a deal but there's a tremendous relationship and a warm feeling."" China also agreed to increase imports of ""US agricultural products, energy products, industrial manufactured goods and service products"" during the talks, Xinhua reported. The two sides are racing to come up with a trade deal by 1 March, or the US has said it will increase tariff rates on $200bn (Â£152bn) worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25%.

A quick guide to the US-China trade war Firms look to new factories as tariffs bite In December, the two countries agreed to 90 days of negotiations, in an effort to defuse their escalating trade war, which had led to new tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods. Shortly after the truce took effect, China - by far the world's biggest importer of soybeans - bought1.13 million tonnes of the crop from the US. The White House said on Thursday the country had agreed to purchase an additional 5 million tonnes of soybeans. Soybeanshave been at the forefront of negotiationsas US farmers have suffered from the sudden loss of their largest customer. The country imported more than 30 million tonnes of soybeans from the US in 2017 - a figure that dropped sharply last year amid the trade war.

"The government has been urged to ""not turn a blind eye to"" the exploitation of workers in hand car washes. The plea came after the government rejected a call for a trial licensing scheme to try to tackle the issue. The Environmental Audit Committee said it had found ""widespread and alarming breaches"" of employment and environmental laws at hand car washes. ""It is disappointing that the ministers have opted for a pilot approach that is voluntary,"" EAC chair Mary Creagh said. The government accepted two of the EAC's recommendations from its report which found that cheap hand car washes exploit workers and damage the environment. Ministers agreed to: Write to major supermarkets to remind them of their environmental duties when disposing of dirty water Update the pollution prevention guidance on the government website Cheap hand car washes now account for 80% of the sector in the UK. They have grown rapidly over the past 15 years, and are often in car parks and disused forecourts. MPs said 27% of cases recorded by the Modern Slavery Helpline in 2017 about labour exploitation, concerned car wash workers. Dawn Frazer, managing director of Car Wash Advisory Services (CWAS), which represents a range of car wash businesses, told the BBC she was ""really disappointed"" by the government's decision. CWAS operates a ""Wash Mark"" scheme to denote a company which is meeting required standards. ""We visit every site, that's the only way we are ever able to stamp out issues,"" she said. The government's voluntary scheme would rely on firms to self report on how they were performing, which she believed would be ineffective. Industry body The Car Wash Association said up to 20,000 ""rogue hand car washes"" were believed to be operating in the UK. ""We are being given words of reassurance, but what we need is firm action against the modern slave owners who evade taxes and exploit vulnerable workers,"" said chair Brian Madderson.

"This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains Venezuela's self-declared interim president Juan GuaidÃ³ has said his family has been threatened, amid the country's continuing political crisis. In a speech at Venezuela's Central University, he said police had visited his family home looking for his wife. Mr GuaidÃ³ declared himself president this month and was immediately recognised by the US and several Latin American countries. Russia and China back President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. Military support is seen as crucial to Mr Maduro's hold on power. But Mr GuaidÃ³ says he has held secret meetings with the military to win support for ousting Mr Maduro. Who is backing who in Venezuela Why the military is sticking with Maduro What's behind the political crisis? Protests have been held across the country since Mr Maduro began his second term on 10 January. He was elected last year during a controversial vote in which many opposition candidates were barred from running, or jailed. About three million people have fled Venezuela amid acute economic problems. ""Right now, special forces were at my home asking for Fabiana,"" said the opposition leader during a speech at the university. ""The dictatorship thinks they will frighten us. I received this information before I came here. But I didn't start with that. I started with a plan for all Venezuelans."" Addressing security forces directly, he said: ""I will hold you responsible for any intimidation of my baby, who is just 20 months old."" This video can not be played Juan GuaidÃ³: ""Maduro's regime is killing young, poor people on the streets"" The self-proclaimed president had been speaking as part of an event outlining his broad vision for the future direction of the country. Mr GuaidÃ³ called for the ""re-establishment of public services"", measures to tackle the worsening humanitarian crisis, and support for the ""most vulnerable sectors"" of the economy. His ""Plan Venezuela"" also focused on restoring oil production. ""We want a child who is born in any Venezuelan state to aspire to as much as, or more, than any child who lives in Madrid, Barcelona or Bogota or in any other part of the world,"" he said. He called on Venezuelans to gather together on Saturday as part of fresh protests to demand ""humanitarian assistance"", before asking for foreign diplomats to accompany him home to help protect his family. Later on Thursday he told the Reuters news agency that a change in the country's government would be advantageous to Russia and China, who support Mr Maduro. ""What most suits Russia and China is the country's stability and a change of government,"" he said, adding that Venezuela would be ""responsible"" to its creditors and bondholders. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? The crisis in seven charts Mr GuaidÃ³ earlier said he had held ""clandestine meetings with members of the armed forces and the security forces"". He did not say who he had been speaking to. Venezuela's top military representative to the US Col JosÃ© Luis Silva has defected- but senior military figures in Venezuela have supported Mr Maduro. As head of Venezuela's National Assembly, Mr GuaidÃ³ says the constitution allows him to assume power temporarily when the president is deemed illegitimate. Venezuela's Supreme Court has banned the opposition leader from leaving the country, however, and frozen his bank accounts. Mr Maduro told Russian news agency RIA he was prepared to hold talks with the opposition ""for the good of Venezuela"" but would not accept ultimatums or blackmail. The military has so far supported Mr Maduro (C) He insisted he had the backing of the military, accusing deserters of conspiring to plot a coup. Many officers hold posts as ministers or other influential positions. On Thursday, the European Parliament voted, in a non-binding resolution, to recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president until fresh elections can be called. The parliament has no foreign policy powers but urged the European Union and its member states to follow suit. The EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said it had agreed to create a contact group with Latin American nations aimed at resolving the crisis, but had set a 90-day deadline to find a political solution. The United Nations has told Mr GuaidÃ³ that it is willing to increase humanitarian aid to the country but required the consent of Mr Maduro's government, a spokesman said. The US government warned Mr Maduro there would be consequences for ""egregious"" acts of intimidation against Mr GuaidÃ³, a senior US official told the Reuters news agency. US National Security Adviser John Bolton also tweeted advice to Mr Maduro: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Libby used to post images of her self-harm injuries on Instagram At the age of 12, Libby, became ""hooked"" on posting and viewing self-harm images on Instagram - including pictures of cutting, burning and overdosing. Her father, Ian, says his family reported such images to Instagram, but the social media company did nothing. Speaking to the BBC, Libby, now 16, recalls sharing pictures of her fresh cuts with 8,000 followers. She described how she was drawn in to an online community centred around self-harm photos. ""You start becoming a part of it - you get almost stuck to it,"" she says. ""I was very hooked on it. ""It was almost like you had to keep up with it otherwise people would turn away and stop caring."" She says the three main images were cutting, burning and overdosing. She says while Instagram didn't make her self-harm, the images she saw on the site ""accelerated the severity"" of the cuts. ""I'd see people and then my brain would go: 'That's OK.  It doesn't matter how bad it gets because they're not dead, it hasn't killed them yet,'"" she says. ""It made it safe to do it worse."" UK 'could ban' social media over suicide images Facebook 'sorry' for distressing suicide posts Regulate social media, MPs urge Libby's dad Ian was shocked by some of the images he saw: ""It ranged from scratching, right through to Stanley knives and scalpels. ""I'm an ex-military man. I didn't see stuff like that when I was in the army."" If youâve been affected byself-harm,eating disordersoremotional distress, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line. It wasn't just the pictures that were shocking but also the comments underneath giving advice on how to self-harm. Ian remembers posters saying: ""You shouldn't have done it this way, you should have done it like that. Don't do it here, do it there because there's more blood."" ""That is not someone trying to help you - that is someone getting off on it,"" he says. For Ian and his family, the pressure of trying to keep his daughter safe was unimaginable. ""I honestly don't know how we did get through it,"" he says. ""You will never understand the stress. ""We were living in a dazed world while all this was happening. ""You couldn't leave her on her own. So we were just working round each other: 'You've got to go to work. I've got to go to work. Who's going to look after Libby?'"" The family say they attempted to report the images to Instagram but received a response that the pictures did not breach their community standards. ""They don't like to be contacted. They make it very difficult, or they did back then,"" Ian says. ""If you've got an issue and you want to speak to someone, there's nothing. ""Parents can do everything they want to try to prevent kids going on Instagram but where there's a will there's a way. ""Until one of their close family members fall down that rabbit hole they won't do anything about it. ""Until it affects them or their wallet, they are not interested. ""Instagram needs to put its hand up and say we've created a monster we cannot control."" Libby has now stopped harming and is getting good professional help. She is hoping to become a paramedic or mental health nurse. However, her father says that unless Instagram acts ""there are going to be more Libbys and more Mollys out there"". This video can not be played After Molly Russell took her own life, her family discovered distressing material about suicide on her Instagram account Molly Russell was 14 when she took her own life in 2017 after viewing disturbing content about suicide on social media. Molly's father, Ian, told the BBChe believed Instagram helped kill his daughter. In the days after the BBC reported on Molly's death, youth suicide prevention charity Papyrus say it saw a ""spike"" in calls to its UK helpline from families reporting similar stories. Instagram said its thoughts were with Molly's family and those affected by suicide or self-harm. They said they have deployed engineers to start making changes to make it harder for people to search for and find self-harm content. The company, which is owned by Facebook, acknowledged it had a ""deep responsibility"" to ensuring the safety of young people on the platform and had started a review of its policies around suicide and self-injury content. The company also said it would Start to make it harder for people to search for and find self-harm content Restrict the ability of users to find the content through hashtags Introduce sensitivity screens over self-harm content Stop recommending accounts that post self-harm content It says anybody can report content or accounts that they believe to be against the community guidelines. Families can ask the company to remove accounts if the user is physically or mentally incapacitated. They can also report accounts belonging to a child under the age of 13. The company says it does not usually close accounts because a parent has requested it, arguing that parents are in the best position to monitor and advise teenagers on responsible social media use. It says Instagram has a responsibility to users and believes young people should be able to express themselves and find communities of support such as LGBT groups. This video can not be played Facebook, which owns Instagram, says it is ""deeply upset"" by the death of Molly Russell New Facebook vice-president Sir Nick Clegg saidthe company would do ""whatever it takes"" to make the platform safer for young people. He also added that experts had said not all related content should be banned as it provided a way for people to get help. ""I know this sounds counter-intuitive, but they do say that in some instances it's better to keep some of the distressing images up if that helps people make a cry for help and then get the support they need,"" he said. By BBC correspondent Angus Crawford At the heart of problem is an algorithm. Or really a series of algorithms. Complex instructions written into code. They underpin the mechanics of social media. Analysing everything you do on a platform - pinging you more of the content you like and adverts for things you never knew you wanted. Interest transforms into clicks, which translates into engagement and finally ""sales"" - with data being scraped all the time - that's the business model. But therein lies the problem. If you like pictures of puppies, you'll get more of them. If you seek out material on self-harm and suicide - the algorithm may push you further and further down that pathway. Add to that the scale of the operation - Instagram says it has one billion users. How do you effectively police that without driving your users away - consumers, especially teenagers, are picky, impatient and averse to anything that puts ""friction"" into their enjoyment.  Annoy your users and they'll leave for good. Finally there's verification - anyone who has a phone and an email can sign up for a social media account. And you can be totally anonymous - bad behaviour loves dark places. To be fair to Instagram it has started making changes - restricting hashtags, no more ""recommending"" of self-harm accounts. Soon they'll be blurring images of self-harm. But here's the dilemma for the tech companies - how do you tinker with an algorithm at the heart of your platform to make people safer, if those changes could undermine the very business model you are trying to protect? Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was ""horrified"" by Molly's death and feels ""desperately concerned to ensure young people are protected"". Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Hancock called on social media sites to ""purge"" material promoting self-harm and suicide. When asked if social media could be banned, Mr Hancock said: ""Ultimately parliament does have that sanction, yes"" but added ""it's not where I'd like to end up."" ""If we think they need to do things they are refusing to do, then we can and we must legislate,"" he said. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright told MPs the government is ""considering very carefully"" calls to impose a legal duty of care on social media companies. He said there had been some activity by social media companies but not enough, adding that it would be ""wrong to assume that this House or this Government can sit back and allow the social media companies to do this voluntarily"". Labour's deputy leader and culture spokesman Tom Watson accused Facebook of being more focused on ""profiting from children"" rather than protecting them.
