"Bishop told the court he was wrongfully arrested over the IRA bomb in Brighton A man accused of murdering two girls in 1986 has told the Old Bailey how police bullied him into making a false account, ""totally destroying"" him. Russell Bishop told the court he signed an incorrect witness statement as ""it was the only way I was going to get out of there"", the jury heard. Bishop denies murdering Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway in a second trial. He said he considered killing himself and his two children after he was acquitted in a first trial in 1987. Karen Hadaway (left) and Nicola Fellows went missing after they had gone out to play The court has heard how the girls were found dead in Wild Park, near Brighton, on 10 October 1986, a day after they went missing. In 1990, Bishop - formerly of Brighton - went on to be jailed for life for the kidnap, sexual assault and attempted murder of a seven-year-old girl at Devil's Dyke on the South Downs. Two teenagers who initially discovered Nicola and Karen have told jurors Bishop never touched them. But the court has also heard claims Bishop touched the bodies and checked for a pulse, which may explain the DNA evidence that has presented in the case, the second time he has been tried over their deaths. Jurors heard both Bishop and his father faced wrongful arrests before the Babes in the Wood murder investigation - Bishop told the court he was wrongfully detained over the Grand Hotel bombing in Brighton in 1984. Giving evidence, Bishop described how he had joined the search for the girl but was warned by his father - who had himself previously been wrongly arrested for murder - not to get involved. He said when a man raised the alarm the girls had been found, he was told to go up the scene and keep people away. ""I went straight to the victims, felt for a pulse, neck on Nicola and Karen on the right arm,"" he said. Bishop told jurors he felt ""shocked, totally sickened"". He went on to tell the court he was interviewed by police for 13 hours without a solicitor. He said: ""I started getting all frustrated, confused, tied up in knots."" The girls' bodies were found in a woodland den in Wild Park, near Brighton He claimed officers showed him pictures of the dead girls and the area where they were found. Defending, Joel Bennathan QC said: ""By the end of this process, you signed a witness statement that said you did not take the pulse of the two girls."" Bishop said: ""I was just telling them what they wanted to hear. It was obvious they were not going to believe me over what those two boys were saying. ""I was being called a liar. They had been downright nasty. I was being kept a prisoner. ""I was having two police officers bullying and totally destroying me in that room. ""I'm dyslexic and I could not read or write. I had poor problem-solving skills."" The day they disappeared Bishop was acquitted of the murders in 1987 but now faces a second trial In the witness stand, Bishop told jurors what he did on 9 October 1986, the day the girls disappeared: He described how he went digging for fishing bait and later tried to visit Dougie Judd, a lodger staying with Nicola's father Barrie Fellows. Bishop said he also went to the University of Sussex's car park to try to steal a red Ford Escort. As he walked home, wearing a ""blue flecky jumper"", he said he came across the park keeper in Wild Park and saw the girls from a distance. From there, he went to Angie Cutting's home to buy a ""small amount of cannabis"" and rolled it into a joint. Once home, Bishop said he had a bath, which was interrupted by an insurance salesman, and he then began cooking a meal and washing the clothes that had ""muck"" on them from his walk. After cooking, he said he watched the last five or 10 minutes of EastEnders and later, his partner Jennie Johnson returned home with their young son and they watched a film called Runaway Train. Bishop then told the court at 02:30 the next day, police first arrived at the house and asked him if he could help with the missing girls. Mr Bennathan earlier told the court that if Bishop touched the bodies there is an explanation for DNA evidence on a Pinto sweatshirt linking Bishop with the girls. The barrister said: ""Did Russell Bishop touch the bodies of the girls when they were discovered on October 10 - because if he did take their pulses then there is an obvious simple explanation why he knew what they looked like and the DNA."" Bishop was tried for the murders in 1987, but acquitted. He now faces a second trial. Over the attack on the girl he was jailed for, he told the jury he was ""deeply ashamed"" of what he had done. Mr Bennathan said Bishop had spent 28 years behind bars for the 1990 attack, adding: ""Russell Bishop admittedly committed awful shameful offences in 1990. He's not on trial for them."" Bishop told the court he nearly threw himself and his two children off Beachy Head after the first trial. He said he had numerous bricks lobbed through his windows and firebombs through the letter box after his acquittal, adding: ""There was never a day something did not happen."" After he was cleared, Sussex Police had said they were not looking for anyone else, implying ""the jury got it wrong"", Bishop said. He said weeks before he attacked the seven-year-old girl, he set off for the Sussex cliffs with his children, but he said: ""My son said something in the car which made me rethink and drive away. ""I went to the beach to clear my head. Went for a walk with the children. ""It's hard to put into words, symptoms of mental illness. There was no sleeping. There was no resting. I was living in fear."" The trial continues.

"The Conservative backbench MP John Hayes has been granted a knighthood. Number 10 said the Queen had approved the honour for the South Holland and The Deepings MP, who was a transport minister until a reshuffle in January. Sir John, a long-standing sceptic about the UK's membership of the EU, has been critical of the PM's Brexit deal. Labour shadow minister Chris Matheson said it would be an ""act of desperation"" for the PM ""to be giving away knighthoods"" to win deal backing. The prime minister is due to travel to Brussels on Saturday ahead of the EU summit on Sunday, when the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement is due to be signed off. EU won't offer 'better deal' on Brexit - May Will EU Brexit summit crash on The Rock? Sir John - a Eurosceptic - has told the Sun,externalthat the honour has no bearing on how he will vote on the deal. Speaking to his local newspaper,external, Spalding Today, Sir John said he was ""immensely proud"" to receive the knighthood. ""I am very proud to be MP for the area in which I live - I see it as something for everyone in the area, not just for me,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

The awarding of a knighthood to an MP outside of the usual New Year's and Queen's birthday honours lists is not unprecedented. Conservative ex-defence minister Mike Penning and ex-whip Robert Syms lost their roles in the post-election reshuffle in 2017 and were given knighthoods months later. Former cabinet minister Eric Pickles, who was a casualty of David Cameron's reshuffle following the Tories' 2015 general election victory,received his knighthood later that year. Sir John served in a series of ministerial roles from 2010 to January 2018 and was Home Office security minister from May 2015 to June 2016, while Mrs May was home secretary. The Queen has also approved the appointment of Tory deputy chief whip Christopher Pincher and Labour whip Mark Tami to the Privy Council, Downing Street said. On Twitter, Labour MP Chris Bryant congratulated Mr Tami and Sir John, paying tribute to the latter's campaigning on acquired brain injury. Allow Twitter content?

"An energy supply company with almost 300,000 customers has ceased trading. Spark Energy Supply is part of a gas and electricity firm which employs more than 300 staff at its Selkirk headquarters. The move comes after the company was given a Â£14m bill by the energy regulator Ofgem for non-payment of its renewable power obligation. Ovo Energy has confirmed it has entered into a conditional agreement to buy the company and take on its customers. Ofgem said the energy supply for Spark's 290,000 customers would continue as normal. It advised customers to take meter readings, and said outstanding credit balances would be protected. Ofgem said it would soon transfer customers to another supplier at competitive rates. On its website, Spark Energy said it employs more than 300 staff in the Borders town. A Spark spokesperson said the company which had ceased trading was the part of the group which holds its energy supplier licence. The company said: ""Meanwhile Spark Energy Ltd, the group's parent company, has been working on creating an opportunity for our workforce which could see us becoming a part of one of the UK's largest independent energy suppliers. ""KPMG has been assisting us in this process. ""If successful it would mean Spark becomes a standalone part of this large independent supplier - operating from our offices in Selkirk, Edinburgh and Horsham, supplying our customers under the new parent company's licence."" Mary Starks, Ofgem's executive director for consumers and markets, said: ""Our message to energy customers with Spark is there is no need to worry, as under our safety net we will make sure your energy supplies are secure and your credit balance is protected. ""Ofgem will now choose a new supplier and ensure you get the best deal possible. Whilst we're doing this our advice is to 'sit tight' and don't switch. ""You can rely on your energy supply as normal. We will update you when we have chosen a new supplier, who will then get in touch about your new tariff."" She added: ""Although we have seen a number of supplier failures this year, our safety net procedures are working as they should to protect customers."" An Ovo Energy spokeswoman said: ""Ovo Energy can confirm we have entered into a conditional agreement to buy the operating company of Spark Energy, and we also intend to submit a proposal to Ofgem to take over their customers. ""We have been working with the management team in Selkirk to ensure Spark Energy jobs will be protected and customers' services will not be disrupted."" Rival firms Extra Energy, Future Energy, National Gas and Power, Iresa Energy, Gen4U and Usio Energy have all gone bust in 2018. MP John Lamont said: ""This is clearly a very worrying time for staff and their families at what is one of the largest employers of high-quality jobs in the Borders. ""This news affects the supply arm of the business. ""I've spoken to senior management at Spark Energy, the parent company and I remain hopeful that a solution can be found which protects jobs in Selkirk.""

"Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury's have cut the price of petrol and diesel, as wholesale fuel prices continue to fall. The cuts were led by Asda, which cut the price of petrol by 1p a litre and diesel by 2p a litre. Morrisons and Sainsbury's then matched that move. It means that Asda is charging Â£1.19 a litre for petrol and Â£1.30 a litre for diesel. Supermarkets have been criticised by motoring groups for not cutting fuel prices faster. ""While this is obviously good news, it's disappointing that it has not come sooner as the wholesale price of petrol has been falling for weeks,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. Asda fuel buyer Dave Tyrer said: ""Further decreases in the wholesale market mean we are able to reduce our prices again, with Asda's unleaded price dropped by up to 9p per litre since the end of October."" Average fuel prices hit a four-year high in mid October, when the average price of petrol at the pump hit more than Â£1.31 a litre. Since then prices have been falling - the most recent average price for petrol was Â£1.27 a litre and for diesel Â£1.35 a litre. Subsidised plug-in cars driven on fuel There could be further cuts ahead, as crude oil prices, which help to determine the price of fuel, have been falling. Earlier on Friday, the price of Brent Crude dropped below $60 a barrel for the first time since October 2017, trading as low as $59.44 a barrel. Prices have sagged following data showing that the global supply of oil, led by US producers, is running ahead of demand. Members of the oil cartel Opec meet next month and they will be tempted to curb supply to support the price of crude oil. ""We expect that Opec will manage the market in 2019 and assess the probability of an agreement to reduce production at around two-in-three,"" Morgan Stanley commodities strategists Martijn Rats and Amy Sergeant wrote in a research note. In that scenario, they said, the price of Brent crude is likely to rise back to about $70 a barrel.

"Derek Mead's family said he died ""doing what he loved"" A farmer was crushed to death when his dog knocked a lever inside his forklift truck causing it to trap him against a gate, an inquest heard. Derek Mead, 70, was building a rockery at his home in Hewish, near Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, on 4 June 2017. Avon Coroner's Court heard Mr Mead left the machine in neutral with the engine running and the handbrake off but his pet Jack Russell was still in the cab. Assistant coroner Dr Peter Harrowing said it was a ""tragic accident"". The inquest heard Mr Mead had stopped at the entrance to a field on his land and is believed to have got out to open the gate. His pet dog is thought to have knocked the shuttle lever which moves in a similar way to an indicator stalk on a car and moves the forklift forwards and backwards. Simon Chilcott, from the Health and Safety Executive, told the inquest there was no other ""reasonable explanation"" for the accident. ""You can move it inadvertently,"" Mr Chilcott added. ""Whether the dog has been jumping up to see where his master has gone, or put his paws up on the door to await the return of Derek - it seems most likely that he has collided with the lever. ""He has jumped up or put his paws up and knocked the shuttle lever, which would have put the vehicle in a forward motion."" Dr Harrowing reached a conclusion of accidental death. He said: ""The most likely explanation is that the dog... inadvertently moved the shuttle lever, causing the forward motion... which sadly trapped Mr Mead against the solid gate, causing injuries which he did not survive."" A post-mortem examination found he died from spinal fractures and traumatic asphyxia. In a statement after his death, Mr Mead's family said: ""He was doing what he loved and had been doing since he was a young boy.""

"UK shoppers on Black Friday have been buying more items but spending less, credit card data suggests. Barclaycard, which processes half of all UK card payments, said that by 15:00 GMT it had seen 10% more transactions from a year earlier. However, the value of spending was down 12% on last year. Separate data suggested a continuing trend for Black Friday bargain hunting to be done online rather than on the High Street. Barclaycard said it had processed 1,087 transactions per second between 13:00 and 14:00 GMT, a record high. Konrad Kelling, managing director of Barclaycard Payment Solutions, said: ""Our data shows that people have been making a higher number of less expensive purchases than at this time last year. ""This suggests that, while Black Friday is clearly encouraging shoppers to buy, consumers are more likely to be purchasing smaller 'treat' products, rather than splashing out on high-end items."" Useful tips for the best Black Friday deals Warning on 'misleading' Black Friday deals Separate data from retail analysts Springboard indicated that shoppers were continuing to favour buying online rather than heading out to the shops. Springboard said that by 13:00 GMT, footfall at shops was down 7% from a year ago. High Streets saw a 6.4% decline while shopping centres saw visitor numbers drop 9.1%. In comparison, the volume of online transactions was up 47%, according to analysis by Loqate/GBG. Black Friday, a period of heavy discounting which originated as a post-Thanksgiving sale in the US, has divided retailers in the UK. Some see it as risking already-thin profit margins as consumers expect both pre-and post-Christmas deals. However, this year has seen a return of some retailers who snubbed the promotion 12 months ago. Previous years have seen huge crowds stampeding for in-store bargains Retail aggregator LovetheSales.com, which tracks prices and discounts, said there were 26% more deals on offer this year compared with 2017, and noted that chains such as Homebase, Whistles and FatFace had begun offering Black Friday deals again. Department store chain John Lewis said the most searched-for products so far on Friday were Apple Airpods and the Applewatch Series 3. Earlier on Friday, the National Cyber Security Centre issued advice to shoppers of therisk of ""malicious"" online threatsand potential for fraud as shoppers are distracted by bargains.

"A report commissioned by the French president recommends that disputed artworks should be returned to their countries of origin French President Emmanuel Macron has said that France will return 26 artworks taken from the west African state of Benin in the colonial era. His announcement follows an experts' report recommending that African treasures in French museums be returned to their countries of origin. The 26 thrones and statues were taken in 1892 during a colonial war against the then Kingdom of Dahomey. They are currently on display in the Quai Branly museum in Paris. What do you know about Africa's 'looted treasures'? A guide to Africa's 'looted treasures' Benin officially asked for their return some years ago. President Macron said the statues would be returned ""without delay"". His office said the return of art to Benin should not be an isolated case. The president ""hopes that all possible circulation of these works is considered: returns but also exhibitions, loans, further cooperation"", the Elysee palace said. A panel of experts, commissioned by the president to study the issue of African artworks in French museums, presented their findings to him on Friday. Ousmane Aledji, director of the Benin cultural centre Artisttik Africa, told the AFP news agency he was pleased to see ""a new form of cultural exchange"" with France. During colonial rule in Africa, thousands of cultural artefacts were seized from the continent by Western countries. The official report states that most of the Africa collection in the Quai Branly museum - approximately 46,000 pieces - was acquired with some degree of duress. France's announcement comes as major museums across Europe have agreed to lend key artefacts back to Nigeria.

"A report commissioned by the French president recommends that disputed artworks should be returned to their countries of origin French President Emmanuel Macron has said that France will return 26 artworks taken from the west African state of Benin in the colonial era.

"After the ""wolf pack"" trial, demonstrations spread across Spain - this sign reads: ""We want to be free"" A court's decision to clear two men of rape despite the victim begging them to stop has prompted outrage in Spain. The court in Lleida in north-eastern Spain jailed the uncle and nephew for four-and-a-half years for sexual abuse, rather than the graver offence. A similar verdict in a gang rape case this year prompted large demonstrations against ""patriarchal"" justice. Five men were cleared of raping a teenage woman during the San FermÃ­n bull-running festival in Pamplona. In the latest verdict, the court ruled that the two men had not committed a sexual assault, the equivalent to rape in Spain, because they were deemed not to have used intimidation or violence. The uncle and nephew had met their victim in a bar and gone with her to a nightclub. The men then took her to a backstreet where she was forced into sex and a separate sexual act without her consent. She had pleaded with the men to stop, and cried and vomited afterwards. The two men ""took advantage of her vulnerable nature, which, added to her consumption of alcohol and antidepressants, may have weakened her ability to defend herself, thus making the use of violent or intimidatory acts unnecessary"", the ruling said. And yet it added that, without intimidation or violence, the crime of sexual assault, which commands a jail term of up to 15 years, could not be applied. 'Wolf pack' gang rape trial angers Spain Viewpoint: Spain rape case highlights enduring machismo Thousands protest over Spanish rape ruling There was indignation online, with thousands sharing their anger at the decision. One Twitter user Mercedes DomÃ¨nech described the court ruling as a scandal. ""If you don't defend yourself, it's not rape. If you do, they kill you."" The verdict comes as feminists around Spain prepare for a series of 200 demonstrations over the weekend to mark the UN International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on 25 November. This video can not be played The ""wolf pack"" verdict was met with anger outside court Mass protests spread across Spain in April when a court in Pamplona ruled that the five men who used a WhatsApp chat group called ""the wolf pack"" had not used intimidation or violence against their victim during the 2016 San FermÃ­n festival. The five dragged an 18 year old into an alcove at the back of a block of flats and filmed their attack with their mobile phones. The victim said in the trial that she froze, and the judges who saw the videos described her attitude as ""passive or neutral"". The three judges in that case were involved in another controversial ruling this week, acquitting a man of attempted murder after he threatened his estranged wife with a kitchen knife and throttled her on the floor in front of their children. The woman survived and her husband was sentenced to 10 months in prison for domestic abuse, although even his defence lawyers reportedly asked for a two-year jail term for actual bodily harm. After the ""wolf pack"" ruling, Spain's government asked a group of legal experts to revise the sexual assault laws, with a view to unifying the different offences under the umbrella term rape. Amnesty International released a report on Thursday criticising the absence of policies in Spain to help women who suffer from sexual violence, and pointing to a legal system that discourages victims from coming forward.

"This video can not be played The latest group of migrants arrives in Dover after crossing the English Channel in a small boat Eight suspected migrants claiming to be from Iran have been brought ashore after a dinghy was spotted off Kent. The men were located by the coastguard and Border Force officers at about 07:15 GMT and brought into Dover. A Home Office spokesman said they were checked by ambulance staff and found to be well. It brings the number of suspected Iranian migrants to have reached UK shores this month to 101. All have been passed to immigration officials. The recent surge in attempts to cross the Channel is being blamed on a rise in organised crime in France. Ingrid Parrot, of the French maritime police, said ""criminal and mafia networks"" had been organising the trafficking. ""There are more and more thefts of boats, pleasure craft, speed boats,"" she said. More than 100 suspected Iranian migrants have reached the Kent coastline this month A spokesman for the National Crime Agency echoed her comments, but said gathering intelligence and the evidence required to prosecute such networks could take time. ""Crossing the Channel in this way is obviously highly dangerous,"" he said. ""It demonstrates the lack of regard for human life that these criminal networks have, but also their willingness to exploit the desperation of others. ""But while these attempts are high profile and high risk, the numerical threat posed by organised criminals trying to smuggle people into the UK remains largest at south coast ports rather than through the use of small maritime vessels."" On Thursday, 14 suspected migrants claiming to be Iranian were rescued from two dinghies. A first boat, with six men and one woman, was intercepted by Border Force officers off the coast of Dover at about 01:30.

"This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Unchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life, a US government report warns. ""Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today,"" the 4th National Climate Assessment says. The report saysclimate change is ""presenting growing challenges,externalto human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth"". The warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda. By James Cook, Los Angeles correspondent, BBC News During a blast of icy weather in Washington this week,Donald Trump tweeted, ""whatever happened to global warming?"",external Now, without mentioning the president, his own scientists have answered their boss' question in comprehensive detail. Global warming is here in the US, they say - now. It is already deadly serious and without urgent, dramatic change, it will be catastrophic. The report warns that the frequency of wildfires could increase if climate change is unchecked This report is striking for two reasons. First, it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples - overwhelmed dams in South Carolina; failing crops in the parched Great Plains; a rise in insect-borne disease in Florida. And, secondly, it majors on the economic impact, in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation. With warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure, falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity, the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life. The White House said the report - compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments - was inaccurate. Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was ""largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population"". The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity. The US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society. What is climate change? Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Risk of 'Hothouse Earth' despite CO2 cuts ""With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,"" the report says. ""Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century."" The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events. But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ""to adapt to the changes that will occur"". Environmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action. Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, said the report made it clear that climate change was not ""some problem in the distant future"". ""It's happening right now in every part of the country,"" she said. This bar in San Francisco had a climate change message during a summit in the city in September That view was echoed by Abigail Dillen, president of environmental group Earthjustice. ""While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, his own administration is sounding the alarm,"" she said. Former US Vice-President Al Gore, a prominent climate change campaigner, accused the White House of trying to bury the report by releasing it on Black Friday - the unofficial start of America's Christmas shopping season. ""Unbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the west, hurricanes batter our coasts - and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical US assessment of the climate crisis,"" Mr Gore said. ""The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible."" In October,President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a ""political agenda"", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels. At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was ""a hoax"". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: ""I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference."" A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could only be stopped if the world made major, and costly, changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops. If the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

"Joshua Knox-Hooke was on holiday in Thailand with friends when he became ill When Joshua Knox-Hooke arrived at his local A&E department by ambulance after cutting his wrists, he was agitated and told staff he wanted to die - despite this, he was allowed to walk out of the hospital. For a month no-one knew where he was, until his body was found in a local reservoir. He had drowned. Stories like his are the starting point for a report which concludes that too many people are failing to get the help they need when they arrive at emergency departments in a mental health crisis. ""I know it is a very busy place,"" says Joshua's brother Jacob, ""but I still think if someone was presenting as my brother was, with visible cuts to himself, acting in a slightly agitated manner and also verbally saying he wanted to die, then that is the biggest red flag ever. ""Quickly you need to call psychiatric liaison, there's no time to waste in that situation."" Mental health: 10 charts on the scale of the problem Reality Check: The targets for mental health 'I was brought back from the brink of suicide' Joshua, 22, had his first psychotic episode while travelling in Thailand in 2014. He was brought home and his family say the care he received from the community mental health team was really good, he responded well to medication and was starting to make plans again. Six weeks after returning to the UK, he started feeling low again and said he wanted to take his own life. After he cut himself, he was taken to hospital by ambulance. His family alerted his community psychiatric nurse who tried to ring the hospital to pass on information about Joshua. They say it took hours before anyone picked up the phone. His mother also made her way there, but arrived a short time after he walked out. In the report, the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) examines cases like Joshua's to see what wider lessons can be learned from them and make recommendations for improving health services. The HSIB found the care that people get varies according to where they live in England. It points to research which suggests that nearly two-thirds of people arriving at A&E do not receive the mental health care they need. Jacob Knox-Hooke (r) says his brother Joshua should have had better care in A&E Joshua's inquest heard that despite him telling the triage nurse who assessed him that he was feeling suicidal, he was not referred to the psychiatric liaison team. He should also have been kept within sight of staff at all times, but was not. The coroner said there was evidence that it was common for patients to leave the emergency department before a psychiatric assessment. ""People's lives are in the balance. You can see with my brother, he lost his life, partly because he was allowed to leave what you think is a safe environment,"" says Jacob. ""If someone came in and they'd been shot or stabbed, they'd be fast tracked to the most adequate surgeon or doctor to try to help save their life, in this case where it was a more mental unseen threat, nothing was done."" The report concludes that there is a lack of clear guidance on mental health for staff in this pressured environment, and there are problems with the funding and integration of these services with emergency departments. The HSIB report says people who arrive in A&E having self-harmed should receive a full psychiatric assessment, but research shows huge variation. In some places, only 22% of those patients were referred, compared with 88% in other parts of the country. The report wants funding for mental health services in emergency departments 24 hours a day, with better training for other staff. ""In publishing this report, we've highlighted the systemic issues in funding and integrating mental health liaison services into the emergency department,"" said HSIB chief investigator Keith Conradi. ""The investigation also showed that there is a clear lack of guidance and process for staff already working in a pressured environment. ""Every presentation at the emergency department represents the opportunity to provide the safest possible care to those in mental health crisis."" Too many patients in mental health crisis are failed by emergency departments, says report At Birmingham's Heartland Hospital, the psychiatric liaison team sees people with a mental health issue within an average of 23 minutes. ""Psychiatric liaison teams are making a big difference to patients and not only that... save money and time and resources. ""In my mind it is very essential, across the country, to have psychiatric liaison teams to ensure patient safety and the best quality for all of them,"" said Prof George Tadros of Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust, who pioneered the rapid response system. In a statement, the Department of Health and Social care said mental health was a ""top priority"". ""We're committed to putting mental health on equal footing with physical health. ""That's why we are investing Â£249m to roll out liaison mental health teams in every general hospital by 2020-21 with at least 50% of them meeting 24/7 core standards of care, and are investing Â£400m to improve mental health crisis resolution services in the community.""

"Arlene Foster has said the government should ""ditch the backstop"" The DUP would have to revisit its confidence and supply deal with the Tories if Theresa May's Brexit deal passes through parliament, Arlene Foster has said.

She was speaking on Radio Ulster's Inside Politics programme. The DUP is holding its annual conference this weekend.

The DUP leader insisted the government should ""ditch the Irish backstop"" and recognise that, in practice, nobody will implement a hard border on the island of Ireland.

The chancellor, Philip Hammond, is one of two Conservative MPs to attend the DUP party conference in Belfast this weekend. Mr Hammond spoke at a dinner on Friday night. Earlier, he told the BBC that the government is looking at ways to provide extra assurances to the DUP over the Irish border backstop. He was speaking during a visit to an integrated school in Moira, County Down. Mr Hammond said the government has a number of choices through the ""parliamentary process"", which include extending the implementation period to avoid having to use the backstop. ""I would much prefer to see us extending the implementation period and I am sure my DUP colleagues would take the same view,"" he said. Philip Hammond had a series of engagements in Northern Ireland on Friday before attending the DUP conference ""So we need to look at how we can provide reassurance about how we will use the options that the agreement gives us."" Boris Johnson will give a speech to the conference on Saturday afternoon. Mrs Foster said the reference to the potential use of technology to monitor cross-border trade in the latest EU-UK Political Declaration does not change her party's objections to Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreement. She said it would have been much better if both the EU and the UK had explored potential technological solutions to maintaining smooth cross-border trade in the summer of last year, when unionists previously championed the idea. Mrs  Foster said the withdrawal agreement will be legally binding and have the status of an international treaty, so it remains important to the DUP that nothing contained in it damages the UK constitutionally or economically.

"This video can not be played The Met said drivers aim to end pursuits before riders or members of the public are injured The Met Police has published footage of officers knocking suspected criminals off scooters, at the same time as the watchdog is investigating some crashes. Videos released by the force show police cars being driven into riders. The Met says it has cut scooter crime by 36% this year. However, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it is investigating three cases involving ""tactical contact"" by Met police cars on scooters. The number of offences involving scooters has fallen since specialists teams were set up to tackle the problem. In January 2018 to October 2018 there were 12,419 offences, 7,036 fewer than the same period in 2017. Police officers can use their vehicles to knock moped thieves off their bikes, the Met Police said The Met says drivers are specially trained and aim to end pursuits before riders or members of the public are injured. A spokesperson said the tactic is not new but is being used more often by its most highly trained drivers working on Operation Venice; the team set up to tackle scooter gangs. According to the IOPC, one of the cases being investigated involved a 17-year-old boy who suffered head injuries a year ago in Bexley. However, none of the three cases involved officers involved with Operation Venice. Can Chicago cure London's violence?

"Another EU referendum is not ""off the table"" for Labour but would probably be won by Leave again, says Diane Abbott. The shadow home secretary said she was ""as sure as anyone can be"" that ""the referendum vote will be honoured and we will come out of the EU next spring"". But she repeated her warning that those urging a new referendum should should ""be careful what they wish for"". ""My view is that ...Leave would win again,"" shetold Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast. ""And not only would Leave win again but Leave voters would say: 'What didn't you understand about Leave the first time?'"" Labour 'could form minority government' Can May get her deal through the Commons? Corbyn: New referendum 'not option for now' At the Labour Party conference in September,party members approved a motionthat would keep all options - including a fresh referendum - on the table if MPs are deadlocked over Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he would respect the result of the vote - but said last week that a new referendum was ""an option for the future"" but ""not an option for today"". The People's Vote campaign group, which organised a march in London in October which it said attracted about 700,000 people, wants a referendum on the final withdrawal deal. But Labour says it would prefer to see a general election, if Theresa May loses the ""meaningful vote"" on her Brexit deal. Asked how that could come about, as the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act means two-thirds of MPs would have to vote in favour of an election, or go through a no-confidence procedure, Ms Abbott said: ""This is an era of things that you never thought could happen, are happening and whatever the legislation says, in the end, Parliament disposes and Parliament proposes."" She said she had been an MP through parliamentary ""turmoil"" under Margaret Thatcher and John Major but added: ""I have never seen anything like this and there is a tiny bit of me which thinks this might all end in a general election. It's not clear how that would happen but you can't escape thinking about that."" Earlier this week, shadow chancellor John McDonnellsuggested Labour could form a minority government, without a general election. Ms Abbott was asked whether Labour would ally itself with the DUP - the Northern Ireland Unionist party which has been supporting Theresa May's government in key Commons votes. She said: ""We would only want to ally with a group of MPs who agreed with us on the issues at stake. At this point, we don't agree with the DUP on the issues at stake, but in this sort of parliamentary turmoil you can't necessarily rule anything out. ""I always say to my MP colleagues that the people of Hackney send me to Parliament to get rid of the Tories and if it's all about getting rid of this Tory government you do what it takes.""

"Arlene Foster has said the government should ""ditch the backstop"" The DUP would have to revisit its confidence and supply deal with the Tories if Theresa May's Brexit deal passes through parliament, Arlene Foster has said. The DUP leader said her agreement with the Conservatives had been intended to provide the UK with national stability and to deliver on Brexit. She was speaking on Radio Ulster's Inside Politics programme. The DUP is holding its annual conference this weekend.

"It feels like Westminster is tumbling towards a political crisis without modern precedent. On Tuesday 11 December, the House of Commons will conclude five days of debate with a vote on a government motion to approve the EU withdrawal agreement and accompanying political declaration. The terms of the UK's departure from the EU. But at the moment, it looks as if Theresa May faces an incredibly hard job getting it passed. She leads a government with a working majority of just 13. Only seven Tory rebels are needed to defeat it. EU won't offer 'better deal' on Brexit - May DUP may revisit Tory deal says Foster Brexit vote will be honoured, says Abbott But according to the latest number-crunching by BBC researchers, 81 Tory MPs have said they object to the deal Mrs May hopes to sign off with EU leaders on Sunday. With Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and even perhaps the DUP set to vote against the motion too, the withdrawal agreement looks set to be torpedoed in the Commons. Between now and then Theresa May will exhaustively insist the deal is in the national interest and the only way of ensuring Brexit happens. But if the withdrawal agreement is defeated, what happens then? The default position in that scenario would be for the UK to leave without a deal. Under both EU law and the UK's Withdrawal Act, Brexit day is chiselled into the diary for 11pm on 29 March, 2019. That's when the EU Treaties will stop applying to the UK. If Parliament rejects the deal, the same Withdrawal Act sets out what the government must do next. Ministers would have up to 21 days to make a statement to the Commons on ""how it proposes to proceed"". The government would then have a further seven days to move a motion in the Commons, allowing MPs to express their view on the government's course of action. This video can not be played Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan? Crucially though, this would not be opportunity for MPs to throw a road-block in the way of a no-deal Brexit if that's what the government wanted to happen. Whatever motion the government brings back to Parliament will now have to be amendable, after MPs backed a change to it tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve. MPs are hoping this will allow them to vote to rule-out a no-deal Brexit. The government would find it hard to ignore such a vote - but it would not carry the legal force to stop the UK leaving without a deal next March. Instead, the government would have to put new legislation before Parliament and secure the approval of MPs if it did not want the UK to leave without a deal. As the clerk of the House of Commons, Sir David Natzler, told a committee of MPs last month, ""there is no House procedure that can overcome statute. Statute is overturned by statute."" Can May get Brexit deal through Commons? Sir David Natzler (seated, front left) says MPs could vote again But in addition to the rigid legal position there would be the frenzied political reality. The maximum three-week window between the government's deal being defeated and the requirement on ministers to propose a way forward would see several alternative scenarios come into play. The prime minister could make a second attempt at getting the withdrawal deal through the Commons. Sir David Natzler said, in procedural terms, that would be possible. ""The words might be the same but the underlying reality would be self-evidently be different"", Sir David said. Brussels might be persuaded to tweak the political declaration on the future relationship to meet the concerns of MPs. Theresa May could try to return to Brussels to renegotiate the Northern Irish ""backstop"" - the main sticking point for many MPs. The government has long insisted this is not an option, because the EU has said the existing deal is final and there is no alternative. Might Brussels give Mrs May some leeway if she loses the vote by a narrowish margin? Some MPs hope she could get behind another version of Brexit at this point. There is support on the Tory benches for a membership of the European Free Trade Area, which would see the UK staying closely linked to the EU, like Norway. This would not be a straightforward move - and would require extensive renegotiation, even if the EU was prepared to contemplate it, and the extension of Article 50, delaying Brexit day. Then there is Labour's proposal for a permanent customs union - Mrs May has always ruled that out, but if enough MPs get behind it, it might be an option, although, again, it would need Article 50 to be extended to allow for more talks. Unlikely, given her track record of doggedly ploughing on against the odds - but if she is defeated by a heavy margin on 11 December she may feel she has no other option. There would then be a Tory leadership contest, which would turn into a fight to the death between the Leave and Remain wings of the party, with profound effects on the future of Brexit and, indeed, the country. Jacob Rees-Mogg's band of Brexiteers famously failed to reach the magic 48 letters of no confidence in the PM to trigger a leadership contest last month. But if she tries to cling on after a significant defeat on 11 December, more MPs could add their names to the list, forcing a no-confidence vote that she might struggle to win. MPs might suddenly shift in large numbers towards the idea of another referendum to break the Parliamentary impasse and open the possibility of stopping Brexit. At the moment, about eight Tory and 44 Labour MPs have publicly committed to another referendum. Theresa May is dead set against another referendum and it's hard to see an alternative Tory leader picking up that baton. But the Labour leadership has said all options should remain on the table (including another referendum) and the SNP and Lib Dems say there should be one too. However, a second referendum can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it. There would have to be legislation. The rules for referendums are set out by thePolitical Parties, Elections & Referendums Act 2000,external. TheElectoral Commission's,externalrecommendation is that there should be six months between the legislation being passed and referendum day. This could be shortened but, realistically, not by all that much. The UCL Constitution Unit, a research centre on constitutional change, suggests that could be 22 weeks. So for the referendum to happen there would have to be a delay to Brexit - and that would require all 27 EU member states and the UK to agree. This is Labour's preferred outcome to the deal being rejected. But as Dr Jack Simson Caird from the Bingham Centre for the Rule of Law says, ""with the ticking clock of Article 50 it's very difficult to see that this represents a solution to the problem"" of a deadlocked parliament. That will be the other critical factor at play. Unless the government asks for an extension to the negotiating period - ie Brexit being delayed - the time for parliament and the government to agree a way forward is incredibly tight.  The clock won't wait. There are two routes to a general election through the Fixed Term Parliament Act. Two-thirds of MPs could vote for one. This is the quickest route - a poll could be held as soon as 25 working days later. Alternatively MPs could go for a no confidence motion in the government - Labour has said they will table such a motion if Mrs May loses on 11 December. This is a straight majority rather than requiring two thirds of MPs to vote for it. This gives two weeks for someone to demonstrate they can command a majority in the Commons. If that does not happen, the 25 working days countdown to a general election kicks in. Any election now would be on the existing constituency boundaries. The new ones have to be approved by the Commons and the Lords. And that has been put on hold until after Brexit. Another idea that has been floated is a ""negotiated no deal"" in the which the UK would ask the EU for a (paid) one year extension of membership before leaving on World Trade Organisation terms. Some Brexiteers might like the idea but it's hard to see Parliament supporting such a move - with or without an explicit vote. Because Parliament will have to come to a view. As Maddy Thimont Jack, from the Institute for Government think tank says: ""We do have Parliamentary sovereignty and there are clear ways for Parliament to express a very strong political view. ""I cannot see how a government can get through a legislative programme, for no deal, for example, if you don't have the support of Parliament."" Theresa May might have neutralised the chance of defeat in the Commons if she had found a Parliamentary consensus for the Brexit she planned to negotiate right at the start of the process. Instead, she faces a fraught few days and a vote that will define the country's future for many years. Right now, it looks like the government's deal cannot get through the Commons. But the mood in Westminster could shift quickly in the current pandemonium.

"Could Spanish concerns scupper Brexit progress? How much of a threat is the Spain/Gibraltar question to the Brexit summit on Sunday? Well, it could turn out to be either huge or simply a puff of smoke. Madrid and Downing Street say they are working on it. There's not much time left for the question to assume either form. UK Prime Minister Theresa May meets EU leaders in Brussels to sign off on the Brexit texts in just over 36 hours. Brexit: Where are we now? Your guide to EU jargon Grandstanding for his domestic audience aside, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez feels hoodwinked and angry. Gibraltar is of great national interest, and hurt pride, for many Spaniards. It became official government policy during the Franco dictatorship to get back what Spaniards nickname ""El PeÃ±Ã³n""  (The Rock). The small peninsula of Gibraltar has been a British territory since 1713 After the UK's Brexit vote, Spain at the very least saw an opportunity to re-gain considerable influence over Gibraltar. Eyebrows shot up in the UK at the very start of the Article 50 process when article 24 of the EU's negotiating guidelines stated: ""After the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom."" In fact, though, the bilateral UK-Spain talks that then took place in parallel to EU-UK Brexit negotiations went extremely smoothly... until just recently. What will Brexit mean for Britain's overseas territories? What are the competing claims over Gibraltar? Spanish resentment started building after the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his team proposed going into a ""tunnel"" with UK negotiators - blocking out political and media noise - in an attempt to break the lengthy impasse over the wording of the Irish ""backstop"" - that guarantee to avoid a border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. This video can not be played Spain claims Gibraltar is a part of the country because of its location on the Iberian peninsula It is during that tunnel moment that Spain feels it was ""betrayed"". By the time EU and UK negotiators emerged, the Irish backstop had become a UK-wide customs area, meaning it was potentially straying into post Brexit trade deal territory. Yet neither in that text, nor in the draft of the political declaration on EU-UK future relations published on Thursday, is there mention of Gibraltar and the need for Spanish approval. Prime Minister SÃ¡nchez believes the positive attitude Spain had shown in bilateral Brexit talks over Gibraltar is now being abused; that Spanish national interest was sacrificed in the tunnel in order to offer an extra ""sweetener"" to the UK in wider Brexit negotiations. European Commission negotiators flatly deny this. But Spain is not alone in believing that priorities of individual EU countries were ignored during tunnel negotiations. France, Denmark and the Netherlands felt let down by their EU negotiators over pinning down ongoing fishing rights in UK waters in the political declaration on post Brexit EU-UK relations. Will the UK and EU reach a Brexit fishing deal? Fishing after Brexit: Sink or swim? We have now heard that the fishing issue has been ""resolved"" (for now). The details have yet to emerge. This means Gibraltar is the only outstanding issue ahead of Sunday's Brexit summit, according to the EU. Fishing has been another contentious issue in the Brexit talks Now, Spain's Prime Minister is hugely pro-European. He sees himself as a bit of a Macron number two. It is not in his nature to scupper EU plans or an EU summit. Remember when Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini refused to take in migrant boats earlier this year, Mr SÃ¡nchez was the first to step in and help in order to avert an EU crisis - and also to win brownie points in Brussels. Spain to accept disputed migrant ship Migration to Europe in charts Pedro SÃ¡nchez is under a lot of domestic pressure. He heads a minority government and has been repeatedly accused by the main conservative opposition of being ""soft"" over Gibraltar in Brexit negotiations. He also faces elections in the politically significant Andalucia region on 2 December. A part of Spain that neighbours - you guessed it - The Rock. It is possible that Spain's prime minister has learned a lesson from Italy's deputy prime minister: that if you dig in your heels in the EU, you can get results. Matteo Salvini is a harsh critic of the EU He knows, of course, that holding the Brexit summit now, in November, was at Theresa's May's insistence; that the EU thought it possible to seal the deal next month instead. This knowledge is in Mr SÃ¡nchez's back pocket. It's important to bear in mind that while Spain doesn't have an actual veto over the Brexit divorce deal, EU leaders need to reach decisions by consensus at their summits. They don't actually put up their hands to vote. There is no way they can rubber stamp a text designed for a leaving member (the UK) when an existing member (Spain) is so strongly opposed. It is true, there is less EU solidarity with Spain over Gibraltar than there was with Ireland over the border issue. But the EU has been so proud about the very unusual unity amongst its members over Brexit, they won't want to give that up at this late stage. So, in effect, Spain could exercise a moral or political ""veto"" on Sunday. Which means that although Spain does not have a formal veto, it could exercise moral and political objections that would effectively stop other countries from voting against it. Concerns about a hard border between the UK and Ireland have been a key feature of Brexit negotiations EU insiders don't think it will come down to that. They believe this can be solved without reopening the Brexit texts by noting Spain's insistence on continuing UK.-Madrid bilateral talks in a declaration added to the texts or other possible EU formulas. But even if Spanish opposition melts away before Sunday, the bitterness over Gibraltar, over fishing rights, over ensuring that the UK has no competitive advantages over European businesses in a post-Brexit trade deal, these are examples of the substantial obstacles the UK will face from EU countries in negotiating a trade deal with EU after Brexit. And that's a deal the parliaments of every single EU country - including Spain's - will need to ratify unanimously.

"Charlotte says she was hit with hundreds of pounds of extra fees Campaigners say new laws going through Parliament will not go far enough to stamp out all hidden fees and charges for renters. Charlotte Von Crease, a 27-year-old renter, says: ""When we moved into our last property we were hit with nearly Â£3,500 worth of fees, before we even got the keys."" However, those pre-tenancy fees are just one of the hidden costs. Tenant campaign groups say banning them will not solve the problem. There were the usual costs for Charlotte, such as one month's rent in advance and six weeks' rent as a deposit. But she toldBBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Moneythere were ""also Â£875 worth of letting agent fees, Â£600 were admin fees, Â£120 for employers' references for both me and my partner, and Â£155 for an inventory check-in fee as well"". Charlotte is one of the estimated 11.5 million people who live in private rented homes in England. Many renters complain of high upfront costs to secure a property and the Tenant Fees Bill passing through Parliament will effectively cap or ban these extra, unavoidable charges for tenants in England. Wales has similar legislation under way and Scotland outlawed pre-tenancy fees back in 2012. In Northern Ireland it's a more complicated picture. A judge recently ruled that tenants could not be charged upfront costs, but without a sitting assembly to bring in new rules, tenants there are still paying them. But those pre-tenancy fees are just one part of the hidden costs for renters and a number of tenant campaign groups, including Shelter and Generation Rent, have expressed concern that banning them will not solve the problem. When the new rules eventually come into force, they will not stop landlords and letting agents from charging default fees, such as cleaning costs or those for repairs. While those are often for work needed after tenants leave a property, some tenants report being charged huge amounts for tiny jobs. Some tenants say they feel ripped off. ""I've just ended 10 years of renting [and] each property was its own frustrating experience,"" says 30-year-old former renter Jen Eastwood. ""Never once have I received a full amount of deposit back, despite every property being returned in a better condition than when it was given to me. Twice I paid for professional cleaning and gave the receipts as proof, and still I was charged for cleaning."" Is rent cheaper in the next street? Use our map to find out The cost of renting in the UK in seven charts Where does rent hit young people the hardest in Britain? Ask any group of renters about their experiences and at least some will have similar stories. Private renting has more than doubled in the past 20 years. There's been a decline in home ownership among millennials in particular, leading more to rent for longer. Earlier this year the Institute for Fiscal Studies reported there had been a large decline in home ownership among middle-income 25-34-year-olds. In 1995-96, 65% of this group owned a home but by 2015-16 that fell to just 27%. Shelter has said tenants are routinely being overcharged. It lists examples of tenants paying as much as Â£20 an hour for their landlord's time, Â£45 for procuring a replacement dustpan and brush - and even Â£100 for removing cobwebs. None of those charges will be banned by the Tenant Fees Bill. Tenants deposits are now routinely held in deposit protection schemes, meaning money is protected and they can challenge charges they think are unfair. However, if a landlord or agent can show invoices and receipts for work carried out then it can be hard to argue it was unnecessary or unfair. Polly Neate, chief executive of the charity, says she will welcome the new rules but tells Wake Up To Money it must go further. Clearer guidelines on what tenants can and can't be charged for are needed, she says, to prevent landlords and agents finding ""additional things"" to charge for. ""Letting agents are running a business and their business is managing properties. So they ought to be able to calculate the general costs that they will incur. [These] should be part of the totally predictable cost of managing a property."" Tenants may feel ripped off by these fees but letting agents and landlords argue they genuinely reflect the cost of the work. One letting agent, who did not want to be named, said: ""To get anyone to show up at your door no matter what they do is Â£50 or something in that region. So, if a tenant is to leave a bit of fluff somewhere, someone still has to take an hour to go there, do it and come back and you have to hire a professional. ""I used to own a property and I wouldn't just run out to clear up a bit of fluff or change a bulb, I'd say it's my tenants' responsibility."" 11.5m people rent in England His comments were echoed by housing minister Heather Wheeler. ""I genuinely think that you have a responsibility when you take on a property - you expect it to be in good order when you arrive, it's your job to make it in a good order when you leave."" Richard Lambert, chief executive of the National Landlords Association, said the new rules will curb abuses. ""Default fees will have to be a reasonable charge for a defined purpose. But if I have to come to you to change a light bulb then I have to drive for half-an-hour, plus petrol, to carry out the work. I wouldn't be charging you anything more than what it cost me. He said the government had tried to strike a reasonable balance between tenants and landlords. David Cox, chief executive of Arla Propertymark, said: ""Letting agent fees cover the cost of essential services during the lettings process, such as referencing, negotiations about clauses in the tenancy agreement and the inventory - processes that cost letting agents time and money to carry out. He says research for Arla by Capital Economics showed that a full ban on tenant fees would mean two tenants would end up paying an extra Â£206 per year in rent. ""Ultimately, the ban doesn't reflect the value of the services which agents provide to tenants,"" he said.

"Two police officers were killed in the attack Gunmen have killed at least four people in an attack on the Chinese consulate in the Pakistani port city of Karachi. Gunshots were heard at about 09:30 local time (04:30 GMT) outside the consulate in the upmarket Clifton area. Police shot dead three attackers. Separatist militants who oppose Chinese investment projects in western Pakistan say they carried out the attack. In another incident on Friday, at least 30 people were killed in a bomb attack in north-west Pakistan. The blast occurred in a mostly Shia neighbourhood in Orakzai district. Police say a suicide bomber on a motorbike drove into a crowded marketplace. Pakistan's Shia minority has often been targeted by Sunni extremists. Three gunmen tried to enter the consulate but were stopped by guards at a checkpoint, reports said. Two of those killed in the attack were police officers. A burning vehicle near the attack site Eyewitnesses reported seeing a blast, and local TV channels broadcast images of a plume of smoke. There is a heavy police presence in the area which has been cordoned off. Is Chinese an official language in Pakistan? The other Balochistan: Life in a conflict zone All the staff inside the consulate are safe, China said. The government condemned the attack on its mission and the foreign ministry in Beijing called for extra measures to protect Chinese citizens in Pakistan. ""At the same time we mourn the deaths of the Pakistani police and think of their families at this time,"" a spokesman said. But the spokesman was keen to praise Pakistani security forces for its efforts to protect the consulate. A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, said it had carried out the attack. It is one of a number of separatist groups operating in the province, which has seen a long-running nationalist insurgency. ""We have been seeing the Chinese as an oppressor, along with Pakistani forces,"" a spokesman for the group told the AFP news agency. Over the years, construction projects and Chinese workers in Balochistan have been repeatedly targeted by militants. Most recently, a suicide bombing in August injured a number of Chinese engineers. So far, none of the incidents has been large enough in scale to really threaten the viability of Chinese investment in the country. But this is one of the most prominent attacks to date. Officials told the BBC's Stephen McDonell in Beijing they were confident the Pakistani government was able to manage the security situation to guarantee Chinese investment. A female police officer, Suhai Talpur, who led the security operation,externalduring the consulate attack is being showered with praise, BBC Monitoring reports. ""Suhai Aziz, you have set an example of bravery. These are the women who are ahead of everyone,"" Sindh provincial chief Murad Ali Shah was quoted as saying by Pakistan Today. ""They say women belong in the kitchen. Except when everyone needs a saviour,"" columnist Aisha Sarwari tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Suhai Talpur joined the police force after passing the country's civil services exam in 2013, according to local media. ""When my parents decided to enrol me at a school, most of our relatives started taunting my family. So much so, that my family had to leave our village and move to a nearby town,"" she is quoted as telling The Express Tribune. By Secunder Kermani, BBC Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad Balochistan is a sparsely populated region, and has remained Pakistan's most impoverished area despite being rich in gas and coal reserves, as well as copper and gold. Baloch nationalists have long accused the central government of exploitation, and denying the province its due rights. The area is at the heart of an ambitious Chinese project, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The corridor is a string of huge investments by China in Pakistani infrastructure, which aim to link its western Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea port of Gwadar in Balochistan, as part of theOne Belt, One Road initiative. Risky road: China's missionaries follow Beijing west Is China-Pakistan 'silk road' a game-changer? China has poured billions into Pakistan, and thousands of Chinese nationals visit the country to work on CPEC projects or other business ventures. Pakistan is keen to ensure nothing happens to jeopardise that and Chinese workers are closely guarded. The assault on the consulate is particularly significant because it took place in Karachi, the commercial capital of Pakistan, rather than in the remote province where the militants are based. The incident will deeply concern authorities who have described the Chinese funding as a ""game-changer"". What is China's One Belt, One Road? Video, 00:02:36What is China's One Belt, One Road?

"Flybe and Virgin Atlantic have confirmed they are in talks about a sale or closer alliance. The move comes after cash-strapped Flybe put itself up for sale earlier this month. The Exeter-based regional airline said that Virgin was ""one of the parties"" it has been in discussions with. Last month,Flybe warned its full-year losses would be Â£22m,blaming falling consumer demand, a weaker pound and higher fuel costs. Confirming the talks, Flybe added that there was no certainty that an offer would be made by Virgin. In a short statement, Virgin Atlantic said it ""has a trading and codeshare relationship with Flybe and confirms that it is reviewing its options in respect of Flybe which range from enhanced commercial arrangements to a possible offer for Flybe"". Since hitting a price of nearly 50p in March this year, Flybe's shares have fallen by more than three-quarters. On Friday, they jumped by nearly half to 14.3p. Aviation analyst Andrew Charlton, from Aviation Advocacy, said Virgin Atlantic was likely lured to the beleaguered budget carrier to gain access to its take-off and landing slots at Heathrow airport. ""Flybe has a fine suite of slots across the UK, particularly at Heathrow. Any bid by Virgin would be a back-door way to get access to them and is probably cheaper than to wait to buy similar landing slots outright."" Mr Charlton said that Virgin Atlantic may also benefit from certain regional routes flown by Flybe which would deliver passengers into London for Virgin Atlantic's long-haul operations based in London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports. Flybe, whose roots date back to 1979, has 78 planes operating from smaller airports such as London City, Southampton, Cardiff, Belfast City, Aberdeen and Norwich to destinations in the UK and Europe. It serves about eight million passengers a year, but has been struggling to recover from an expensive IT overhaul and has been trying to reduce costs.

"Bishop told the court he was wrongfully arrested over the IRA bomb in Brighton A man accused of murdering two girls in 1986 has told the Old Bailey how police bullied him into making a false account, ""totally destroying"" him. Russell Bishop told the court he signed an incorrect witness statement as ""it was the only way I was going to get out of there"", the jury heard. Bishop denies murdering Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway in a second trial. He said he considered killing himself and his two children after he was acquitted in a first trial in 1987. Karen Hadaway (left) and Nicola Fellows went missing after they had gone out to play The court has heard how the girls were found dead in Wild Park, near Brighton, on 10 October 1986, a day after they went missing. In 1990, Bishop - formerly of Brighton - went on to be jailed for life for the kidnap, sexual assault and attempted murder of a seven-year-old girl at Devil's Dyke on the South Downs. Two teenagers who initially discovered Nicola and Karen have told jurors Bishop never touched them. But the court has also heard claims Bishop touched the bodies and checked for a pulse, which may explain the DNA evidence that has presented in the case, the second time he has been tried over their deaths. Jurors heard both Bishop and his father faced wrongful arrests before the Babes in the Wood murder investigation - Bishop told the court he was wrongfully detained over the Grand Hotel bombing in Brighton in 1984. Giving evidence, Bishop described how he had joined the search for the girl but was warned by his father - who had himself previously been wrongly arrested for murder - not to get involved. He said when a man raised the alarm the girls had been found, he was told to go up the scene and keep people away. ""I went straight to the victims, felt for a pulse, neck on Nicola and Karen on the right arm,"" he said. Bishop told jurors he felt ""shocked, totally sickened"". He went on to tell the court he was interviewed by police for 13 hours without a solicitor. He said: ""I started getting all frustrated, confused, tied up in knots."" The girls' bodies were found in a woodland den in Wild Park, near Brighton He claimed officers showed him pictures of the dead girls and the area where they were found. Defending, Joel Bennathan QC said: ""By the end of this process, you signed a witness statement that said you did not take the pulse of the two girls."" Bishop said: ""I was just telling them what they wanted to hear. It was obvious they were not going to believe me over what those two boys were saying. ""I was being called a liar. They had been downright nasty. I was being kept a prisoner. ""I was having two police officers bullying and totally destroying me in that room. ""I'm dyslexic and I could not read or write. I had poor problem-solving skills."" The day they disappeared Bishop was acquitted of the murders in 1987 but now faces a second trial In the witness stand, Bishop told jurors what he did on 9 October 1986, the day the girls disappeared: He described how he went digging for fishing bait and later tried to visit Dougie Judd, a lodger staying with Nicola's father Barrie Fellows. Bishop said he also went to the University of Sussex's car park to try to steal a red Ford Escort. As he walked home, wearing a ""blue flecky jumper"", he said he came across the park keeper in Wild Park and saw the girls from a distance. From there, he went to Angie Cutting's home to buy a ""small amount of cannabis"" and rolled it into a joint. Once home, Bishop said he had a bath, which was interrupted by an insurance salesman, and he then began cooking a meal and washing the clothes that had ""muck"" on them from his walk. After cooking, he said he watched the last five or 10 minutes of EastEnders and later, his partner Jennie Johnson returned home with their young son and they watched a film called Runaway Train. Bishop then told the court at 02:30 the next day, police first arrived at the house and asked him if he could help with the missing girls. Mr Bennathan earlier told the court that if Bishop touched the bodies there is an explanation for DNA evidence on a Pinto sweatshirt linking Bishop with the girls. The barrister said: ""Did Russell Bishop touch the bodies of the girls when they were discovered on October 10 - because if he did take their pulses then there is an obvious simple explanation why he knew what they looked like and the DNA."" Bishop was tried for the murders in 1987, but acquitted. He now faces a second trial. Over the attack on the girl he was jailed for, he told the jury he was ""deeply ashamed"" of what he had done. Mr Bennathan said Bishop had spent 28 years behind bars for the 1990 attack, adding: ""Russell Bishop admittedly committed awful shameful offences in 1990. He's not on trial for them."" Bishop told the court he nearly threw himself and his two children off Beachy Head after the first trial. He said he had numerous bricks lobbed through his windows and firebombs through the letter box after his acquittal, adding: ""There was never a day something did not happen."" After he was cleared, Sussex Police had said they were not looking for anyone else, implying ""the jury got it wrong"", Bishop said. He said weeks before he attacked the seven-year-old girl, he set off for the Sussex cliffs with his children, but he said: ""My son said something in the car which made me rethink and drive away. ""I went to the beach to clear my head. Went for a walk with the children. ""It's hard to put into words, symptoms of mental illness. There was no sleeping. There was no resting. I was living in fear."" The trial continues.

"Sandra Parks, 13, was shot dead in her home in Milwaukee ""We are in a state of chaos. In the city in which I live, I hear and see examples of chaos almost every day. Little children are victims of senseless gun violence..."" Two years ago, 11-year-old Milwaukee schoolgirl Sandra Parks wrote these words in an award-winning essay about the murders in her city. On Monday night, aged 13, she was shot by a stray bullet fired into her home. Her frantic family called 911, but Sandra died at the scene. The girl's mother, Bernice Parks, told police she had gone to bed early while her children watched TV. She woke to the sound of gunshots shortly before 20:00, and found her daughter bleeding on the floor. ""She said, 'Momma, I'm shot. Call the police,'"" Ms Parks told TV station WITI. ""I looked at her. She didn't cry. She wasn't hollering. She was just so peaceful... She didn't deserve to leave this world like that."" America's gun culture in 10 charts Five reasons US gun control won't happen Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett described the situation as ""insanity"", telling reporters: ""Tragically, her death was caused by someone who just decided they were going to shoot bullets into her house, and she's dead. A 13-year-old, on Thanksgiving week, on a school night, in her bedroom, and she died."" Mr Barrett speculated that the shooter may have wanted to ""settle a score, express anger, try to scare someone"", saying on Tuesday: ""All we know is that a 13-year-old died last night in her bedroom."" Midwestern paper the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that one suspect, Isaac D. Barnes, has been charged with homicide,externaland a second man, Untrell Oden, faces two counts for allegedly helping to safeguard two guns. Isaac Barnes (L) and Untrell Oden have been charged in connection with the shooting Mr Barnes' ex-girlfriend reportedly flagged his possible involvement to a police officer at the scene. She said he had approached her parked car on a nearby street carrying an assault-style rifle and wearing a mask. She said he swore at her and told her ""you lucky the kids are in the car. I was gonna fan you down."" Police found Mr Barnes in a nearby home, hiding in a closet. Milwaukee's murder rate has been falling since a spike between 2014 and 2015,external, but the city still ranks among America's most deadly,FBI figures show,external. Sandra was a student at Keefe Avenue School, and her essay - which she called ""Our Truth"" - had won third place in the Milwaukee Public Schools' yearly Martin Luther King Jr. essay contest. She spoke to Wisconsin Public Radio in January 2017, saying she yearned to ""stop all the violence and... negativity that's going on"". ""All you hear about is somebody dying and somebody getting shot. People do not just think about whose father or son or granddaughter or grandson was just killed,"" she said. Stray bullets: The girl shot in the play area Pro-gun tweet provokes doctors' fury Ms Parks told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel her daughter was ""everything this world is not"". ""My baby was not violent. My baby did not like violence,"" she said. ""Everybody she knew, everybody that came past, she made them happy."" This video can not be played Bullets and bills: The cost of getting shot in America Milwaukee Public Schools said Sandra is the seventh child at a district school to be murdered in 2018. At a vigil outside her home on Tuesday night, her grieving mother acknowledged that grim toll. ""I understand that there was a lot of kids that passed away recently and I wouldn't say that my baby was better than the rest,"" she said. ""But God, Jesus, Lord have mercy... ""Lord have mercy knows, she was a star that was trying to get out, but she didn't know how."" Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

"Google removed an ad for this official-looking website Google says it will stop ads for expensive unofficial Esta services appearing at the top of search results, eight years after the first complaints. In 2010, the US startedcharging UK travellersto use the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (Esta). Unofficial sites charging five times as much as the US government soon flooded the top of Google's search results, despite breaking Google's ad rules. Now, after a BBC News investigation, Google says it is tackling the issue. While unofficial Esta sites will still appear in the search results, they should no longer appear above the official website as advertisements when using the most common search terms. Since it has used machine learning to address the issue, the ads do still show up for some search terms. Google says this will improve in time. Theofficial Esta website,externalis run by the US Department for Homeland Security. It charges $14 (Â£10.70) for each Esta application. But countless unofficial sites appeared at the top of Google search results by buying advertisements. These unofficial sites charged more than $80 for an Esta application. Google's advertising policies explicitly forbid ""charging for products or services where the primary offering is available from a government or public source for free or at a lower price"". The company did take down ads that were manually reported by its users, but the same websites would soon reappear with a new web address. It was a fruitless game of ""whack a mole"". The BBC sent several unofficial Esta ads to Google and asked why they had been allowed to remain on the platform. One of the websites advertised on Google was charging $99 (Â£76) per Esta. Google took the ads down, but others immediately filled the space. An ad for this Esta site was also taken down After the BBC supplied more of the unofficial Esta ads, Google said it would look into the problem. It later said it had been able to develop its machine learning process to wipe out the unofficial Esta ads. Following the change, commonly used Esta search terms no longer carry ads for the unofficial services. Some less common searches may still return ads while the algorithm continues to learn, but the most obvious ones such as ""esta"" should no longer show ads, it said. Other countries including Australia and Canada also have travel permits similar to the Esta. Just like the Esta, there are countless unofficial websites offering Australia ETA and Canadian ETA permits at inflated prices. Ads for these services have also been prominent on Google. But the search giant said it would use the same machine learning systems to eliminate these too. In a statement, Google said: ""We know that people look to Google ads for information about where to get goods and services, so we are committed to ensuring that the ads they see are useful and relevant. ""We use a combination of algorithmic and human review to catch and remove bad ads; and we continue to update our policies and methods of enforcement."" It said it encouraged people to report ads that slipped through the system, so they could be manually reviewed.

"The former EDL leader will advise Mr Batten on prison reform and rape gangs UKIP leader Gerard Batten has defended his decision to hire Tommy Robinson as an adviser and says he had saved the party ""from oblivion"". His predecessor Nigel Farage criticised UKIP's association with the ex-English Defence League leader and said there should be a vote of no confidence in Mr Batten. Mr Batten said many people respected Mr Robinson's ""stand on things"". And he claimed Mr Farage had shown ""0% interest"" in UKIP since ""walking away"". Mr Batten, who is the fourth person to lead UKIP since Mr Farage quit in the wake of the 2016 EU referendum, said he believed he would see off any challenge to his leadership. Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, will advise him on rape gangs and prison reform. UKIP AMs say Robinson should not get membership Paypal stops payments for Tommy Robinson Gerard Batten on Tommy Robinson In May, the 35-year old former EDL leader was jailed for 13 months for contempt of court, which sparked a series of #freeTommy protests. His conviction was later quashed over procedural concerns and the casehas now been referred to the attorney general. Mr Robinson had previously been sentenced to 18 months in jail in January 2014 for mortgage fraud and for 10 months in January 2013 for a passport offence. Asked whether it was appropriate to take advice from someone with a criminal record, Mr Batten said those with ""minor convictions"" deserved a second chance. He told BBC News that Tommy Robinson was a ""high profile"" figure who had been ""persecuted by the state because of his views"". ""I think he's a good person to have on side, a lot of people respect his stand on things and his courage."" Mr Batten said he had the support of the party's ruling body He rejected concerns expressed by Mr Farage and other MEPs, several of whom have quit the party in recent months, that UKIP was becoming tainted with Islamophobia. ""Islamophobic is a made up wordâ¦ I don't have an irrational fear of Islam, nor does Tommy Robinson."" Mr Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today earlier that, under his leadership, the party had talked about mass immigration and extreme forms of Islam but ""as a non-racist, non-sectarian party"". ""This blows a hole in all of that."" While he had not ""given up"" on UKIP, he said he would be writing to the party's ruling National Executive Committee urging a vote of no confidence in Mr Batten as leader and ""that we get rid of him"". ""We can have one last go at getting rid of somebody who as leader is dragging us in a shameful direction."" But Mr Batten said he believed he had the support of UKIP's NEC after rescuing the party from potential financial collapse. He suggested Mr Farage was now more interested in his role with Leave Means Leave, the pro-Brexit campaign group, than UKIP. Nigel Farage was UKIP leader for much of time between 2006 and 2016 ""It's down to me that this party has survived, not Nigel Farage nor anybody else,"" he said. ""Nigel walked away from UKIP two years ago and hasn't shown any interest in it since."" UKIP was still in the vanguard of the Brexit fight, he argued, and Mr Robinson's presence would increase numbers at a demonstration the party was planning next month. On Sunday, UKIP's NEC deferred a decision on allowing members to vote on Mr Robinson joining the party. The decision was postponed until after 29 March 2019 - the day the UK is due to leave the EU - with the NEC arguing the party should be focused on Brexit. Currently, UKIP has a blanket ban on allowing former members of the British National Party and the EDL from joining the party - meaning Mr Robinson is barred. Last week, some UKIP members of the Welsh Assemblysaid Mr Robinson should not be allowed to join.

"The tiara was designed for Winifred, Duchess of Portland to wear at the 1902 coronation of King Edward VII Thieves have used power tools to smash an armoured glass case and steal a diamond-encrusted tiara ""worth millions"". The Portland Tiara was stolen in a heist on the Welbeck Estate in Worksop, Nottinghamshire. It was created for Winifred, Duchess of Portland, to wear to the 1902 coronation of King Edward VII. An expert said he feared it could be broken up and the diamonds sold off separately. Police said they believed a silver Audi S5 found burnt out in Cross Lane, Blidworth, had been used by the thieves. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The tiara is centred on the Portland Diamond, which is flanked by two diamond drops and other pendant diamonds, all set in gold and silver. The burglars broke into thePortland Collection Gallery,externalbetween 21:45 and 22:00 GMT on Tuesday and snatched the object as alarms sounded. Winifred Anna Dallas-Yorke, Duchess of Portland, wearing the tiara ""Security services missed the thieves by 90 seconds and the police arrived on the scene two minutes later,"" said a spokesperson for the Welbeck Estate. Nottinghamshire Police said it was following ""a number of lines of inquiry"" but attention was focused on the recovered car. The Portland Collection is part of the Harley Gallery which is housed on the estate Richard Edgcumbe, curator of jewellery at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, described the jewelled headpiece as ""one of the great historic tiaras of Great Britain"". James Lewis from Bamford auctioneers in Derby said it had been ""designed in a period when money was no object"". Mr Lewis said: ""It could be worth millions - but it is such a well-known piece it can't come up for public sale. ""The most horrendous thought is it could be something called a 'breaker', where the diamonds are taken out and sold individually."" A diamond brooch made from stones removed when the tiara was remodelled was also stolen in the raid.

"Black Friday is upon us and this year many retailers have extended their deals for the whole week. And hot on its heels will be Cyber Monday, a phrase coined back in 2005 when online shopping needed promotion, but is increasingly becoming less relevant. There will be bargains to be had but shoppers need to keep their wits about them. Here are some top tips. iPhone 11 - probably not in a half price sale You're unlikely to get 50% off the latest iPhone. Newer products are still going to sell well at their original price so there is less incentive for firms to put them on offer - especially tech devices. Consumer website Which? also suggests being cautious about apparently amazing offers on unknown brands. It found that one in five Black Friday shoppers did not read any reviews of the products they bought and advised people to do their research and be wary of unusual brands. How to check if Black Friday is cheaper Fake online reviews 'for sale on internet' Watch out too for unfamiliar stores that significantly undercut their rivals. Trustpilot,externalandReviews.co.uk,externalare two popular sites where you can draw on past customers' experiences. In addition, it can be worth double-checking whether the retailer is based outside the EU as that might signal they are selling ""grey market"" items that the manufacturer's regional division will not fix or replace if something goes wrong. Sending a camera or phone back overseas for repair could easily wipe out any savings you might make. If you do spot a good deal, bear in mind that some stores change their prices several times a day, so it may not last. In some cases you can guard against this by sticking the product in your shopping cart before double-checking it's a bargain by searching elsewhere. If the store puts the price up in the meantime, you should still be able to complete the deal at the earlier advertised cost. And if it's gone down, you can empty the basket and then add the product back in again to take advantage of the change. There are also several websites, apps and browser plug-ins that can aid you on your shopping quest. One of the most famous iscamelcamelcamel,external, which allows you to see a product's historic prices on Amazon and set up alerts to tell you if it drops to a desired price point. Keepa offers a similar service,external. You have to log in to use it, but it offers simple ways to check if prices are cheaper on eBay as well as providing an opportunity to dive deeper into the data. This video can not be played Consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith's top tips for online shopping If you prefer Argos to the US retail giants, you should tryPriceHistory instead,external. It lists past prices for items sold by the UK chain rather than drawing you charts, but has a clear user interface and also highlights the biggest reductions of the day by product category. Voucher codes can also help cut prices further. There's plenty of sites to find them, but you can also speed up the process by adding an extension such asPouch,externalorPriceBlink,external, which automatically flag relevant codes for the online store you are currently visiting. Alternatively,Honey,externalpromises to carry out a voucher-scan of its own at checkout and automatically fills in the best code for you if one is available. In addition, you can draw on other people's bargain-spotting skills by checking outHotUKDeals,external,LatestDeals.co.uk,externaland theMoneySavingExpert forums,external- all of which offer finds and comments submitted by other members of the public. And you could always abandon your basket, by filling it and then not checking out. Sometimes retailers entice you to finish the purchase by offering further discounts. Beware of email deals that sound too good to be true if you just click that link - and check website addresses very carefully. ""Making a website look identical to a well-known retail brand is horribly easy,"" says Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University. ""Try not to use a link in an email but rather go to the web address you know."" He also advises keeping an eye on your statements in the aftermath of the sales to make sure nobody else has helped themselves to your card details. Lots of high street shops are offering deals on chothes and again price comparison websites can help find the cheapest prices. If buying online, users can opt to collect items from stores to save a delivery charge and also take advantage of cashback sites such as Quidco.com which offers a Â£15 bonus when shopping via it at over 4,500 brands. If you buy anything online you have 14 days to change your mind and get a complete refund, says Sarah Pennells, editor of the consumer finance website Savvy Woman. ""You may have to pay to return the item, but if the retailer doesn't tell you whether or not you'll have to pay return postage, it's free,"" she says. Ms Pennells also advises paying on a credit card for purchases worth more than Â£100 (and less than Â£30,000) as you are better protected if the firm goes bust or you don't receive your item, than you would be if you paid by debit card.

"Flybe and Virgin Atlantic have confirmed they are in talks about a sale or closer alliance. The move comes after cash-strapped Flybe put itself up for sale earlier this month. The Exeter-based regional airline said that Virgin was ""one of the parties"" it has been in discussions with. Last month,Flybe warned its full-year losses would be Â£22m,blaming falling consumer demand, a weaker pound and higher fuel costs. Confirming the talks, Flybe added that there was no certainty that an offer would be made by Virgin. In a short statement, Virgin Atlantic said it ""has a trading and codeshare relationship with Flybe and confirms that it is reviewing its options in respect of Flybe which range from enhanced commercial arrangements to a possible offer for Flybe"". Since hitting a price of nearly 50p in March this year, Flybe's shares have fallen by more than three-quarters. On Friday, they jumped by nearly half to 14.3p. Aviation analyst Andrew Charlton, from Aviation Advocacy, said Virgin Atlantic was likely lured to the beleaguered budget carrier to gain access to its take-off and landing slots at Heathrow airport. ""Flybe has a fine suite of slots across the UK, particularly at Heathrow. Any bid by Virgin would be a back-door way to get access to them and is probably cheaper than to wait to buy similar landing slots outright."" Mr Charlton said that Virgin Atlantic may also benefit from certain regional routes flown by Flybe which would deliver passengers into London for Virgin Atlantic's long-haul operations based in London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports. Flybe, whose roots date back to 1979, has 78 planes operating from smaller airports such as London City, Southampton, Cardiff, Belfast City, Aberdeen and Norwich to destinations in the UK and Europe. It serves about eight million passengers a year, but has been struggling to recover from an expensive IT overhaul and has been trying to reduce costs.

" It’s clear which one Patricia O’Brien thinks he was as she rifles through a thick bundle of pages, each with an official looking logo in the top right-hand corner. She’s been a one-woman detective agency for four years. She believes Omagh bricklayer Noel Knox killed her younger sister, Mairéad McCallion in 2014. And she holds him responsible for the deaths of at least two other women: Diane Conway in 2002 and Katrina Fulton in 2003. All three were alcoholics who drank with Knox. People in the County Tyrone town believe he was also linked to the death of a fourth woman. “It was just through talking to other people in Omagh that we suddenly became aware that Mairéad was his fourth partner to die in very tragic circumstances,” says Patricia. “I have autopsy reports, forensic reports, I have information from the coroner’s service.” Each report details the bruises, violent injuries and the ravaging effects alcohol had on her sister’s body. But Patricia holds Noel Knox responsible. He died almost a year ago to the day - after suffering a blood clot at the age of 53. There’s a story here. There’s a story that has to be told. Omagh is a town that knows tragedy: most people you speak to have a link to the devastating Real IRA bomb in 1998. Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, were killed that day - among them was Mairéad McCallion’s best friend. Mairéad was 21 at the time. “My mother in particular noticed Mairéad sinking into a depression as a result of the Omagh bomb,” says Patricia. “And another serious incident happened around that time too.” Patricia describes Mairéad as a timid girl who became the victim of a bully when she went to university in Dundee to study accountancy. After she was beaten up on a night out, she dropped out. Never to return. Many people who knew Mairéad talk about how bright she was. How good her memory was. She was the second youngest of eight and, according to Patricia, “probably the most intelligent in our family”. After she returned to Northern Ireland, she began a traineeship with an accountancy firm, but alcohol took hold. “She was set on a path of destruction,” says her sister. “My mother would have said Mairéad is choosing alcohol to try and dull the pain of what she’s been through.” After a while, Mairéad found comfort in the arms of a local man, Noel Knox. Theirs was a violent relationship and on the morning of 23 February 2014, Knox called the police asking them to remove her from his property. Transcript of 999 call “There’s a disturbance at 6 Castleview Court in Omagh,” Knox said, according to the 999 call transcript. He’d already thrown her out of the house into the cold Sunday morning. She wasn’t wearing shoes and was banging on the door and window, demanding her coat and handbag. Knox had told Mairéad not to let anyone else in while he was out drinking at a nearby house. But she’d let in a man known as “Clown” who asked her to phone Noel. He came back in a rage, shouting at them both to get out. When officers arrived, Mairéad showed them a fistful of her brown hair and told them: “He pulled my hair, banged my head and threw me into the garden.” Mairéad died the next day. After spending hours at the police station, she began vomiting and passed out in the police car as she was brought to a friend’s house. She was rushed to hospital but it was too late. Patricia and the family were called to come and say their goodbyes. Mairéad McCallion's death certificate Under “cause of death”, her death certificate reads: “Subdural haemorrhage” - a bleed in the brain. It’s something that haunts Patricia O’Brien. “There was only police involvement in Mairéad's death because Noel Knox phoned the police to remove her from his house,” she says. “Had he not done that we’d have never known the truth on that day.” We have always known that Noel Knox killed Mairéad, there was never any doubt in our minds. Noel was arrested and charged with murder. It would be as close as he would ever come to sitting in a dock, as prosecutors withdrew the charge seven months after Mairéad's death. The McCallion family were told the evening before he was due in court for a remand hearing. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) had been told a further medical report had cast doubt on the cause and timing of Mairéad’s death. In 2017, an inquest was finally held. Last autumn, coroner Patrick McGurgan went as far as it was legally possible to go in blaming Knox for Mairéad’s death. “I find that the trauma sustained was an impact to the deceased’s head and that it occurred on the morning of Sunday 23 February 2014 whilst the deceased was being removed from 6 Castleview Court by her then partner,” he said. Coronial law restricts the naming of blamed individuals, but it’s clear who Mr McGurgan was referring to. Violence had been a hallmark of Mairéad’s relationship with Noel Knox. People remember her being frail and unsteady on her feet, aggravated by her alcoholism. She had a propensity for falling and banging into things. But she was also being hit, it seems regularly, by Knox. Her autopsy recorded three pages outlining injuries to her body, including more than 50 bruises. “The abuse was horrific,” recalls Patricia, who only discovered the extent of the violence when Mairéad first admitted it to the family two years before her death. “It was at times of a sexual nature, it was very manipulative. It was very controlling.” And, it seems, the violence was documented. Police found photographs of Mairéad’s injuries on Knox’s phone. There was one particular photograph… police told us she had two black eyes and a broken nose...  he had it as his screensaver. On occasions Mairéad had gone to police, but she had a tendency to backtrack. A letter in her neat handwriting was discovered in a jotter after her death: I made an accusation of assault. To me it was not an ‘accusation’ because the assault did happen. “But my reasoning for withdrawing my statement is for personal reasons. ""However I do want to state the fact that I do not tell lies. “To  put  it  in  a  nutshell, I  cannot  go  through  this  again. I apologise to the PSNI. ""Did he put me up to this? ""Well I think everybody knows the answer to that question. “Again I want to state the fact that I want to withdraw my statement. No proceeding against Mr Knox.” The jotter also contained poetry. Mairéad would create black humour, punning Knox with knocks to describe how he would ""knock her lamps out"". The famous Ulster colloquialism fused with his surname in a play on words - but there was nothing playful about it. A large H-shaped red metal structure with a sign on the crossbar saying “Welcome to Mullaghmore” announces your arrival. It’s a network of cul-de-sacs and short dark-brown brick terraces. It’s easy to get disorientated if you’re not from the area. This was Noel Knox’s patch. It’s where he got to know his girlfriends. He’d grown up here and was living in one of the yellow bungalows at the bottom of the hill in nearby Castleview Court. There are a lot of steps throughout the estate and from the higher ground you can see down to an electrical substation. The wind can be biting up at the top. There’s not much in the way of shelter. There’s a playground and lots of grassy areas but we didn’t see any children playing there on any of our visits. In fact, you rarely see anyone. The first people we encountered were plain-clothed police officers removing evidence bags filled with computer equipment from one of the houses. We began by trying to find No 61. A friendly woman going into her home explained that about five years ago a number of abandoned flats on the estate were knocked down. No 61 was one of them. It has since been replaced by a conservatory and a parking space. No 61 was divided into two flats, one of which was used by a circle of drinkers from in and around the estate. They’d gather with their cans and plastic bottles of cider. In 2002, one of Knox’s girlfriends died the month before her 31st birthday. Diane Conway's death certificate Diane Conway died in his arms, he later said. The mother-of-two lived in a large bungalow, not far from the Mullaghmore estate. She had increasingly turned to drink after her marriage broke up. Before long, she and Noel Knox were an item. Things for Diane took a downward turn. She suffered from epilepsy, apparently made worse by her addiction to alcohol, although she knew when a fit was coming and would call for help. In the height of summer, she died after a seizure. Noel Knox was with her. He didn’t call for help. He did eventually phone one of her family members, but by the time they arrived, it was too late. The family got on with life as best they could. And no one else consideredNoel Knox’s link to the young woman’s death. Until nine years later. We can piece together what happened that August evening in 2011 from court transcripts. The Cellar Bar, Omagh Noel Knox was drinking at the Cellar Bar, a small place in the centre of the town, close to the river Strule one Friday afternoon. He was playing pool. At some point during the evening, 26-year-old Mark McGlone came into the pub. He played pool with Knox. They got talking. The younger man mentioned his dead sister, Diane – he’d been only 18 when she died. That’s when he found out Noel Knox  was the man who’d failed to call for medical help as she was dying. His defence barrister would later admit McGlone “flipped”. He went outside, broke a glass and came back into the bar, pinning Noel Knox down and slashing his face and throat. Knox needed 16 stitches to his throat and 14 to his face. The barman jumped over the bar, restrained McGlone and heard him say: “That bastard killed my sister… I’d do it again.” McGlone was charged with attempted murder and later admitted a GBH charge. The court heard that he was a quiet and private man who’d never been in trouble with the law before. He was sentenced to five years for the attack – two of whichwere to be spent in prison. A year after Diane Conway’s death in 2002, a woman was found lying at the bottom of a stairway in Mullaghmore with a serious head injury. In her 50s and part of the circle of drinkers, she has been described as “a big woman” who was kind and confident. She was known for always wearing Scholl sandals, whatever the weather. We’ve been told she was found at the foot of the stairs by Noel Knox, which was enough to arouse local suspicion. Forensic investigators made a full examination of the scene, but never released their findings. Olive Wiley has a mixture of brisk efficiency and warmth and it’s no surprise to find out she was a nurse. Now retired, for decades she worked in intensive care at the now closed Tyrone county hospital – including in the dark days after the Omagh bomb. She’s still dealing with those memories. Olive has never got over the death of her younger sister Katrina – Reenie to her family – who died in 2006. The way their large family worked, you looked after the sibling next in line. Katrina was Olive’s responsibility. And that weighs heavily on her. Katrina Fulton – her married name – was always a free spirit. She thought it was funny to keep Olive on her toes, her sister recalls - one time going missing for several weeks until Olive tracked her down. But the sisters were very close – and Katrina kept in touch with relatives throughout Ireland and England. “She’d have been able to tell you what anybody was doing and what was happening with their kids,” says Olive. On the surface, Katrina’s life looked picture perfect. “Katrina was really, really tidy, her house was absolutely perfect, she just seemed to have her life so under control, her kids were always immaculately dressed.” But when Katrina’s marriage ended, she turned to alcohol. Gradually, she became part of the circle of drinkers on the Mullaghmore estate. Olive would call around to Katrina’s house on the estate regularly, often after a busy shift at the hospital. After all, she was the sister charged with keeping an eye on Katrina. She got to know the circle and liked them. The only one Olive never liked was Noel Knox, who she describes as obnoxious, nasty and rude. “I hated him,” she says. “He wasn’t a pleasant person. When you went into the house and there were a number of people there. He always had to be the dominant person, the person who was speaking the loudest. Olive and Noel argued. Whatever the subject, Noel knew better, she says – even when Olive was advising Katrina to take her medication. Olive would ask him to leave her alone with her sister and Noel would refuse. Katrina always backed Noel up. Katrina never admitted to Olive that she was in a relationship with Noel, but her sister is confident she was. The circle of drinkers fell apart – some died, some went their separate ways, until it was only ever Noel that she saw when she went to Katrina’s house. Sometimes her sister wouldn’t let her in and would shout out the window that she wasn’t to come in as she would only fight with Noel. Sometimes Olive was happy enough to leave, knowing Katrina was OK without having got through the door. Katrina often had bruises, but as a nurse Olive knew she was more prone to them because of her heavy drinking. She didn’t particularly worry until the hospital phoned her three years before Katrina’s death to say that she had suffered a head injury. When Olive got there, Katrina was having stitches applied to the wound. She was drunk and confused and it was not clear what had happened. As she was being taken to the ward, Katrina’s condition suddenly deteriorated. She’d had a massive bleed in her brain. Doctors held out little hope but, miraculously, Olive says, Katrina recovered. After a week, Katrina returned to her house. From then on, Olive says Katrina let few people other than Noel into her home. Katrina thought he looked after her, says Olive. “He was doing things like getting money out with her bank card and probably buying alcohol for both of them,” she says. I just think that he bullied her and manipulated her and made her believe that he was the only person that she needed to be around. Olive still called around but more often than not, her sister wouldn’t let her in. Olive thinks she was frightened of angering Knox. One April day in 2006, another relative of Katrina’s went to check on her. “He came into the house and went up the stairs and walked into the bedroom and Noel Knox was standing there,” says Olive. “As soon as he walked into the bedroom Noel Knox walked out.” The relative went over to the bed and found Katrina seriously ill, in a semi-conscious state. He rang Olive. They couldn’t get an ambulance so she helped him carry Katrina to her car. As they were putting her in, Noel Knox re-appeared. “He came slinking around the corner and said: ‘Did I leave my coat in there?’” He went into the house, got his coat and left without asking how Katrina was. He never did ask about her condition. Days later, she died. Katrina Fulton's death certificate Katrina Fulton’s death certificate records her death as due to broncho-pneumonia, caused by advanced liver failure, due to cirrhosis of the liver. But Olive says her sister seemed normal when she had seen her just a few days earlier. “I just wonder at that man being in that room and what he could have done to her,” she says. She can’t understand why Noel Knox didn’t call an ambulance for her sister. “He wasn’t doing anything, he wasn’t making any attempt to help her, or get help for her, or tell anyone that she was ill.” She now wishes the police had investigated how Katrina had become so ill, so quickly. “I think they just assumed it was her alcoholism made her semi-conscious without looking to see if it could have been something different.” She remembers clearly what a medical professional said to her about the Mullaghmore circle: “It’s just a drinking den, they’re all drinkers and they’re all gradually going to die off.” Olive questions how fully the authorities investigate the deaths of alcoholics. Just because they were drunk, doesn’t mean that whatever happened to them just happened out of drunkenness. That’s something Coroner Joe McCrisken rejects. “It’s never assumed that this is a person who has died because they’ve had a high level of alcohol taken,” he says. “The fact that someone has chronic alcoholism and a medic or pathologist thinks that is the cause of death, if I think there are other issues around that, I’ll question that.” Olive is a childhood friend of the journalist Anton McCabe. After the inquest into the death of Mairéad McCallion in 2017, he put her in touch with Patricia O’Brien. As they spoke on the phone, the two women noticed striking similarities in their sisters’ relationships with Noel Knox. They compared how their sisters became isolated from their families, how they were pursued by Knox, how he used to phone or text them “non-stop” when they were away from him. Patricia recalled her sister, Mairéad. Mairéad was a smart girl but he had beat her down so much that she thought nobody else loved her and that’s what he was constantly telling her. Olive spoke about her sister Katrina. “I believe he was controlling her and anything that happened in her life was directly connected to him.” It was then that Olive felt she had to speak out about what had happened to Katrina. Photos of the man some called “Knoxy” show an unremarkable looking man, grey in pallor with the pot belly of a drinker. While Anton McCabe didn’t know him personally - they went to the same school, but not at the same time - he knew Knox by reputation. He was known as “a hard man” or “a hood”, he says. He was somebody not to be messed with, somebody with a degree of menace. ""Many would have said that if you didn’t cross him he was ok.” Noel Knox died suddenly in November 2017 after phoning an ambulance complaining of breathing difficulties. On his death certificate, his occupation was listed as “bricklayer”, although for 16 years he cared full-time for his brother Brian, who had MS. Brian died 18 months before Noel, and the brothers share a grave next to a small church outside Omagh. Two more brothers and Noel’s father are also buried nearby. Theirs was a large family, and the nine children were brought up on the Mullaghmore estate, which is where we go looking to find out more about Noel Knox. We knock on the door of one of his sisters, who says she is glad to have the opportunity to clear her brother’s name. She asks us not to identify her but brings us into her kitchen and talks at length about the brother to whom she says she was very close. “It was terrible to read all those lies,” she says. I knew Noel and there’s no way he abused them. And to class him as a serial killer… they made Noel out to be a monster. The man described by Olive Wiley bears no relation to the brother she remembers. Noel was easy-going and he was a very helpful and kind person. She says he was good company, often cracking jokes and making up funny stories. She knew all his girlfriends and got on with them, although she says they were all “drinkers” whom she urged him to stay away from. “He’d say: ‘Oh I know, that’s not the girl for me,’” she recalls. Noel wasn’t an alcoholic, she says, arguing he couldn’t have been because he had to look after Brian. Olive Wiley also noticed that Noel didn’t seem to drink as much as the others in the Mullaghmore circle, although both women say he was often the one who would go and buy alcohol. “Any time they would want anything to drink he would go and get the drink,” says Knox’s sister. His girlfriends “took advantage” of her brother’s good nature, she says. “I suppose he would have been lonely as well. They all had drink problems and Noel would take them in and care for them.” Noel Knox’s sister is clearly angry at Patricia O’Brien and Olive Wiley’s allegations. She denies Katrina was in a relationship with Noel Knox, saying they were just friends. She knew Mairéad McCallion well as Noel’s girlfriend and liked her. Although she was often bruised, that was only because she fell over so much and was so thin, adds Knox’s sister: The injuries had nothing to do with Noel. His sister couldn’t believe it when Noel was charged with her murder. She says she accompanied him to the courthouse every day during last autumn’s inquest into Mairéad’s death. He died weeks after the inquest ended. The media’s representation of him as a serial killer was “part of putting a nail in Noel’s coffin”, she says. She rejects the suggestion there could have been another side to Noel, a side she didn’t know about. “I knew all sides of Noel,” she says. OK, he might get a bit angry and a bit annoyed… but (he) wouldn’t go and lift your head and bang you against the wall. Noel had another girlfriend before he died, and we track her down to a well-kept semi-detached house in a quiet development in Omagh. While she says she knew Mairéad well from a support group for alcoholic women, she says Noel was very good to her during the two years they were together. He was never violent towards her and the allegations against him were unfair, she adds. She is still close to his family and was set to join them at a Mass on the anniversary of his death on 22 November. We needed to find out more about the woman found dead on the steps in 2003 – labelled by some as Knox’s second alleged victim. Several people tell us she was part of Knox’s drinking circle, and Olive Wiley says she saw the woman with Katrina. But we can find no evidence she was ever in a relationship with Noel Knox; one of her sisters denied she even knew him. When the woman died, forensic officers investigated the scene and a post-mortem examination was carried out. Coroner Joe McCrisken says it was clear foul play was not involved in the death: Noel Knox may have discovered her body, but that appears to have just been an unfortunate coincidence. Omagh is still small enough for most people to know each other. A conversation with Anton McCabe in a local café is repeatedly interrupted by locals nodding and saying hello to him. Over a latte the freelance journalist points out those around us and wonders aloud if they could help us build a picture of Noel Knox. One passer-by went to school with Knox, another’s sister lived next to Knox’s cousin. “Man May Have Killed Four” was one of the articles Anton wrote at the time of Knox’s death. The tabloids picked the story up and the “serial killer” title was attached to Noel Knox. From behind a shaggy beard, Anton describes how Noel and his link to four sudden deaths of women in Omagh had been the talk of the town. “So much of what was in the rumour mill stood up as true,” he says. I believe that Noel Knox was Omagh’s serial killer. He sips his latte. “I believe it because there was a history of women becoming involved personally with Noel Knox and ending up dead.” “People felt they had put the pieces together. They were saying that Noel Knox was a serial killer.” The FBI defines a serial killer as anyone responsible for two deaths. According to Peter Hepper, professor of psychology at Queens University, Belfast, a more commonly accepted definition is someone who kills three or more people, often with a “cooling-off period in between”. The timings of Knox’s alleged victims’ deaths – 2002, 2006 and 2014 - certainly point to “cooling-off periods.” “There is no one profile that says a person is likely to be a serial killer,” he says. “They can be male, female, 10 years old, up to 60 years old. They can be people in professions, people on the street. Anyone can be a serial killer. But while the attackers can be very different types of people, their victims tend to fit more of a formula, says Prof Hepper. “A lot of serial killers target a certain type, so whether it’s male, female, it may be a certain type of hair colour, a certain context. People who are powerless and who are easier to control are often more likely to become victims. If anything ties Knox’s victims together, it is their alcoholism and the chaotic lifestyles they led. Pat Fahy’s legal practice sits in the shadow of Omagh courthouse. He’s been a solicitor in the town for 48 years. The McCallions are long-term clients; he knows the family well. The case of Mairéad McCallion got under his skin, he says, and he was shocked the Public Prosecution Service dropped the murder charge against Noel Knox. His repeated lobbying on behalf of the family to re-instate the charges was never successful. After last year’s inquest into Mairéad’s death, the family hoped prosecutors would move to charge Knox. After all, a coroner had found that the head injury Mairéad had received while being removed from the property at Castleview Court had led to her death. “There was more than sufficient evidence to mount a case and have the jury decide whether or not Knox was guilty either of murder or manslaughter,” says Pat Fahy. PPS officials say that at the time of Noel Knox’s death in November 2017, they were still considering the family’s request, but had not received all the relevant documents from the inquest. They point to “inconclusive” expert medical evidence which made it impossible to ascertain when and how Mairéad McCallion suffered her fatal head injury. They also point out the higher burden of proof they require – beyond reasonable doubt – compared to a coroner, who makes a finding on the balance of probabilities. Joe McCrisken has analysed the death certificates of Diane Conway, Katrina Fulton and Mairéad McCallion. “Looking at the causes of death for all these ladies, chronic alcoholism or some form of alcoholism is there,” he says. A criminal barrister for 15 years, prosecuting and defending, before he took up his role as coroner, Joe McCrisken says there was nothing in the death certificates to indicate the work of a possible serial killer. We asked about Knox’s failure to call an ambulance before two of the women died. “If there were concerns about a failure to seek medical attention and there was good cogent evidence to underpin a request, that’s something that could be considered during an inquest,” he says. He had held inquests in those circumstances before, he says, adding that the families only needed to write to him to request the deaths of their loved ones be further investigated. There was no set test he says, in deciding whether to hold an inquest, which must merely be deemed “useful”. This is not a neat detective story. PSNI officers looked at Knox’s links to the four dead women in 2014. After a short investigation they concluded there was not enough evidence to press charges. And since Knox is dead, some of the questions about the women’s deaths can never be answered. The PPS, police and a coroner may agree that under the current system he had no legal case to answer. It’s a high bar to prove murder “beyond reasonable doubt”. As Joe McCrisken put it, you have to be 95% certain. That is a point that is almost impossible to reach when alcohol is involved: It is a perfect weapon that provides a perfect cover-up. Many alcoholic women feel too ashamed to ask for support from friends or family, which leaves them particularly vulnerable to abuse. Alcohol keeps victims compliant. It cuts off avenues of escape - many refuges don’t accept drinkers. It also changes how they are viewed by those who witness disturbing behaviour. And if they have been attacked, an alcoholic may struggle to remember, to give a clear account or perhaps even fully understand what has happened. Prosecutors can be reluctant to take forward cases involving these women, argues Orla Conway of Women’s Aid in Omagh. Very often just the impact of abuse and trauma means you aren’t able to express yourself in a clear and sequential narrativeand of course that’s what the criminal justice system wants. Most cruelly of all, perhaps, even though the mind has been compromised, after the event the body can offer little reliable evidence. Every questionable bruise and injury is contaminated with a suggestion that maybe it was due to “a drunken fall”. Whether or not Noel Knox is a serial killer, does he bear any responsibility for the women’s deaths? There are three families who believe he does. Why didn’t he call an ambulance when Diane Conway was suffering a seizure? Why was Katrina Fulton in a semi-conscious state – and why wasn’t he helping her? And why weren’t agencies working together to protect Mairéad McCallion from a man so many thought was dangerous? Predators can target and abuse vulnerable women, enabling them to drink more alcohol and become increasingly dependent if they become alienated from family and friends. The reasons for death listed on official records might not suggest foul play, instead referring to issues related to alcoholism. It doesn’t mean there are no victims.

" It’s clear which one Patricia O’Brien thinks he was as she rifles through a thick bundle of pages, each with an official looking logo in the top right-hand corner. She’s been a one-woman detective agency for four years. She believes Omagh bricklayer Noel Knox killed her younger sister, Mairéad McCallion in 2014. And she holds him responsible for the deaths of at least two other women: Diane Conway in 2002 and Katrina Fulton in 2003. All three were alcoholics who drank with Knox. People in the County Tyrone town believe he was also linked to the death of a fourth woman. “It was just through talking to other people in Omagh that we suddenly became aware that Mairéad was his fourth partner to die in very tragic circumstances,” says Patricia. “I have autopsy reports, forensic reports, I have information from the coroner’s service.” Each report details the bruises, violent injuries and the ravaging effects alcohol had on her sister’s body. But Patricia holds Noel Knox responsible. He died almost a year ago to the day - after suffering a blood clot at the age of 53. There’s a story here. There’s a story that has to be told. Omagh is a town that knows tragedy: most people you speak to have a link to the devastating Real IRA bomb in 1998. Twenty-nine people, including a woman pregnant with twins, were killed that day - among them was Mairéad McCallion’s best friend. Mairéad was 21 at the time. “My mother in particular noticed Mairéad sinking into a depression as a result of the Omagh bomb,” says Patricia. “And another serious incident happened around that time too.” Patricia describes Mairéad as a timid girl who became the victim of a bully when she went to university in Dundee to study accountancy. After she was beaten up on a night out, she dropped out. Never to return. Many people who knew Mairéad talk about how bright she was. How good her memory was. She was the second youngest of eight and, according to Patricia, “probably the most intelligent in our family”. After she returned to Northern Ireland, she began a traineeship with an accountancy firm, but alcohol took hold. “She was set on a path of destruction,” says her sister. “My mother would have said Mairéad is choosing alcohol to try and dull the pain of what she’s been through.” After a while, Mairéad found comfort in the arms of a local man, Noel Knox. Theirs was a violent relationship and on the morning of 23 February 2014, Knox called the police asking them to remove her from his property. Transcript of 999 call “There’s a disturbance at 6 Castleview Court in Omagh,” Knox said, according to the 999 call transcript. He’d already thrown her out of the house into the cold Sunday morning. She wasn’t wearing shoes and was banging on the door and window, demanding her coat and handbag. Knox had told Mairéad not to let anyone else in while he was out drinking at a nearby house. But she’d let in a man known as “Clown” who asked her to phone Noel. He came back in a rage, shouting at them both to get out. When officers arrived, Mairéad showed them a fistful of her brown hair and told them: “He pulled my hair, banged my head and threw me into the garden.” Mairéad died the next day. After spending hours at the police station, she began vomiting and passed out in the police car as she was brought to a friend’s house. She was rushed to hospital but it was too late. Patricia and the family were called to come and say their goodbyes. Mairéad McCallion's death certificate Under “cause of death”, her death certificate reads: “Subdural haemorrhage” - a bleed in the brain. It’s something that haunts Patricia O’Brien. “There was only police involvement in Mairéad's death because Noel Knox phoned the police to remove her from his house,” she says. “Had he not done that we’d have never known the truth on that day.” We have always known that Noel Knox killed Mairéad, there was never any doubt in our minds. Noel was arrested and charged with murder. It would be as close as he would ever come to sitting in a dock, as prosecutors withdrew the charge seven months after Mairéad's death. The McCallion family were told the evening before he was due in court for a remand hearing. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) had been told a further medical report had cast doubt on the cause and timing of Mairéad’s death. In 2017, an inquest was finally held. Last autumn, coroner Patrick McGurgan went as far as it was legally possible to go in blaming Knox for Mairéad’s death. “I find that the trauma sustained was an impact to the deceased’s head and that it occurred on the morning of Sunday 23 February 2014 whilst the deceased was being removed from 6 Castleview Court by her then partner,” he said. Coronial law restricts the naming of blamed individuals, but it’s clear who Mr McGurgan was referring to. Violence had been a hallmark of Mairéad’s relationship with Noel Knox. People remember her being frail and unsteady on her feet, aggravated by her alcoholism. She had a propensity for falling and banging into things. But she was also being hit, it seems regularly, by Knox. Her autopsy recorded three pages outlining injuries to her body, including more than 50 bruises. “The abuse was horrific,” recalls Patricia, who only discovered the extent of the violence when Mairéad first admitted it to the family two years before her death. “It was at times of a sexual nature, it was very manipulative. It was very controlling.” And, it seems, the violence was documented. Police found photographs of Mairéad’s injuries on Knox’s phone. There was one particular photograph… police told us she had two black eyes and a broken nose...  he had it as his screensaver. On occasions Mairéad had gone to police, but she had a tendency to backtrack. A letter in her neat handwriting was discovered in a jotter after her death: I made an accusation of assault. To me it was not an ‘accusation’ because the assault did happen. “But my reasoning for withdrawing my statement is for personal reasons. ""However I do want to state the fact that I do not tell lies. “To  put  it  in  a  nutshell, I  cannot  go  through  this  again. I apologise to the PSNI. ""Did he put me up to this? ""Well I think everybody knows the answer to that question. “Again I want to state the fact that I want to withdraw my statement. No proceeding against Mr Knox.” The jotter also contained poetry. Mairéad would create black humour, punning Knox with knocks to describe how he would ""knock her lamps out"". The famous Ulster colloquialism fused with his surname in a play on words - but there was nothing playful about it. A large H-shaped red metal structure with a sign on the crossbar saying “Welcome to Mullaghmore” announces your arrival. It’s a network of cul-de-sacs and short dark-brown brick terraces. It’s easy to get disorientated if you’re not from the area. This was Noel Knox’s patch. It’s where he got to know his girlfriends. He’d grown up here and was living in one of the yellow bungalows at the bottom of the hill in nearby Castleview Court. There are a lot of steps throughout the estate and from the higher ground you can see down to an electrical substation. The wind can be biting up at the top. There’s not much in the way of shelter.

The first people we encountered were plain-clothed police officers removing evidence bags filled with computer equipment from one of the houses. We began by trying to find No 61. A friendly woman going into her home explained that about five years ago a number of abandoned flats on the estate were knocked down. No 61 was one of them. It has since been replaced by a conservatory and a parking space. No 61 was divided into two flats, one of which was used by a circle of drinkers from in and around the estate. They’d gather with their cans and plastic bottles of cider. In 2002, one of Knox’s girlfriends died the month before her 31st birthday. Diane Conway's death certificate Diane Conway died in his arms, he later said. The mother-of-two lived in a large bungalow, not far from the Mullaghmore estate. She had increasingly turned to drink after her marriage broke up. Before long, she and Noel Knox were an item. Things for Diane took a downward turn. She suffered from epilepsy, apparently made worse by her addiction to alcohol, although she knew when a fit was coming and would call for help. In the height of summer, she died after a seizure. Noel Knox was with her. He didn’t call for help. He did eventually phone one of her family members, but by the time they arrived, it was too late. The family got on with life as best they could. And no one else consideredNoel Knox’s link to the young woman’s death. Until nine years later. We can piece together what happened that August evening in 2011 from court transcripts. The Cellar Bar, Omagh Noel Knox was drinking at the Cellar Bar, a small place in the centre of the town, close to the river Strule one Friday afternoon. He was playing pool. At some point during the evening, 26-year-old Mark McGlone came into the pub. He played pool with Knox. They got talking. The younger man mentioned his dead sister, Diane – he’d been only 18 when she died. That’s when he found out Noel Knox  was the man who’d failed to call for medical help as she was dying. His defence barrister would later admit McGlone “flipped”. He went outside, broke a glass and came back into the bar, pinning Noel Knox down and slashing his face and throat. Knox needed 16 stitches to his throat and 14 to his face. The barman jumped over the bar, restrained McGlone and heard him say: “That bastard killed my sister… I’d do it again.” McGlone was charged with attempted murder and later admitted a GBH charge. The court heard that he was a quiet and private man who’d never been in trouble with the law before. He was sentenced to five years for the attack – two of whichwere to be spent in prison. A year after Diane Conway’s death in 2002, a woman was found lying at the bottom of a stairway in Mullaghmore with a serious head injury. In her 50s and part of the circle of drinkers, she has been described as “a big woman” who was kind and confident. She was known for always wearing Scholl sandals, whatever the weather. We’ve been told she was found at the foot of the stairs by Noel Knox, which was enough to arouse local suspicion. Forensic investigators made a full examination of the scene, but never released their findings. Olive Wiley has a mixture of brisk efficiency and warmth and it’s no surprise to find out she was a nurse. Now retired, for decades she worked in intensive care at the now closed Tyrone county hospital – including in the dark days after the Omagh bomb. She’s still dealing with those memories. Olive has never got over the death of her younger sister Katrina – Reenie to her family – who died in 2006. The way their large family worked, you looked after the sibling next in line. Katrina was Olive’s responsibility. And that weighs heavily on her. Katrina Fulton – her married name – was always a free spirit. She thought it was funny to keep Olive on her toes, her sister recalls - one time going missing for several weeks until Olive tracked her down. But the sisters were very close – and Katrina kept in touch with relatives throughout Ireland and England. “She’d have been able to tell you what anybody was doing and what was happening with their kids,” says Olive. On the surface, Katrina’s life looked picture perfect. “Katrina was really, really tidy, her house was absolutely perfect, she just seemed to have her life so under control, her kids were always immaculately dressed.” But when Katrina’s marriage ended, she turned to alcohol. Gradually, she became part of the circle of drinkers on the Mullaghmore estate. Olive would call around to Katrina’s house on the estate regularly, often after a busy shift at the hospital. After all, she was the sister charged with keeping an eye on Katrina. She got to know the circle and liked them. The only one Olive never liked was Noel Knox, who she describes as obnoxious, nasty and rude. “I hated him,” she says. “He wasn’t a pleasant person. When you went into the house and there were a number of people there. He always had to be the dominant person, the person who was speaking the loudest. Olive and Noel argued. Whatever the subject, Noel knew better, she says – even when Olive was advising Katrina to take her medication. Olive would ask him to leave her alone with her sister and Noel would refuse. Katrina always backed Noel up. Katrina never admitted to Olive that she was in a relationship with Noel, but her sister is confident she was. The circle of drinkers fell apart – some died, some went their separate ways, until it was only ever Noel that she saw when she went to Katrina’s house. Sometimes her sister wouldn’t let her in and would shout out the window that she wasn’t to come in as she would only fight with Noel. Sometimes Olive was happy enough to leave, knowing Katrina was OK without having got through the door. Katrina often had bruises, but as a nurse Olive knew she was more prone to them because of her heavy drinking. She didn’t particularly worry until the hospital phoned her three years before Katrina’s death to say that she had suffered a head injury. When Olive got there, Katrina was having stitches applied to the wound. She was drunk and confused and it was not clear what had happened. As she was being taken to the ward, Katrina’s condition suddenly deteriorated. She’d had a massive bleed in her brain. Doctors held out little hope but, miraculously, Olive says, Katrina recovered. After a week, Katrina returned to her house. From then on, Olive says Katrina let few people other than Noel into her home. Katrina thought he looked after her, says Olive. “He was doing things like getting money out with her bank card and probably buying alcohol for both of them,” she says. I just think that he bullied her and manipulated her and made her believe that he was the only person that she needed to be around. Olive still called around but more often than not, her sister wouldn’t let her in. Olive thinks she was frightened of angering Knox. One April day in 2006, another relative of Katrina’s went to check on her. “He came into the house and went up the stairs and walked into the bedroom and Noel Knox was standing there,” says Olive. “As soon as he walked into the bedroom Noel Knox walked out.” The relative went over to the bed and found Katrina seriously ill, in a semi-conscious state. He rang Olive. They couldn’t get an ambulance so she helped him carry Katrina to her car. As they were putting her in, Noel Knox re-appeared. “He came slinking around the corner and said: ‘Did I leave my coat in there?’” He went into the house, got his coat and left without asking how Katrina was. He never did ask about her condition. Days later, she died. Katrina Fulton's death certificate Katrina Fulton’s death certificate records her death as due to broncho-pneumonia, caused by advanced liver failure, due to cirrhosis of the liver. But Olive says her sister seemed normal when she had seen her just a few days earlier. “I just wonder at that man being in that room and what he could have done to her,” she says. She can’t understand why Noel Knox didn’t call an ambulance for her sister. “He wasn’t doing anything, he wasn’t making any attempt to help her, or get help for her, or tell anyone that she was ill.” She now wishes the police had investigated how Katrina had become so ill, so quickly. “I think they just assumed it was her alcoholism made her semi-conscious without looking to see if it could have been something different.” She remembers clearly what a medical professional said to her about the Mullaghmore circle: “It’s just a drinking den, they’re all drinkers and they’re all gradually going to die off.” Olive questions how fully the authorities investigate the deaths of alcoholics. Just because they were drunk, doesn’t mean that whatever happened to them just happened out of drunkenness. That’s something Coroner Joe McCrisken rejects. “It’s never assumed that this is a person who has died because they’ve had a high level of alcohol taken,” he says. “The fact that someone has chronic alcoholism and a medic or pathologist thinks that is the cause of death, if I think there are other issues around that, I’ll question that.” Olive is a childhood friend of the journalist Anton McCabe. After the inquest into the death of Mairéad McCallion in 2017, he put her in touch with Patricia O’Brien. As they spoke on the phone, the two women noticed striking similarities in their sisters’ relationships with Noel Knox. They compared how their sisters became isolated from their families, how they were pursued by Knox, how he used to phone or text them “non-stop” when they were away from him. Patricia recalled her sister, Mairéad. Mairéad was a smart girl but he had beat her down so much that she thought nobody else loved her and that’s what he was constantly telling her. Olive spoke about her sister Katrina. “I believe he was controlling her and anything that happened in her life was directly connected to him.” It was then that Olive felt she had to speak out about what had happened to Katrina. Photos of the man some called “Knoxy” show an unremarkable looking man, grey in pallor with the pot belly of a drinker. While Anton McCabe didn’t know him personally - they went to the same school, but not at the same time - he knew Knox by reputation. He was known as “a hard man” or “a hood”, he says. He was somebody not to be messed with, somebody with a degree of menace. ""Many would have said that if you didn’t cross him he was ok.” Noel Knox died suddenly in November 2017 after phoning an ambulance complaining of breathing difficulties. On his death certificate, his occupation was listed as “bricklayer”, although for 16 years he cared full-time for his brother Brian, who had MS. Brian died 18 months before Noel, and the brothers share a grave next to a small church outside Omagh. Two more brothers and Noel’s father are also buried nearby. Theirs was a large family, and the nine children were brought up on the Mullaghmore estate, which is where we go looking to find out more about Noel Knox. We knock on the door of one of his sisters, who says she is glad to have the opportunity to clear her brother’s name. She asks us not to identify her but brings us into her kitchen and talks at length about the brother to whom she says she was very close. “It was terrible to read all those lies,” she says. I knew Noel and there’s no way he abused them. And to class him as a serial killer… they made Noel out to be a monster. The man described by Olive Wiley bears no relation to the brother she remembers. Noel was easy-going and he was a very helpful and kind person. She says he was good company, often cracking jokes and making up funny stories. She knew all his girlfriends and got on with them, although she says they were all “drinkers” whom she urged him to stay away from. “He’d say: ‘Oh I know, that’s not the girl for me,’” she recalls. Noel wasn’t an alcoholic, she says, arguing he couldn’t have been because he had to look after Brian. Olive Wiley also noticed that Noel didn’t seem to drink as much as the others in the Mullaghmore circle, although both women say he was often the one who would go and buy alcohol. “Any time they would want anything to drink he would go and get the drink,” says Knox’s sister. His girlfriends “took advantage” of her brother’s good nature, she says. “I suppose he would have been lonely as well. They all had drink problems and Noel would take them in and care for them.” Noel Knox’s sister is clearly angry at Patricia O’Brien and Olive Wiley’s allegations. She denies Katrina was in a relationship with Noel Knox, saying they were just friends. She knew Mairéad McCallion well as Noel’s girlfriend and liked her. Although she was often bruised, that was only because she fell over so much and was so thin, adds Knox’s sister: The injuries had nothing to do with Noel. His sister couldn’t believe it when Noel was charged with her murder. She says she accompanied him to the courthouse every day during last autumn’s inquest into Mairéad’s death. He died weeks after the inquest ended. The media’s representation of him as a serial killer was “part of putting a nail in Noel’s coffin”, she says. She rejects the suggestion there could have been another side to Noel, a side she didn’t know about. “I knew all sides of Noel,” she says. OK, he might get a bit angry and a bit annoyed… but (he) wouldn’t go and lift your head and bang you against the wall. Noel had another girlfriend before he died, and we track her down to a well-kept semi-detached house in a quiet development in Omagh. While she says she knew Mairéad well from a support group for alcoholic women, she says Noel was very good to her during the two years they were together. He was never violent towards her and the allegations against him were unfair, she adds. She is still close to his family and was set to join them at a Mass on the anniversary of his death on 22 November. We needed to find out more about the woman found dead on the steps in 2003 – labelled by some as Knox’s second alleged victim. Several people tell us she was part of Knox’s drinking circle, and Olive Wiley says she saw the woman with Katrina. But we can find no evidence she was ever in a relationship with Noel Knox; one of her sisters denied she even knew him. When the woman died, forensic officers investigated the scene and a post-mortem examination was carried out. Coroner Joe McCrisken says it was clear foul play was not involved in the death: Noel Knox may have discovered her body, but that appears to have just been an unfortunate coincidence. Omagh is still small enough for most people to know each other. A conversation with Anton McCabe in a local café is repeatedly interrupted by locals nodding and saying hello to him. Over a latte the freelance journalist points out those around us and wonders aloud if they could help us build a picture of Noel Knox. One passer-by went to school with Knox, another’s sister lived next to Knox’s cousin. “Man May Have Killed Four” was one of the articles Anton wrote at the time of Knox’s death. The tabloids picked the story up and the “serial killer” title was attached to Noel Knox. From behind a shaggy beard, Anton describes how Noel and his link to four sudden deaths of women in Omagh had been the talk of the town. “So much of what was in the rumour mill stood up as true,” he says. I believe that Noel Knox was Omagh’s serial killer. He sips his latte. “I believe it because there was a history of women becoming involved personally with Noel Knox and ending up dead.” “People felt they had put the pieces together. They were saying that Noel Knox was a serial killer.” The FBI defines a serial killer as anyone responsible for two deaths. According to Peter Hepper, professor of psychology at Queens University, Belfast, a more commonly accepted definition is someone who kills three or more people, often with a “cooling-off period in between”. The timings of Knox’s alleged victims’ deaths – 2002, 2006 and 2014 - certainly point to “cooling-off periods.” “There is no one profile that says a person is likely to be a serial killer,” he says. “They can be male, female, 10 years old, up to 60 years old. They can be people in professions, people on the street. Anyone can be a serial killer. But while the attackers can be very different types of people, their victims tend to fit more of a formula, says Prof Hepper. “A lot of serial killers target a certain type, so whether it’s male, female, it may be a certain type of hair colour, a certain context. People who are powerless and who are easier to control are often more likely to become victims. If anything ties Knox’s victims together, it is their alcoholism and the chaotic lifestyles they led. Pat Fahy’s legal practice sits in the shadow of Omagh courthouse. He’s been a solicitor in the town for 48 years. The McCallions are long-term clients; he knows the family well. The case of Mairéad McCallion got under his skin, he says, and he was shocked the Public Prosecution Service dropped the murder charge against Noel Knox. His repeated lobbying on behalf of the family to re-instate the charges was never successful. After last year’s inquest into Mairéad’s death, the family hoped prosecutors would move to charge Knox. After all, a coroner had found that the head injury Mairéad had received while being removed from the property at Castleview Court had led to her death. “There was more than sufficient evidence to mount a case and have the jury decide whether or not Knox was guilty either of murder or manslaughter,” says Pat Fahy. PPS officials say that at the time of Noel Knox’s death in November 2017, they were still considering the family’s request, but had not received all the relevant documents from the inquest. They point to “inconclusive” expert medical evidence which made it impossible to ascertain when and how Mairéad McCallion suffered her fatal head injury. They also point out the higher burden of proof they require – beyond reasonable doubt – compared to a coroner, who makes a finding on the balance of probabilities. Joe McCrisken has analysed the death certificates of Diane Conway, Katrina Fulton and Mairéad McCallion. “Looking at the causes of death for all these ladies, chronic alcoholism or some form of alcoholism is there,” he says. A criminal barrister for 15 years, prosecuting and defending, before he took up his role as coroner, Joe McCrisken says there was nothing in the death certificates to indicate the work of a possible serial killer. We asked about Knox’s failure to call an ambulance before two of the women died. “If there were concerns about a failure to seek medical attention and there was good cogent evidence to underpin a request, that’s something that could be considered during an inquest,” he says. He had held inquests in those circumstances before, he says, adding that the families only needed to write to him to request the deaths of their loved ones be further investigated. There was no set test he says, in deciding whether to hold an inquest, which must merely be deemed “useful”. This is not a neat detective story. PSNI officers looked at Knox’s links to the four dead women in 2014. After a short investigation they concluded there was not enough evidence to press charges. And since Knox is dead, some of the questions about the women’s deaths can never be answered. The PPS, police and a coroner may agree that under the current system he had no legal case to answer. It’s a high bar to prove murder “beyond reasonable doubt”. As Joe McCrisken put it, you have to be 95% certain. That is a point that is almost impossible to reach when alcohol is involved: It is a perfect weapon that provides a perfect cover-up. Many alcoholic women feel too ashamed to ask for support from friends or family, which leaves them particularly vulnerable to abuse. Alcohol keeps victims compliant. It cuts off avenues of escape - many refuges don’t accept drinkers. It also changes how they are viewed by those who witness disturbing behaviour. And if they have been attacked, an alcoholic may struggle to remember, to give a clear account or perhaps even fully understand what has happened. Prosecutors can be reluctant to take forward cases involving these women, argues Orla Conway of Women’s Aid in Omagh. Very often just the impact of abuse and trauma means you aren’t able to express yourself in a clear and sequential narrativeand of course that’s what the criminal justice system wants. Most cruelly of all, perhaps, even though the mind has been compromised, after the event the body can offer little reliable evidence. Every questionable bruise and injury is contaminated with a suggestion that maybe it was due to “a drunken fall”. Whether or not Noel Knox is a serial killer, does he bear any responsibility for the women’s deaths? There are three families who believe he does. Why didn’t he call an ambulance when Diane Conway was suffering a seizure? Why was Katrina Fulton in a semi-conscious state – and why wasn’t he helping her? And why weren’t agencies working together to protect Mairéad McCallion from a man so many thought was dangerous? Predators can target and abuse vulnerable women, enabling them to drink more alcohol and become increasingly dependent if they become alienated from family and friends. The reasons for death listed on official records might not suggest foul play, instead referring to issues related to alcoholism. It doesn’t mean there are no victims.

"The former EDL leader will advise Mr Batten on prison reform and rape gangs UKIP leader Gerard Batten has defended his decision to hire Tommy Robinson as an adviser and says he had saved the party ""from oblivion"". His predecessor Nigel Farage criticised UKIP's association with the ex-English Defence League leader and said there should be a vote of no confidence in Mr Batten. Mr Batten said many people respected Mr Robinson's ""stand on things"". And he claimed Mr Farage had shown ""0% interest"" in UKIP since ""walking away"". Mr Batten, who is the fourth person to lead UKIP since Mr Farage quit in the wake of the 2016 EU referendum, said he believed he would see off any challenge to his leadership. Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, will advise him on rape gangs and prison reform. UKIP AMs say Robinson should not get membership Paypal stops payments for Tommy Robinson Gerard Batten on Tommy Robinson In May, the 35-year old former EDL leader was jailed for 13 months for contempt of court, which sparked a series of #freeTommy protests. His conviction was later quashed over procedural concerns and the casehas now been referred to the attorney general. Mr Robinson had previously been sentenced to 18 months in jail in January 2014 for mortgage fraud and for 10 months in January 2013 for a passport offence. Asked whether it was appropriate to take advice from someone with a criminal record, Mr Batten said those with ""minor convictions"" deserved a second chance. He told BBC News that Tommy Robinson was a ""high profile"" figure who had been ""persecuted by the state because of his views"". ""I think he's a good person to have on side, a lot of people respect his stand on things and his courage."" Mr Batten said he had the support of the party's ruling body He rejected concerns expressed by Mr Farage and other MEPs, several of whom have quit the party in recent months, that UKIP was becoming tainted with Islamophobia. ""Islamophobic is a made up wordâ¦ I don't have an irrational fear of Islam, nor does Tommy Robinson."" Mr Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today earlier that, under his leadership, the party had talked about mass immigration and extreme forms of Islam but ""as a non-racist, non-sectarian party"". ""This blows a hole in all of that."" While he had not ""given up"" on UKIP, he said he would be writing to the party's ruling National Executive Committee urging a vote of no confidence in Mr Batten as leader and ""that we get rid of him"". ""We can have one last go at getting rid of somebody who as leader is dragging us in a shameful direction."" But Mr Batten said he believed he had the support of UKIP's NEC after rescuing the party from potential financial collapse. He suggested Mr Farage was now more interested in his role with Leave Means Leave, the pro-Brexit campaign group, than UKIP. Nigel Farage was UKIP leader for much of time between 2006 and 2016 ""It's down to me that this party has survived, not Nigel Farage nor anybody else,"" he said. ""Nigel walked away from UKIP two years ago and hasn't shown any interest in it since."" UKIP was still in the vanguard of the Brexit fight, he argued, and Mr Robinson's presence would increase numbers at a demonstration the party was planning next month. On Sunday, UKIP's NEC deferred a decision on allowing members to vote on Mr Robinson joining the party. The decision was postponed until after 29 March 2019 - the day the UK is due to leave the EU - with the NEC arguing the party should be focused on Brexit. Currently, UKIP has a blanket ban on allowing former members of the British National Party and the EDL from joining the party - meaning Mr Robinson is barred. Last week, some UKIP members of the Welsh Assemblysaid Mr Robinson should not be allowed to join.

"Joshua Knox-Hooke was on holiday in Thailand with friends when he became ill When Joshua Knox-Hooke arrived at his local A&E department by ambulance after cutting his wrists, he was agitated and told staff he wanted to die - despite this, he was allowed to walk out of the hospital. For a month no-one knew where he was, until his body was found in a local reservoir. He had drowned. Stories like his are the starting point for a report which concludes that too many people are failing to get the help they need when they arrive at emergency departments in a mental health crisis. ""I know it is a very busy place,"" says Joshua's brother Jacob, ""but I still think if someone was presenting as my brother was, with visible cuts to himself, acting in a slightly agitated manner and also verbally saying he wanted to die, then that is the biggest red flag ever. ""Quickly you need to call psychiatric liaison, there's no time to waste in that situation."" Mental health: 10 charts on the scale of the problem Reality Check: The targets for mental health 'I was brought back from the brink of suicide' Joshua, 22, had his first psychotic episode while travelling in Thailand in 2014. He was brought home and his family say the care he received from the community mental health team was really good, he responded well to medication and was starting to make plans again. Six weeks after returning to the UK, he started feeling low again and said he wanted to take his own life. After he cut himself, he was taken to hospital by ambulance. His family alerted his community psychiatric nurse who tried to ring the hospital to pass on information about Joshua. They say it took hours before anyone picked up the phone. His mother also made her way there, but arrived a short time after he walked out. In the report, the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) examines cases like Joshua's to see what wider lessons can be learned from them and make recommendations for improving health services. The HSIB found the care that people get varies according to where they live in England. It points to research which suggests that nearly two-thirds of people arriving at A&E do not receive the mental health care they need. Jacob Knox-Hooke (r) says his brother Joshua should have had better care in A&E Joshua's inquest heard that despite him telling the triage nurse who assessed him that he was feeling suicidal, he was not referred to the psychiatric liaison team. He should also have been kept within sight of staff at all times, but was not. The coroner said there was evidence that it was common for patients to leave the emergency department before a psychiatric assessment. ""People's lives are in the balance. You can see with my brother, he lost his life, partly because he was allowed to leave what you think is a safe environment,"" says Jacob. ""If someone came in and they'd been shot or stabbed, they'd be fast tracked to the most adequate surgeon or doctor to try to help save their life, in this case where it was a more mental unseen threat, nothing was done."" The report concludes that there is a lack of clear guidance on mental health for staff in this pressured environment, and there are problems with the funding and integration of these services with emergency departments. The HSIB report says people who arrive in A&E having self-harmed should receive a full psychiatric assessment, but research shows huge variation. In some places, only 22% of those patients were referred, compared with 88% in other parts of the country. The report wants funding for mental health services in emergency departments 24 hours a day, with better training for other staff. ""In publishing this report, we've highlighted the systemic issues in funding and integrating mental health liaison services into the emergency department,"" said HSIB chief investigator Keith Conradi. ""The investigation also showed that there is a clear lack of guidance and process for staff already working in a pressured environment. ""Every presentation at the emergency department represents the opportunity to provide the safest possible care to those in mental health crisis."" Too many patients in mental health crisis are failed by emergency departments, says report At Birmingham's Heartland Hospital, the psychiatric liaison team sees people with a mental health issue within an average of 23 minutes. ""Psychiatric liaison teams are making a big difference to patients and not only that... save money and time and resources. ""In my mind it is very essential, across the country, to have psychiatric liaison teams to ensure patient safety and the best quality for all of them,"" said Prof George Tadros of Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust, who pioneered the rapid response system. In a statement, the Department of Health and Social care said mental health was a ""top priority"". ""We're committed to putting mental health on equal footing with physical health. ""That's why we are investing Â£249m to roll out liaison mental health teams in every general hospital by 2020-21 with at least 50% of them meeting 24/7 core standards of care, and are investing Â£400m to improve mental health crisis resolution services in the community.""

"Grieving loved ones may no longer be able to pay their last respects to dead relatives when the EU bans the chemical in embalming fluid. That is the fear of Britain's funeral directors after MEPs voted to restrict the use of formaldehyde. The EU says it will protect workers' health and save lives. And - in a concession secured by a Conservative MEP - it has delayed the ban on the substance for three years to allow the industry to adjust. If the UK remains in the EU single market for 21 months after it officially leaves on 29 March, as is currently planned, then the government would be expected to transpose the directive into UK law within a strict time limit. UK funeral prices to be probed Funerals 'rushed' amid lack of crematoria The Health and Safety Executive said it would welcome any measures to help controls but is trying to get more time for the funeral industry to adjust. A HSE spokesman said: ""This is not a ban on formaldehyde. The European Commission has proposed formalising exposure limits. ""Formaldehyde is a known human carcinogen that requires close regulation, which the funeral sector has always taken into account. As is the current case, it will still be used in a controlled manner. ""As a responsible regulator we have always worked closely with the funeral industry to understand its particular needs. This has informed our discussions at EU level. ""Our dialogue with the sector on the proposed limits will continue whatever the terms of our departure from the European Union."" The HSE said the three-year exemption period would come on top of the usual two-year implementation period for a new regulation to come into force, meaning it will not apply to the funeral sector for five years. Funeral directors in the UK are concerned they will not be able to find a replacement for formaldehyde and that they will be faced with extra costs. Formaldehyde, which can cause irritation and has been linked to nasopharyngeal cancer, is one of five industrial chemicals to be added to theEuropean Commission's list of restricted carcinogens and mutagens,external. The UK funeral industry says it recognises that formaldehyde, which is also used in hospitals and in a wide variety of industrial processes, has been linked to serious illnesses. But it argues that the chemical does not pose a significant risk to workers in the diluted form, known as formalin, used by embalmers. And if an alternative to formalin cannot be found, then the ""culture"" around Christian burials and cremations in the UK, will have to change, with funeral directors advising more families against seeing their loved one in the coffin, although ultimately it is the family's choice whether to do so. The embalming of bodies is prohibited in the Jewish and Muslim faiths. It is not forbidden in Hinduism but is rare because cremation normally takes place within 24 hours of death. The funeral industry estimates between 50% and 55% of cadavers in the UK undergo some form of embalming so they can be viewed by relatives. The practice has become more prevalent in recent years because of the growing length of time between death and funeral, caused by delays in obtaining paperwork. The ancient Egyptians used embalming materials to preserve mummies Bodies have been preserved after death since at least 4,000 BC Embalming using formaldehyde and other chemicals began in the late 1800s to preserve bodies for scientific study It involves the draining of the deceased's fluids and the injection of chemical solutions into the arteries, tissues and sometimes organs The process takes about an hour and embalmers are required to wear protective clothing and respirators ""Visiting a loved one in the chapel of rest can be both a distressing and comforting experience for families, and it is also proven to be an important part of the grieving process,"" says Jon Levett, chief executive of the National Association of Funeral Directors. ""For funeral directors, embalming offers the only realistic solution that will delay deterioration and present the deceased person at peace and as close to their appearance before death as possible; particularly where there has been a post mortem, examination, traumatic death - or to accommodate the increasing gap between death and a funeral which is now often two or three weeks. ""For all of these reasons, embalming remains a common funeral choice in the UK by families, much more so than in Europe."" Anthea McIntyre secured a temporary exemption for funeral directors He welcomed the three-year delay in the implementation of the EU directive to ""allow funeral firms to continue the search for a feasible alternative"" but suggested the UK may need to ""change the culture around funerals to make the need for embalming redundant"". All the alternatives to formalin tried so far ""simply do not work as a preservative"", he added. West Midlands MEP Anthea McIntyre, who this week secured the three-year exemption in a vote in the European Parliament, said: ""This new legislation is well meant, but I don't think officials in Brussels realised quite how big the impact would be on Britain."" Refrigeration has been used as an alternative to embalming but that can lead to dehydrated remains and, with repeated thawing and refreezing, accelerated decay, leading to ""an unwholesome viewing situation"", a briefing note by the funeral industry said. ""For the close viewing of the deceased to take place, it is essential for the deceased to be embalmed so the person viewing is safe (free from the hazard of infection), and that the deceased's remains are fixed and stable and do not chemically break down or decompose and/or release embarrassing odours from decomposition,"" it added. The European Commission says setting maximum values for the concentration in workplace air of the five chemicals added to its list will improve conditions for more than 1,000,000 EU workers and prevent more than 22,000 work-related illnesses over the next 50 years. The Council of Ministers in Brussels is due to vote in the issue on 6 December - and the Health and Safety Executive is hoping it will be agreed.

"Jonny (left) tries to groom Ste to become a far-right extremist Hollyoaks will air a storyline about far-right radicalisation to try to raise awareness of the issue in the UK. The Channel 4 soap has worked with experts and charities to help tell the story, where Ste, played by Kieron Richardson, becomes radicalised by newcomer Jonny, played by Ray Quinn. The number of people referred to the government's anti-extremism programme because of right-wing extremism went up by 28% to 968 in 2016-17. The storyline will begin in January. Writer Jamie Bartlett has spent time with extremist groups ""It's vital that we get beyond the caricatures and understand the way extremists really operate,"" says Jamie Bartlett, an author who worked with Hollyoaks on the story. Jamie, who shadowed movements with extremist views for his 2017 book Radicals, adds that far-right groomers exploit ""legitimate personal grievances"".

"This video can not be played The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at what could happen to the man known as MBS US President Donald Trump has said the CIA did not conclude that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi was killed on 2 October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. US officials have reportedly said thatsuch an operation would have needed the prince's approval,external. But Saudi Arabia maintains it was a ""rogue operation"". ""They didn't conclude,"" Mr Trump said when asked about the CIA's reported evaluation by reporters in Florida. Jamal Khashoggi: The story so far Journalist who stepped into a consulate and vanished His comments on Thursday came as the Saudi crown prince began a regional tour of the Middle East, starting with the United Arab Emirates - his first official trip abroad since Khashoggi was killed. The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed, tweeted to say the UAE ""will always be a loving and supportive home for our brothers in Saudi Arabia"". Allow Twitter content?

The Saudi crown prince is also expected to participate in a G20 meeting of world leaders in Buenos Aires at the end of the month that will be attended by leaders from the US, Turkey and a number of European countries. In another development, about 200 British military personnel and eight Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoon jets have arrived in Saudi Arabia to take part in a joint military exercise. The RAF described it as a ""pre-planned exercise"" but the timing is potentially embarrassing to the UK government, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale says. Britain has previously called on Saudi authorities to fully explain Khashoggi's death. Meanwhile, France has announced that it is imposing sanctions on 18 Saudi nationals - the same individuals targeted with sanctions by the US, UK and Germany - allegedly linked to the Khashoggi murder. Their list of individuals does not include the crown prince, a spokesperson for the French ministry of foreign affairs said. ""They have feelings certain ways. I have the report, they have not concluded, I don't know if anyone's going to be able to conclude the crown prince did it,"" Mr Trump told reporters in Florida. ""But whether he did or whether he didn't, he denies it vehemently. His father denies it, the king, vehemently,"" he added. President Trump stressed business and military ties with the Gulf state Earlier this week,Mr Trump released a statement suggesting that the crown prince ""could very well"" have knownabout the murder. His statement said: ""[It] could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"" The president has repeatedly stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia to the US following the killing, calling the kingdom a ""steadfast partner"" that has agreed to invest ""a record amount of money"" in the US. On 17 November, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that Mr Trump had confidence in the CIA following conversations with Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the Khashoggi murder. Sources quoted in the US media at the time stressed that there was no single piece of evidence linking the crown prince directly to the murder, but officials believe the killing would have required his endorsement. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says intelligence agencies rarely offer their governments cast-iron, 100% conclusions, instead producing nuanced assessments often based on probabilities. This wariness has become more pronounced since the mistakes made in the run-up to the Iraq invasion of 2003. Separately, the Hurriyet newspaper reported on Thursday that Ms Haspel told Turkish officials last month that the CIA had a recording in which the crown prince gave instructions to ""silence"" the Saudi writer as soon as possible. When asked about the claims by reporters, Mr Trump said: ""I don't want to talk about it. You'll have to ask them."" Saudi Arabia says claims that the crown prince may have ordered the Khashoggi killing are false and maintains that he knew nothing about it. The Gulf kingdom's public prosecutor has said Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate as a result of a ""rogue operation""on the orders of an intelligence officer. Khashoggi was given a lethal injection after a struggle. His body was then dismembered inside the consulate in Istanbul and the body parts were handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the grounds, the prosecutor said. He said investigations had ""revealed that the person who ordered the killing was the head of the negotiations team"", but did not identify any of the 11 people charged with the murder. As a prominent journalist, he covered major stories including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of Osama Bin Laden for various Saudi news organisations. Jamal Khashoggi had gone to Istanbul to obtain a marriage document For decades he was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US last year. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Jamal Khashoggi in his own words In his first column for the newspaper, Khashoggi said he feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince since. In his last column,he criticised Saudi involvement in the Yemen conflict,external.

"This video can not be played ""I was petrified"" - Det Sgt Nick  Bailey on being poisoned by Novichok The police officer who was poisoned in the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal has told how his family lost their home and all their possessions after he was contaminated with Novichok. In his first interview since it happened, Det Sgt Nick Baileytold the BBC's Panorama: ""Everything the kids owned, we lost all that, the cars, we lost everything."" Det Sgt Bailey came into contact with the nerve agent after being sent to the Skripals' home, where it had been sprayed on the door handle. After finishing work on that fateful day, he unwittingly contaminated his home. He and his family have so far been unable to return. A perfume bottle containing Novichok was later found in a bin, leading to the death of a woman who had sprayed the substance onto her wrists. Investigators now say the bottle contained enough Novichok to potentially kill thousands of people. Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury on the afternoon of Sunday 4 March. That night, Det Sgt Bailey and two colleagues were sent to their home, in a quiet suburb. Clad in full forensic suits, they were tasked with making sure there were no other casualties. They had no idea the visit would change Det Sgt Bailey's life. Hours later he began to feel unwell. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far ""My pupils were like pinpricks and I was quite sweaty and hot,"" said the 38-year-old father of two. ""At the time I put that down to being tired and stressed."" By Tuesday he was so unwell, he was rushed to hospital. ""It was horrendous, I was confused, I didn't know what was going on and it was really, really frightening,"" he said. This video can not be played The two men suspected of poisoning Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury are seen walking to the victims' home Det Sgt Bailey was admitted to Salisbury District Hospital, where doctors tried to find the right combination of drugs to fight the poison in his body. At the same time, scientists at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory - at nearby Porton Down - worked around the clock to find out what had poisoned him and the Skripals. When experts discovered Novichok was responsible for the poisoning it was ""a jaw-dropping moment"", Professor ""Tim"", the lead scientist dealing with chemical threats, said. ""Novichok is one of the most dangerous substances known. It's quite unique in its ability to poison individuals at very low concentrations,"" he added. For the first time, a nerve agent had been used in an attack in Europe. Doctors had to break the news to Det Sgt Bailey that he had been poisoned with Novichok. ""It's the fear of the unknown because it's such a dangerous thing to have in your system. Knowing how the other two were [and] how badly they'd been affected by it, I was petrified,"" he said. Intensive care doctors at Salisbury hospital were faced with something they had not dealt with before and, according to Dr Duncan Murray, there was ""a very real expectation"" all three could die. Det Sgt Bailey's treatment was both painful and stressful. ""I was conscious throughout the whole time,"" he said. ""I had lots of injectionsâ¦ I had five or six infusions at any one time in my arms. Physically, I felt quite numb after a while."" Dawn Sturgess died after finding the bottle containing the Novichok One of the Skripals was being treated in the room next door, which he said was guarded by police. ""One moment you'd have a nurse coming in with a sandwich for you dressed top to bottom in protective gear,"" he said, However, they might be ""closely followed"" by his wife and children, who were ""allowed to just walk in"". ""It was very confusing."" It took two weeks of painstaking investigation for scientists and police to work out exactly how the Skripals and Det Sgt Bailey had come into contact with Novichok. When they eventually discovered the nerve agent had been sprayed on the Skripals' front door handle, Det Sgt Bailey said the news helped him. He's still not sure how the nerve agent bypassed the protective gloves he was wearing to get into contact with his skin. ""I don't know,"" he said, ""I could have adjusted my face mask and my goggles while I was in the house, with it being on my hand."" Det Sgt Bailey and the Skripals weren't the only ones poisoned by the nerve agent. Four months later, Dawn Sturgess, 44, died after she and her partner, Charlie Rowley, 45, were exposed to Novichok in Amesbury, Wiltshire. Mr Rowley survived. ""My heart goes out to Dawn and her family because I was able to walk out of hospital and, sadly, she wasn't,"" Det Sgt Bailey said. This video can not be played Russian spy poisoning: Why was Sergei Skripal attacked? It was the tragedy of Dawn's death that helped detectives solve a vital piece of the puzzle. Charlie hadfound a perfume bottle and given it to Dawn. Believing it was a popular brand of perfume, she sprayed some on her wrists. In fact, officers believe the bottle had been used to smuggle the Novichok into Britain. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon, who is leading the investigation, said there was a ""significant amount"" of nerve agent in the bottle - probably enough to kill ""thousands"". ""The amount that was in the bottle and the way it was applied to the Skripals' home address was completely reckless,"" he told BBC Panorama. The UK governmentblames Russiafor the attack. Why was Sergei Skripal attacked? Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' For Det Sgt Bailey, it is something he has to come to terms with. ""It's such an outrageous, dangerous way of doing something that it angered me as well because any number of people could have been affected by that,"" he said. The effects have not only been on his health. ""Physically I think I bounced back pretty well thanks to the hospital,"" he said. He says the fact he was able to walk out of hospital with his wife after two and a half weeks was ""incredible"". But the mental scars he has been left with are a ""different kettle of fish"". ""I describe it as emotional battering,"" he said. ""It's taken longer to deal with just because of everything that's happened to us. Not only did we lose the house, we lost all of our possessions... Everything the kids owned, we lost all that, the cars, we lost everything."" Det Sgt Bailey has never met Sergei and Yulia Skripal, who have also been discharged from hospital. Looking to the future, he says he has some concerns: ""I have passing moments where I think about how it could affect me, but I can't control that. ""It's happened now and I have to just take each day as it comes."" His voice breaking with emotion, he adds: ""The public reaction has been overwhelming and I wish I could thank everybody. ""And my family. And my wife who has been the rock, who's held it all together.""

"Two police officers were killed in the attack Gunmen have killed at least four people in an attack on the Chinese consulate in the Pakistani port city of Karachi. Gunshots were heard at about 09:30 local time (04:30 GMT) outside the consulate in the upmarket Clifton area. Police shot dead three attackers. Separatist militants who oppose Chinese investment projects in western Pakistan say they carried out the attack. In another incident on Friday, at least 30 people were killed in a bomb attack in north-west Pakistan. The blast occurred in a mostly Shia neighbourhood in Orakzai district. Police say a suicide bomber on a motorbike drove into a crowded marketplace. Pakistan's Shia minority has often been targeted by Sunni extremists. Three gunmen tried to enter the consulate but were stopped by guards at a checkpoint, reports said. Two of those killed in the attack were police officers. A burning vehicle near the attack site Eyewitnesses reported seeing a blast, and local TV channels broadcast images of a plume of smoke. There is a heavy police presence in the area which has been cordoned off. Is Chinese an official language in Pakistan? The other Balochistan: Life in a conflict zone All the staff inside the consulate are safe, China said. The government condemned the attack on its mission and the foreign ministry in Beijing called for extra measures to protect Chinese citizens in Pakistan. ""At the same time we mourn the deaths of the Pakistani police and think of their families at this time,"" a spokesman said. But the spokesman was keen to praise Pakistani security forces for its efforts to protect the consulate. A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, said it had carried out the attack. It is one of a number of separatist groups operating in the province, which has seen a long-running nationalist insurgency. ""We have been seeing the Chinese as an oppressor, along with Pakistani forces,"" a spokesman for the group told the AFP news agency. Over the years, construction projects and Chinese workers in Balochistan have been repeatedly targeted by militants. Most recently, a suicide bombing in August injured a number of Chinese engineers. So far, none of the incidents has been large enough in scale to really threaten the viability of Chinese investment in the country. But this is one of the most prominent attacks to date.

By Secunder Kermani, BBC Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad Balochistan is a sparsely populated region, and has remained Pakistan's most impoverished area despite being rich in gas and coal reserves, as well as copper and gold. Baloch nationalists have long accused the central government of exploitation, and denying the province its due rights. The area is at the heart of an ambitious Chinese project, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The corridor is a string of huge investments by China in Pakistani infrastructure, which aim to link its western Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea port of Gwadar in Balochistan, as part of theOne Belt, One Road initiative. Risky road: China's missionaries follow Beijing west Is China-Pakistan 'silk road' a game-changer? China has poured billions into Pakistan, and thousands of Chinese nationals visit the country to work on CPEC projects or other business ventures. Pakistan is keen to ensure nothing happens to jeopardise that and Chinese workers are closely guarded. The assault on the consulate is particularly significant because it took place in Karachi, the commercial capital of Pakistan, rather than in the remote province where the militants are based. The incident will deeply concern authorities who have described the Chinese funding as a ""game-changer"". What is China's One Belt, One Road? Video, 00:02:36What is China's One Belt, One Road?

"This video can not be played One family is responsible for ending FGM in an entire village in Sudan The UK is to give Â£50m ($64m) in aid money to help stop female genital mutilation (FGM) in Africa. The government says this is the biggest single investment to date in the world to help end FGM by 2030. The practice involves removing all or part of a girl or woman's external genitalia, including the clitoris, with some treating it as a rite of passage. ActionAid welcomed the funding but said focusing on FGM alone ""was not enough"" to eradicate violence against women. The aid package will help fund organisations such as the Saleema project in Sudan, which aims to show girls they can feel empowered if they are left uncut as well as trying to shift the attitudes of older members in the community. Ministers have said the money will also have a beneficial effect in the UK as it will be used to help reduce the risk of girls being taken abroad to be cut. FGM has been illegal in the UK since 1985 and further legislation in 2003 and 2005 made it an offence to arrange the practice outside the country for British citizens or permanent residents. But there is yet to be a successful prosecution. The government says there are an estimated 24,000 women and girls at risk of FGM in the UK. What does FGM actually involve? Botched FGM leaves 50 girls in hospital 'This is what it's like to pee after female genital mutilation' UK schoolgirls 'pressured into FGM' Announcing the aid money, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said FGM could not be eliminated in the UK ""without ending it globally"". ""Inspirational, courageous African women are leading efforts to end the practice in their own countries, and thanks to them, more communities are starting to abandon the practice,"" she said. ""But progress is at a critical juncture and we must work to protect the millions of girls that are still at risk of being cut.""

"This video can not be played The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at what could happen to the man known as MBS US President Donald Trump has said the CIA did not conclude that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Khashoggi was killed on 2 October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. US officials have reportedly said thatsuch an operation would have needed the prince's approval,external. But Saudi Arabia maintains it was a ""rogue operation"". ""They didn't conclude,"" Mr Trump said when asked about the CIA's reported evaluation by reporters in Florida. Jamal Khashoggi: The story so far Journalist who stepped into a consulate and vanished His comments on Thursday came as the Saudi crown prince began a regional tour of the Middle East, starting with the United Arab Emirates - his first official trip abroad since Khashoggi was killed. The Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed, tweeted to say the UAE ""will always be a loving and supportive home for our brothers in Saudi Arabia"". Allow Twitter content?

The Saudi crown prince is also expected to participate in a G20 meeting of world leaders in Buenos Aires at the end of the month that will be attended by leaders from the US, Turkey and a number of European countries. In another development, about 200 British military personnel and eight Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoon jets have arrived in Saudi Arabia to take part in a joint military exercise. The RAF described it as a ""pre-planned exercise"" but the timing is potentially embarrassing to the UK government, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale says. Britain has previously called on Saudi authorities to fully explain Khashoggi's death. Meanwhile, France has announced that it is imposing sanctions on 18 Saudi nationals - the same individuals targeted with sanctions by the US, UK and Germany - allegedly linked to the Khashoggi murder. Their list of individuals does not include the crown prince, a spokesperson for the French ministry of foreign affairs said. ""They have feelings certain ways. I have the report, they have not concluded, I don't know if anyone's going to be able to conclude the crown prince did it,"" Mr Trump told reporters in Florida. ""But whether he did or whether he didn't, he denies it vehemently. His father denies it, the king, vehemently,"" he added. President Trump stressed business and military ties with the Gulf state Earlier this week,Mr Trump released a statement suggesting that the crown prince ""could very well"" have knownabout the murder. His statement said: ""[It] could very well be that the crown prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"" The president has repeatedly stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia to the US following the killing, calling the kingdom a ""steadfast partner"" that has agreed to invest ""a record amount of money"" in the US. On 17 November, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that Mr Trump had confidence in the CIA following conversations with Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the Khashoggi murder. Sources quoted in the US media at the time stressed that there was no single piece of evidence linking the crown prince directly to the murder, but officials believe the killing would have required his endorsement. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says intelligence agencies rarely offer their governments cast-iron, 100% conclusions, instead producing nuanced assessments often based on probabilities. This wariness has become more pronounced since the mistakes made in the run-up to the Iraq invasion of 2003. Separately, the Hurriyet newspaper reported on Thursday that Ms Haspel told Turkish officials last month that the CIA had a recording in which the crown prince gave instructions to ""silence"" the Saudi writer as soon as possible. When asked about the claims by reporters, Mr Trump said: ""I don't want to talk about it. You'll have to ask them."" Saudi Arabia says claims that the crown prince may have ordered the Khashoggi killing are false and maintains that he knew nothing about it. The Gulf kingdom's public prosecutor has said Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate as a result of a ""rogue operation""on the orders of an intelligence officer. Khashoggi was given a lethal injection after a struggle. His body was then dismembered inside the consulate in Istanbul and the body parts were handed over to a local ""collaborator"" outside the grounds, the prosecutor said. He said investigations had ""revealed that the person who ordered the killing was the head of the negotiations team"", but did not identify any of the 11 people charged with the murder. As a prominent journalist, he covered major stories including the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the rise of Osama Bin Laden for various Saudi news organisations. Jamal Khashoggi had gone to Istanbul to obtain a marriage document For decades he was close to the Saudi royal family and also served as an adviser to the government. But he fell out of favour and went into self-imposed exile in the US last year. From there, he wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post in which he criticised the policies of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Jamal Khashoggi in his own words In his first column for the newspaper, Khashoggi said he feared being arrested in an apparent crackdown on dissent overseen by the prince since. In his last column,he criticised Saudi involvement in the Yemen conflict,external.

"There is ""no realistic prospect"" of the government meeting its own deadline to install smart meters, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). The public accounts watchdog has joined a chorus of voices - including a group of MPs and Citizens Advice - which say the target is impossible to reach. Every home in Britain is supposed to have a smart meter - which avoids the need for customer readings - by 2020. However the government has insisted that it will meet its commitment. The NAO also said that nearly one million smart meters are no longer working properly, and that the coldest parts of Britain have the fewest meters. 'Deadline requires 30 meters a minute' Deadine 'should be extended' To meet the deadline, installers will need to replace 39 million old meters within the next two years, according to the NAO. In comparison, just 12 million meters have been replaced over the last six years. Earlier this week the consumer group Which? said that the industry would need to install 30 meters every minute over the next two years to meet the target. It is currently installing fewer than ten, it said. The government said that 400,000 meters were being installed every month, and the target was achievable. ""Millions have already chosen to have a smart meter and take control of their energy use to cut their bills,"" said energy minister Claire Perry. ""We've said everyone will be offered a smart meter by the end of 2020 to reap these benefits and we will meet that commitment."" Energy UK, which represents the firms installing the meters, told the BBC it would not speculate on the feasibility of hitting the deadline. Smart meters are designed to save consumers money, as it is said that they encourage householders to use less power. Because they can be read remotely, the costs to industry are also lower. They also enable consumers to use cheaper tariffs, by using power in the evening or on week-ends. Four years ago the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy estimated that they would save consumers about Â£26 a year. However, the NAO says the increasing cost of installing them will now save consumers less than Â£11 annually. That follows asimilar estimate made by a group of MPsin the summer. In any case, the NAO says the government is failing to monitor what savings households are actually making. The first generation of smart meters do not necessarily continue working if a customer switches supplier. About 70% of them ""go dumb"", according to the NAO. The second generation is designed to be more flexible, but only 109,000 such meters have been installed. The NAO says 943,000 first generation meters have now stopped working to their full capacity, because of a change of supplier. The NAO says the functionality of smart meters still needs improvement. It says they don't work in homes with thick walls, for example, which can block the mobile phone signals needed to transmit their data. And it says the coldest parts of the country are the least likely to have a smart meter installed, even though the need in such regions is greater. In Scotland and the north of England just 3,000 second generation meters had been installed by June, compared to 106,000 in the rest of Britain.

"Charlotte says she was hit with hundreds of pounds of extra fees Campaigners say new laws going through Parliament will not go far enough to stamp out all hidden fees and charges for renters. Charlotte Von Crease, a 27-year-old renter, says: ""When we moved into our last property we were hit with nearly Â£3,500 worth of fees, before we even got the keys."" However, those pre-tenancy fees are just one of the hidden costs. Tenant campaign groups say banning them will not solve the problem. There were the usual costs for Charlotte, such as one month's rent in advance and six weeks' rent as a deposit. But she toldBBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Moneythere were ""also Â£875 worth of letting agent fees, Â£600 were admin fees, Â£120 for employers' references for both me and my partner, and Â£155 for an inventory check-in fee as well"". Charlotte is one of the estimated 11.5 million people who live in private rented homes in England. Many renters complain of high upfront costs to secure a property and the Tenant Fees Bill passing through Parliament will effectively cap or ban these extra, unavoidable charges for tenants in England. Wales has similar legislation under way and Scotland outlawed pre-tenancy fees back in 2012. In Northern Ireland it's a more complicated picture. A judge recently ruled that tenants could not be charged upfront costs, but without a sitting assembly to bring in new rules, tenants there are still paying them. But those pre-tenancy fees are just one part of the hidden costs for renters and a number of tenant campaign groups, including Shelter and Generation Rent, have expressed concern that banning them will not solve the problem. When the new rules eventually come into force, they will not stop landlords and letting agents from charging default fees, such as cleaning costs or those for repairs. While those are often for work needed after tenants leave a property, some tenants report being charged huge amounts for tiny jobs. Some tenants say they feel ripped off. ""I've just ended 10 years of renting [and] each property was its own frustrating experience,"" says 30-year-old former renter Jen Eastwood. ""Never once have I received a full amount of deposit back, despite every property being returned in a better condition than when it was given to me. Twice I paid for professional cleaning and gave the receipts as proof, and still I was charged for cleaning."" Is rent cheaper in the next street? Use our map to find out The cost of renting in the UK in seven charts Where does rent hit young people the hardest in Britain? Ask any group of renters about their experiences and at least some will have similar stories. Private renting has more than doubled in the past 20 years. There's been a decline in home ownership among millennials in particular, leading more to rent for longer. Earlier this year the Institute for Fiscal Studies reported there had been a large decline in home ownership among middle-income 25-34-year-olds. In 1995-96, 65% of this group owned a home but by 2015-16 that fell to just 27%. Shelter has said tenants are routinely being overcharged. It lists examples of tenants paying as much as Â£20 an hour for their landlord's time, Â£45 for procuring a replacement dustpan and brush - and even Â£100 for removing cobwebs. None of those charges will be banned by the Tenant Fees Bill. Tenants deposits are now routinely held in deposit protection schemes, meaning money is protected and they can challenge charges they think are unfair. However, if a landlord or agent can show invoices and receipts for work carried out then it can be hard to argue it was unnecessary or unfair. Polly Neate, chief executive of the charity, says she will welcome the new rules but tells Wake Up To Money it must go further. Clearer guidelines on what tenants can and can't be charged for are needed, she says, to prevent landlords and agents finding ""additional things"" to charge for. ""Letting agents are running a business and their business is managing properties. So they ought to be able to calculate the general costs that they will incur. [These] should be part of the totally predictable cost of managing a property."" Tenants may feel ripped off by these fees but letting agents and landlords argue they genuinely reflect the cost of the work. One letting agent, who did not want to be named, said: ""To get anyone to show up at your door no matter what they do is Â£50 or something in that region. So, if a tenant is to leave a bit of fluff somewhere, someone still has to take an hour to go there, do it and come back and you have to hire a professional. ""I used to own a property and I wouldn't just run out to clear up a bit of fluff or change a bulb, I'd say it's my tenants' responsibility."" 11.5m people rent in England His comments were echoed by housing minister Heather Wheeler. ""I genuinely think that you have a responsibility when you take on a property - you expect it to be in good order when you arrive, it's your job to make it in a good order when you leave."" Richard Lambert, chief executive of the National Landlords Association, said the new rules will curb abuses. ""Default fees will have to be a reasonable charge for a defined purpose. But if I have to come to you to change a light bulb then I have to drive for half-an-hour, plus petrol, to carry out the work. I wouldn't be charging you anything more than what it cost me. He said the government had tried to strike a reasonable balance between tenants and landlords. David Cox, chief executive of Arla Propertymark, said: ""Letting agent fees cover the cost of essential services during the lettings process, such as referencing, negotiations about clauses in the tenancy agreement and the inventory - processes that cost letting agents time and money to carry out. He says research for Arla by Capital Economics showed that a full ban on tenant fees would mean two tenants would end up paying an extra Â£206 per year in rent. ""Ultimately, the ban doesn't reflect the value of the services which agents provide to tenants,"" he said.

"Black Friday is upon us and this year many retailers have extended their deals for the whole week. And hot on its heels will be Cyber Monday, a phrase coined back in 2005 when online shopping needed promotion, but is increasingly becoming less relevant. There will be bargains to be had but shoppers need to keep their wits about them. Here are some top tips. iPhone 11 - probably not in a half price sale You're unlikely to get 50% off the latest iPhone. Newer products are still going to sell well at their original price so there is less incentive for firms to put them on offer - especially tech devices. Consumer website Which? also suggests being cautious about apparently amazing offers on unknown brands. It found that one in five Black Friday shoppers did not read any reviews of the products they bought and advised people to do their research and be wary of unusual brands. How to check if Black Friday is cheaper Fake online reviews 'for sale on internet' Watch out too for unfamiliar stores that significantly undercut their rivals. Trustpilot,externalandReviews.co.uk,externalare two popular sites where you can draw on past customers' experiences. In addition, it can be worth double-checking whether the retailer is based outside the EU as that might signal they are selling ""grey market"" items that the manufacturer's regional division will not fix or replace if something goes wrong. Sending a camera or phone back overseas for repair could easily wipe out any savings you might make. If you do spot a good deal, bear in mind that some stores change their prices several times a day, so it may not last. In some cases you can guard against this by sticking the product in your shopping cart before double-checking it's a bargain by searching elsewhere. If the store puts the price up in the meantime, you should still be able to complete the deal at the earlier advertised cost. And if it's gone down, you can empty the basket and then add the product back in again to take advantage of the change. There are also several websites, apps and browser plug-ins that can aid you on your shopping quest. One of the most famous iscamelcamelcamel,external, which allows you to see a product's historic prices on Amazon and set up alerts to tell you if it drops to a desired price point. Keepa offers a similar service,external. You have to log in to use it, but it offers simple ways to check if prices are cheaper on eBay as well as providing an opportunity to dive deeper into the data.

It lists past prices for items sold by the UK chain rather than drawing you charts, but has a clear user interface and also highlights the biggest reductions of the day by product category. Voucher codes can also help cut prices further. There's plenty of sites to find them, but you can also speed up the process by adding an extension such asPouch,externalorPriceBlink,external, which automatically flag relevant codes for the online store you are currently visiting. Alternatively,Honey,externalpromises to carry out a voucher-scan of its own at checkout and automatically fills in the best code for you if one is available. In addition, you can draw on other people's bargain-spotting skills by checking outHotUKDeals,external,LatestDeals.co.uk,externaland theMoneySavingExpert forums,external- all of which offer finds and comments submitted by other members of the public. And you could always abandon your basket, by filling it and then not checking out. Sometimes retailers entice you to finish the purchase by offering further discounts. Beware of email deals that sound too good to be true if you just click that link - and check website addresses very carefully. ""Making a website look identical to a well-known retail brand is horribly easy,"" says Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University. ""Try not to use a link in an email but rather go to the web address you know."" He also advises keeping an eye on your statements in the aftermath of the sales to make sure nobody else has helped themselves to your card details. Lots of high street shops are offering deals on chothes and again price comparison websites can help find the cheapest prices. If buying online, users can opt to collect items from stores to save a delivery charge and also take advantage of cashback sites such as Quidco.com which offers a Â£15 bonus when shopping via it at over 4,500 brands. If you buy anything online you have 14 days to change your mind and get a complete refund, says Sarah Pennells, editor of the consumer finance website Savvy Woman. ""You may have to pay to return the item, but if the retailer doesn't tell you whether or not you'll have to pay return postage, it's free,"" she says. Ms Pennells also advises paying on a credit card for purchases worth more than Â£100 (and less than Â£30,000) as you are better protected if the firm goes bust or you don't receive your item, than you would be if you paid by debit card.

"Black Friday could provide ""prime pickings"" for cyber-crime, warns the security agency Black Friday sales could be targeted as ""prime pickings"" for cyber-crime, the UK's cyber-security defence agency has warned shoppers. The National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ intelligence service, is issuing advice to shoppers of the risk of ""malicious"" online threats. It is the first such official cyber-warning in the run-up to the Christmas shopping season. ""It's vital that knowledge is shared,"" says Ian Levy of the cyber-agency. The cyber-wing of the GCHQ communications centre says it wants to start a ""national cyber-chat"" on Black Friday when billions are spent on online shopping. It might be known for working in secret, but the agency wants to engage with the public over the seriousness of the threat. It has been involved in trying to tackle more than 550 significant cyber-incidents in the past 12 months, and has taken down almost 140,000 ""phishing"" websites used by fraudsters. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is giving tips for individual consumers to avoid cyber-crime - and for the first time it will be publishing answers to questions from the public on Twitter. There are warnings for better cyber-security when billions are being spent on online shopping ""Staying safe online doesn't require deep technical knowledge, and we want the whole country to know that the NCSC speaks the same language as them,"" said Mr Levy, the cyber-defence agency's technical director. ""With so many of the UK shopping online, we want to see these tips shared from classrooms and scout groups to family dinner tables and old people's homes."" The agency's chief executive, Ciaran Martin, recently told a meeting of business leaders of a ""serious and sustained"" threat, including from ""elite hackers"" in other countries. ""It is not speculation and it is not scare-mongering,"" said Mr Martin. ""Large-scale criminal cyber-activity is, sadly, ubiquitous."" This could include the ""theft of millions"" from retailers and attacks on financial networks on which shops depend, he said. A data breach had an average cost of Â£3m, he said - and there were estimates that the WannaCry cyber-attack last year had cost the United States Â£3.5bn. Another cyber-attack last year, known as NotPetya, had cost one firm up to Â£250m, including the cost of replacement IT equipment. The British Retail Consortium is backing the calls for better cyber-security during the Christmas shopping season. ""With more and more shoppers looking to get the best deals online, retailers continue to invest significantly in developing the right tools and expertise to protect against cyber-threats,"" says James Martin, security adviser to the retailers' organisation. But he warned of the danger of cyber-crime causing a ""post-Christmas headache"". The National Cyber Security Centre's advice to reduce the risk of cyber-crime is: Install the latest software and app updates Choose strong and separate passwords for accounts Type in a shop's website address rather than clicking on links in emails Avoid over-sharing unnecessary information with shops, even if they ask Don't panic if you think you've been a victim of fraud Keep an eye on bank accounts for unrecognised payments Make sure all your home gadgets are secure Top tips for online shopping this Christmas.

"This video can not be played Consumer affairs correspondent Colletta Smith's top tips for online shopping The advertising regulator has warned consumers that some Black Friday deals may be misleading. Guy Parker, chief executive of the Advertising Standards Authority, said that the rapid pace of change online is ""fuelling people's concerns about whether everything they see and read is true"". ""It becomes more difficult to establish whether the price you're being offered a product at is indeed a good price,"" he added. Dr Gareth Harvey, a consumer psychologist who studies how retailers try to influence customers, says Black Friday deals are all about grabbing attention with big signs and numbers. ""Shopping in the sales is a very different frame of mind. A website or shop will look different. Normally a retailer hides the price, so it is the last thing we see,"" he said. ""They want you to buy into the product and think it's worth the money. But on Black Friday or the sales, the price or big discount is what you see first. But you're not concentrating on the product and whether it is what you want."" How to check if Black Friday deals really are cheaper Black Friday is changing the way we spend Shoppers in Wrexham who spoke to the BBC conveyed their experiences of online retail therapy. Emma Wilson, who runs Emz Cakes on the town's high street, said she has felt pressured into a purchase because of a clock countdown on discounted dresses: ""I even added extra things to my basket that I wouldn't have done otherwise - you feel cheated."" Friend Claire Nicholas has two young children and now does most shopping online. ""I'm a sucker for a deal - especially on kids clothes - and I'll add stuff to my basket to get the free shipping,"" she said. Claire Nicholas, Emma Wilson and Michelle Powis Her co-worker Michelle Powis has two teenage sons and said buying the brands they want can be expensive: ""I do try to look for the deals, but sometimes I will buy something just in case I lose the offer."" Emz Cakes will also be getting on the Black Friday bandwagon, offering cut-price afternoon teas. Its discounts will ""absolutely be genuine"", Ms Wilson stresses. Dr Harvey says tactics such as clock countdowns or highlighting limited stock or how many people are looking at an item, pile on the pressure to buy quickly in a bid to keep a shopper on that website or app. ""We've put people in a brain scanner and get them to shop online,"" he says. ""After about 12 minutes they become mentally exhausted. They stop making good decisions or analysing their choices and taking shortcuts, thinking 'I'll just get one of those'."" It is therefore unsurprising that most of the Advertising Standards Authority's work is now focused on online promotions. Mr Parker said consumers should remember that the same rules apply to discounts and deals whether they are on TV, a billboard or in an email. The ability of a business to change the price of a product numerous times a year means it can be hard for the regulator and consumers to keep up. The watchdog said businesses have a duty to ensure that deals are clear and that they anticipate demand for a product to ensure items are available. Mr Parker urged consumers tocontact the ASA,externalif they encountered a deal they think if misleading or untrue. Have eight years of Black Friday changed the UK?

"This video can not be played Michael: ""What in your honest opinion is better for the UK, your deal or the deal we had if we stayed in the EU?"" Theresa May has said the UK should not hope for a ""better deal"" from the EU if MPs reject her Brexit agreement. She told a BBC phone-in that there would be just ""more division and uncertainty"" if Parliament voted against the agreement next month. But she declined to say whether the UK would be better off outside the EU, saying only it would be ""different"". A summit of EU leaders to sign off the deal will go ahead on Sunday despite ""unresolved"" issues over Gibraltar. Spain is seeking written assurances from the UK that it will be directly consulted over its future trade negotiations with the EU which relate to Gibraltar, a British Overseas Territory. Its prime minister Pedro Sanchez has said he won't decide whether to attend Sunday's summit until these are provided. DUP may revisit Tory deal, says Foster What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Will EU Brexit summit crash on The Rock? The withdrawal agreement - what it all means He has said his backing for the overall deal cannot be taken for granted although no one country can block the withdrawal agreement on its own at this stage. Meanwhile, the leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster,has said she will ""look again"" at her party's dealwith the Conservatives if Mrs May's Brexit bill passes through parliament. ""But we are not there yet,"" Mrs Foster added. This video can not be played Watch in full: Prime Minister Theresa May takes calls on the BBC News Channel and BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Emma Barnett: The PM didn't give clear answers on Brexit Mrs May told the Emma Barnett Show that her job was to persuade MPs to back her but also to ""explain"" the merits of the deal to the public. Asked what her plan B was, if MPs rejected the deal, she suggested there would be little point going back to the EU to ask for further changes. ""I believe if we were to go back to the European Union and say: Well people didn't like that deal, can we have another one? ... I don't think they're going to come to us and say: We'll give you a better deal."" Mrs May, who has previously warned about the dangers of the UK leaving without a deal or not leaving at all, would not be drawn on whether she would quit if MPs refused to back her deal. Asked what was a more likely outcome in such an event - a no-deal exit or the UK remaining in the EU - she said ""from my point of view, personally, there is no question of 'no Brexit' because the government needs to deliver on what people voted on in the referendum in 2016"". This video can not be played Dominic Raab tells Today the proposed Brexit deal is worse than EU membership Asked by a caller called Michael if the UK would be better off outside the EU under her deal than staying in, she said that as someone who voted to Remain, she had never said the ""sky would fall in"" if Brexit happens. ""I think we will be better off in a situation which we'll have outside the European Union, where we have control of all those things, and are able to trade around the rest of the world,"" she said.

Pressed by Emma Barnett to answer the question, she said ""it is going to be different,"" before adding: ""We can build a better future outside the European Union."" The UK and EU have agreed in principlethe framework for their future relations,externaloutlining how UK-EU trade, security and other issues would work. The document, known as the ""political declaration"", is not legally-binding but will be the starting point for negotiations on co-operation after the UK leaves. It has been heavily criticised by many MPs for lacking detail. This is a separate document to the legally-binding withdrawal agreement - setting out the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, including the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" to keep the border with the Republic of Ireland open, if trade talks stall. Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said what was on offer in the political declaration was inferior to EU membership, as it would leave the UK bound by the same rules but without control over them. Pedro Sanchez and the 27 other EU leaders will be asked to sign off the agreement on Sunday Theresa May goes back to Brussels on Saturday for more talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker Negotiators try to get an agreement with Spain over Gibraltar EU leaders meet on Sunday to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration If that is agreed Mrs May starts the process of getting MPs to back the deal - most are currently against it If MPs back the deal it then has to be ratified by the European Parliament The UK leaves the EU on 29 March - and trade talks on the future relationship start Meanwhile, EU officials are meeting to try to put the finishing touches to both the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration.

The future of Gibraltar and its 30,000 residents, 96% whom voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, remains a sticking point.

"Two police officers were killed in the attack Gunmen have killed at least four people in an attack on the Chinese consulate in the Pakistani port city of Karachi. Gunshots were heard at about 09:30 local time (04:30 GMT) outside the consulate in the upmarket Clifton area. Police shot dead three attackers. Separatist militants who oppose Chinese investment projects in western Pakistan say they carried out the attack. In another incident on Friday, at least 30 people were killed in a bomb attack in north-west Pakistan. The blast occurred in a mostly Shia neighbourhood in Orakzai district. Police say a suicide bomber on a motorbike drove into a crowded marketplace. Pakistan's Shia minority has often been targeted by Sunni extremists. Three gunmen tried to enter the consulate but were stopped by guards at a checkpoint, reports said. Two of those killed in the attack were police officers. A burning vehicle near the attack site Eyewitnesses reported seeing a blast, and local TV channels broadcast images of a plume of smoke. There is a heavy police presence in the area which has been cordoned off. Is Chinese an official language in Pakistan? The other Balochistan: Life in a conflict zone All the staff inside the consulate are safe, China said. The government condemned the attack on its mission and the foreign ministry in Beijing called for extra measures to protect Chinese citizens in Pakistan. ""At the same time we mourn the deaths of the Pakistani police and think of their families at this time,"" a spokesman said. But the spokesman was keen to praise Pakistani security forces for its efforts to protect the consulate. A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, said it had carried out the attack. It is one of a number of separatist groups operating in the province, which has seen a long-running nationalist insurgency. ""We have been seeing the Chinese as an oppressor, along with Pakistani forces,"" a spokesman for the group told the AFP news agency. Over the years, construction projects and Chinese workers in Balochistan have been repeatedly targeted by militants. Most recently, a suicide bombing in August injured a number of Chinese engineers. So far, none of the incidents has been large enough in scale to really threaten the viability of Chinese investment in the country. But this is one of the most prominent attacks to date. Officials told the BBC's Stephen McDonell in Beijing they were confident the Pakistani government was able to manage the security situation to guarantee Chinese investment. A female police officer, Suhai Talpur, who led the security operation,externalduring the consulate attack is being showered with praise, BBC Monitoring reports. ""Suhai Aziz, you have set an example of bravery. These are the women who are ahead of everyone,"" Sindh provincial chief Murad Ali Shah was quoted as saying by Pakistan Today. ""They say women belong in the kitchen. Except when everyone needs a saviour,"" columnist Aisha Sarwari tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

So much so, that my family had to leave our village and move to a nearby town,"" she is quoted as telling The Express Tribune. By Secunder Kermani, BBC Pakistan correspondent, Islamabad Balochistan is a sparsely populated region, and has remained Pakistan's most impoverished area despite being rich in gas and coal reserves, as well as copper and gold. Baloch nationalists have long accused the central government of exploitation, and denying the province its due rights. The area is at the heart of an ambitious Chinese project, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The corridor is a string of huge investments by China in Pakistani infrastructure, which aim to link its western Xinjiang province with the Arabian Sea port of Gwadar in Balochistan, as part of theOne Belt, One Road initiative. Risky road: China's missionaries follow Beijing west Is China-Pakistan 'silk road' a game-changer? China has poured billions into Pakistan, and thousands of Chinese nationals visit the country to work on CPEC projects or other business ventures. Pakistan is keen to ensure nothing happens to jeopardise that and Chinese workers are closely guarded. The assault on the consulate is particularly significant because it took place in Karachi, the commercial capital of Pakistan, rather than in the remote province where the militants are based. The incident will deeply concern authorities who have described the Chinese funding as a ""game-changer"". What is China's One Belt, One Road? Video, 00:02:36What is China's One Belt, One Road?

"There is ""no realistic prospect"" of the government meeting its own deadline to install smart meters, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). The public accounts watchdog has joined a chorus of voices - including a group of MPs and Citizens Advice - which say the target is impossible to reach. Every home in Britain is supposed to have a smart meter - which avoids the need for customer readings - by 2020. However the government has insisted that it will meet its commitment. The NAO also said that nearly one million smart meters are no longer working properly, and that the coldest parts of Britain have the fewest meters. 'Deadline requires 30 meters a minute' Deadine 'should be extended' To meet the deadline, installers will need to replace 39 million old meters within the next two years, according to the NAO. In comparison, just 12 million meters have been replaced over the last six years. Earlier this week the consumer group Which? said that the industry would need to install 30 meters every minute over the next two years to meet the target. It is currently installing fewer than ten, it said. The government said that 400,000 meters were being installed every month, and the target was achievable. ""Millions have already chosen to have a smart meter and take control of their energy use to cut their bills,"" said energy minister Claire Perry. ""We've said everyone will be offered a smart meter by the end of 2020 to reap these benefits and we will meet that commitment."" Energy UK, which represents the firms installing the meters, told the BBC it would not speculate on the feasibility of hitting the deadline. Smart meters are designed to save consumers money, as it is said that they encourage householders to use less power. Because they can be read remotely, the costs to industry are also lower. They also enable consumers to use cheaper tariffs, by using power in the evening or on week-ends. Four years ago the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy estimated that they would save consumers about Â£26 a year. However, the NAO says the increasing cost of installing them will now save consumers less than Â£11 annually. That follows asimilar estimate made by a group of MPsin the summer. In any case, the NAO says the government is failing to monitor what savings households are actually making. The first generation of smart meters do not necessarily continue working if a customer switches supplier. About 70% of them ""go dumb"", according to the NAO. The second generation is designed to be more flexible, but only 109,000 such meters have been installed. The NAO says 943,000 first generation meters have now stopped working to their full capacity, because of a change of supplier. The NAO says the functionality of smart meters still needs improvement. It says they don't work in homes with thick walls, for example, which can block the mobile phone signals needed to transmit their data. And it says the coldest parts of the country are the least likely to have a smart meter installed, even though the need in such regions is greater. In Scotland and the north of England just 3,000 second generation meters had been installed by June, compared to 106,000 in the rest of Britain.

"This video can not be played One family is responsible for ending FGM in an entire village in Sudan The UK is to give Â£50m ($64m) in aid money to help stop female genital mutilation (FGM) in Africa. The government says this is the biggest single investment to date in the world to help end FGM by 2030. The practice involves removing all or part of a girl or woman's external genitalia, including the clitoris, with some treating it as a rite of passage. ActionAid welcomed the funding but said focusing on FGM alone ""was not enough"" to eradicate violence against women. The aid package will help fund organisations such as the Saleema project in Sudan, which aims to show girls they can feel empowered if they are left uncut as well as trying to shift the attitudes of older members in the community. Ministers have said the money will also have a beneficial effect in the UK as it will be used to help reduce the risk of girls being taken abroad to be cut. FGM has been illegal in the UK since 1985 and further legislation in 2003 and 2005 made it an offence to arrange the practice outside the country for British citizens or permanent residents. But there is yet to be a successful prosecution. The government says there are an estimated 24,000 women and girls at risk of FGM in the UK. What does FGM actually involve? Botched FGM leaves 50 girls in hospital 'This is what it's like to pee after female genital mutilation' UK schoolgirls 'pressured into FGM' Announcing the aid money, International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt said FGM could not be eliminated in the UK ""without ending it globally"". ""Inspirational, courageous African women are leading efforts to end the practice in their own countries, and thanks to them, more communities are starting to abandon the practice,"" she said. ""But progress is at a critical juncture and we must work to protect the millions of girls that are still at risk of being cut."" Anne Quesney, ActionAid's senior women's rights advocacy adviser, called the UK aid money a ""vital effort to provide much needed support to ending one of the most extreme forms of violence against women and girls"". ""From our work in nine African countries, we have seen how this life-threatening practice not only impacts on girls' lives and health, it limits their futures,"" she said. ""Many girls never return to school and are forced into early marriage, for example. ""However, focusing on FGM alone is not enough... If we seriously want to eliminate violence against women and girls, we urgently need a holistic, well-resourced approach to tackling gender inequality more widely."" Includes ""the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons"" Practised in 30 countries in Africa, and some in Asia and the Middle East An estimated three million girls and women worldwide are at risk each year It is commonly carried out on young girls, often between infancy and the age of 15 Often motivated by beliefs about what is considered proper sexual behaviour, to prepare a girl or woman for adulthood and marriage, and to ensure ""pure femininity"" Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility and increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths Source:World Health Organization,external Anatomy of female genital mutilation 'Huge' fall in FGM rates for African girls UK schoolgirls 'pressured into FGM' Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Black Friday could provide ""prime pickings"" for cyber-crime, warns the security agency Black Friday sales could be targeted as ""prime pickings"" for cyber-crime, the UK's cyber-security defence agency has warned shoppers. The National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ intelligence service, is issuing advice to shoppers of the risk of ""malicious"" online threats. It is the first such official cyber-warning in the run-up to the Christmas shopping season. ""It's vital that knowledge is shared,"" says Ian Levy of the cyber-agency. The cyber-wing of the GCHQ communications centre says it wants to start a ""national cyber-chat"" on Black Friday when billions are spent on online shopping. It might be known for working in secret, but the agency wants to engage with the public over the seriousness of the threat. It has been involved in trying to tackle more than 550 significant cyber-incidents in the past 12 months, and has taken down almost 140,000 ""phishing"" websites used by fraudsters. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is giving tips for individual consumers to avoid cyber-crime - and for the first time it will be publishing answers to questions from the public on Twitter. There are warnings for better cyber-security when billions are being spent on online shopping ""Staying safe online doesn't require deep technical knowledge, and we want the whole country to know that the NCSC speaks the same language as them,"" said Mr Levy, the cyber-defence agency's technical director. ""With so many of the UK shopping online, we want to see these tips shared from classrooms and scout groups to family dinner tables and old people's homes."" The agency's chief executive, Ciaran Martin, recently told a meeting of business leaders of a ""serious and sustained"" threat, including from ""elite hackers"" in other countries. ""It is not speculation and it is not scare-mongering,"" said Mr Martin. ""Large-scale criminal cyber-activity is, sadly, ubiquitous."" This could include the ""theft of millions"" from retailers and attacks on financial networks on which shops depend, he said. A data breach had an average cost of Â£3m, he said - and there were estimates that the WannaCry cyber-attack last year had cost the United States Â£3.5bn. Another cyber-attack last year, known as NotPetya, had cost one firm up to Â£250m, including the cost of replacement IT equipment. The British Retail Consortium is backing the calls for better cyber-security during the Christmas shopping season. ""With more and more shoppers looking to get the best deals online, retailers continue to invest significantly in developing the right tools and expertise to protect against cyber-threats,"" says James Martin, security adviser to the retailers' organisation. But he warned of the danger of cyber-crime causing a ""post-Christmas headache"". The National Cyber Security Centre's advice to reduce the risk of cyber-crime is: Install the latest software and app updates Choose strong and separate passwords for accounts Type in a shop's website address rather than clicking on links in emails Avoid over-sharing unnecessary information with shops, even if they ask Don't panic if you think you've been a victim of fraud Keep an eye on bank accounts for unrecognised payments Make sure all your home gadgets are secure Top tips for online shopping this Christmas.

"Noel Edmonds has formally kick-started his legal action against Lloyds Bank as he enters the I'm a Celebrity jungle. The TV personality is seeking at least Â£30m over an alleged scam involving staff at the Reading branch of HBOS, which was later bought by Lloyds. He claims his former firm Unique Group was destroyed because of fraud. Lloyds has rejected the basis of his claim. On Friday his lawyers served Lloyds with a pre-case letter to initiate action, which could start next month. A spokesperson for Lloyds Banking Group said it would review the letter before responding. ""We fully understand the anguish he feels at the failure of his businesses, but on the information we have seen so far we simply cannot agree that this is the result of actions taken by the former HBOS business. ""We are content for the matter to be considered by a court if he pursues his legal action. However we cannot allow ourselves to be pressed into paying out money without cause just because an individual uses their celebrity status to attack us."" The spokesperson said 71 of the 72 customers affected by the fraud at the HBOS Impaired Assets office based in Reading have been made compensation offers and 64 had been accepted. It comes as Mr Edmonds says he will use his appearance in the ITV reality show to promote his cause in his battle for compensation from Lloyds. The former Deal Or No Deal host said in videos released to the Press Association that Lloyds would ""have to pay up"", adding: ""I am totally convinced at trial we will win."" ""It's not going to do any harm to be in the jungle on ITV at peak time every single day for a few weeks,"" he said. Lloyds has set aside Â£100m for victims of the fraud at the hands of HBOS Reading staff between 2003 and 2007. Corrupt staff from the HBOS branch were jailed last yearfor a Â£245m loans scam between 2003 and 2007 that destroyed several businesses. It was revealed they squandered the profits on prostitutes and luxury holidays.
