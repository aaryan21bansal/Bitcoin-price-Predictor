"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to announce a Â£126m boost for traineeships in England in his Budget on Wednesday. The scheme will include a new ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship that will enable apprentices to work with a number of different employers in one sector. Unemployment is at its highest level in almost five years, with younger and typically lower-paid workers bearing the brunt of job losses. Mr Sunak said it was ""vital"" support continued to get people back into work. The chancellor's boost to existing apprenticeship and traineeship programmes will include playing up to double the current cash incentive to firms who take on an apprentice, regardless of age. It comes as a new government guarantee for low-deposit mortgagesis announced as part of next week's measures. 'We'd just begun our careers when the pandemic hit' 'Furlough is a lifeline, I hope they extend it' Apprentice redundancies rise: 'I was devastated' Traineeships are intended to get people into their first job after education. They last from six weeks to six months and they are open to people aged between 16 and 24. Currently, firms in England are given Â£2,000 for every new apprentice they take on under the age of 25, and Â£1,500 for those over 25, in addition to a Â£1,000 grant they are already getting under another project. Mr Sunak will promise to increase the cash incentives for employers who take on an apprentice to Â£3,000 - regardless of age. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is warning the UK's finances are ""exposed"" So the government says the planned Â£126m investment could enable 40,000 more traineeships. While he is committed to helping jobseekers and employers, Mr Sunak warned in an interview withthe Financial Times,externalthat the UK's finances were now ""exposed"". ""Because we now have far more debt than we used to and because interest ratesâ.â.â.âat least a month or two ago were exceptionally low, that means we remain exposed to changes in those rates,"" he said. ""That why I talk about levelling with people about the public finances [challenges] and our plans to address them."" He added that the UK's exposure to a rise of one percentage point across all interest rates meant adding Â£25bn a year to the government's cost of servicing its debt. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which represents HR professionals, welcomed the move, but said it would like to see reform of the apprenticeships system to make it more flexible. ""Changing the apprenticeship levy to make it a flexible training levy would achieve a bigger boost to skills development than incentives alone,"" said Lizzie Crowley, skills adviser for the CIPD. She stressed that awareness of traineeships is very low: ""Besides providing additional funding for placements, the government will have to do much more to market them to employers to boost uptake."" The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB), which had previously called for flexi-job apprenticeships, said the increase in incentives for employers was ""important"", because the current level of support ""is not leading to enough starts"". ""It will be important in the budget to take wider action to support jobs, including on employers national insurance and reintroducing the jobs retention bonus,"" said the FSB's national chairman Mike Cherry. ""Going forward, the government should consider changing the timings of apprenticeship incentives.""

"Alex Salmond explained to a committee of MSPs why he believed there was an attempt - by a number of people he named - to remove him from public life In his evidence - which lasted six hours - the former first minister fired shots at the Scottish government, including saying its harassment policy was ""badly thought out and badly implemented"" He was also critical of the ""censorship"" of one of his submissions to the Holyrood committee investigating the mishandling of complaints against him A row erupted after part of his written evidence was initially published but later redacted when the Crown Office raised concerns with the Scottish Parliament Mr Salmond believed that other parliaments, including the one at Westminster, would not have agreed to such a request by a prosecution service He accused the civil service, the Crown Office and the Scottish government of ""many and obvious"" failures in leadership, adding that there should be resignations Mr Salmond also told MSPs that the name of a woman who had made complaints about him had been shared at a meeting involving his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein The politician of three decades said he hoped the inquiry would yield lessons leading to a greater confidence in Scotland's institutions Mr Salmond went on to say that he ""has no doubt"" that Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor had ""not a shred of evidence"" to back his claim that there was ""malicious"" moves to damage him BBC Scotland News Thank you for joining our coverage of Alex Salmond's
six-hour evidence session. Here are the main points:  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The last six hours have been detailed. Alex Salmondâs
complaints are numerous. But stand back from it for a second. The former first minister of Scotland has just accused his
successor of breaking the ministerial code â and left open the door for her
having to resign as a result. He has said Scotlandâs most senior civil servant should quit
â and that its most senior lawyer should consider his position. Nicola Sturgeonâs allies will argue he has not provided
evidence for his claims of a plot against him. But Ms Sturgeon will face huge questions when she appears
before MSPs next week â some of the most difficult she has faced in her career. In
response to the question about whether Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans would resign, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""No."" ""Scottish Government civil servants have acted professionally throughout on
behalf of ministers and in line with the Civil Service Code and values of
integrity, honesty, impartiality and objectivity. ""The permanent secretary
has already addressed the issues raised today at Committee on several
occasions. ""As the first minister has set out, she retains confidence in
the permanent secretary and expects her to see out the remainder of her
contract."" The spokesman said the government had a duty to investigate the ""serious and specific"" complaints against Mr Salmond. ""As set out in
detailed evidence to the committee, all government decisions were informed by
legal advice and taken in line with the Civil Service Code,"" he added. The Crown Office has responded to the allegations made by Alex Salmond in his evidence, saying it takes its responsibility to uphold the law seriously and protects the dignity and rights of all. It added: âScotlandâs prosecutors have acted independently and in the public interest at all times when considering matters related to this case. âThe Lord Advocate will appear before the committee next week to assist in public understanding of his role, and the actions of the Crown Office in relation to this case.â Philip SimBBC Scotland political reporter As the session ended, Mr Salmond
suggested to the committee that it could use its powers to seek to recover
documents from his lawyers. He
said the group had previously served orders on âpeople unwilling to give you
informationâ â but that his solicitors would be âextremely willingâ to assist. The committee has requested that the
Crown Office produce messages which Mr Salmond cited as potential proof of
collusion against him by midday on Tuesday â the day before Nicola Sturgeon
gives evidence. The group had previously used Scotland Act powers to compel the release of
other text messages â but concluded that they were not relevant to the
inquiryâs remit. Mr Salmond concludes by suggesting that the committee should serve an order under the Scotland Act on his solicitors ""who are extremely willing to give you information"". He says members may also want to request ""the letters from the Crown Office preventing me from furnishing you with that information hitherto"" under the same powers. He says that if the committee serves that order on his solicitors they will have the documentation on Monday morning, in time for sessions with the Lord Advocate and crown agent. Jackie Baillie Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says that Mr Salmond has been very careful not call for Nicola Sturgeon to resign. ""Does that mean you have forgiven her for her handling of this?"" she asks. Mr Salmond says ""no"" - it means the people who he has called on to consider their positions are the ones where he has ""documentary evidence"" of their actions. ""I don't think it is for me to judge what happens to someone who may have broken the ministerial code,"" he says. Committee convener Linda Fabiani asks Mr Salmond when the ""malicious plan"" that he has described against him started. Mr Salmond repeats that he thinks some people hoped the police investigation would come to the rescue of the judicial review. ""That almost happened,"" he says. ""It was only with the great work of my legal team that we were able to argue that should not happen."" James Hamilton QC, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions, is leading an investigation into whether Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. Independent MSP Andy Wightman asks Mr Salmond if he has ""full confidence in the independent advisers on the ministerial code"" and ""can we rely on Mr Hamilton's findings?"" Mr Salmond says he has ""every reason to believe he (Mr Hamilton) is a man of great integrity and experience"". He says he created the panel and thinks it is unsatisfactory its remit should be confined in any way. ""I've got every confidence that Mr Hamilton will discharge his duties in a proper way and I think it is fundamentally a good system,"" he says. Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell on a visit to Wimbledon Alex Salmond has made a series of allegations in
his evidence:  The first minister, Mr Murrell, Ms Evans and Lord Wolffe have all rejected the allegations and deny wrongdoing. Murdo Fraser asks Mr Salmond who should resign. Mr Salmond says the people responsible for the judicial review should resign. He says permanent secretary Leslie Evans should have resigned on 8 January 2019 when the judicial review was conceded, and he knew Scottish government ministers who felt the same. ""I can't think of many people who would not have thought that an appropriate thing to do,"" he says. ""I think the Lord Advocate should be considering his position for this and a range of other issues,"" Mr Salmond adds. He says the Scottish government administration and the Crown Office needs new leadership. Mr Fraser asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if she is shown to have broken the ministerial code. Mr Salmond says he is in no doubt that she has broken the code, but it is not for him to say what the consequences should be. He says it is not the case that every minister that breaks the code resigns. ""Your own party have an example of that relatively recently,"" he tells the Tory MSP, referring to the case of the UK government's Home Secretary Priti Patel. Mr Salmond said in his submission that ""the evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and
concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and
the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned"". Tory MSP Murdo Fraser asks why these people would conspire against him. Mr Salmond says the original intention was to defeat the judicial review by having it postponed. He says: ""It came to be believed among some people that the loss of the court case would be cataclysmic not just for Leslie Evans and senior officials in the Scottish government, but for Nicola Sturgeon herself. ""I think people came to the belief that the police process would somehow assist in firstly not losing the review, and thereafter making sure that the loss of the judicial review was swept away in the inevitable publicity of the criminal trial. ""If I had been convicted of any offence in the criminal trial, that would be the case.""  The evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned. Alex Salmond, Former first minister Mr Salmond tells Murdo Fraser that both explanations around the 29 March meeting breach the ministerial code. He says either Ms Sturgeon did not really forget about it and parliament was deliberately misled, or alternatively it was forgotten about and parliament was not informed when she was reminded of it. These are clear breaches of the ministerial code, he says. A separate inquiry, led by James Hamilton, is to decide on whether the ministerial code was broken. Murdo Fraser Tory MSP Murdo Fraser says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Mr Salmond's claims are untrue and he has no evidence. ""In effect she is denouncing you as a liar and a fantasist. Are you?"" asks Mr Fraser. Mr Salmond points to the evidence of his claims, citing the meeting with his special advisor on 29 March 2018 which Ms Sturgeon had ""forgotten"" happened. He says there is no doubt that this meeting was pre-arranged for the express purpose of Ms Sturgeon being briefed about the complaints against him. The meeting on 2 April arose from that, he says. ""Otherwise, how on earth would I have known to turn up on the 2 April?"" Mr Salmond says that for a substantial period of time the meeting of 29 March was written out of history. ""People say what difference does four days make?"" he asks. ""The difference is, of course, if the meeting of 29 March is admitted and, indeed, the subject matter is admitted, then it makes it very hard to argue that the meeting of 2 April was on party business as opposed to government business."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Thereâs a lot of important detail to wade through in this
inquiry and it would be easy to get bogged down. But essentially Alex Salmond thinks senior figures in
Scotlandâs public administration should be held to account for mishandling
harassment complaints against him. Perhaps foremost among them is Scotlandâs top civil servant,
Leslie Evans. Asked by Labour MSP Jackie Baillie if he thought she had
discharged her responsibilities in line with the ministerial code, he gave a
one word answer: âNoâ. Heâs also taken aim at the Scottish governmentâs chief legal
adviser, Lord Advocate James Wolffe. And we know that he thinks his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, has repeatedly broken the code of conduct of ministers. His evidence on the ministerial code is the final section of
todayâs epic evidence session which has already gone into extra time. Mr Cole-Hamilton says the first minister's written evidence says she agreed to meet Mr Salmond for two reasons. The Lib Dem MSP says the first was Mr Salmond's ""profound distress"" around what he was going to say at the meeting, and the second was that she thought he was going to resign her party membership. Mr Salmond says he had no purpose in resigning from the SNP at that time and insists ""I had no thought of resignation whatsoever. ""Resignation from the SNP never entered my head."" Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole Hamilton Mr Cole-Hamilton asks Mr Salmond to summarise the discussion he had with the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says
they had discussed the situation and what he had been sent, which had some
detail. He said there was no suggestion that Ms Sturgeon was ""surprised and astounded"" by the reason for the meeting. ""The meeting was for that purpose,"" he said. He says they went through options, including a mediation policy - which had been absent from the harassment policy. Mr Salmond says the indication the first minister gave him was that she was willing to go ahead with that. Mr Cole-Hamilton asks if the name of one of the complainants was intimated to him and the three other people involved in that discussion. Mr Salmond said he thought it was - but that the name had previously been given to him by Geoff Aberdein, who had got it from a senior government official. Nicola Sturgeon met Mr Salmond at her home in April 2018 Alex Cole-Hamilton focuses on a meeting between Geoff Aberdein and Nicola Sturgeon on 29 March 2018 and the subsequent meeting between Alex Salmond and the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says the purpose of Mr Aberdein meeting with Ms Sturgeon on 29 March was to brief the first minister on what was happening. ""I know that Nicola Sturgeon knew about the complaints process at the meeting on the 29th of March because I was told so by Geoff Aberdein,"" he said. He adds that meeting was ""not impromptu, was not accidental, was not her popping her head around the door - it was a meeting arranged for that purpose"". Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon met at the first ministerâs Glasgow home on 2 April. Mr Salmond says he had heard Mr Murrell say that he was regularly ""popping in"". The former first minister points out that he stays 200 miles away from Glasgow and says he has only visited Ms Sturgeon's home about six times in his life. ""I didn't pop in,"" he says. Tory MSP Margaret Mitchell refers to a text sent by SNP chief executive Peter Murrell that talks of âpressurisingâ the police. Another says ""the more fronts he is having to firefight on the better for all complainers"". Mr Murrell, who is the husband of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has said the messages were out of character and expressed how upset he was at the time. Mr Salmond says that in January last year, on the day he first appeared at court for a preliminary hearing in the criminal case, he was presented with a memory stick. The next day when he went through the messages it contained ""was one of the most extraordinary days of my life"", Mr Salmond says. He says he is not allowed to describe them in any detail, but they speak to behaviour he would not have expected from people he had known for 30 years. ""In my opinion, there has been behaviour which is about not just pressurising the police but pressurising witnesses, collusion with witnesses, we are talking about the construction of evidence because the police were somehow felt inadequate in finding it themselves,"" he says. Mr Salmond says that when a police investigation starts these matters are for the police. It is not for the SNP or the Scottish government to supplant the police in an investigative function, he says. Jackie Baillie asked if the ministerial code had been breached Jackie Baillie says there was a meeting on 13 November 2018 between counsel, the first minister, the permanent secretary and the chief of staff. ""As a former first minister, would carrying on legal action in the Court of Session knowing that you had acted unlawfully be a breach of the ministerial code?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" replies Mr Salmond. Ms Baillie asks: ""Do you believe that this was the case in this instance?"" He replies: ""Well we cannot be sure because I like you haven't seen the external legal advice of October 2018."" If the legal advice said the government was about to lose and the first minister carried on with the case then that would be a breach of the ministerial code, he says. Mr Salmond says people would be better informed if they could see the document. Ms Baillie says the parliament has asked twice, adding: ""Good luck with that one."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Steph Norman and Aaron Willoughby have been told they must have their wedding ceremony in English first A couple feel ""discriminated against"" after being told they cannot have their wedding ceremony entirely in Cornish. Steph Norman and Aaron Willoughby were told by Cornwall Council their ceremony must be in English and Cornish. The council said ""declaratory and contracting words"" can only be said in English or Welsh for a legally binding marriage. Ms Norman said ""I feel if everyone understands the language, it should be up to them what language they speak"". The couple contacted the council as part of their search for a registrar who speaks Cornish, when they were told their plans for the ceremony were not legal. Ms Norman, 32, from St Anne near St Day, then researched theMarriage Act 1949,externaland found an exception only applied to Welsh speakers. Cornwall Council told the couple their ceremony was not legally allowed to be entirely in Cornish She said: ""If you fluently speak Welsh then that's perfectly legal, but not Cornish. ""It feels like we've been a bit discriminated against, because it's not equal across the board."" The couple have learned a ""good fair bit"" of the language as it was ""really important to our culture and our heritage,"" Ms Norman said. ""We just really wanted an authentic Cornish wedding and part of that would be incorporating the language. ""So we can a little bit, but not fully,"" she added. Cornwall Council confirmed the ""declaratory and contracting words"" of a marriage ceremony must be conducted in English or Welsh to be legally binding. It said: ""We try to tailor each ceremony to the couple's wishes and Cornish phrases are often included in our ceremonies. ""Currently we don't have a fluent Cornish speaking registrar but we can accommodate a Cornish translator if one is provided by the couple."" Cornwall Council estimated in 2015about 300 to 400 peoplespoke the language fluently and used it regularly, with about 5,000 more having some conversational ability. Cornish language teacher Jenefer Lowe said she was ""hopeful"" that a couple like Steph and Aaron would be able to take their vows in Cornish in the future. ""What we really need for that to happen is for Cornish to get official status like Welsh and Gaelic,"" she said. ""That needs a critical mass of people using the language for it to be accepted. ""But because it's not official we don't have the ability to do legal proceedings at the moment."" She has seen an increasing interest in the language in Cornwall and from around the world and there had been ""huge advances"" in the last 20 years, especially with uptake from young people. Teaching online in the pandemic had also increased the number of learners, she said. ""I have students in Australia, America and around the world, but we now need to translate that into more speakers and more resources.

"All areas of the UK are moving into the next vaccination phase, to prioritise those aged over 40 People aged in their 40s will be next in line to get the coronavirus vaccine, Wales' chief medical officer has said. Thefour UK nations are doing this, under the plan to vaccinate all adults by the end of July. Dr Frank Atherton said the plan for Wales depends on ""supply matching our ambition"". Teachers and police officers were among those who lobbied to be prioritised - but will now be vaccinated in line with their age group. News of the next phase comes as Public Health Wales figures showmore than 270,000 people aged in their 50s and 60s, have had their first dose of Covid vaccine. All four of Wales' chief constables have criticised the decision not to prioritise frontline workers, saying they were ""incredibly disappointed"". Head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said all front-line staff ""should be protected now"". Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Dr Atherton said there was not enough evidence to support prioritising people from specific occupations in the next phase of the vaccine rollout, as outlined by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). This video can not be played Frank Atherton says the plan depends on ""supply matching our ambition"" ""I, along with the UK's other three chief medical officers support the JCVI advice and the four UK governments have agreed to implement it,"" he said.Â ""This means the UK's vaccine programmes remains aligned as we all work towards one shared goal. ""This is the simplest, quickest and fairest approach. And it means we can remain on track to meet our ambitious vaccination targets."" Age not job priority in Covid jab's second phase How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? All adults in Wales to be offered jab by 31 July He said calls for people in specific occupations to be prioritised had been heard. ""The JCVI did consider this - however, it found there wasn't sufficient evidence to set specific occupations apart from the general population.Â It also advised that the complexity of delivering this approach would slow down the pace of the vaccination roll-out,"" he added. However Laura Doel, director of NAHT Cymru, said that despite such complexity it was ""not a good enough reason not to prioritise the needs of committed professionals"". ""We call upon the Welsh Government to take a different viewâ¦ front line staff should be protected now that those in the greatest danger have already been vaccinated,"" she said. ""They are being required to work with large groups of people who carry at least as much potential for infection as anyone else. ""Those groups often occupy confined and unventilated spaces for long periods of time with only rudimentary PPE."" In a joint statement, Wales' four chief constables - Carl Foulkes of North Wales Police, Mark Collins of Dyfed Powys Police, Pam Kelly of Gwent Police and Jeremy Vaughan of South Wales Police - said: ""We have repeatedly asked that policing be risk assessed so our officers and staff can be given due consideration, given the risks they take daily on behalf of us all.

Thetotal number of people to have received their first dose of a Covid vaccinein Wales is 902,334 and 80,062 of those have had their second dose.

"NI has remained part of the EU's single market for goods and continues to enforce EU customs rules at its ports Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) agriculture minister has ordered officials to stop work on new permanent border control posts (BCPs). These are used to check food products from GB. Existing temporary BCPs are continuing to operate. The minister, Gordon Lyons, said he had also asked officials to stop recruiting BCP staff. Three Stormont ministers have formally requested an emergency meeting of the NI Executive over the move. It is understood officials are seeking legal advice on whether they can follow Mr Lyons' orders. The BCPs are a requirement of the Brexit deal between the UK and EU. Mr Lyons said he was responding to ""practical difficulties"" caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol. Gordon Lyons has been accused of doing ""a solo run"" He said there was too much uncertainty around the end of the protocol grace periods. ""It's a real nightmare for us and it's going to be causing us an awful lot of problems."" The Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. What are Brexit border controls between GB and NI? Currently, there are grace periods in place that mean checks and controls on goods going from GB to NI are not yet fully implemented. The first of the grace periods, which covers food and parcels, is due to end in April. Mr Lyons' predecessor as agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, had sought legal advice on whether he could instruct his officials not to operate the BCPs but was told that would be unlawful. Infrastructure Minister Nicola Mallon, of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), Finance Minister Conor Murphy, of Sinn FÃ©in, and Justice Minister Naomi Long, of the Alliance Party, wrote to ministerial colleagues, calling for an urgent meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive on Friday evening. ""This controversial and cross-cutting matter requires the executive to meet as a matter of urgency,"" they said. Alliance MP Stephen Farry said the move was ""illegal"" and ""self-defeating"". ""Focus has to be on achieving agreed practical solutions,"" he wrote on social media. Ms Mallon told BBC News NI the Mr Lyons' decision ""is clearly controversial, it is clearly cross cutting and it clearly can't have any effect without the executive agreement and that's why it's essential that we meet tonight and that we take action on this unilateral solo run by the DUP minister"".

Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said the DUP ""must own the consequences of Brexit"" and the Northern Ireland Protocol is a ""direct consequence of Brexit"". She added that the ""solo run by DUP Minister for Agriculture Gordon Lyons instructing his officials to halt work on further infrastructure, and charging at the ports is clearly a stunt"". Ms O'Neill said that there was no alternative to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Sinn FÃ©in MLA Declan McAleer, who is chair of Stormont's agriculture committee, said he has sought an urgent meeting with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs' permanent secretary.

"Alex Salmond explained to a committee of MSPs why he believed there was an attempt - by a number of people he named - to remove him from public life In his evidence - which lasted six hours - the former first minister fired shots at the Scottish government, including saying its harassment policy was ""badly thought out and badly implemented"" He was also critical of the ""censorship"" of one of his submissions to the Holyrood committee investigating the mishandling of complaints against him A row erupted after part of his written evidence was initially published but later redacted when the Crown Office raised concerns with the Scottish Parliament Mr Salmond believed that other parliaments, including the one at Westminster, would not have agreed to such a request by a prosecution service He accused the civil service, the Crown Office and the Scottish government of ""many and obvious"" failures in leadership, adding that there should be resignations Mr Salmond also told MSPs that the name of a woman who had made complaints about him had been shared at a meeting involving his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein The politician of three decades said he hoped the inquiry would yield lessons leading to a greater confidence in Scotland's institutions Mr Salmond went on to say that he ""has no doubt"" that Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor had ""not a shred of evidence"" to back his claim that there was ""malicious"" moves to damage him BBC Scotland News Thank you for joining our coverage of Alex Salmond's
six-hour evidence session. Here are the main points:  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The last six hours have been detailed. Alex Salmondâs
complaints are numerous. But stand back from it for a second. The former first minister of Scotland has just accused his
successor of breaking the ministerial code â and left open the door for her
having to resign as a result. He has said Scotlandâs most senior civil servant should quit
â and that its most senior lawyer should consider his position. Nicola Sturgeonâs allies will argue he has not provided
evidence for his claims of a plot against him. But Ms Sturgeon will face huge questions when she appears
before MSPs next week â some of the most difficult she has faced in her career. In
response to the question about whether Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans would resign, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""No."" ""Scottish Government civil servants have acted professionally throughout on
behalf of ministers and in line with the Civil Service Code and values of
integrity, honesty, impartiality and objectivity. ""The permanent secretary
has already addressed the issues raised today at Committee on several
occasions. ""As the first minister has set out, she retains confidence in
the permanent secretary and expects her to see out the remainder of her
contract."" The spokesman said the government had a duty to investigate the ""serious and specific"" complaints against Mr Salmond. ""As set out in
detailed evidence to the committee, all government decisions were informed by
legal advice and taken in line with the Civil Service Code,"" he added. The Crown Office has responded to the allegations made by Alex Salmond in his evidence, saying it takes its responsibility to uphold the law seriously and protects the dignity and rights of all. It added: âScotlandâs prosecutors have acted independently and in the public interest at all times when considering matters related to this case. âThe Lord Advocate will appear before the committee next week to assist in public understanding of his role, and the actions of the Crown Office in relation to this case.â Philip SimBBC Scotland political reporter As the session ended, Mr Salmond
suggested to the committee that it could use its powers to seek to recover
documents from his lawyers. He
said the group had previously served orders on âpeople unwilling to give you
informationâ â but that his solicitors would be âextremely willingâ to assist. The committee has requested that the
Crown Office produce messages which Mr Salmond cited as potential proof of
collusion against him by midday on Tuesday â the day before Nicola Sturgeon
gives evidence. The group had previously used Scotland Act powers to compel the release of
other text messages â but concluded that they were not relevant to the
inquiryâs remit. Mr Salmond concludes by suggesting that the committee should serve an order under the Scotland Act on his solicitors ""who are extremely willing to give you information"". He says members may also want to request ""the letters from the Crown Office preventing me from furnishing you with that information hitherto"" under the same powers. He says that if the committee serves that order on his solicitors they will have the documentation on Monday morning, in time for sessions with the Lord Advocate and crown agent. Jackie Baillie Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says that Mr Salmond has been very careful not call for Nicola Sturgeon to resign. ""Does that mean you have forgiven her for her handling of this?"" she asks. Mr Salmond says ""no"" - it means the people who he has called on to consider their positions are the ones where he has ""documentary evidence"" of their actions. ""I don't think it is for me to judge what happens to someone who may have broken the ministerial code,"" he says. Committee convener Linda Fabiani asks Mr Salmond when the ""malicious plan"" that he has described against him started. Mr Salmond repeats that he thinks some people hoped the police investigation would come to the rescue of the judicial review. ""That almost happened,"" he says. ""It was only with the great work of my legal team that we were able to argue that should not happen."" James Hamilton QC, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions, is leading an investigation into whether Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. Independent MSP Andy Wightman asks Mr Salmond if he has ""full confidence in the independent advisers on the ministerial code"" and ""can we rely on Mr Hamilton's findings?"" Mr Salmond says he has ""every reason to believe he (Mr Hamilton) is a man of great integrity and experience"". He says he created the panel and thinks it is unsatisfactory its remit should be confined in any way. ""I've got every confidence that Mr Hamilton will discharge his duties in a proper way and I think it is fundamentally a good system,"" he says. Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell on a visit to Wimbledon Alex Salmond has made a series of allegations in
his evidence:  The first minister, Mr Murrell, Ms Evans and Lord Wolffe have all rejected the allegations and deny wrongdoing. Murdo Fraser asks Mr Salmond who should resign. Mr Salmond says the people responsible for the judicial review should resign. He says permanent secretary Leslie Evans should have resigned on 8 January 2019 when the judicial review was conceded, and he knew Scottish government ministers who felt the same. ""I can't think of many people who would not have thought that an appropriate thing to do,"" he says. ""I think the Lord Advocate should be considering his position for this and a range of other issues,"" Mr Salmond adds. He says the Scottish government administration and the Crown Office needs new leadership. Mr Fraser asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if she is shown to have broken the ministerial code. Mr Salmond says he is in no doubt that she has broken the code, but it is not for him to say what the consequences should be. He says it is not the case that every minister that breaks the code resigns. ""Your own party have an example of that relatively recently,"" he tells the Tory MSP, referring to the case of the UK government's Home Secretary Priti Patel. Mr Salmond said in his submission that ""the evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and
concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and
the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned"". Tory MSP Murdo Fraser asks why these people would conspire against him. Mr Salmond says the original intention was to defeat the judicial review by having it postponed. He says: ""It came to be believed among some people that the loss of the court case would be cataclysmic not just for Leslie Evans and senior officials in the Scottish government, but for Nicola Sturgeon herself. ""I think people came to the belief that the police process would somehow assist in firstly not losing the review, and thereafter making sure that the loss of the judicial review was swept away in the inevitable publicity of the criminal trial. ""If I had been convicted of any offence in the criminal trial, that would be the case.""  The evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned. Alex Salmond, Former first minister Mr Salmond tells Murdo Fraser that both explanations around the 29 March meeting breach the ministerial code. He says either Ms Sturgeon did not really forget about it and parliament was deliberately misled, or alternatively it was forgotten about and parliament was not informed when she was reminded of it. These are clear breaches of the ministerial code, he says. A separate inquiry, led by James Hamilton, is to decide on whether the ministerial code was broken. Murdo Fraser Tory MSP Murdo Fraser says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Mr Salmond's claims are untrue and he has no evidence. ""In effect she is denouncing you as a liar and a fantasist. Are you?"" asks Mr Fraser. Mr Salmond points to the evidence of his claims, citing the meeting with his special advisor on 29 March 2018 which Ms Sturgeon had ""forgotten"" happened. He says there is no doubt that this meeting was pre-arranged for the express purpose of Ms Sturgeon being briefed about the complaints against him. The meeting on 2 April arose from that, he says. ""Otherwise, how on earth would I have known to turn up on the 2 April?"" Mr Salmond says that for a substantial period of time the meeting of 29 March was written out of history. ""People say what difference does four days make?"" he asks. ""The difference is, of course, if the meeting of 29 March is admitted and, indeed, the subject matter is admitted, then it makes it very hard to argue that the meeting of 2 April was on party business as opposed to government business."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Thereâs a lot of important detail to wade through in this
inquiry and it would be easy to get bogged down. But essentially Alex Salmond thinks senior figures in
Scotlandâs public administration should be held to account for mishandling
harassment complaints against him. Perhaps foremost among them is Scotlandâs top civil servant,
Leslie Evans. Asked by Labour MSP Jackie Baillie if he thought she had
discharged her responsibilities in line with the ministerial code, he gave a
one word answer: âNoâ. Heâs also taken aim at the Scottish governmentâs chief legal
adviser, Lord Advocate James Wolffe. And we know that he thinks his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, has repeatedly broken the code of conduct of ministers. His evidence on the ministerial code is the final section of
todayâs epic evidence session which has already gone into extra time. Mr Cole-Hamilton says the first minister's written evidence says she agreed to meet Mr Salmond for two reasons. The Lib Dem MSP says the first was Mr Salmond's ""profound distress"" around what he was going to say at the meeting, and the second was that she thought he was going to resign her party membership. Mr Salmond says he had no purpose in resigning from the SNP at that time and insists ""I had no thought of resignation whatsoever. ""Resignation from the SNP never entered my head."" Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole Hamilton Mr Cole-Hamilton asks Mr Salmond to summarise the discussion he had with the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says
they had discussed the situation and what he had been sent, which had some
detail. He said there was no suggestion that Ms Sturgeon was ""surprised and astounded"" by the reason for the meeting. ""The meeting was for that purpose,"" he said. He says they went through options, including a mediation policy - which had been absent from the harassment policy. Mr Salmond says the indication the first minister gave him was that she was willing to go ahead with that. Mr Cole-Hamilton asks if the name of one of the complainants was intimated to him and the three other people involved in that discussion. Mr Salmond said he thought it was - but that the name had previously been given to him by Geoff Aberdein, who had got it from a senior government official. Nicola Sturgeon met Mr Salmond at her home in April 2018 Alex Cole-Hamilton focuses on a meeting between Geoff Aberdein and Nicola Sturgeon on 29 March 2018 and the subsequent meeting between Alex Salmond and the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says the purpose of Mr Aberdein meeting with Ms Sturgeon on 29 March was to brief the first minister on what was happening. ""I know that Nicola Sturgeon knew about the complaints process at the meeting on the 29th of March because I was told so by Geoff Aberdein,"" he said. He adds that meeting was ""not impromptu, was not accidental, was not her popping her head around the door - it was a meeting arranged for that purpose"". Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon met at the first ministerâs Glasgow home on 2 April. Mr Salmond says he had heard Mr Murrell say that he was regularly ""popping in"". The former first minister points out that he stays 200 miles away from Glasgow and says he has only visited Ms Sturgeon's home about six times in his life. ""I didn't pop in,"" he says. Tory MSP Margaret Mitchell refers to a text sent by SNP chief executive Peter Murrell that talks of âpressurisingâ the police. Another says ""the more fronts he is having to firefight on the better for all complainers"". Mr Murrell, who is the husband of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has said the messages were out of character and expressed how upset he was at the time. Mr Salmond says that in January last year, on the day he first appeared at court for a preliminary hearing in the criminal case, he was presented with a memory stick. The next day when he went through the messages it contained ""was one of the most extraordinary days of my life"", Mr Salmond says. He says he is not allowed to describe them in any detail, but they speak to behaviour he would not have expected from people he had known for 30 years. ""In my opinion, there has been behaviour which is about not just pressurising the police but pressurising witnesses, collusion with witnesses, we are talking about the construction of evidence because the police were somehow felt inadequate in finding it themselves,"" he says. Mr Salmond says that when a police investigation starts these matters are for the police. It is not for the SNP or the Scottish government to supplant the police in an investigative function, he says. Jackie Baillie asked if the ministerial code had been breached Jackie Baillie says there was a meeting on 13 November 2018 between counsel, the first minister, the permanent secretary and the chief of staff. ""As a former first minister, would carrying on legal action in the Court of Session knowing that you had acted unlawfully be a breach of the ministerial code?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" replies Mr Salmond. Ms Baillie asks: ""Do you believe that this was the case in this instance?"" He replies: ""Well we cannot be sure because I like you haven't seen the external legal advice of October 2018."" If the legal advice said the government was about to lose and the first minister carried on with the case then that would be a breach of the ministerial code, he says. Mr Salmond says people would be better informed if they could see the document. Ms Baillie says the parliament has asked twice, adding: ""Good luck with that one."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Carl Woolley (pictured) punched Stephen Jeffries in the face, causing him to collapse A man who admitted fatally punching another man after an argument in a car park has been jailed for six years. Stephen Jeffries, 59, was found with a head injury at The Avenue car park, Bournemouth, on 13 September and died two days later in hospital. Carl Woolley, 33, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to manslaughter in December. Prosecutors accepted the plea and they did not seek a trial on a charge of murder. Dorset Police said, prior to the assault, Mr Jeffries had been involved in a ""verbal altercation"" with a group of people close to the Flirt Cafe in The Triangle. Stephen Jeffries collapsed after a single punch Woolley, who was part of the group, followed Mr Jeffries as he walked away and punched him in the face, causing him to collapse. He presented himself to officers at the scene on the morning after the attack and told them he was responsible. Following the sentencing at Bournemouth Crown Court, Mr Jeffries' family issued a statement describing him as ""a kind and loving father, grandfather, brother, uncle and friend who loved life"". They said, because of the pandemic, they felt ""cheated"" of the opportunity to witness Woolley's sentencing and ""see if he is filled with remorse"".

"All areas of the UK are moving into the next vaccination phase, to prioritise those aged over 40 People aged in their 40s will be next in line to get the coronavirus vaccine, Wales' chief medical officer has said. Thefour UK nations are doing this, under the plan to vaccinate all adults by the end of July. Dr Frank Atherton said the plan for Wales depends on ""supply matching our ambition"". Teachers and police officers were among those who lobbied to be prioritised - but will now be vaccinated in line with their age group. News of the next phase comes as Public Health Wales figures showmore than 270,000 people aged in their 50s and 60s, have had their first dose of Covid vaccine.

Head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said all front-line staff ""should be protected now"".

"Alex Salmond explained to a committee of MSPs why he believed there was an attempt - by a number of people he named - to remove him from public life In his evidence - which lasted six hours - the former first minister fired shots at the Scottish government, including saying its harassment policy was ""badly thought out and badly implemented"" He was also critical of the ""censorship"" of one of his submissions to the Holyrood committee investigating the mishandling of complaints against him A row erupted after part of his written evidence was initially published but later redacted when the Crown Office raised concerns with the Scottish Parliament Mr Salmond believed that other parliaments, including the one at Westminster, would not have agreed to such a request by a prosecution service He accused the civil service, the Crown Office and the Scottish government of ""many and obvious"" failures in leadership, adding that there should be resignations Mr Salmond also told MSPs that the name of a woman who had made complaints about him had been shared at a meeting involving his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein The politician of three decades said he hoped the inquiry would yield lessons leading to a greater confidence in Scotland's institutions Mr Salmond went on to say that he ""has no doubt"" that Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor had ""not a shred of evidence"" to back his claim that there was ""malicious"" moves to damage him BBC Scotland News Thank you for joining our coverage of Alex Salmond's
six-hour evidence session. Here are the main points:  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The last six hours have been detailed. Alex Salmondâs
complaints are numerous. But stand back from it for a second. The former first minister of Scotland has just accused his
successor of breaking the ministerial code â and left open the door for her
having to resign as a result. He has said Scotlandâs most senior civil servant should quit
â and that its most senior lawyer should consider his position. Nicola Sturgeonâs allies will argue he has not provided
evidence for his claims of a plot against him. But Ms Sturgeon will face huge questions when she appears
before MSPs next week â some of the most difficult she has faced in her career. In
response to the question about whether Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans would resign, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""No."" ""Scottish Government civil servants have acted professionally throughout on
behalf of ministers and in line with the Civil Service Code and values of
integrity, honesty, impartiality and objectivity. ""The permanent secretary
has already addressed the issues raised today at Committee on several
occasions. ""As the first minister has set out, she retains confidence in
the permanent secretary and expects her to see out the remainder of her
contract."" The spokesman said the government had a duty to investigate the ""serious and specific"" complaints against Mr Salmond. ""As set out in
detailed evidence to the committee, all government decisions were informed by
legal advice and taken in line with the Civil Service Code,"" he added. The Crown Office has responded to the allegations made by Alex Salmond in his evidence, saying it takes its responsibility to uphold the law seriously and protects the dignity and rights of all. It added: âScotlandâs prosecutors have acted independently and in the public interest at all times when considering matters related to this case. âThe Lord Advocate will appear before the committee next week to assist in public understanding of his role, and the actions of the Crown Office in relation to this case.â Philip SimBBC Scotland political reporter As the session ended, Mr Salmond
suggested to the committee that it could use its powers to seek to recover
documents from his lawyers. He
said the group had previously served orders on âpeople unwilling to give you
informationâ â but that his solicitors would be âextremely willingâ to assist. The committee has requested that the
Crown Office produce messages which Mr Salmond cited as potential proof of
collusion against him by midday on Tuesday â the day before Nicola Sturgeon
gives evidence. The group had previously used Scotland Act powers to compel the release of
other text messages â but concluded that they were not relevant to the
inquiryâs remit. Mr Salmond concludes by suggesting that the committee should serve an order under the Scotland Act on his solicitors ""who are extremely willing to give you information"". He says members may also want to request ""the letters from the Crown Office preventing me from furnishing you with that information hitherto"" under the same powers. He says that if the committee serves that order on his solicitors they will have the documentation on Monday morning, in time for sessions with the Lord Advocate and crown agent. Jackie Baillie Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says that Mr Salmond has been very careful not call for Nicola Sturgeon to resign. ""Does that mean you have forgiven her for her handling of this?"" she asks. Mr Salmond says ""no"" - it means the people who he has called on to consider their positions are the ones where he has ""documentary evidence"" of their actions. ""I don't think it is for me to judge what happens to someone who may have broken the ministerial code,"" he says. Committee convener Linda Fabiani asks Mr Salmond when the ""malicious plan"" that he has described against him started. Mr Salmond repeats that he thinks some people hoped the police investigation would come to the rescue of the judicial review. ""That almost happened,"" he says. ""It was only with the great work of my legal team that we were able to argue that should not happen."" James Hamilton QC, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions, is leading an investigation into whether Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. Independent MSP Andy Wightman asks Mr Salmond if he has ""full confidence in the independent advisers on the ministerial code"" and ""can we rely on Mr Hamilton's findings?"" Mr Salmond says he has ""every reason to believe he (Mr Hamilton) is a man of great integrity and experience"". He says he created the panel and thinks it is unsatisfactory its remit should be confined in any way. ""I've got every confidence that Mr Hamilton will discharge his duties in a proper way and I think it is fundamentally a good system,"" he says. Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell on a visit to Wimbledon Alex Salmond has made a series of allegations in
his evidence:  The first minister, Mr Murrell, Ms Evans and Lord Wolffe have all rejected the allegations and deny wrongdoing. Murdo Fraser asks Mr Salmond who should resign. Mr Salmond says the people responsible for the judicial review should resign. He says permanent secretary Leslie Evans should have resigned on 8 January 2019 when the judicial review was conceded, and he knew Scottish government ministers who felt the same. ""I can't think of many people who would not have thought that an appropriate thing to do,"" he says. ""I think the Lord Advocate should be considering his position for this and a range of other issues,"" Mr Salmond adds. He says the Scottish government administration and the Crown Office needs new leadership. Mr Fraser asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if she is shown to have broken the ministerial code. Mr Salmond says he is in no doubt that she has broken the code, but it is not for him to say what the consequences should be. He says it is not the case that every minister that breaks the code resigns. ""Your own party have an example of that relatively recently,"" he tells the Tory MSP, referring to the case of the UK government's Home Secretary Priti Patel. Mr Salmond said in his submission that ""the evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and
concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and
the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned"". Tory MSP Murdo Fraser asks why these people would conspire against him. Mr Salmond says the original intention was to defeat the judicial review by having it postponed. He says: ""It came to be believed among some people that the loss of the court case would be cataclysmic not just for Leslie Evans and senior officials in the Scottish government, but for Nicola Sturgeon herself. ""I think people came to the belief that the police process would somehow assist in firstly not losing the review, and thereafter making sure that the loss of the judicial review was swept away in the inevitable publicity of the criminal trial. ""If I had been convicted of any offence in the criminal trial, that would be the case.""  The evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned. Alex Salmond, Former first minister Mr Salmond tells Murdo Fraser that both explanations around the 29 March meeting breach the ministerial code. He says either Ms Sturgeon did not really forget about it and parliament was deliberately misled, or alternatively it was forgotten about and parliament was not informed when she was reminded of it. These are clear breaches of the ministerial code, he says. A separate inquiry, led by James Hamilton, is to decide on whether the ministerial code was broken. Murdo Fraser Tory MSP Murdo Fraser says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Mr Salmond's claims are untrue and he has no evidence. ""In effect she is denouncing you as a liar and a fantasist. Are you?"" asks Mr Fraser. Mr Salmond points to the evidence of his claims, citing the meeting with his special advisor on 29 March 2018 which Ms Sturgeon had ""forgotten"" happened. He says there is no doubt that this meeting was pre-arranged for the express purpose of Ms Sturgeon being briefed about the complaints against him. The meeting on 2 April arose from that, he says. ""Otherwise, how on earth would I have known to turn up on the 2 April?"" Mr Salmond says that for a substantial period of time the meeting of 29 March was written out of history. ""People say what difference does four days make?"" he asks. ""The difference is, of course, if the meeting of 29 March is admitted and, indeed, the subject matter is admitted, then it makes it very hard to argue that the meeting of 2 April was on party business as opposed to government business."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Thereâs a lot of important detail to wade through in this
inquiry and it would be easy to get bogged down. But essentially Alex Salmond thinks senior figures in
Scotlandâs public administration should be held to account for mishandling
harassment complaints against him. Perhaps foremost among them is Scotlandâs top civil servant,
Leslie Evans. Asked by Labour MSP Jackie Baillie if he thought she had
discharged her responsibilities in line with the ministerial code, he gave a
one word answer: âNoâ. Heâs also taken aim at the Scottish governmentâs chief legal
adviser, Lord Advocate James Wolffe. And we know that he thinks his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, has repeatedly broken the code of conduct of ministers. His evidence on the ministerial code is the final section of
todayâs epic evidence session which has already gone into extra time. Mr Cole-Hamilton says the first minister's written evidence says she agreed to meet Mr Salmond for two reasons. The Lib Dem MSP says the first was Mr Salmond's ""profound distress"" around what he was going to say at the meeting, and the second was that she thought he was going to resign her party membership. Mr Salmond says he had no purpose in resigning from the SNP at that time and insists ""I had no thought of resignation whatsoever. ""Resignation from the SNP never entered my head."" Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole Hamilton Mr Cole-Hamilton asks Mr Salmond to summarise the discussion he had with the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says
they had discussed the situation and what he had been sent, which had some
detail. He said there was no suggestion that Ms Sturgeon was ""surprised and astounded"" by the reason for the meeting. ""The meeting was for that purpose,"" he said. He says they went through options, including a mediation policy - which had been absent from the harassment policy. Mr Salmond says the indication the first minister gave him was that she was willing to go ahead with that. Mr Cole-Hamilton asks if the name of one of the complainants was intimated to him and the three other people involved in that discussion. Mr Salmond said he thought it was - but that the name had previously been given to him by Geoff Aberdein, who had got it from a senior government official. Nicola Sturgeon met Mr Salmond at her home in April 2018 Alex Cole-Hamilton focuses on a meeting between Geoff Aberdein and Nicola Sturgeon on 29 March 2018 and the subsequent meeting between Alex Salmond and the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says the purpose of Mr Aberdein meeting with Ms Sturgeon on 29 March was to brief the first minister on what was happening. ""I know that Nicola Sturgeon knew about the complaints process at the meeting on the 29th of March because I was told so by Geoff Aberdein,"" he said. He adds that meeting was ""not impromptu, was not accidental, was not her popping her head around the door - it was a meeting arranged for that purpose"". Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon met at the first ministerâs Glasgow home on 2 April. Mr Salmond says he had heard Mr Murrell say that he was regularly ""popping in"". The former first minister points out that he stays 200 miles away from Glasgow and says he has only visited Ms Sturgeon's home about six times in his life. ""I didn't pop in,"" he says. Tory MSP Margaret Mitchell refers to a text sent by SNP chief executive Peter Murrell that talks of âpressurisingâ the police. Another says ""the more fronts he is having to firefight on the better for all complainers"". Mr Murrell, who is the husband of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has said the messages were out of character and expressed how upset he was at the time. Mr Salmond says that in January last year, on the day he first appeared at court for a preliminary hearing in the criminal case, he was presented with a memory stick. The next day when he went through the messages it contained ""was one of the most extraordinary days of my life"", Mr Salmond says. He says he is not allowed to describe them in any detail, but they speak to behaviour he would not have expected from people he had known for 30 years. ""In my opinion, there has been behaviour which is about not just pressurising the police but pressurising witnesses, collusion with witnesses, we are talking about the construction of evidence because the police were somehow felt inadequate in finding it themselves,"" he says. Mr Salmond says that when a police investigation starts these matters are for the police. It is not for the SNP or the Scottish government to supplant the police in an investigative function, he says. Jackie Baillie asked if the ministerial code had been breached Jackie Baillie says there was a meeting on 13 November 2018 between counsel, the first minister, the permanent secretary and the chief of staff. ""As a former first minister, would carrying on legal action in the Court of Session knowing that you had acted unlawfully be a breach of the ministerial code?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" replies Mr Salmond. Ms Baillie asks: ""Do you believe that this was the case in this instance?"" He replies: ""Well we cannot be sure because I like you haven't seen the external legal advice of October 2018."" If the legal advice said the government was about to lose and the first minister carried on with the case then that would be a breach of the ministerial code, he says. Mr Salmond says people would be better informed if they could see the document. Ms Baillie says the parliament has asked twice, adding: ""Good luck with that one."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Duke of Sussex has said he had to step back from royal duties to protect himself and his family from the ""toxic"" situation created by the UK press. Prince Harry told TV chat show host James Corden it was ""destroying my mental health"" and he ""did what any husband [or] father would do"". Buckingham Palace confirmed last week thatthe prince and his wife Meghan would not resume royal duties. The duke insisted they were ""stepping back rather than stepping down"". The couple, who are expecting their second child, moved to California with their one-year-old son Archie afterannouncing their plan to step back as senior working royals last January. They said at the time that they wanted to work to become financially independent. Last week, Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess would not return to royal duties, following a planned review of the arrangements. As a result, they will have to return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages. What we learned from Prince Harry's interview Harry and Meghan not returning to Royal Family 'Overjoyed' Harry and Meghan expecting second child Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win In a segment for Corden's US TV programme The Late Late Show, the duke joined the British presenter on a double-decker bus tour of Los Angeles. Asked by Corden about the couple's decision to walk away from royal duties, Prince Harry insisted it ""was never walking away, it was stepping back rather than stepping down"". ""It was a really difficult environment as a lot of people saw. We all know what the British press can be like. And it was destroying my mental health. I was like, this is toxic."" He said he ""did what any husband [or] father would do"", and moved his family away, but insisted: ""I will never walk away, I will always be contributing. My life is public service."" Asked by Corden how he sees his future after lockdown restrictions are lifted, the duke said: ""My life is always going to be about public service and Meghan signed up to that."" The interview was recorded before it was confirmed Harry and Meghan would not resume royal duties. By Sarah Campbell, BBC News royal correspondent Much has been said and written about Harry and Meghan over the past year, but this is Harry in his own words - the first interview since the family moved to California. There's enough fluff to delight their fans - like details about Archie's first word and his love of waffles. Meghan makes an appearance via FaceTime and Harry gets muddy on an assault course. The tone is informal - two mates chatting on a bus (James Corden was at their wedding) but he does ask the question people want answered, about why they are no longer working royals. Harry is perhaps a little defensive in his response, saying it ""was never walking away"", and although this was recorded before the official ""decree absolute"" from Buckingham Palace last week, the sentiment about continued public service is the same. Commentators will point to the name check for Netflix (the couple have signed a multi-million dollar deal with the streaming service). Then there's the fact that in-between revealing personal family details he argues the reason they left the UK was because of press intrusion. Next weekend, it will be Meghan who takes centre stage with Oprah. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have both taken legal action against media outlets in the past. The duchess recently won aHigh Court privacy battle against the Mail on Sundayover the publication of extracts from a letter to her father. When his wife first began her legal action against the Mail on Sunday, the duke described the ""painful"" impact of the ""ruthless"" press campaign against her. ""I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,"" he said in a statement at the time. Referring to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, Harry said his ""deepest fear is history repeating itself"". Earlier this month, Harry alsosuccessfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he ""turned his back"" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal. Archie was born on 6 May, 2019 In a wide-ranging interview, the duke also defended Netflix drama The Crown, amidcriticism from some quarters about its portrayal of the Royal Family's history. ""Of course it's not strictly accurate, but, loosely, it gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle, what the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that,"" he said. ""I am way more comfortable with The Crown than I am seeing the stories written about my family, or my wife or myself."" Harry and Meghan married at Windsor Castle in May 2018 Last September, it emerged the duke and duchess had agreed a deal withNetflix to make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in. Harry also revealed that Archie's first word was ""crocodile"" and the Queen sent him a waffle maker for Christmas. He added that the monarch, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99,who is currently being treated in hospital for an infection, have used Zoom to video call the family, and have seen Archie ""running around"". 7 things we learned from Prince Harry interview Prince Philip to stay in hospital with infection Harry and Meghan not returning to Royal Family 'Overjoyed' Harry and Meghan expecting second child Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Twitter has announced plans for a new ""super follow"" feature which will enable account holders to charge for exclusive additional content. This could take the form of extra tweets, joining a community group or receiving a newsletter, the firm said. Twitter unveiled its plans at a virtual event held for investors. It's the first time in a while that the platform has announced significant changes to the way in which people can use it. It also said it was testing a live audio discussion service - which has proved popular on a new rival, the audio-only social network Clubhouse. ""Why don't we start with why folks don't believe in us,"" said Twitter founder Jack Dorsey. ""It comes down to three critiques: we're slow, we're not innovative, and we're not trusted."" Twitter, which was launched in 2006 and recorded its first annual profit in 2018, said it hoped to double its revenue in 2023. ""Twitter is unquestionably looking for ways to drive new revenue streams with this new service,"" said analyst Ben Wood from CCS Insight. ""For those with compelling enough content this service could be attractive but I expect it will be hard to deliver big paydays for the average Twitter user."" The news has received a mixed reaction among Twitter users. Social media consultant Matt Navarra asked his followers whether they would be prepared to pay a premium for their favourite accounts - and 85% responded that they would not. A spokesman for Twitter said Super Follow was due to be launched this year.

"For 10 years Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon showed how to be a successful political duo. They campaigned hard, won elections and brought to the fore a shared dream of Scottish independence. That irresistible combo is gone, having given way to personal silences and a public war of words. As MSPs continue investigating the Scottish government's mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond, we look at their story. As the clock ticked past midday, I waited in the first minister's walnut panelled office for Nicola Sturgeon to give her first interview on the scandal. It was Friday 24 August 2018 - the day theDaily Record splashed on allegations of sexual misconduct,externalmade against her predecessor, Alex Salmond. The first minister was said to be so upset that her advisers worried she might cry on camera. When it came to it, Nicola Sturgeon kept her composure but there was clear emotion in the interview that followed. Her voice wavered slightly when she told me how ""incredibly difficult"" the situation was. At about the time she was speaking to me, Alex Salmond was telling journalists gathered around a Linlithgow pub table that while he was ""no saint"" he had not harassed anyone. In a pub in Linlithgow, the town where he was born, Alex Salmond told a gathered media he was ""no saint"" but he was not guilty of anything criminal The Scottish government had investigated complaints about him from two civil servants, under a new procedure signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. That was not news to the first minister because Alex Salmond had told her privately about the investigation several months before. What then could have brought Scotland's leader close to tears? This was, of course, a watershed moment when a private burden finally had to be shouldered in public. And, according to one source close to Nicola Sturgeon what was also significant was confirmation from the civil service that it had sufficient confidence in its investigation to refer the complaints to the police. That is said to have shattered the first minister's confidence in the denials Alex Salmond had given her. Having controversially met or spoken to him five times during the investigation - in which she insists she played no part - she broke off contact with him in July. Nicola Sturgeon's long standing alliance with her predecessor was in the process of breaking down and the day of the Daily Record scoop was probably when it became irretrievable. Alex Salmond was effectively at war with the government he once led and therefore with the woman who replaced him - his protÃ©gÃ©, Nicola Sturgeon. There was a lot to cry about. The Salmond/Sturgeon association spans three decades - she had backed him for the party leadership in 1990 and he encouraged her to stand for Westminster two years later, when she was just 21. ""He believed in me long before I believed in myself,"" she once said. Alex Salmond was a mentor, ally and friend. You could trace his influence in her early speaking style and in the way she sometimes scoffed at rivals during debate. 1999 - A fresh-faced SNP line-up in a new Scottish Parliament. The team of opposition MSPs, featuring the 29-year-old Nicola Sturgeon, was led by Alex Salmond 2011 - Alex Salmond was still leader of his party, but now he was running a majority SNP-government with Nicola Sturgeon at his side He appointed her to the SNP front bench when they were both elected to Holyrood in 1999. However, a little over a year into the new parliament Alex Salmond gave up the leadership, passing the reins to John Swinney. When he resigned in 2004 Nicola Sturgeon made her move for the top party job. The then 34-year-old entered the contest, but when it looked like she would lose to rival Roseanna Cunningham Alex Salmond came to the rescue. His decision to make a leadership comeback saved her from defeat. Instead, she became a winner, running as his deputy on what they styled as a joint ticket. This was the beginning of the powerful political partnership that has dominated Scottish politics and made a big impact on the UK political scene in the early part of this century. They led the SNP into government for the first time in 2007, to an overall majority at Holyrood in 2011 and within touching distance of independence in 2014. What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? A brief history of Alex Salmond Profile: Nicola Sturgeon They worked well together. Not least because Alex Salmond tended to let Nicola Sturgeon and other trusted ministers do their jobs without interference. As his deputy, her skills and personality seemed to complement his. Where he revelled in the spotlight, she was more naturally reserved. While he enjoyed painting the big picture, she was content to fill in the detail. They offered each other advice and challenge in private, and presented a united front in public - a discipline upon which the SNP's success was built. That's not to say there were no disagreements. When the NHS faced a budget squeeze after the financial crash, Nicola Sturgeon took a stand. According to one Alex Salmond ally, she ""pushed very hard"" to protect cash spending and won the first minister's support. Had she failed, another source said, she was prepared to resign. Nicola Sturgeon's confidence grew further during the independence campaign. From 2012, she took charge of referendum preparations as the Scottish government's so called ""Yes"" minister. It was during this period that she started coming into her own, establishing an approach that was distinct from his. Contrast, for example, the responses they gave to protests by independence supporters against the BBC. Alex Salmond defended those involved, arguing they must be allowed to express a view. Nicola Sturgeon advised that they spend their time campaigning for a ""Yes"" vote rather than against the BBC. Where he could be strident, she was more pragmatic is how one source close to Alex Salmond put it. 2013 - A year before the independence referendum, Alex Salmond made his party conference leader speech. Nicola Sturgeon was still performing her supporting role While their relationship remained strong throughout the referendum there were points of tension. Nicola Sturgeon was frustrated not to be involved in Alex Salmond's preparation for his first debate with the pro-Union leader Alistair Darling. The head-to-head, hosted by STV, saw Alex Salmond struggle with currency questions. When he set off for China in November 2013 without leaving detailed comments on the latest draft of the independence White Paper, her team questioned his commitment. The first minister's feedback would eventually filter through from the People's Republic. None of this caused a serious rift between them - that would come later, once Alex Salmond had left office. On 18 September 2014the independence vote was lost by 55% to 45%and within two months of that date Alex Salmond was gone as party leader and first minister. As Nicola Sturgeon prepared to take over, she acknowledged Alex Salmond had left ""big boots to fill"". However, she also asserted her political independence. ""I will wear my own shoes"" she said ""and they will have higher heels"". 2014 - Alex Salmond applauds new SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon moments after she had addressed party members. She was now in charge and centre stage She promised a more female friendly-leadership that would give priority to key issues of gender equality and seek to advance the interests of women. That's a pledge that may have weighed heavily as she thought of her response to the #MeToo movement a few years later. The key point about this transfer of power is that it fundamentally changed this political couple's relationship. She was no longer the understudy, she was now the principal performer. The new first minister travelled the country, addressing large audiences in what became known as her ""rock star tour"" and under her leadershipthe SNP won spectacularly at the 2015 Westminster election. By contrast, Alex Salmond's political power was on the wane. He could have pursued a career in business, academia or on the lecture circuit but he could not resist the pull of politics. As part of the 2015 landslide, he returned to Westminster, as MP for Gordon, in search of a new role. The party appointed him international affairs spokesman with a certain licence to stir things up. Friends said it was difficult for him to adjust. According to one MP, he did not take kindly to no longer driving the bus. When Alex Salmond publicly suggested a referendum might not be the only route to independence, the new driver asserted her authority. Nicola Sturgeon made clear that winning a referendum was now the established way to leave the UK. Within a few months of replacing him, Nicola Sturgeon dropped Alex Salmond's policy of a blanket 3p cut to corporation tax in the event of independence. He was not consulted. He was, however, brought into the loop for some decisions, such as the ill-fated call for indyref2 in early 2017. They were still in touch but nothing like as much as when they were partners in power. With one at Westminster and the other at Holyrood, they saw each other less and were gradually drifting apart. 2021 - There have been five first ministers since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. Their portraits hang alongside each other in Bute House - the official residence for those who do Scotland's top job The relationship deteriorated more seriously after the 2017 general election which sawAlex Salmond defeated for the first time in 30 years of parliamentary service. When Nicola Sturgeon phoned to offer her commiserations, she found Alex Salmond unavailable. It was, apparently, two or three weeks before they spoke. Alex Salmond was dealing with the death of his father around that time as well as the loss of his parliamentary seat. But there was something else. A friend of his said he was ""not very impressed"" with the SNP's election campaign, considering it insubstantial and lacking in energy and purpose. The party lost 21 of its 56 seats in this first election after the Brexit referendum and the Scottish Conservatives won 13 - enough to sustain Theresa May in office with help from the DUP. If that was one source of tension in Alex Salmond's relationship with his successor, others soon emerged as he began a new career outside politics. Appearing in his own show at the Edinburgh Fringe, Alex Salmond was accused of sexism when he explained the absence of any high profile female guests with the double entendre that he ""couldn't make them come"". Nicola Sturgeon said he was ""not sexist"" just as she had done two years earlier whenAlex Salmond told Conservative minister, Anna Soubry in the Commons to ""behave yourself woman"". The first minister's defence of her predecessor was more qualified this time. She said he was not always as funny as he thought and that perhaps his joke belonged in the era of Benny Hill. It was apparent to some in the SNP that she was wearying of him. As one MP put it, he was ""seen as a nuisance"" by the leadership during 2017. The lowest point came in November of that year, when it was announced thatAlex Salmond was to host his own show on the Kremlin-backed TV station, RT. Nicola Sturgeon has since spoken of her ""incredulity"" at this decision. It would increase the distance between them. As one Nicola Sturgeon ally put it - ""the first minister cannot take advice from a presenter on Russian state TV"". The week before Alex Salmond's TV show was announced, SNP MSP Mark McDonald was forced to resign as a Holyrood minister over inappropriate behaviour. The Scottish government's wider response to the #MeToo movement, following this departure, would set these political titans on a collision course. There was speculation that if Mr McDonald stood down, Alex Salmond might want to fight the Aberdeen Donside by-election. 2017 - Alex Salmond was on the campaign trail with Joanna Cherry who won a Westminster seat that summer. But he did not win back his According to friends of Alex Salmond that was wrong - he had no interest in making another Holyrood comeback and Nicola Sturgeon's team did not take it seriously either. Even if they found him annoying, they did not appear to regard him as a political threat. They would not however have been unaware that Alex Salmond had helped nurture new talent at Westminster, including the QC turned MP, Joanna Cherry, whom some see as a future leader. What appeared to be of concern to team Sturgeon in November 2017 was an enquiry from Sky News about allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Alex Salmond at Edinburgh Airport. He denied wrongdoing and nothing was broadcast at the time, but according to a later account from Nicola Sturgeon, it raised suspicions about her predecessor's conduct. On the first minister's instruction, the Scottish government was revising its procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying and harassment against ministers, following Mr McDonald's resignation. Nicola Sturgeon specifically told the civil service that the new policy could apply to former ministers and she put that in writing after the Sky News enquiry. This note was sent after her private secretary met a potential complainer against Alex Salmond from within the civil service. The Scottish government insists the first minister did not know about that. Supporters of Alex Salmond suspected the new policy was designed with him in mind, however, the Scottish government rejects that claim. What is clear is that Nicola Sturgeon chose an approach that would not exempt her predecessor. Had she decided otherwise, there might never have been a scandal. Alternatively, one might have blown up in the media anyway and she might have faced criticism for protecting an old friend. Complaints of sexual harassment against Alex Salmond from two female civil servants were lodged and a seven month investigation by the Scottish government followed. Those findings were shelved when the 66-year-oldsuccessfully challenged the complaints handling process in court. It decided the investigation was ""tainted by apparent bias"" and he was awarded more than Â£500,000 in legal costs. But the former first minister faced a much bigger legal battle ahead. In January 2019, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was arrested and charged with a string of sexual offences against women he had worked with at the Scottish government or the SNP, during his term as first minister. When he looked at the names on the charge sheet - according to a Salmond ally - ""that was when it hit him"" that this could be a conspiracy. One of those who testified against him in court has since told the BBC that it is ""utterly absurd"" to suggest nine women would perjure themselves as part of a political plot. Their evidence did not persuade a jury to convict and on 23 March last year - hours before the UK went into coronavirus lockdown - he was acquitted of the 13 sexual assault charges he faced. This video can not be played Alex Salmond is cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault Alex Salmond is now trying to expose what he believes was a conspiracy, accusing Nicola Sturgeon of multiple rule breaches including misleading the Scottish Parliament. She denies his claims. Their toxic feud has destroyed their relationship and caused deep divisions within the SNP. It also threatens damage to the first minister's reputation and to the independence dream she still shares with Alex Salmond. While she seems confident of weathering the storm, her credibility has hardly been enhanced by the revisions she's made to her story along the way. For example, having told Holyrood she learned about the investigation into Alex Salmond directly from him, she now acknowledges that ""allegations of a sexual nature"" were mentioned at a meeting she had days earlier and claims to have forgotten. Exactly what did she know and when, what meetings were held and why, where does party business end and government business begin? These are the questions being picked over by a committee of MSPs at Holyrood. The inescapable point is that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon cannot both be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as they are obliged to do under oath before the committee. What started three years ago with complaints about the former first minister's behaviour has led to intense scrutiny of Nicola Sturgeon's conduct in handling those complaints. If Alex Salmond can prove his allegations, a clamour for her resignation will follow - ironically at a time when her party and its goal of independence are polling strongly. If his claims are not proven, he is unlikely to give up the fight. Some of his supporters have called for him to be readmitted to the SNP. Others hope that he will stand in this May's Holyrood election for one of the newly formed independence parties. While those who know him well think that unlikely, they note he has not publicly ruled it out. As one MP put it ""you just never know what Alex is going to do next"".

"Alex Salmond explained to a committee of MSPs why he believed there was an attempt - by a number of people he named - to remove him from public life In his evidence - which lasted six hours - the former first minister fired shots at the Scottish government, including saying its harassment policy was ""badly thought out and badly implemented"" He was also critical of the ""censorship"" of one of his submissions to the Holyrood committee investigating the mishandling of complaints against him A row erupted after part of his written evidence was initially published but later redacted when the Crown Office raised concerns with the Scottish Parliament Mr Salmond believed that other parliaments, including the one at Westminster, would not have agreed to such a request by a prosecution service He accused the civil service, the Crown Office and the Scottish government of ""many and obvious"" failures in leadership, adding that there should be resignations Mr Salmond also told MSPs that the name of a woman who had made complaints about him had been shared at a meeting involving his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein The politician of three decades said he hoped the inquiry would yield lessons leading to a greater confidence in Scotland's institutions Mr Salmond went on to say that he ""has no doubt"" that Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor had ""not a shred of evidence"" to back his claim that there was ""malicious"" moves to damage him BBC Scotland News Thank you for joining our coverage of Alex Salmond's
six-hour evidence session. Here are the main points:  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The last six hours have been detailed. Alex Salmondâs
complaints are numerous. But stand back from it for a second. The former first minister of Scotland has just accused his
successor of breaking the ministerial code â and left open the door for her
having to resign as a result. He has said Scotlandâs most senior civil servant should quit
â and that its most senior lawyer should consider his position. Nicola Sturgeonâs allies will argue he has not provided
evidence for his claims of a plot against him. But Ms Sturgeon will face huge questions when she appears
before MSPs next week â some of the most difficult she has faced in her career. In
response to the question about whether Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans would resign, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""No."" ""Scottish Government civil servants have acted professionally throughout on
behalf of ministers and in line with the Civil Service Code and values of
integrity, honesty, impartiality and objectivity. ""The permanent secretary
has already addressed the issues raised today at Committee on several
occasions. ""As the first minister has set out, she retains confidence in
the permanent secretary and expects her to see out the remainder of her
contract."" The spokesman said the government had a duty to investigate the ""serious and specific"" complaints against Mr Salmond. ""As set out in
detailed evidence to the committee, all government decisions were informed by
legal advice and taken in line with the Civil Service Code,"" he added. The Crown Office has responded to the allegations made by Alex Salmond in his evidence, saying it takes its responsibility to uphold the law seriously and protects the dignity and rights of all. It added: âScotlandâs prosecutors have acted independently and in the public interest at all times when considering matters related to this case. âThe Lord Advocate will appear before the committee next week to assist in public understanding of his role, and the actions of the Crown Office in relation to this case.â Philip SimBBC Scotland political reporter As the session ended, Mr Salmond
suggested to the committee that it could use its powers to seek to recover
documents from his lawyers. He
said the group had previously served orders on âpeople unwilling to give you
informationâ â but that his solicitors would be âextremely willingâ to assist. The committee has requested that the
Crown Office produce messages which Mr Salmond cited as potential proof of
collusion against him by midday on Tuesday â the day before Nicola Sturgeon
gives evidence. The group had previously used Scotland Act powers to compel the release of
other text messages â but concluded that they were not relevant to the
inquiryâs remit. Mr Salmond concludes by suggesting that the committee should serve an order under the Scotland Act on his solicitors ""who are extremely willing to give you information"". He says members may also want to request ""the letters from the Crown Office preventing me from furnishing you with that information hitherto"" under the same powers. He says that if the committee serves that order on his solicitors they will have the documentation on Monday morning, in time for sessions with the Lord Advocate and crown agent. Jackie Baillie Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says that Mr Salmond has been very careful not call for Nicola Sturgeon to resign. ""Does that mean you have forgiven her for her handling of this?"" she asks. Mr Salmond says ""no"" - it means the people who he has called on to consider their positions are the ones where he has ""documentary evidence"" of their actions. ""I don't think it is for me to judge what happens to someone who may have broken the ministerial code,"" he says. Committee convener Linda Fabiani asks Mr Salmond when the ""malicious plan"" that he has described against him started. Mr Salmond repeats that he thinks some people hoped the police investigation would come to the rescue of the judicial review. ""That almost happened,"" he says. ""It was only with the great work of my legal team that we were able to argue that should not happen."" James Hamilton QC, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions, is leading an investigation into whether Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. Independent MSP Andy Wightman asks Mr Salmond if he has ""full confidence in the independent advisers on the ministerial code"" and ""can we rely on Mr Hamilton's findings?"" Mr Salmond says he has ""every reason to believe he (Mr Hamilton) is a man of great integrity and experience"". He says he created the panel and thinks it is unsatisfactory its remit should be confined in any way. ""I've got every confidence that Mr Hamilton will discharge his duties in a proper way and I think it is fundamentally a good system,"" he says. Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell on a visit to Wimbledon Alex Salmond has made a series of allegations in
his evidence:  The first minister, Mr Murrell, Ms Evans and Lord Wolffe have all rejected the allegations and deny wrongdoing. Murdo Fraser asks Mr Salmond who should resign. Mr Salmond says the people responsible for the judicial review should resign. He says permanent secretary Leslie Evans should have resigned on 8 January 2019 when the judicial review was conceded, and he knew Scottish government ministers who felt the same. ""I can't think of many people who would not have thought that an appropriate thing to do,"" he says. ""I think the Lord Advocate should be considering his position for this and a range of other issues,"" Mr Salmond adds. He says the Scottish government administration and the Crown Office needs new leadership. Mr Fraser asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if she is shown to have broken the ministerial code. Mr Salmond says he is in no doubt that she has broken the code, but it is not for him to say what the consequences should be. He says it is not the case that every minister that breaks the code resigns. ""Your own party have an example of that relatively recently,"" he tells the Tory MSP, referring to the case of the UK government's Home Secretary Priti Patel. Mr Salmond said in his submission that ""the evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and
concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and
the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned"". Tory MSP Murdo Fraser asks why these people would conspire against him. Mr Salmond says the original intention was to defeat the judicial review by having it postponed. He says: ""It came to be believed among some people that the loss of the court case would be cataclysmic not just for Leslie Evans and senior officials in the Scottish government, but for Nicola Sturgeon herself. ""I think people came to the belief that the police process would somehow assist in firstly not losing the review, and thereafter making sure that the loss of the judicial review was swept away in the inevitable publicity of the criminal trial. ""If I had been convicted of any offence in the criminal trial, that would be the case.""  The evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned. Alex Salmond, Former first minister Mr Salmond tells Murdo Fraser that both explanations around the 29 March meeting breach the ministerial code. He says either Ms Sturgeon did not really forget about it and parliament was deliberately misled, or alternatively it was forgotten about and parliament was not informed when she was reminded of it. These are clear breaches of the ministerial code, he says. A separate inquiry, led by James Hamilton, is to decide on whether the ministerial code was broken. Murdo Fraser Tory MSP Murdo Fraser says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Mr Salmond's claims are untrue and he has no evidence. ""In effect she is denouncing you as a liar and a fantasist. Are you?"" asks Mr Fraser. Mr Salmond points to the evidence of his claims, citing the meeting with his special advisor on 29 March 2018 which Ms Sturgeon had ""forgotten"" happened. He says there is no doubt that this meeting was pre-arranged for the express purpose of Ms Sturgeon being briefed about the complaints against him. The meeting on 2 April arose from that, he says. ""Otherwise, how on earth would I have known to turn up on the 2 April?"" Mr Salmond says that for a substantial period of time the meeting of 29 March was written out of history. ""People say what difference does four days make?"" he asks. ""The difference is, of course, if the meeting of 29 March is admitted and, indeed, the subject matter is admitted, then it makes it very hard to argue that the meeting of 2 April was on party business as opposed to government business."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Thereâs a lot of important detail to wade through in this
inquiry and it would be easy to get bogged down. But essentially Alex Salmond thinks senior figures in
Scotlandâs public administration should be held to account for mishandling
harassment complaints against him. Perhaps foremost among them is Scotlandâs top civil servant,
Leslie Evans. Asked by Labour MSP Jackie Baillie if he thought she had
discharged her responsibilities in line with the ministerial code, he gave a
one word answer: âNoâ. Heâs also taken aim at the Scottish governmentâs chief legal
adviser, Lord Advocate James Wolffe. And we know that he thinks his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, has repeatedly broken the code of conduct of ministers. His evidence on the ministerial code is the final section of
todayâs epic evidence session which has already gone into extra time. Mr Cole-Hamilton says the first minister's written evidence says she agreed to meet Mr Salmond for two reasons. The Lib Dem MSP says the first was Mr Salmond's ""profound distress"" around what he was going to say at the meeting, and the second was that she thought he was going to resign her party membership. Mr Salmond says he had no purpose in resigning from the SNP at that time and insists ""I had no thought of resignation whatsoever. ""Resignation from the SNP never entered my head."" Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole Hamilton Mr Cole-Hamilton asks Mr Salmond to summarise the discussion he had with the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says
they had discussed the situation and what he had been sent, which had some
detail. He said there was no suggestion that Ms Sturgeon was ""surprised and astounded"" by the reason for the meeting. ""The meeting was for that purpose,"" he said. He says they went through options, including a mediation policy - which had been absent from the harassment policy. Mr Salmond says the indication the first minister gave him was that she was willing to go ahead with that. Mr Cole-Hamilton asks if the name of one of the complainants was intimated to him and the three other people involved in that discussion. Mr Salmond said he thought it was - but that the name had previously been given to him by Geoff Aberdein, who had got it from a senior government official. Nicola Sturgeon met Mr Salmond at her home in April 2018 Alex Cole-Hamilton focuses on a meeting between Geoff Aberdein and Nicola Sturgeon on 29 March 2018 and the subsequent meeting between Alex Salmond and the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says the purpose of Mr Aberdein meeting with Ms Sturgeon on 29 March was to brief the first minister on what was happening. ""I know that Nicola Sturgeon knew about the complaints process at the meeting on the 29th of March because I was told so by Geoff Aberdein,"" he said. He adds that meeting was ""not impromptu, was not accidental, was not her popping her head around the door - it was a meeting arranged for that purpose"". Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon met at the first ministerâs Glasgow home on 2 April. Mr Salmond says he had heard Mr Murrell say that he was regularly ""popping in"". The former first minister points out that he stays 200 miles away from Glasgow and says he has only visited Ms Sturgeon's home about six times in his life. ""I didn't pop in,"" he says. Tory MSP Margaret Mitchell refers to a text sent by SNP chief executive Peter Murrell that talks of âpressurisingâ the police. Another says ""the more fronts he is having to firefight on the better for all complainers"". Mr Murrell, who is the husband of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has said the messages were out of character and expressed how upset he was at the time. Mr Salmond says that in January last year, on the day he first appeared at court for a preliminary hearing in the criminal case, he was presented with a memory stick. The next day when he went through the messages it contained ""was one of the most extraordinary days of my life"", Mr Salmond says. He says he is not allowed to describe them in any detail, but they speak to behaviour he would not have expected from people he had known for 30 years. ""In my opinion, there has been behaviour which is about not just pressurising the police but pressurising witnesses, collusion with witnesses, we are talking about the construction of evidence because the police were somehow felt inadequate in finding it themselves,"" he says. Mr Salmond says that when a police investigation starts these matters are for the police. It is not for the SNP or the Scottish government to supplant the police in an investigative function, he says. Jackie Baillie asked if the ministerial code had been breached Jackie Baillie says there was a meeting on 13 November 2018 between counsel, the first minister, the permanent secretary and the chief of staff. ""As a former first minister, would carrying on legal action in the Court of Session knowing that you had acted unlawfully be a breach of the ministerial code?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" replies Mr Salmond. Ms Baillie asks: ""Do you believe that this was the case in this instance?"" He replies: ""Well we cannot be sure because I like you haven't seen the external legal advice of October 2018."" If the legal advice said the government was about to lose and the first minister carried on with the case then that would be a breach of the ministerial code, he says. Mr Salmond says people would be better informed if they could see the document. Ms Baillie says the parliament has asked twice, adding: ""Good luck with that one."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Steph Norman and Aaron Willoughby have been told they must have their wedding ceremony in English first A couple feel ""discriminated against"" after being told they cannot have their wedding ceremony entirely in Cornish. Steph Norman and Aaron Willoughby were told by Cornwall Council their ceremony must be in English and Cornish. The council said ""declaratory and contracting words"" can only be said in English or Welsh for a legally binding marriage. Ms Norman said ""I feel if everyone understands the language, it should be up to them what language they speak"". The couple contacted the council as part of their search for a registrar who speaks Cornish, when they were told their plans for the ceremony were not legal. Ms Norman, 32, from St Anne near St Day, then researched theMarriage Act 1949,externaland found an exception only applied to Welsh speakers. Cornwall Council told the couple their ceremony was not legally allowed to be entirely in Cornish She said: ""If you fluently speak Welsh then that's perfectly legal, but not Cornish. ""It feels like we've been a bit discriminated against, because it's not equal across the board."" The couple have learned a ""good fair bit"" of the language as it was ""really important to our culture and our heritage,"" Ms Norman said. ""We just really wanted an authentic Cornish wedding and part of that would be incorporating the language. ""So we can a little bit, but not fully,"" she added. Cornwall Council confirmed the ""declaratory and contracting words"" of a marriage ceremony must be conducted in English or Welsh to be legally binding. It said: ""We try to tailor each ceremony to the couple's wishes and Cornish phrases are often included in our ceremonies. ""Currently we don't have a fluent Cornish speaking registrar but we can accommodate a Cornish translator if one is provided by the couple."" Cornwall Council estimated in 2015about 300 to 400 peoplespoke the language fluently and used it regularly, with about 5,000 more having some conversational ability. Cornish language teacher Jenefer Lowe said she was ""hopeful"" that a couple like Steph and Aaron would be able to take their vows in Cornish in the future. ""What we really need for that to happen is for Cornish to get official status like Welsh and Gaelic,"" she said. ""That needs a critical mass of people using the language for it to be accepted. ""But because it's not official we don't have the ability to do legal proceedings at the moment."" She has seen an increasing interest in the language in Cornwall and from around the world and there had been ""huge advances"" in the last 20 years, especially with uptake from young people. Teaching online in the pandemic had also increased the number of learners, she said. ""I have students in Australia, America and around the world, but we now need to translate that into more speakers and more resources.

"Amanda Staveley claimed damages over an emergency fundraising by Barclays in 2008. A businesswoman who sued Barclays for hundreds of millions of pounds has lost her High Court fight, despite the judge saying the bank acted with ""deceit"". Amanda Staveley claimed her finance firm, PCP Capital, was owed money for work during the financial crisis. Barclays raised billions of pounds during the crisis from Middle East backers, helping it avoid a UK government bailout. The court also heard about complaints about the behaviour of bank bosses. Barclays welcomed the decision, but Ms Staveley, 47, said immediately after the ruling that she was considering an appeal. She said: ""In spite of Barclays' efforts to question my character and credentials, the court has recognised my abilities as a businesswoman and the truth of my account of events. ""The judgment confirms what I have said from the outset and repeated in my evidence; a senior executive at Barclays repeatedly lied to me when seeking private investment in the bank during the 2008 financial crisis. ""The evidence at trial was clear and unequivocal; PCP was an investor in the transaction and played an integral role in the capital raising, which ultimately prevented the bank from being nationalised."" Ex-Barclays banker's sexist remarks disclosed Ex-Barclays bankers call female boss a 'dolly bird' She added that she would be ""taking advice on appealing the judge's decision not to award damages."" The financier had claimed Barclays concealed the terms of its complex fundraising, rather than disclose them to the financial markets as was required. However, Mr Justice Waksman, who heard evidence at a trial in London during the summer of 2020, criticised Barclays, saying he ""found Barclays to be guilty of serious deceit towards it [PCP]"". He praised Ms Staveley's character, describing her as ""the driving force of PCP"" and as a ""tough, clever and creative entrepreneur"" but said her claim ""as a whole must fail"". Ex-Barclays bosses came under fire for sexist comments. The judge said: ""Barclays contends that, in general, Ms Staveley was thoroughly unreliable, her evidence was inconsistent with documents, she had a flawed recollection and she was guilty of 'obvious embellishment and invention'. ""I do not accept that as a general characterisation so that she was essentially an untruthful or unreliable witness."" He added: ""I thought that, for the most part, her evidence was reliable."" PCP's lawyers had told the judge that an initial damages claim was for a sum between Â£1.6bn and Â£400m. But that was scaled back over the course of the trial to amounts between around Â£830m and around Â£600m. Ms Staveley has made headlines after becoming involved with two Premier League football clubs. In 2008, she acted for then Manchester City owner Thaksin Shinawatra when he sold the club, and last year was involved in trying to broker a deal which could have seen a Saudi consortium take control of Newcastle United. She told Mr Justice Waksman how she mainly invested in sports brands and companies in the hospitality sector. Ms Staveley, who was born near Ripon, North Yorkshire, outlined her career during the trial of her dispute with Barclays. After setting up a number of businesses in the Cambridge area, with varying degrees of success, she later moved to Abu Dhabi and was offered a job at an investment fund. She told the trial in the summer she had provided a variety of services to high-profile investments and political figures across the Middle East, including the president of Libya, Colonel Gaddafi. The trial contained some colourful details. It emerged that Ms Staveley was described as a ""dolly bird"" and a ""tart"" by two then Barclays' bosses during the 2008 financial crisis. Richard Boath referred to Ms Staveley as ""that dolly bird"" during an evening telephone call with Roger Jenkins in October 2008. Mr Jenkins referred to her as ""the tart"", the trial heard. Another then-Barclays' boss speculated about whether she was ""sleeping with"" Manchester City football club owner Sheikh Mansour, the judge was told. Stephen Jones made the comment in a telephone call with another then-bank boss in October 2008, saying: ""Whether she's sleeping with him or not I couldn't tell you..."" He had also, in a separate 2008 phone call with the same colleague, referred to Ms Staveley as being as ""thick"" and having ""large breasts"", the trial heard. As the comments were about to come to light in the trial last summer, Mr Jones resigned from his role as chief executive of UK Finance. He apologised to both Ms Staveley and his colleagues for the remarks.

"Britney Spears at a film premiere in Los Angeles in July 2019 People who believe Britney Spears' father should not be overseeing her controversial conservatorship ""have it so wrong"", according to his lawyer. In an interview with ABC News,external, Vivian Thoreen called Jamie Spears ""a fiercely loving, dedicated and loyal father"" who had stopped her from being exploited. Jamie Spears was made his daughter's conservator in 2008 after concerns were raised about the star's mental health. A recent documentary has led to renewed scrutiny of her legal arrangements. ""I understand that every story needs a villain but people have it so wrong here,"" Ms Thoreen told ABC's Good Morning America on Thursday. She said unnamed people had been ""harming and exploiting"" the singer and that Mr Spears had ""rescued"" her from ""a life-threatening situation"". Britney Spears: What is conservatorship? Why the media is saying sorry to Britney Spears ""Britney's assets were clearly being mismanaged and she was being taken advantage of financially by some of those around her,"" the lawyer continued. She added that Mr Spears had ""collaborated"" with his daughter, now 39, so that she could ""live her life the way she wants, like a normal person"". A conservatorship is usually granted for people who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Last November the singerlost a legal attemptto remove her father's control over her estate, currently worth around $60m (Â£43m), but in February this year a judgedenied a requestby Mr Spears to exert greater control over her finances. According to Ms Spears' lawyer, Britney and her father have no ""viable working relationship"" and have not spoken in a ""long while"". Ms Thoreen stated otherwise, claiming they had spent time together last year and she had never voiced a wish to have him removed from the conservatorship. Vivian Thoreen said Spears had ""never asked"" her father to step aside ""Early on in the pandemic they spent two weeks with other family members, hunkered down in Louisiana, and they spent a lot of time together,"" she told ABC News. ""In that time, Britney never expressed those words to her father. She's never asked him to step aside."" She said ABC News would have to ""ask Britney"" why her lawyer had stated otherwise. Spears' life and career has returned to the headlines due to the documentary Framing Britney Spears, which explores the celebrity and media culture at the time of her meteoric rise. According to her lawyer Samuel D Ingham, the singer will not perform as long as her father oversees her affairs. The singer has said she is ""taking the time to learn and be a normal person"" and was ""simply enjoying the basics of everyday life"". ""No matter what we think we know about a person's life it is nothing compared to the actual person living behind the lens,""she wrote on Instagram,external. In a subsequent post,external, she said it was ""so much fun"" spending time with boyfriend Sam Asghari, ""especially when you don't have to do anything at all"". The accompanying video showed Asghari, who has been dating Spears since 2016, giving her a piggy-back ride while out on a hike. Earlier this week former child star Mara Wilsonexpressed solidarity with the singer, saying she was a victim of a culture that ""builds girls up just to destroy them"".

"Exports to Ireland are being blocked by extra paperwork and costs at customs, say CBI Wales Welsh exports to Ireland are being blocked by extra paperwork and costs at customs, says CBI Wales. Director Ian Price said the authorities in the Republic of Ireland were ""zealous"" when checking goods which was ""causing some delays."" He said documents had been rejected for being written in blue not black ink. Ireland's consul general in Wales insisted the Irish Government was ""focused"" on facilitating trade between the two countries. Mr Price called for ""consistency of approach"" when exporting to the EU. The republic is Wales' fourth biggest export market, behind Germany, France and the US and the fifth largest market for the UK. Brexit: Call to cut Welsh ports in a bid to boost trade Brexit: Stena Line 'committed to Wales' despite traffic drop Irish hauliers 'bypassing Welsh ports', say bosses Trade worth Â£20bn goes back and forth across the Irish Sea every week. But since 1 January, there has been a drop in UK-Ireland traffic at Holyhead and Pembroke Dock. CBI Wales' director Ian Price said documents had been rejected for being written in blue rather than black ink Mr Price said it's difficult to tell whether this was down to companies ""biding their time"" because they foresaw problems or if it is ""a genuine change in the way people are moving their goods."" ""There's no denying costs of freight have increased quite largely and it's hard to judge at the moment, whether this is a temporary glitch, or whether this is something that is with us for good,"" he explained. ""Quite clearly there's a lot more administration involved now we're moving goods from ourselves into mainland Europe and as a consequence, it requires more people, requires more time or documentation and that in itself creates a cost."" This was ""a burden"" being absorbed by UK businesses, he said. Ireland's consul general in Wales, Denise Hanrahan said the Brexit changes were a ""steep learning curve"" Ireland's consul general in Wales, Denise Hanrahan said: ""Ireland and Wales are so closely tied, our shared Irish sea border is one of the vital links between us. ""The UK has left the EU customs union, has left the single market, and that inevitably requires then systems to be put in place to manage the customs, the health aspects, the animal safety aspects. ""All of those normal aspects of trading."" Ms Hanrahan said it was a ""steep learning curve."" The Irish Government was supporting businesses ""to learn as much as possible as to how they can best interact with those systems."" Josh Burbidge, managing director of 150-year-old family firm Archwood Group, says the Irish market is ""significant"". It is worth more than Â£600,000 in annual revenue to the business, based in Chirk, Wrexham, he said. Archwood's Josh Burbidge said his firm won't be able to absorb extra costs in the long term ""We made the conscious decision to stop exporting anything to Ireland for two weeks at the start of January to help with the paperwork, and ensure that we had everything sorted in terms of all of the regulation,"" he explained. Deliveries have recently been delayed by six weeks and while currently absorbing extra costs, the firm cannot do so forever. ""Every pallet we send in as an extra Â£65, and every consignment or individual parcel is Â£6.50,"" he said. ""We're not in a high margin business. Therefore, we won't be able to continue absorbing those costs on the longer term."" Wrexham Lager sales manager Joss Roberts, said Brexit complications were having a ""major impact"", despite the majority of business comes from the UK. ""Prices are becoming unrealistic,"" said Mr Roberts. ""We've had to cancel three Irish orders this morning because the end receiver is expected to pay â¬11.50 per crate, that's on top of an admin courier fee. ""It's gone up around Â£17 alone to the Republic of Ireland where as to the likes of Spain it's gone up over â¬60 a crate."" Wrexham Lager will ""have to work out a way"" said sales manager Joss Roberts He has written to customers to warn them of the extra fees. The business will ""have to work out a way.""

"Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton and NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall have been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic People aged over 40 will be next in line to get Covid vaccinations after the current priority groups have been treated UK vaccine advisors say there is little evidence to justify prioritising occupations such as teachers or the police The Welsh Government had already promised to give a higher priority to unpaid carers and people with learning disabilities A Covid outbreak at a north Wales hospital is a lesson that people cannot let their guard down, a doctor says James McCarthy and Andy Roberts That's all from our coverage of the Welsh Government coronavirus press briefing for Friday - thanks for joining us. Here are the main points:  Have a good weekend and stay safe.  Local Democracy Reporting Service Repair work on Blackweir Bridge is due to finish next Friday, says Cardiff University A bridge in Cardiff closed last year for Covid safety reasons is set to finally reopen as repair work is due to finish next Friday. Blackweir Bridge, over the River Taff in Bute Park, is a key route for walkers, runners and cyclists, but has been shut for almost a year. Cardiff Council closed the bridge last April due to people not socially distancing. However it then emerged that the bridge had serious structural and fire damage which needed attention. Cardiff University, which owns the bridge, says repair work is due to finish next Friday, 5 March. The council has said the bridge will reopen once all the repairs are done, adding that the ""scientific understanding"" of Covid-19 which prompted the closure had changed. When the bridge reopens, people using it will be asked to help prevent the spread of coronavirus by keeping to the left, crossing in single file, and not stopping. A petition urging the UK government not to introduce vaccine passports could be debated by MPs after gaining more than 200,000 signatures. Theonline petition said the passports could be ""used to restrict the rights of peoplewho have refused a Covid-19 vaccine"". On Tuesday, Boris Johnson announced a review of possible vaccine certificates or passports. Proof of vaccination could allow people to travel or attend large events. Vaccination is not mandatory, and the petition said passports ""would be unacceptable"". A scientist advising the UK government says there is little point in primary school children wearing face masks. Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Professor Calum Semple, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said: ""Primary school children are the lowest risk both to themselves and to society.â He said there was ""really good data"" that showed children are half to a third as likely to acquire the virus. ""When it comes to transmitting they are probably half as likely to transmit it as adults,"" Prof Semple said, adding: ""That risk actually gets smaller as you go into younger age groups. The positive impact of vaccinating people in care homes in the early stages of the rollout in Wales will become âmuch more visibleâ in March, the head of NHS Wales said. Asked whether he was concerned by recent outbreaks of Covid-19 at care homes in Conwy, Dr Andrew Goodall said there was already evidence the vaccination programme was starting to produce results. âEven in January, the efficacy, the effectiveness of any vaccines that had been administered may not have worked their way through"", said Dr Goodall. âIn overall terms in care homes at the moment, on the testing that weâre doing, the positivity rate is down to around 1%. ""Itâs actually reduced by about a half since last week. âI think that is demonstrating that there is actually a lower prevalence that weâre now starting to see in care homes, but inevitably it takes time for all of those individuals to be worked through. âAs we go into March, we would be expecting to see a much more visible impact of the vaccination programme in care homesâ. Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth says teachers should be prioritised for vaccination against coronavirus. He agreed with theage-based approach for the vaccination programmebut argued for some flexibility on professions such as teaching. âSurely there must be some other way of prioritising those groups that are more likely to come into contact with the virus?â he asked. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall warned that there were still coronavirus pressures on the NHS and that ""numbers in hospital beds are still higher than in the peak in the first wave back in April"". ""What we don't want to see is an emergence [of the virus] which would lead to a third wave in Wales of significance,"" he said. Dr Goodall said some of the modelling demonstrated that ""if we don't take a gradual approach"" to easing restrictions there was ""absolutely the chance"" that ""we could see the new variants in particular"" creating difficulties. A widening of the criteria for a Covid-19 test ""does make sense"" due to the variety of symptoms caused by the Kent variant, according to Wales' chief medical officer. Dr Frank Atherton said that the new Kent variant symptom clusters ""do appear to be a bit different to the virus that we originally saw here in Wales"". Swansea Bay University Health Board has already confirmed that people with a wider range of symptoms can now access a Covid test there. Dr Atherton said that widening of the testing criteria is ""something that we're thinking about, not just in Swansea Bay but in other areas as well"". The three official symptoms are currently noted as a high temperature, a new, continuous cough, and a loss or change to sense of smell or taste. Swansea Bay Health Board says it will also test people reporting complaining of excessive tiredness, a persistent headache and runny nose. Dr Atherton said as case rates go down it ""gives us more ability to to cast the net wider and to find residual cases"". ""So widening the testing criteria - not changing the case definition, but widening the current testing criteria - can make sense, and can be helpful in bringing rates down even lower."" Figures to show how much of an impact the vaccine is having on hospitalisations in Wales âwill probablyâ come in the ânext two to four weeksâ, health officials have said. Speaking during Friday's coronavirus briefing, NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall said at the moment the trend in the reduction of cases is âprobably quite similar to recent weeksâ. But he added that âwe continue to see dropsâ and that there had been âabout a 7% difference in the number of patients in hospitalâ. Dr Goodall went on to say that âwhat had been really pleasingâ was to see a reduction of critical care patients in critical care beds. Some Covid vaccine supplies are arriving in Wales earlier than expected, meaning medical chiefs are confident of meeting the new vaccine targets, it was revealed today. With all over-50s due to be offered the first vaccine dose by mid-April, and all adults by the end of July, ministers have stressed that continued supply - which is managed by the UK government - will be crucial. But Wales' Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said there was no reason to assume there would be any problems with sufficient stocks. âItâs not entirely within our own hands here in Wales; procurement and supply is through the UK government and we receive our share here in Wales,"" he said. âBut weâve had nothing in the pipeline that suggests weâre going to experience any shortfall, and in fact some of the supplies that we were expecting later in the year are coming through earlier than that, which allows us to accelerate. âObviously this is a complex area and one that we have to keep constantly under review with colleagues.â Dr Andrew Goodall, chief executive of the Welsh NHS, added that he âdid have confidenceâ that supply would meet demand in the coming weeks. Dr Frank Atherton says ""it's too early to tell"" if the current ""stay at home"" restrictions in Wales could be eased in a few weeks' time. The chief medical officer for Wales said: ""I think it's just too early to tell really. ""We're just at the start of this three week cycle and the first minister has been very clear, in that he wants to see how things pan out, over the next two or three weeks before he makes a decision and I think that's the right thing to do. ""My advice to him has been to open up cautiously so it's entirely in line with the advice we've been giving."" The regulations are next due to be reviewed in two weeks' time, on Friday 12 March. Wales' chief medical officer said all four UK nations were following the same approach to lifting the lockdown restrictions, although ""some of the timings are slightly different"". Dr Frank Atherton described any differences as ""marginal"". ""The general notes that all chief medical officers have sounded is one of caution,"" he said. ""That, as we release [restrictions], we should release cautiously [and] slowly. ""We should measure the impact of that to make sure that things are remaining on track."" Prioritising people from certain occupations for Covid-19 vaccines would have âslowed down the whole processâ, according to Walesâ chief medical officer. Dr Frank Atherton said the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) had considered giving those in some professions vaccinations sooner, before deciding to continue with an age-based approach. âCertainly we asked JCVI to look carefully at the occupational issue - that was really important that they did that,â Dr Atherton said. âThe JCVI came to the conclusion that if we were to make a decision to go down an occupational line it would be a much more complex process. ""It would slow down the whole process."" Dr Atherton also said the age demographics of people in professions such as teaching and the police, which were among those being advocated for vaccine priority, was also a factor in the decision. âTaking an age-based process covers most of those professionsâ, he said. âForty-five per cent of front-line police staff are aged over 40, 60 per cent in education and childcare are aged over 40, so that was the easiest way and the safest way to get to those populations, really. âSo in the interests of everybodyâs health - of speed, efficiency, safety and effectiveness - it was deemed that itâs the right thing to go down an age criteria, and we fully endorse that here in Wales."" Wales' chief medical officer says
there isn't enough evidence to support prioritising people from specific
occupations in the next phase of the vaccine roll-out. Dr Frank Atherton said: ""I, along with the
UKâs other three chief medical officers support the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) advice, and the four UK
Governments have agreed to implement it. ""This means the
UKâs vaccine programmes remains aligned as we all work towards one shared
goal. ""This is the
simplest, quickest and fairest approach. And it means we can remain on track to
meet our ambitious vaccination targets. ""The JCVI has also
noted the importance of other factors â specifically ethnicity and
socio-economic status â and these factors will be addressed in the vaccine
deployment and in communications."" Dr Atherton acknowledged there had been ""many calls for people from specific occupations to be prioritised  for the next
phase of the vaccine roll-out"". ""The JCVI did
consider this,"" he said. ""However, it found there wasnât sufficient evidence to set
specific occupations apart from the general population. ""It also advised that
the complexity of delivering this approach would slow down the pace of the
vaccination rollout"". Wales' chief medical
officer says more than a million vaccinations will have been given in Wales by tomorrow. Dr Frank Atherton told the Welsh Government press briefing:
""By tomorrow, our remarkable vaccination teams will have administered over
one million vaccines â a truly phenomenal performance and a success story that
is bringing everyone hope and a path out of this crisis."" He said: ""We are
working hard to reach everyone in groups 1-9 by mid-April and all adults by the
end of July, subject to vaccine supply matching our ambition."" The head of NHS Wales says
that despite the improving Covid situation there are still 250 more patients in
hospital beds than at the peak of the first wave experienced in April last
year. Dr Andrew Goodall said he was still
concerned about the impact of this âsustained pressure on critical care
facilities and hard-working staffâ. âToday, there are 60 Covid-related patients in critical care beds, which is a quarter lower than
last week and two-thirds lower than at its peak,"" he said. âHowever, despite
falling numbers, our staff are supporting the equivalent of 110% occupancy in
critical care. ""It is really
positive to see recent improvements in the trends that show our collective
response against coronavirus is working, and we hope and expect that this good
progress will continue. ""However, I need to
emphasise that our overall numbers in hospital remain high. ""This is serious
and affects the ability of the NHS to undertake other activities. ""It would not
take much to see these numbers go up very quickly if the virus once again
spread through our communities."" NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew
Goodall said the number of people admitted daily to hospital with coronavirus
symptoms has been reducing over the last month. âThere are now on
average around 70 coronavirus hospital admissions a day, down from a peak of
around 130 a day in January,â he said. âThere are almost 1,650
covid-related patients in Welsh hospitals - this is 7% lower than the same
point last week and around 1,200 less than the peak in Januaryâ. âThis is the lowest
number since 19 Novemberâ, he added. The head of the NHS in Wales says the health service is still facing a âchallenging timeâ during the pandemic but things were improving. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs coronavirus briefing, Dr Andrew Goodall said the NHS had been under âintense and sustained pressureâ over the last few months. However, Dr Goodall said things were âslowly improvingâ. âOur community prevalence rate is now down to around 75 cases per 100,000 people and gradually reducing,â he said. âLower levels of coronavirus in our communities is starting to translate into lower demand and fewer people being admitted to our hospitalsâ. He said the main reason for the recent improvement was âthe action the people of Wales have taken to stay at homeâ. Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton and NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall are about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic.

Vaccinating people in order of age is the fastest way to cut Covid-19 deaths in the next phase of the rollout, say experts advising the UK government. People in their 40s will be next, once the current phase is completed. Priority based on jobs would be ""more complex"" and could slow down the programme, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said. All four nations of the UK will follow this approach with a target of vaccinating all adults by end of July. More than 18 million people in the UK have received a first dose so far. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Alex Salmond explained to a committee of MSPs why he believed there was an attempt - by a number of people he named - to remove him from public life In his evidence - which lasted six hours - the former first minister fired shots at the Scottish government, including saying its harassment policy was ""badly thought out and badly implemented"" He was also critical of the ""censorship"" of one of his submissions to the Holyrood committee investigating the mishandling of complaints against him A row erupted after part of his written evidence was initially published but later redacted when the Crown Office raised concerns with the Scottish Parliament Mr Salmond believed that other parliaments, including the one at Westminster, would not have agreed to such a request by a prosecution service He accused the civil service, the Crown Office and the Scottish government of ""many and obvious"" failures in leadership, adding that there should be resignations Mr Salmond also told MSPs that the name of a woman who had made complaints about him had been shared at a meeting involving his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein The politician of three decades said he hoped the inquiry would yield lessons leading to a greater confidence in Scotland's institutions Mr Salmond went on to say that he ""has no doubt"" that Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor had ""not a shred of evidence"" to back his claim that there was ""malicious"" moves to damage him BBC Scotland News Thank you for joining our coverage of Alex Salmond's
six-hour evidence session. Here are the main points:  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The last six hours have been detailed. Alex Salmondâs
complaints are numerous. But stand back from it for a second. The former first minister of Scotland has just accused his
successor of breaking the ministerial code â and left open the door for her
having to resign as a result. He has said Scotlandâs most senior civil servant should quit
â and that its most senior lawyer should consider his position. Nicola Sturgeonâs allies will argue he has not provided
evidence for his claims of a plot against him. But Ms Sturgeon will face huge questions when she appears
before MSPs next week â some of the most difficult she has faced in her career. In
response to the question about whether Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans would resign, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""No."" ""Scottish Government civil servants have acted professionally throughout on
behalf of ministers and in line with the Civil Service Code and values of
integrity, honesty, impartiality and objectivity. ""The permanent secretary
has already addressed the issues raised today at Committee on several
occasions. ""As the first minister has set out, she retains confidence in
the permanent secretary and expects her to see out the remainder of her
contract."" The spokesman said the government had a duty to investigate the ""serious and specific"" complaints against Mr Salmond. ""As set out in
detailed evidence to the committee, all government decisions were informed by
legal advice and taken in line with the Civil Service Code,"" he added. The Crown Office has responded to the allegations made by Alex Salmond in his evidence, saying it takes its responsibility to uphold the law seriously and protects the dignity and rights of all. It added: âScotlandâs prosecutors have acted independently and in the public interest at all times when considering matters related to this case. âThe Lord Advocate will appear before the committee next week to assist in public understanding of his role, and the actions of the Crown Office in relation to this case.â Philip SimBBC Scotland political reporter As the session ended, Mr Salmond
suggested to the committee that it could use its powers to seek to recover
documents from his lawyers. He
said the group had previously served orders on âpeople unwilling to give you
informationâ â but that his solicitors would be âextremely willingâ to assist. The committee has requested that the
Crown Office produce messages which Mr Salmond cited as potential proof of
collusion against him by midday on Tuesday â the day before Nicola Sturgeon
gives evidence. The group had previously used Scotland Act powers to compel the release of
other text messages â but concluded that they were not relevant to the
inquiryâs remit. Mr Salmond concludes by suggesting that the committee should serve an order under the Scotland Act on his solicitors ""who are extremely willing to give you information"". He says members may also want to request ""the letters from the Crown Office preventing me from furnishing you with that information hitherto"" under the same powers. He says that if the committee serves that order on his solicitors they will have the documentation on Monday morning, in time for sessions with the Lord Advocate and crown agent. Jackie Baillie Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says that Mr Salmond has been very careful not call for Nicola Sturgeon to resign. ""Does that mean you have forgiven her for her handling of this?"" she asks. Mr Salmond says ""no"" - it means the people who he has called on to consider their positions are the ones where he has ""documentary evidence"" of their actions. ""I don't think it is for me to judge what happens to someone who may have broken the ministerial code,"" he says. Committee convener Linda Fabiani asks Mr Salmond when the ""malicious plan"" that he has described against him started. Mr Salmond repeats that he thinks some people hoped the police investigation would come to the rescue of the judicial review. ""That almost happened,"" he says. ""It was only with the great work of my legal team that we were able to argue that should not happen."" James Hamilton QC, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions, is leading an investigation into whether Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. Independent MSP Andy Wightman asks Mr Salmond if he has ""full confidence in the independent advisers on the ministerial code"" and ""can we rely on Mr Hamilton's findings?"" Mr Salmond says he has ""every reason to believe he (Mr Hamilton) is a man of great integrity and experience"". He says he created the panel and thinks it is unsatisfactory its remit should be confined in any way. ""I've got every confidence that Mr Hamilton will discharge his duties in a proper way and I think it is fundamentally a good system,"" he says. Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell on a visit to Wimbledon Alex Salmond has made a series of allegations in
his evidence:  The first minister, Mr Murrell, Ms Evans and Lord Wolffe have all rejected the allegations and deny wrongdoing. Murdo Fraser asks Mr Salmond who should resign. Mr Salmond says the people responsible for the judicial review should resign. He says permanent secretary Leslie Evans should have resigned on 8 January 2019 when the judicial review was conceded, and he knew Scottish government ministers who felt the same. ""I can't think of many people who would not have thought that an appropriate thing to do,"" he says. ""I think the Lord Advocate should be considering his position for this and a range of other issues,"" Mr Salmond adds. He says the Scottish government administration and the Crown Office needs new leadership. Mr Fraser asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if she is shown to have broken the ministerial code. Mr Salmond says he is in no doubt that she has broken the code, but it is not for him to say what the consequences should be. He says it is not the case that every minister that breaks the code resigns. ""Your own party have an example of that relatively recently,"" he tells the Tory MSP, referring to the case of the UK government's Home Secretary Priti Patel. Mr Salmond said in his submission that ""the evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and
concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and
the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned"". Tory MSP Murdo Fraser asks why these people would conspire against him. Mr Salmond says the original intention was to defeat the judicial review by having it postponed. He says: ""It came to be believed among some people that the loss of the court case would be cataclysmic not just for Leslie Evans and senior officials in the Scottish government, but for Nicola Sturgeon herself. ""I think people came to the belief that the police process would somehow assist in firstly not losing the review, and thereafter making sure that the loss of the judicial review was swept away in the inevitable publicity of the criminal trial. ""If I had been convicted of any offence in the criminal trial, that would be the case.""  The evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned. Alex Salmond, Former first minister Mr Salmond tells Murdo Fraser that both explanations around the 29 March meeting breach the ministerial code. He says either Ms Sturgeon did not really forget about it and parliament was deliberately misled, or alternatively it was forgotten about and parliament was not informed when she was reminded of it. These are clear breaches of the ministerial code, he says. A separate inquiry, led by James Hamilton, is to decide on whether the ministerial code was broken. Murdo Fraser Tory MSP Murdo Fraser says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Mr Salmond's claims are untrue and he has no evidence. ""In effect she is denouncing you as a liar and a fantasist. Are you?"" asks Mr Fraser. Mr Salmond points to the evidence of his claims, citing the meeting with his special advisor on 29 March 2018 which Ms Sturgeon had ""forgotten"" happened. He says there is no doubt that this meeting was pre-arranged for the express purpose of Ms Sturgeon being briefed about the complaints against him. The meeting on 2 April arose from that, he says. ""Otherwise, how on earth would I have known to turn up on the 2 April?"" Mr Salmond says that for a substantial period of time the meeting of 29 March was written out of history. ""People say what difference does four days make?"" he asks. ""The difference is, of course, if the meeting of 29 March is admitted and, indeed, the subject matter is admitted, then it makes it very hard to argue that the meeting of 2 April was on party business as opposed to government business."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Thereâs a lot of important detail to wade through in this
inquiry and it would be easy to get bogged down. But essentially Alex Salmond thinks senior figures in
Scotlandâs public administration should be held to account for mishandling
harassment complaints against him. Perhaps foremost among them is Scotlandâs top civil servant,
Leslie Evans. Asked by Labour MSP Jackie Baillie if he thought she had
discharged her responsibilities in line with the ministerial code, he gave a
one word answer: âNoâ. Heâs also taken aim at the Scottish governmentâs chief legal
adviser, Lord Advocate James Wolffe. And we know that he thinks his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, has repeatedly broken the code of conduct of ministers. His evidence on the ministerial code is the final section of
todayâs epic evidence session which has already gone into extra time. Mr Cole-Hamilton says the first minister's written evidence says she agreed to meet Mr Salmond for two reasons. The Lib Dem MSP says the first was Mr Salmond's ""profound distress"" around what he was going to say at the meeting, and the second was that she thought he was going to resign her party membership. Mr Salmond says he had no purpose in resigning from the SNP at that time and insists ""I had no thought of resignation whatsoever. ""Resignation from the SNP never entered my head."" Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole Hamilton Mr Cole-Hamilton asks Mr Salmond to summarise the discussion he had with the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says
they had discussed the situation and what he had been sent, which had some
detail. He said there was no suggestion that Ms Sturgeon was ""surprised and astounded"" by the reason for the meeting. ""The meeting was for that purpose,"" he said. He says they went through options, including a mediation policy - which had been absent from the harassment policy. Mr Salmond says the indication the first minister gave him was that she was willing to go ahead with that. Mr Cole-Hamilton asks if the name of one of the complainants was intimated to him and the three other people involved in that discussion. Mr Salmond said he thought it was - but that the name had previously been given to him by Geoff Aberdein, who had got it from a senior government official. Nicola Sturgeon met Mr Salmond at her home in April 2018 Alex Cole-Hamilton focuses on a meeting between Geoff Aberdein and Nicola Sturgeon on 29 March 2018 and the subsequent meeting between Alex Salmond and the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says the purpose of Mr Aberdein meeting with Ms Sturgeon on 29 March was to brief the first minister on what was happening. ""I know that Nicola Sturgeon knew about the complaints process at the meeting on the 29th of March because I was told so by Geoff Aberdein,"" he said. He adds that meeting was ""not impromptu, was not accidental, was not her popping her head around the door - it was a meeting arranged for that purpose"". Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon met at the first ministerâs Glasgow home on 2 April. Mr Salmond says he had heard Mr Murrell say that he was regularly ""popping in"". The former first minister points out that he stays 200 miles away from Glasgow and says he has only visited Ms Sturgeon's home about six times in his life. ""I didn't pop in,"" he says. Tory MSP Margaret Mitchell refers to a text sent by SNP chief executive Peter Murrell that talks of âpressurisingâ the police. Another says ""the more fronts he is having to firefight on the better for all complainers"". Mr Murrell, who is the husband of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has said the messages were out of character and expressed how upset he was at the time. Mr Salmond says that in January last year, on the day he first appeared at court for a preliminary hearing in the criminal case, he was presented with a memory stick. The next day when he went through the messages it contained ""was one of the most extraordinary days of my life"", Mr Salmond says. He says he is not allowed to describe them in any detail, but they speak to behaviour he would not have expected from people he had known for 30 years. ""In my opinion, there has been behaviour which is about not just pressurising the police but pressurising witnesses, collusion with witnesses, we are talking about the construction of evidence because the police were somehow felt inadequate in finding it themselves,"" he says. Mr Salmond says that when a police investigation starts these matters are for the police. It is not for the SNP or the Scottish government to supplant the police in an investigative function, he says. Jackie Baillie asked if the ministerial code had been breached Jackie Baillie says there was a meeting on 13 November 2018 between counsel, the first minister, the permanent secretary and the chief of staff. ""As a former first minister, would carrying on legal action in the Court of Session knowing that you had acted unlawfully be a breach of the ministerial code?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" replies Mr Salmond. Ms Baillie asks: ""Do you believe that this was the case in this instance?"" He replies: ""Well we cannot be sure because I like you haven't seen the external legal advice of October 2018."" If the legal advice said the government was about to lose and the first minister carried on with the case then that would be a breach of the ministerial code, he says. Mr Salmond says people would be better informed if they could see the document. Ms Baillie says the parliament has asked twice, adding: ""Good luck with that one."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played WATCH: On patrol with an indigenous leader trying to protect the Amazon from land grabbers Parts of Brazil's Amazon rainforest are being illegally sold on Facebook, the BBC has discovered. The protected areas include national forests and land reserved for indigenous peoples. Some of the plots listed via Facebook's classified ads service are as large as 1,000 football pitches. Facebook said it was ""ready to work with local authorities"", but indicated it would not take independent action of its own to halt the trade. ""Our commerce policies require buyers and sellers to comply with laws and regulations,"" the Californian tech firm added. The Amazon has been described as being the lungs of the Earth - and it is being destroyed The leader of one of the indigenous communities affected has urged the tech firm to do more. And campaigners have claimed the country's government is unwilling to halt the sales. ""The land invaders feel very empowered to the point that they are not ashamed of going on Facebook to make illegal land deals,"" said Ivaneide Bandeira, head of environmental NGO KanindÃ©. Anyone can find the illegally invaded plots by typing the Portuguese equivalents for search terms like ""forest"", ""native jungle"" and ""timber"" into Facebook Marketplace's search tool, and picking one of the Amazonian states as the location. Some of the listings feature satellite images and GPS co-ordinates. Cattle are often put to graze on land that is meant to be protected Many of the sellers openly admit they do not have a land title, the only document which proves ownership of land under Brazilian law. The illegal activity is being fuelled by Brazil's cattle ranching industry. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is at a 10-year high, and Facebook's Marketplace has become a go-to site for sellers like Fabricio GuimarÃ£es, who was filmed by a hidden camera. ""There's no risk of an inspection by state agents here,"" he said as he walked through a patch of rainforest he had burnt to the ground. Fabricio is using Facebook Marketplace to sell land he has grabbed from indigenous communities With the land illegally cleared and ready for farming, he had tripled his initial asking price to $35,000 (Â£25,000). Fabricio is not a farmer. He has steady middle-class job in a city, and views the rainforest as being an investment opportunity. The BBC later contacted Fabricio for his response to its investigation but he declined to comment. Many of the ads came from RondÃ´nia, the most deforested state in Brazil's rainforest region. The BBC arranged meetings between four sellers from the state and an undercover operative posing as a lawyer claiming to represent wealthy investors. One man, called Alvim Souza Alves, was trying to sell a plot inside the Uru Eu Wau Wau indigenous reserve for about Â£16,400 in local currency. It is the home to a community of more than 200 Uru Eu Wau Wau people. And at least five further groups that have had no contact with the outside world also live there, according to the Brazilian government. But at the meeting, Mr Alves claimed: ""There are no Indians [sic] there. From where my land is, they are 50km [31 miles] away. I am not going to tell you that at one time or another they are not walking around."" The Uru Eu Wau Wau people are trying to protect their land from invaders The BBC showed the Facebook ad to community leader BitatÃ© Uru Eu Wau Wau. He said the lot was in an area used by his community to hunt, fish and collect fruits. ""This is a lack of respect,"" he said. ""I don't know these people. I think their objective is to deforest the indigenous land, to deforest what is standing. To deforest our lives, you could say."" He said the authorities should intervene, and also urged Facebook - ""the most accessed social media platform"" - to take action of its own. Another factor driving the illegal land market is the expectation of amnesty. Mr Alves revealed he was working with others to lobby politicians to help them legally own stolen land. ""I'll tell you the truth: if this is not solved with [President] Bolsonaro there, it won't be solved anymore,"" he said of the current government. A common strategy is to deforest the land and then plead with politicians to abolish its protected status, on the basis it no longer serves its original purpose. The land grabbers can then officially buy the plots from the government, thereby legalising their claims. Alvim Souza Alves told a BBC undercover agent that he was selling indigenous land but did not show a legal land title Mr Alves took the BBC's undercover reporter to meet a man he described as the leader of the Curupira Association. Brazil's federal police have described the group as being an illegal land-grabbing operation focused on invading indigenous territory. The two men told the reporter that high-profile politicians were helping them set up meetings with government agencies in the capital BrasÃ­lia. They said their main ally was congressman Colonel ChrisÃ³stomo, a member of the Social Liberal Party, which Mr Bolsonaro used to be a member of until he founded his own party in 2019. When contacted by the BBC, Colonel ChrisÃ³stomo acknowledged having helped arrange meetings, but said he did not know the group was involved in land invasions. ""They didn't tell me,"" he said. ""If they invaded [the land], they don't have my support anymore."" When asked if he regretted setting up the meetings, he said: ""No."" The BBC contacted Mr Alves for his response but he declined to comment. The Amazon rainforest is home to one in 10 known species on Earth The BBC also approached Brazil's Minister of the Environment, Ricardo Salles. He said: ""President Jair Bolsonaro's government has always made it clear that his is a zero-tolerance government for any crime, including environmental ones."" The government has cut the inspections budget for Ibama, the federal agency that in charge of regulating deforestation, by 40%. But Mr Salles said the coronavirus pandemic had hampered law enforcement in the Amazon, and that state governments also bore responsibility for the deforestation. ""This year the government has created operation Verde Brasil 2, which seeks to control illegal deforestation, illegal fires, and to join efforts between the federal government and the states,"" he added. However Raphael Bevilaquia, a federal prosecutor based in RondÃ´nia, said the situation had worsened under the current government. ""The situation is really desperate,"" he said. ""The executive power is playing against us. It's disheartening."" For its part, Facebook claims trying to deduce which sales are illegal would be too complex a task for it to carry out itself, and should be left to the local judiciary and other authorities. And it does not appear to see the issue as being serious enough to warrant halting all Marketplace land sales across the Amazon. Ivaneide Bandeira, who has been trying to combat deforestation in the state of RondÃ´nia for 30 years, said she was losing hope. ""I think this is a very hard battle. It is really painful to see the forest being destroyed and shrinking more and more,"" she said. ""Never, in any other moment in history, has it been so hard to keep the forest standing.""

"The Duke of Sussex has said he had to step back from royal duties to protect himself and his family from the ""toxic"" situation created by the UK press. Prince Harry told TV chat show host James Corden it was ""destroying my mental health"" and he ""did what any husband [or] father would do"". Buckingham Palace confirmed last week thatthe prince and his wife Meghan would not resume royal duties. The duke insisted they were ""stepping back rather than stepping down"". The couple, who are expecting their second child, moved to California with their one-year-old son Archie afterannouncing their plan to step back as senior working royals last January. They said at the time that they wanted to work to become financially independent. Last week, Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess would not return to royal duties, following a planned review of the arrangements. As a result, they will have to return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages. What we learned from Prince Harry's interview Harry and Meghan not returning to Royal Family 'Overjoyed' Harry and Meghan expecting second child Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win In a segment for Corden's US TV programme The Late Late Show, the duke joined the British presenter on a double-decker bus tour of Los Angeles. Asked by Corden about the couple's decision to walk away from royal duties, Prince Harry insisted it ""was never walking away, it was stepping back rather than stepping down"". ""It was a really difficult environment as a lot of people saw. We all know what the British press can be like. And it was destroying my mental health. I was like, this is toxic."" He said he ""did what any husband [or] father would do"", and moved his family away, but insisted: ""I will never walk away, I will always be contributing. My life is public service."" Asked by Corden how he sees his future after lockdown restrictions are lifted, the duke said: ""My life is always going to be about public service and Meghan signed up to that."" The interview was recorded before it was confirmed Harry and Meghan would not resume royal duties. By Sarah Campbell, BBC News royal correspondent Much has been said and written about Harry and Meghan over the past year, but this is Harry in his own words - the first interview since the family moved to California. There's enough fluff to delight their fans - like details about Archie's first word and his love of waffles. Meghan makes an appearance via FaceTime and Harry gets muddy on an assault course. The tone is informal - two mates chatting on a bus (James Corden was at their wedding) but he does ask the question people want answered, about why they are no longer working royals. Harry is perhaps a little defensive in his response, saying it ""was never walking away"", and although this was recorded before the official ""decree absolute"" from Buckingham Palace last week, the sentiment about continued public service is the same. Commentators will point to the name check for Netflix (the couple have signed a multi-million dollar deal with the streaming service). Then there's the fact that in-between revealing personal family details he argues the reason they left the UK was because of press intrusion. Next weekend, it will be Meghan who takes centre stage with Oprah. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have both taken legal action against media outlets in the past. The duchess recently won aHigh Court privacy battle against the Mail on Sundayover the publication of extracts from a letter to her father. When his wife first began her legal action against the Mail on Sunday, the duke described the ""painful"" impact of the ""ruthless"" press campaign against her. ""I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,"" he said in a statement at the time. Referring to his late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, Harry said his ""deepest fear is history repeating itself"". Earlier this month, Harry alsosuccessfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he ""turned his back"" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal. Archie was born on 6 May, 2019 In a wide-ranging interview, the duke also defended Netflix drama The Crown, amidcriticism from some quarters about its portrayal of the Royal Family's history. ""Of course it's not strictly accurate, but, loosely, it gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle, what the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that,"" he said. ""I am way more comfortable with The Crown than I am seeing the stories written about my family, or my wife or myself."" Harry and Meghan married at Windsor Castle in May 2018 Last September, it emerged the duke and duchess had agreed a deal withNetflix to make a range of programmes, some of which they may appear in. Harry also revealed that Archie's first word was ""crocodile"" and the Queen sent him a waffle maker for Christmas.

"For 10 years Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon showed how to be a successful political duo. They campaigned hard, won elections and brought to the fore a shared dream of Scottish independence. That irresistible combo is gone, having given way to personal silences and a public war of words. As MSPs continue investigating the Scottish government's mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond, we look at their story. As the clock ticked past midday, I waited in the first minister's walnut panelled office for Nicola Sturgeon to give her first interview on the scandal. It was Friday 24 August 2018 - the day theDaily Record splashed on allegations of sexual misconduct,externalmade against her predecessor, Alex Salmond. The first minister was said to be so upset that her advisers worried she might cry on camera. When it came to it, Nicola Sturgeon kept her composure but there was clear emotion in the interview that followed. Her voice wavered slightly when she told me how ""incredibly difficult"" the situation was. At about the time she was speaking to me, Alex Salmond was telling journalists gathered around a Linlithgow pub table that while he was ""no saint"" he had not harassed anyone. In a pub in Linlithgow, the town where he was born, Alex Salmond told a gathered media he was ""no saint"" but he was not guilty of anything criminal The Scottish government had investigated complaints about him from two civil servants, under a new procedure signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. That was not news to the first minister because Alex Salmond had told her privately about the investigation several months before. What then could have brought Scotland's leader close to tears? This was, of course, a watershed moment when a private burden finally had to be shouldered in public. And, according to one source close to Nicola Sturgeon what was also significant was confirmation from the civil service that it had sufficient confidence in its investigation to refer the complaints to the police. That is said to have shattered the first minister's confidence in the denials Alex Salmond had given her. Having controversially met or spoken to him five times during the investigation - in which she insists she played no part - she broke off contact with him in July. Nicola Sturgeon's long standing alliance with her predecessor was in the process of breaking down and the day of the Daily Record scoop was probably when it became irretrievable. Alex Salmond was effectively at war with the government he once led and therefore with the woman who replaced him - his protÃ©gÃ©, Nicola Sturgeon. There was a lot to cry about. The Salmond/Sturgeon association spans three decades - she had backed him for the party leadership in 1990 and he encouraged her to stand for Westminster two years later, when she was just 21. ""He believed in me long before I believed in myself,"" she once said. Alex Salmond was a mentor, ally and friend. You could trace his influence in her early speaking style and in the way she sometimes scoffed at rivals during debate. 1999 - A fresh-faced SNP line-up in a new Scottish Parliament. The team of opposition MSPs, featuring the 29-year-old Nicola Sturgeon, was led by Alex Salmond 2011 - Alex Salmond was still leader of his party, but now he was running a majority SNP-government with Nicola Sturgeon at his side He appointed her to the SNP front bench when they were both elected to Holyrood in 1999. However, a little over a year into the new parliament Alex Salmond gave up the leadership, passing the reins to John Swinney. When he resigned in 2004 Nicola Sturgeon made her move for the top party job. The then 34-year-old entered the contest, but when it looked like she would lose to rival Roseanna Cunningham Alex Salmond came to the rescue. His decision to make a leadership comeback saved her from defeat. Instead, she became a winner, running as his deputy on what they styled as a joint ticket. This was the beginning of the powerful political partnership that has dominated Scottish politics and made a big impact on the UK political scene in the early part of this century. They led the SNP into government for the first time in 2007, to an overall majority at Holyrood in 2011 and within touching distance of independence in 2014. What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? A brief history of Alex Salmond Profile: Nicola Sturgeon They worked well together. Not least because Alex Salmond tended to let Nicola Sturgeon and other trusted ministers do their jobs without interference. As his deputy, her skills and personality seemed to complement his. Where he revelled in the spotlight, she was more naturally reserved. While he enjoyed painting the big picture, she was content to fill in the detail. They offered each other advice and challenge in private, and presented a united front in public - a discipline upon which the SNP's success was built. That's not to say there were no disagreements. When the NHS faced a budget squeeze after the financial crash, Nicola Sturgeon took a stand. According to one Alex Salmond ally, she ""pushed very hard"" to protect cash spending and won the first minister's support. Had she failed, another source said, she was prepared to resign. Nicola Sturgeon's confidence grew further during the independence campaign. From 2012, she took charge of referendum preparations as the Scottish government's so called ""Yes"" minister. It was during this period that she started coming into her own, establishing an approach that was distinct from his. Contrast, for example, the responses they gave to protests by independence supporters against the BBC. Alex Salmond defended those involved, arguing they must be allowed to express a view. Nicola Sturgeon advised that they spend their time campaigning for a ""Yes"" vote rather than against the BBC. Where he could be strident, she was more pragmatic is how one source close to Alex Salmond put it. 2013 - A year before the independence referendum, Alex Salmond made his party conference leader speech. Nicola Sturgeon was still performing her supporting role While their relationship remained strong throughout the referendum there were points of tension. Nicola Sturgeon was frustrated not to be involved in Alex Salmond's preparation for his first debate with the pro-Union leader Alistair Darling. The head-to-head, hosted by STV, saw Alex Salmond struggle with currency questions. When he set off for China in November 2013 without leaving detailed comments on the latest draft of the independence White Paper, her team questioned his commitment. The first minister's feedback would eventually filter through from the People's Republic. None of this caused a serious rift between them - that would come later, once Alex Salmond had left office. On 18 September 2014the independence vote was lost by 55% to 45%and within two months of that date Alex Salmond was gone as party leader and first minister. As Nicola Sturgeon prepared to take over, she acknowledged Alex Salmond had left ""big boots to fill"". However, she also asserted her political independence. ""I will wear my own shoes"" she said ""and they will have higher heels"". 2014 - Alex Salmond applauds new SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon moments after she had addressed party members. She was now in charge and centre stage She promised a more female friendly-leadership that would give priority to key issues of gender equality and seek to advance the interests of women. That's a pledge that may have weighed heavily as she thought of her response to the #MeToo movement a few years later. The key point about this transfer of power is that it fundamentally changed this political couple's relationship. She was no longer the understudy, she was now the principal performer. The new first minister travelled the country, addressing large audiences in what became known as her ""rock star tour"" and under her leadershipthe SNP won spectacularly at the 2015 Westminster election. By contrast, Alex Salmond's political power was on the wane. He could have pursued a career in business, academia or on the lecture circuit but he could not resist the pull of politics. As part of the 2015 landslide, he returned to Westminster, as MP for Gordon, in search of a new role. The party appointed him international affairs spokesman with a certain licence to stir things up. Friends said it was difficult for him to adjust. According to one MP, he did not take kindly to no longer driving the bus. When Alex Salmond publicly suggested a referendum might not be the only route to independence, the new driver asserted her authority. Nicola Sturgeon made clear that winning a referendum was now the established way to leave the UK. Within a few months of replacing him, Nicola Sturgeon dropped Alex Salmond's policy of a blanket 3p cut to corporation tax in the event of independence. He was not consulted. He was, however, brought into the loop for some decisions, such as the ill-fated call for indyref2 in early 2017. They were still in touch but nothing like as much as when they were partners in power. With one at Westminster and the other at Holyrood, they saw each other less and were gradually drifting apart. 2021 - There have been five first ministers since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. Their portraits hang alongside each other in Bute House - the official residence for those who do Scotland's top job The relationship deteriorated more seriously after the 2017 general election which sawAlex Salmond defeated for the first time in 30 years of parliamentary service. When Nicola Sturgeon phoned to offer her commiserations, she found Alex Salmond unavailable. It was, apparently, two or three weeks before they spoke. Alex Salmond was dealing with the death of his father around that time as well as the loss of his parliamentary seat. But there was something else. A friend of his said he was ""not very impressed"" with the SNP's election campaign, considering it insubstantial and lacking in energy and purpose. The party lost 21 of its 56 seats in this first election after the Brexit referendum and the Scottish Conservatives won 13 - enough to sustain Theresa May in office with help from the DUP. If that was one source of tension in Alex Salmond's relationship with his successor, others soon emerged as he began a new career outside politics. Appearing in his own show at the Edinburgh Fringe, Alex Salmond was accused of sexism when he explained the absence of any high profile female guests with the double entendre that he ""couldn't make them come"". Nicola Sturgeon said he was ""not sexist"" just as she had done two years earlier whenAlex Salmond told Conservative minister, Anna Soubry in the Commons to ""behave yourself woman"". The first minister's defence of her predecessor was more qualified this time. She said he was not always as funny as he thought and that perhaps his joke belonged in the era of Benny Hill. It was apparent to some in the SNP that she was wearying of him. As one MP put it, he was ""seen as a nuisance"" by the leadership during 2017. The lowest point came in November of that year, when it was announced thatAlex Salmond was to host his own show on the Kremlin-backed TV station, RT. Nicola Sturgeon has since spoken of her ""incredulity"" at this decision. It would increase the distance between them. As one Nicola Sturgeon ally put it - ""the first minister cannot take advice from a presenter on Russian state TV"". The week before Alex Salmond's TV show was announced, SNP MSP Mark McDonald was forced to resign as a Holyrood minister over inappropriate behaviour. The Scottish government's wider response to the #MeToo movement, following this departure, would set these political titans on a collision course. There was speculation that if Mr McDonald stood down, Alex Salmond might want to fight the Aberdeen Donside by-election. 2017 - Alex Salmond was on the campaign trail with Joanna Cherry who won a Westminster seat that summer. But he did not win back his According to friends of Alex Salmond that was wrong - he had no interest in making another Holyrood comeback and Nicola Sturgeon's team did not take it seriously either. Even if they found him annoying, they did not appear to regard him as a political threat. They would not however have been unaware that Alex Salmond had helped nurture new talent at Westminster, including the QC turned MP, Joanna Cherry, whom some see as a future leader. What appeared to be of concern to team Sturgeon in November 2017 was an enquiry from Sky News about allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Alex Salmond at Edinburgh Airport. He denied wrongdoing and nothing was broadcast at the time, but according to a later account from Nicola Sturgeon, it raised suspicions about her predecessor's conduct. On the first minister's instruction, the Scottish government was revising its procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying and harassment against ministers, following Mr McDonald's resignation. Nicola Sturgeon specifically told the civil service that the new policy could apply to former ministers and she put that in writing after the Sky News enquiry. This note was sent after her private secretary met a potential complainer against Alex Salmond from within the civil service. The Scottish government insists the first minister did not know about that. Supporters of Alex Salmond suspected the new policy was designed with him in mind, however, the Scottish government rejects that claim. What is clear is that Nicola Sturgeon chose an approach that would not exempt her predecessor. Had she decided otherwise, there might never have been a scandal. Alternatively, one might have blown up in the media anyway and she might have faced criticism for protecting an old friend. Complaints of sexual harassment against Alex Salmond from two female civil servants were lodged and a seven month investigation by the Scottish government followed. Those findings were shelved when the 66-year-oldsuccessfully challenged the complaints handling process in court. It decided the investigation was ""tainted by apparent bias"" and he was awarded more than Â£500,000 in legal costs. But the former first minister faced a much bigger legal battle ahead. In January 2019, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was arrested and charged with a string of sexual offences against women he had worked with at the Scottish government or the SNP, during his term as first minister. When he looked at the names on the charge sheet - according to a Salmond ally - ""that was when it hit him"" that this could be a conspiracy. One of those who testified against him in court has since told the BBC that it is ""utterly absurd"" to suggest nine women would perjure themselves as part of a political plot. Their evidence did not persuade a jury to convict and on 23 March last year - hours before the UK went into coronavirus lockdown - he was acquitted of the 13 sexual assault charges he faced. This video can not be played Alex Salmond is cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault Alex Salmond is now trying to expose what he believes was a conspiracy, accusing Nicola Sturgeon of multiple rule breaches including misleading the Scottish Parliament. She denies his claims. Their toxic feud has destroyed their relationship and caused deep divisions within the SNP. It also threatens damage to the first minister's reputation and to the independence dream she still shares with Alex Salmond. While she seems confident of weathering the storm, her credibility has hardly been enhanced by the revisions she's made to her story along the way. For example, having told Holyrood she learned about the investigation into Alex Salmond directly from him, she now acknowledges that ""allegations of a sexual nature"" were mentioned at a meeting she had days earlier and claims to have forgotten. Exactly what did she know and when, what meetings were held and why, where does party business end and government business begin? These are the questions being picked over by a committee of MSPs at Holyrood. The inescapable point is that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon cannot both be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as they are obliged to do under oath before the committee. What started three years ago with complaints about the former first minister's behaviour has led to intense scrutiny of Nicola Sturgeon's conduct in handling those complaints. If Alex Salmond can prove his allegations, a clamour for her resignation will follow - ironically at a time when her party and its goal of independence are polling strongly. If his claims are not proven, he is unlikely to give up the fight. Some of his supporters have called for him to be readmitted to the SNP. Others hope that he will stand in this May's Holyrood election for one of the newly formed independence parties. While those who know him well think that unlikely, they note he has not publicly ruled it out. As one MP put it ""you just never know what Alex is going to do next"".

"The Scottish government said the number of consultants employed by NHS Scotland had increased by 56% since 2006 It will be ""impossible"" for NHS Scotland to recover from the pandemic if senior staff cannot be retained, a medical body has warned. The British Medical Association (BMA) Scotland said vacancies for consultants may now be higher than 15%. Doctors were also reporting ""widespread burnout"" even before the Covid crisis hit, according to the association. The Scottish government said the number of consultants had increased by more than 56% since 2006. A spokesperson added that there was a ""record high"" of 5,702 whole time equivalent consultants currently employed by NHS Scotland. BMA Scotland is calling for urgent action from the Scottish government to stop what it called a ""deeply worrying drain of senior doctors out of the workforce"". A report published by the trade union found one in five consultants who were aged 45-49 in 2010 had left the profession by 2020 - with early retirement being the most likely destination. The BMA also said that freedom of information requests indicated that the actual vacancy rate for doctors was at least twice the government's official figure. Dr Graeme Eunson, chairman of the BMA's Scottish consultants committee, described the findings as ""extremely worrying"" and argued staff shortages were ""already affecting the ability of doctors to deliver the high-quality patient care they strive for"". He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programmethat staff were exhausted from going from winter 2019 straight into the Covid-19 pandemic early last year, with no time to recover between the first and second waves, and were now running on empty. Dr Eunson said that doctors were leaving quicker than their replacements could be trained - and said it took 15 years to train as a consultant. Without adequate staffing, he stressed that patient care would suffer. The Covid-19 pandemic has created a huge load on Scotland's hospitals during both the first and second waves of the pandemic Doctors had been reporting widespread burnout and an array or workforce and workplace pressures long before the pandemic hit last year, he said. And the specialities that faced the biggest staff shortages were those that faced the biggest pressure from Covid. He added that this came on top of ""a general increase in the intensity of work"" for doctors over the years. He said long working hours had followed them through their entire career, and that there was little recognition of the burnout these medics faced. ""As you get older, the shifts get harder - you're either doing everything or nothing,"" he said. He added that large tax bills drove people out at the end of their career. He called for a ""portfolio career approach"", so doctors could wind down - for example, by cutting back on shifts - but still care for patients. If the matter was not addressed urgently, he said the country would end up ""storing up problems"" for the future. The Scottish government said it was committed to improving the wellbeing of health and social care staff across Scotland and had taken ""immediate action"" to provide support while they responded to the pandemic. ""We are also working to build a sustainable culture that will continue to prioritise staff wellbeing in the future,"" a spokesperson said.

"This video can not be played WATCH: On patrol with an indigenous leader trying to protect the Amazon from land grabbers Parts of Brazil's Amazon rainforest are being illegally sold on Facebook, the BBC has discovered. The protected areas include national forests and land reserved for indigenous peoples. Some of the plots listed via Facebook's classified ads service are as large as 1,000 football pitches. Facebook said it was ""ready to work with local authorities"", but indicated it would not take independent action of its own to halt the trade. ""Our commerce policies require buyers and sellers to comply with laws and regulations,"" the Californian tech firm added. The Amazon has been described as being the lungs of the Earth - and it is being destroyed The leader of one of the indigenous communities affected has urged the tech firm to do more. And campaigners have claimed the country's government is unwilling to halt the sales. ""The land invaders feel very empowered to the point that they are not ashamed of going on Facebook to make illegal land deals,"" said Ivaneide Bandeira, head of environmental NGO KanindÃ©. Anyone can find the illegally invaded plots by typing the Portuguese equivalents for search terms like ""forest"", ""native jungle"" and ""timber"" into Facebook Marketplace's search tool, and picking one of the Amazonian states as the location. Some of the listings feature satellite images and GPS co-ordinates. Cattle are often put to graze on land that is meant to be protected Many of the sellers openly admit they do not have a land title, the only document which proves ownership of land under Brazilian law. The illegal activity is being fuelled by Brazil's cattle ranching industry. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is at a 10-year high, and Facebook's Marketplace has become a go-to site for sellers like Fabricio GuimarÃ£es, who was filmed by a hidden camera. ""There's no risk of an inspection by state agents here,"" he said as he walked through a patch of rainforest he had burnt to the ground. Fabricio is using Facebook Marketplace to sell land he has grabbed from indigenous communities With the land illegally cleared and ready for farming, he had tripled his initial asking price to $35,000 (Â£25,000). Fabricio is not a farmer. He has steady middle-class job in a city, and views the rainforest as being an investment opportunity. The BBC later contacted Fabricio for his response to its investigation but he declined to comment. Many of the ads came from RondÃ´nia, the most deforested state in Brazil's rainforest region. The BBC arranged meetings between four sellers from the state and an undercover operative posing as a lawyer claiming to represent wealthy investors. One man, called Alvim Souza Alves, was trying to sell a plot inside the Uru Eu Wau Wau indigenous reserve for about Â£16,400 in local currency. It is the home to a community of more than 200 Uru Eu Wau Wau people. And at least five further groups that have had no contact with the outside world also live there, according to the Brazilian government. But at the meeting, Mr Alves claimed: ""There are no Indians [sic] there. From where my land is, they are 50km [31 miles] away. I am not going to tell you that at one time or another they are not walking around."" The Uru Eu Wau Wau people are trying to protect their land from invaders The BBC showed the Facebook ad to community leader BitatÃ© Uru Eu Wau Wau. He said the lot was in an area used by his community to hunt, fish and collect fruits. ""This is a lack of respect,"" he said. ""I don't know these people. I think their objective is to deforest the indigenous land, to deforest what is standing. To deforest our lives, you could say."" He said the authorities should intervene, and also urged Facebook - ""the most accessed social media platform"" - to take action of its own. Another factor driving the illegal land market is the expectation of amnesty. Mr Alves revealed he was working with others to lobby politicians to help them legally own stolen land. ""I'll tell you the truth: if this is not solved with [President] Bolsonaro there, it won't be solved anymore,"" he said of the current government. A common strategy is to deforest the land and then plead with politicians to abolish its protected status, on the basis it no longer serves its original purpose. The land grabbers can then officially buy the plots from the government, thereby legalising their claims. Alvim Souza Alves told a BBC undercover agent that he was selling indigenous land but did not show a legal land title Mr Alves took the BBC's undercover reporter to meet a man he described as the leader of the Curupira Association. Brazil's federal police have described the group as being an illegal land-grabbing operation focused on invading indigenous territory. The two men told the reporter that high-profile politicians were helping them set up meetings with government agencies in the capital BrasÃ­lia. They said their main ally was congressman Colonel ChrisÃ³stomo, a member of the Social Liberal Party, which Mr Bolsonaro used to be a member of until he founded his own party in 2019. When contacted by the BBC, Colonel ChrisÃ³stomo acknowledged having helped arrange meetings, but said he did not know the group was involved in land invasions. ""They didn't tell me,"" he said. ""If they invaded [the land], they don't have my support anymore."" When asked if he regretted setting up the meetings, he said: ""No."" The BBC contacted Mr Alves for his response but he declined to comment. The Amazon rainforest is home to one in 10 known species on Earth The BBC also approached Brazil's Minister of the Environment, Ricardo Salles. He said: ""President Jair Bolsonaro's government has always made it clear that his is a zero-tolerance government for any crime, including environmental ones."" The government has cut the inspections budget for Ibama, the federal agency that in charge of regulating deforestation, by 40%. But Mr Salles said the coronavirus pandemic had hampered law enforcement in the Amazon, and that state governments also bore responsibility for the deforestation. ""This year the government has created operation Verde Brasil 2, which seeks to control illegal deforestation, illegal fires, and to join efforts between the federal government and the states,"" he added. However Raphael Bevilaquia, a federal prosecutor based in RondÃ´nia, said the situation had worsened under the current government. ""The situation is really desperate,"" he said. ""The executive power is playing against us. It's disheartening.""

"Alex Salmond explained to a committee of MSPs why he believed there was an attempt - by a number of people he named - to remove him from public life In his evidence - which lasted six hours - the former first minister fired shots at the Scottish government, including saying its harassment policy was ""badly thought out and badly implemented"" He was also critical of the ""censorship"" of one of his submissions to the Holyrood committee investigating the mishandling of complaints against him A row erupted after part of his written evidence was initially published but later redacted when the Crown Office raised concerns with the Scottish Parliament Mr Salmond believed that other parliaments, including the one at Westminster, would not have agreed to such a request by a prosecution service He accused the civil service, the Crown Office and the Scottish government of ""many and obvious"" failures in leadership, adding that there should be resignations Mr Salmond also told MSPs that the name of a woman who had made complaints about him had been shared at a meeting involving his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein The politician of three decades said he hoped the inquiry would yield lessons leading to a greater confidence in Scotland's institutions Mr Salmond went on to say that he ""has no doubt"" that Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code Ms Sturgeon said her predecessor had ""not a shred of evidence"" to back his claim that there was ""malicious"" moves to damage him BBC Scotland News Thank you for joining our coverage of Alex Salmond's
six-hour evidence session. Here are the main points:  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The last six hours have been detailed. Alex Salmondâs
complaints are numerous. But stand back from it for a second. The former first minister of Scotland has just accused his
successor of breaking the ministerial code â and left open the door for her
having to resign as a result. He has said Scotlandâs most senior civil servant should quit
â and that its most senior lawyer should consider his position. Nicola Sturgeonâs allies will argue he has not provided
evidence for his claims of a plot against him. But Ms Sturgeon will face huge questions when she appears
before MSPs next week â some of the most difficult she has faced in her career. In
response to the question about whether Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans would resign, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""No."" ""Scottish Government civil servants have acted professionally throughout on
behalf of ministers and in line with the Civil Service Code and values of
integrity, honesty, impartiality and objectivity. ""The permanent secretary
has already addressed the issues raised today at Committee on several
occasions. ""As the first minister has set out, she retains confidence in
the permanent secretary and expects her to see out the remainder of her
contract."" The spokesman said the government had a duty to investigate the ""serious and specific"" complaints against Mr Salmond. ""As set out in
detailed evidence to the committee, all government decisions were informed by
legal advice and taken in line with the Civil Service Code,"" he added. The Crown Office has responded to the allegations made by Alex Salmond in his evidence, saying it takes its responsibility to uphold the law seriously and protects the dignity and rights of all. It added: âScotlandâs prosecutors have acted independently and in the public interest at all times when considering matters related to this case. âThe Lord Advocate will appear before the committee next week to assist in public understanding of his role, and the actions of the Crown Office in relation to this case.â Philip SimBBC Scotland political reporter As the session ended, Mr Salmond
suggested to the committee that it could use its powers to seek to recover
documents from his lawyers. He
said the group had previously served orders on âpeople unwilling to give you
informationâ â but that his solicitors would be âextremely willingâ to assist. The committee has requested that the
Crown Office produce messages which Mr Salmond cited as potential proof of
collusion against him by midday on Tuesday â the day before Nicola Sturgeon
gives evidence. The group had previously used Scotland Act powers to compel the release of
other text messages â but concluded that they were not relevant to the
inquiryâs remit. Mr Salmond concludes by suggesting that the committee should serve an order under the Scotland Act on his solicitors ""who are extremely willing to give you information"". He says members may also want to request ""the letters from the Crown Office preventing me from furnishing you with that information hitherto"" under the same powers. He says that if the committee serves that order on his solicitors they will have the documentation on Monday morning, in time for sessions with the Lord Advocate and crown agent. Jackie Baillie Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says that Mr Salmond has been very careful not call for Nicola Sturgeon to resign. ""Does that mean you have forgiven her for her handling of this?"" she asks. Mr Salmond says ""no"" - it means the people who he has called on to consider their positions are the ones where he has ""documentary evidence"" of their actions. ""I don't think it is for me to judge what happens to someone who may have broken the ministerial code,"" he says. Committee convener Linda Fabiani asks Mr Salmond when the ""malicious plan"" that he has described against him started. Mr Salmond repeats that he thinks some people hoped the police investigation would come to the rescue of the judicial review. ""That almost happened,"" he says. ""It was only with the great work of my legal team that we were able to argue that should not happen."" James Hamilton QC, Ireland's former director of public prosecutions, is leading an investigation into whether Nicola Sturgeon broke the ministerial code - which sets out how ministers should behave. Independent MSP Andy Wightman asks Mr Salmond if he has ""full confidence in the independent advisers on the ministerial code"" and ""can we rely on Mr Hamilton's findings?"" Mr Salmond says he has ""every reason to believe he (Mr Hamilton) is a man of great integrity and experience"". He says he created the panel and thinks it is unsatisfactory its remit should be confined in any way. ""I've got every confidence that Mr Hamilton will discharge his duties in a proper way and I think it is fundamentally a good system,"" he says. Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell on a visit to Wimbledon Alex Salmond has made a series of allegations in
his evidence:  The first minister, Mr Murrell, Ms Evans and Lord Wolffe have all rejected the allegations and deny wrongdoing. Murdo Fraser asks Mr Salmond who should resign. Mr Salmond says the people responsible for the judicial review should resign. He says permanent secretary Leslie Evans should have resigned on 8 January 2019 when the judicial review was conceded, and he knew Scottish government ministers who felt the same. ""I can't think of many people who would not have thought that an appropriate thing to do,"" he says. ""I think the Lord Advocate should be considering his position for this and a range of other issues,"" Mr Salmond adds. He says the Scottish government administration and the Crown Office needs new leadership. Mr Fraser asks if Nicola Sturgeon should resign if she is shown to have broken the ministerial code. Mr Salmond says he is in no doubt that she has broken the code, but it is not for him to say what the consequences should be. He says it is not the case that every minister that breaks the code resigns. ""Your own party have an example of that relatively recently,"" he tells the Tory MSP, referring to the case of the UK government's Home Secretary Priti Patel. Mr Salmond said in his submission that ""the evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and
concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and
the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned"". Tory MSP Murdo Fraser asks why these people would conspire against him. Mr Salmond says the original intention was to defeat the judicial review by having it postponed. He says: ""It came to be believed among some people that the loss of the court case would be cataclysmic not just for Leslie Evans and senior officials in the Scottish government, but for Nicola Sturgeon herself. ""I think people came to the belief that the police process would somehow assist in firstly not losing the review, and thereafter making sure that the loss of the judicial review was swept away in the inevitable publicity of the criminal trial. ""If I had been convicted of any offence in the criminal trial, that would be the case.""  The evidence supports a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned. Alex Salmond, Former first minister Mr Salmond tells Murdo Fraser that both explanations around the 29 March meeting breach the ministerial code. He says either Ms Sturgeon did not really forget about it and parliament was deliberately misled, or alternatively it was forgotten about and parliament was not informed when she was reminded of it. These are clear breaches of the ministerial code, he says. A separate inquiry, led by James Hamilton, is to decide on whether the ministerial code was broken. Murdo Fraser Tory MSP Murdo Fraser says First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Mr Salmond's claims are untrue and he has no evidence. ""In effect she is denouncing you as a liar and a fantasist. Are you?"" asks Mr Fraser. Mr Salmond points to the evidence of his claims, citing the meeting with his special advisor on 29 March 2018 which Ms Sturgeon had ""forgotten"" happened. He says there is no doubt that this meeting was pre-arranged for the express purpose of Ms Sturgeon being briefed about the complaints against him. The meeting on 2 April arose from that, he says. ""Otherwise, how on earth would I have known to turn up on the 2 April?"" Mr Salmond says that for a substantial period of time the meeting of 29 March was written out of history. ""People say what difference does four days make?"" he asks. ""The difference is, of course, if the meeting of 29 March is admitted and, indeed, the subject matter is admitted, then it makes it very hard to argue that the meeting of 2 April was on party business as opposed to government business."" Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Editor Thereâs a lot of important detail to wade through in this
inquiry and it would be easy to get bogged down. But essentially Alex Salmond thinks senior figures in
Scotlandâs public administration should be held to account for mishandling
harassment complaints against him. Perhaps foremost among them is Scotlandâs top civil servant,
Leslie Evans. Asked by Labour MSP Jackie Baillie if he thought she had
discharged her responsibilities in line with the ministerial code, he gave a
one word answer: âNoâ. Heâs also taken aim at the Scottish governmentâs chief legal
adviser, Lord Advocate James Wolffe. And we know that he thinks his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, has repeatedly broken the code of conduct of ministers. His evidence on the ministerial code is the final section of
todayâs epic evidence session which has already gone into extra time. Mr Cole-Hamilton says the first minister's written evidence says she agreed to meet Mr Salmond for two reasons. The Lib Dem MSP says the first was Mr Salmond's ""profound distress"" around what he was going to say at the meeting, and the second was that she thought he was going to resign her party membership. Mr Salmond says he had no purpose in resigning from the SNP at that time and insists ""I had no thought of resignation whatsoever. ""Resignation from the SNP never entered my head."" Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole Hamilton Mr Cole-Hamilton asks Mr Salmond to summarise the discussion he had with the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says
they had discussed the situation and what he had been sent, which had some
detail. He said there was no suggestion that Ms Sturgeon was ""surprised and astounded"" by the reason for the meeting. ""The meeting was for that purpose,"" he said. He says they went through options, including a mediation policy - which had been absent from the harassment policy. Mr Salmond says the indication the first minister gave him was that she was willing to go ahead with that. Mr Cole-Hamilton asks if the name of one of the complainants was intimated to him and the three other people involved in that discussion. Mr Salmond said he thought it was - but that the name had previously been given to him by Geoff Aberdein, who had got it from a senior government official. Nicola Sturgeon met Mr Salmond at her home in April 2018 Alex Cole-Hamilton focuses on a meeting between Geoff Aberdein and Nicola Sturgeon on 29 March 2018 and the subsequent meeting between Alex Salmond and the first minister on 2 April. Mr Salmond says the purpose of Mr Aberdein meeting with Ms Sturgeon on 29 March was to brief the first minister on what was happening. ""I know that Nicola Sturgeon knew about the complaints process at the meeting on the 29th of March because I was told so by Geoff Aberdein,"" he said. He adds that meeting was ""not impromptu, was not accidental, was not her popping her head around the door - it was a meeting arranged for that purpose"". Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon met at the first ministerâs Glasgow home on 2 April. Mr Salmond says he had heard Mr Murrell say that he was regularly ""popping in"". The former first minister points out that he stays 200 miles away from Glasgow and says he has only visited Ms Sturgeon's home about six times in his life. ""I didn't pop in,"" he says. Tory MSP Margaret Mitchell refers to a text sent by SNP chief executive Peter Murrell that talks of âpressurisingâ the police. Another says ""the more fronts he is having to firefight on the better for all complainers"". Mr Murrell, who is the husband of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has said the messages were out of character and expressed how upset he was at the time. Mr Salmond says that in January last year, on the day he first appeared at court for a preliminary hearing in the criminal case, he was presented with a memory stick. The next day when he went through the messages it contained ""was one of the most extraordinary days of my life"", Mr Salmond says. He says he is not allowed to describe them in any detail, but they speak to behaviour he would not have expected from people he had known for 30 years. ""In my opinion, there has been behaviour which is about not just pressurising the police but pressurising witnesses, collusion with witnesses, we are talking about the construction of evidence because the police were somehow felt inadequate in finding it themselves,"" he says. Mr Salmond says that when a police investigation starts these matters are for the police. It is not for the SNP or the Scottish government to supplant the police in an investigative function, he says. Jackie Baillie asked if the ministerial code had been breached Jackie Baillie says there was a meeting on 13 November 2018 between counsel, the first minister, the permanent secretary and the chief of staff. ""As a former first minister, would carrying on legal action in the Court of Session knowing that you had acted unlawfully be a breach of the ministerial code?"" she asked. ""Yes,"" replies Mr Salmond. Ms Baillie asks: ""Do you believe that this was the case in this instance?"" He replies: ""Well we cannot be sure because I like you haven't seen the external legal advice of October 2018."" If the legal advice said the government was about to lose and the first minister carried on with the case then that would be a breach of the ministerial code, he says. Mr Salmond says people would be better informed if they could see the document. Ms Baillie says the parliament has asked twice, adding: ""Good luck with that one."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Exports to Ireland are being blocked by extra paperwork and costs at customs, say CBI Wales Welsh exports to Ireland are being blocked by extra paperwork and costs at customs, says CBI Wales. Director Ian Price said the authorities in the Republic of Ireland were ""zealous"" when checking goods which was ""causing some delays."" He said documents had been rejected for being written in blue not black ink. Ireland's consul general in Wales insisted the Irish Government was ""focused"" on facilitating trade between the two countries. Mr Price called for ""consistency of approach"" when exporting to the EU. The republic is Wales' fourth biggest export market, behind Germany, France and the US and the fifth largest market for the UK. Brexit: Call to cut Welsh ports in a bid to boost trade Brexit: Stena Line 'committed to Wales' despite traffic drop Irish hauliers 'bypassing Welsh ports', say bosses Trade worth Â£20bn goes back and forth across the Irish Sea every week. But since 1 January, there has been a drop in UK-Ireland traffic at Holyhead and Pembroke Dock. CBI Wales' director Ian Price said documents had been rejected for being written in blue rather than black ink Mr Price said it's difficult to tell whether this was down to companies ""biding their time"" because they foresaw problems or if it is ""a genuine change in the way people are moving their goods."" ""There's no denying costs of freight have increased quite largely and it's hard to judge at the moment, whether this is a temporary glitch, or whether this is something that is with us for good,"" he explained. ""Quite clearly there's a lot more administration involved now we're moving goods from ourselves into mainland Europe and as a consequence, it requires more people, requires more time or documentation and that in itself creates a cost."" This was ""a burden"" being absorbed by UK businesses, he said. Ireland's consul general in Wales, Denise Hanrahan said the Brexit changes were a ""steep learning curve"" Ireland's consul general in Wales, Denise Hanrahan said: ""Ireland and Wales are so closely tied, our shared Irish sea border is one of the vital links between us. ""The UK has left the EU customs union, has left the single market, and that inevitably requires then systems to be put in place to manage the customs, the health aspects, the animal safety aspects. ""All of those normal aspects of trading."" Ms Hanrahan said it was a ""steep learning curve."" The Irish Government was supporting businesses ""to learn as much as possible as to how they can best interact with those systems."" Josh Burbidge, managing director of 150-year-old family firm Archwood Group, says the Irish market is ""significant"". It is worth more than Â£600,000 in annual revenue to the business, based in Chirk, Wrexham, he said. Archwood's Josh Burbidge said his firm won't be able to absorb extra costs in the long term ""We made the conscious decision to stop exporting anything to Ireland for two weeks at the start of January to help with the paperwork, and ensure that we had everything sorted in terms of all of the regulation,"" he explained. Deliveries have recently been delayed by six weeks and while currently absorbing extra costs, the firm cannot do so forever. ""Every pallet we send in as an extra Â£65, and every consignment or individual parcel is Â£6.50,"" he said. ""We're not in a high margin business. Therefore, we won't be able to continue absorbing those costs on the longer term."" Wrexham Lager sales manager Joss Roberts, said Brexit complications were having a ""major impact"", despite the majority of business comes from the UK. ""Prices are becoming unrealistic,"" said Mr Roberts. ""We've had to cancel three Irish orders this morning because the end receiver is expected to pay â¬11.50 per crate, that's on top of an admin courier fee. ""It's gone up around Â£17 alone to the Republic of Ireland where as to the likes of Spain it's gone up over â¬60 a crate."" Wrexham Lager will ""have to work out a way"" said sales manager Joss Roberts He has written to customers to warn them of the extra fees. The business will ""have to work out a way."" He said: ""Do they ring us and pay the extra over the phone? Do we put an extra addition on our cost on the website? It's hassle that from December wasn't there.""

"Mark Drakeford says Wales is ""so lucky"" to have the natural resources for renewable energy Labour will put Wales ""at the forefront of the global energy revolution"" if the party wins the Senedd election in May, the party's Welsh leader has pledged. First Minister Mark Drakeford says Wales can use ""wind, water and wave"" to create ""the jobs of the future"". In a pre-recorded speech to Welsh Labour's virtual spring conference, he also called for a ""more powerful devolution settlement"". Mr Drakeford wants ""home rule for Wales in a successful United Kingdom"". Leader of Welsh Labour and first minister since December 2018, Mr Drakeford has already saidhe does not intend to serve a full termif he is reappointed after the election. In his recorded address on Friday -shared publicly on social media,external- he said a Labour government would put the ""urgent need"" to tackle climate change ""at the heart of everything we do"". ""We are so lucky, in our country, to have all the natural resources we need to put Wales at the forefront of the global energy revolution which the world will need,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""Wind, water and wave - the next Welsh Labour Government will make those assets work to create the jobs of the future and, in doing so, make our contribution to securing the future of our beautiful but fragile planet."" Mark Drakeford wants Wales to ""break down barriers, not build them up"" in terms of the UK's future In response to a growing debate around Wales' future in the UK, Mr Drakeford said: ""We need a more powerful devolution settlement, one in which we secure home rule for Wales in a successful United Kingdom - internationalist, not nationalist; outward facing, not inward looking."" With an apparent nod to the independence movement, he said: ""Yes for Wales, of course - that's what I have been throughout my whole life - but yes to a Wales that takes ownership of its own destiny alongside working people in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland who share our progressive values. ""Yes to a Wales which has the confidence of knowing that we are at our best when we break down barriers, not build them up, where we create our future alongside others, not despite or against them."" On Friday, Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales his party's manifesto would be both ambitious and credible. ""I'll be focusing on health because we will have to rebuild our health service post pandemic,"" he said. ""I'll be talking about jobs, particularly jobs for our young people, because this is an economic crisis as well as a health crisis. ""And I'll be talking about justice as well, so that we come out of all of this in a way that is fairer."" Mr Drakeford said he was ""absolutely determined there will be no lost generation in Wales"". FM Mark Drakeford denies he's 'indy-curious' Clock ticks down to May's Senedd election UK Treasury to control Wales' 'levelling up' cash He added that if Labour wins the election he would remain as first minister for ""beyond two years"". ""When I first stood as a candidate for the leadership of the Labour Party... I said then that I expected to serve for around five years,"" he told Radio Wales Breakfast. ""So, if we are fortunate enough to win the confidence of Welsh people again... I will be the first minister in the full sense of that word. ""That's the plan that I had in the beginning - that's the plan I intend to stick to."" Labour has been in government in Wales since devolution began in 1999, forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats in 2000 and Plaid Cymru in 2007. The party won 29 of the 60 seats in the 2016 Senedd election and governs with the support of Liberal Democrat Kirsty Williams and independent member Lord Elis-Thomas. Labour lost six Welsh seats to the Conservatives at the last UK general election in 2019. The Senedd election is due to take place on 6 May, although a law has been passed in light of the pandemic toallow a delay of up to six monthsif two-thirds of members think it necessary for safety or other reasons. In this speech Mark Drakeford is trying to address some of the big issues in the forthcoming election. Firstly, the ""it's time for a change"" argument that will be made by Labour's opponents - the party has been in power in Wales for 20 plus years. So he says it's only his team who have been ""tested in the fire of experience"" of governing through the Covid pandemic, which is ""far from over"". Secondly independence, which has risen up the political agenda recently. He uses the phrase ""Yes for Wales"" to tell left-wing voters thinking of turning to Plaid or the Greens that he wants to get more powers for Welsh devolution (""home rule"") but he balances that by referencing traditional socialist concerns about working class solidarity across the UK. And finally, he turns his fire power on the Conservative government in Westminster, presenting Welsh Labour as a bulwark against ""inequality and austerity"".

"Residents in the area said they heard an ""explosion"" at about 04:00 GMT Forty people had to be evacuated when burglars used acetylene cylinders to blast off a shop's door and cash machine in part of Cardiff. South Wales Police said the explosion at about 04:00 GMT at the Co-op in Llanrumney caused ""significant damage"". About 40 people living in the flats above the shop had to take refuge at a nearby branch of Greggs. Councillor Keith Jones said the offenders showed a ""complete disregard for human life"". Two South Wales Fire crews were also at the scene in Countisbury Avenue but there have been no reported injuries. Councillors have said the offenders were targetting the ATM outside the Co-op Mr Jones said he and his fellow ward councillors had previously successfully campaigned to install two CCTV cameras at either end of the parade of shops. He urged police to ""urgently review"" the footage of what happened in the early hours and see if anyone could be identified. Llanrumney councillor Lee Bridgeman said when the 11 families were evacuated from their flats uthe leisure centre and hotels were put on standby to look after them. Allow Facebook content?

They said: ""Following a failed attempt to remove an ATM machine from the Co-op store on Countisbury Avenue, a fire was started at the building, which caused an immediate danger to those living in flats above the shops. ""The council was responsible for the evacuation and shelter of 40 people during this incident, who were firstly moved to a safe distance, and then moved on to a bus until more suitable accommodation could be found. ""All protocols and procedures were followed and the incident ended at 6.30am. The residents have now been moved back into their properties and the council is continuing to support the emergency services while investigations continue."" A spokesperson for Co-op said it was too early to confirm when the store would be able to reopen as the damage was still being assessed. Philip Lancefield said Friday's incident was more ""significant"" than similar ones in the past Philip Lancefield, who owns a greengrocers in the same parade of shops, said there had been a few break-ins and a ram raid on the Co-op two years ago but nothing as significant as Friday's . Mr Lancefield said: ""I'm not particularly worried about my business being targeted but what's happened is affecting trade here today."" Kieran Davenport said his family heard the explosion in the early hours Kieran Davenport, who lives opposite the Co-op, said: ""I didn't hear it because I was asleep but others in the house heard an explosion and a car screeching away. It happened at about four in the morning. ""It all happened really quickly. It's been targeted a few times in the past but I don't think they've ever got away with much before.""

"Residents in the area said they heard an ""explosion"" at about 04:00 GMT Forty people had to be evacuated when burglars used acetylene cylinders to blast off a shop's door and cash machine in part of Cardiff. South Wales Police said the explosion at about 04:00 GMT at the Co-op in Llanrumney caused ""significant damage"". About 40 people living in the flats above the shop had to take refuge at a nearby branch of Greggs. Councillor Keith Jones said the offenders showed a ""complete disregard for human life"". Two South Wales Fire crews were also at the scene in Countisbury Avenue but there have been no reported injuries. Councillors have said the offenders were targetting the ATM outside the Co-op Mr Jones said he and his fellow ward councillors had previously successfully campaigned to install two CCTV cameras at either end of the parade of shops. He urged police to ""urgently review"" the footage of what happened in the early hours and see if anyone could be identified. Llanrumney councillor Lee Bridgeman said when the 11 families were evacuated from their flats uthe leisure centre and hotels were put on standby to look after them. Allow Facebook content?

A spokesman for Cardiff Council confirmed it was contacted by the emergency services at 04:00 GMT. They said: ""Following a failed attempt to remove an ATM machine from the Co-op store on Countisbury Avenue, a fire was started at the building, which caused an immediate danger to those living in flats above the shops. ""The council was responsible for the evacuation and shelter of 40 people during this incident, who were firstly moved to a safe distance, and then moved on to a bus until more suitable accommodation could be found. ""All protocols and procedures were followed and the incident ended at 6.30am. The residents have now been moved back into their properties and the council is continuing to support the emergency services while investigations continue."" A spokesperson for Co-op said it was too early to confirm when the store would be able to reopen as the damage was still being assessed. Philip Lancefield said Friday's incident was more ""significant"" than similar ones in the past Philip Lancefield, who owns a greengrocers in the same parade of shops, said there had been a few break-ins and a ram raid on the Co-op two years ago but nothing as significant as Friday's . Mr Lancefield said: ""I'm not particularly worried about my business being targeted but what's happened is affecting trade here today."" Kieran Davenport said his family heard the explosion in the early hours Kieran Davenport, who lives opposite the Co-op, said: ""I didn't hear it because I was asleep but others in the house heard an explosion and a car screeching away. It happened at about four in the morning. ""It all happened really quickly. It's been targeted a few times in the past but I don't think they've ever got away with much before.""

"For 10 years Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon showed how to be a successful political duo. They campaigned hard, won elections and brought to the fore a shared dream of Scottish independence. That irresistible combo is gone, having given way to personal silences and a public war of words. As MSPs continue investigating the Scottish government's mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond, we look at their story. As the clock ticked past midday, I waited in the first minister's walnut panelled office for Nicola Sturgeon to give her first interview on the scandal. It was Friday 24 August 2018 - the day theDaily Record splashed on allegations of sexual misconduct,externalmade against her predecessor, Alex Salmond. The first minister was said to be so upset that her advisers worried she might cry on camera. When it came to it, Nicola Sturgeon kept her composure but there was clear emotion in the interview that followed. Her voice wavered slightly when she told me how ""incredibly difficult"" the situation was. At about the time she was speaking to me, Alex Salmond was telling journalists gathered around a Linlithgow pub table that while he was ""no saint"" he had not harassed anyone. In a pub in Linlithgow, the town where he was born, Alex Salmond told a gathered media he was ""no saint"" but he was not guilty of anything criminal The Scottish government had investigated complaints about him from two civil servants, under a new procedure signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. That was not news to the first minister because Alex Salmond had told her privately about the investigation several months before. What then could have brought Scotland's leader close to tears? This was, of course, a watershed moment when a private burden finally had to be shouldered in public. And, according to one source close to Nicola Sturgeon what was also significant was confirmation from the civil service that it had sufficient confidence in its investigation to refer the complaints to the police. That is said to have shattered the first minister's confidence in the denials Alex Salmond had given her. Having controversially met or spoken to him five times during the investigation - in which she insists she played no part - she broke off contact with him in July. Nicola Sturgeon's long standing alliance with her predecessor was in the process of breaking down and the day of the Daily Record scoop was probably when it became irretrievable. Alex Salmond was effectively at war with the government he once led and therefore with the woman who replaced him - his protÃ©gÃ©, Nicola Sturgeon. There was a lot to cry about. The Salmond/Sturgeon association spans three decades - she had backed him for the party leadership in 1990 and he encouraged her to stand for Westminster two years later, when she was just 21. ""He believed in me long before I believed in myself,"" she once said. Alex Salmond was a mentor, ally and friend. You could trace his influence in her early speaking style and in the way she sometimes scoffed at rivals during debate. 1999 - A fresh-faced SNP line-up in a new Scottish Parliament. The team of opposition MSPs, featuring the 29-year-old Nicola Sturgeon, was led by Alex Salmond 2011 - Alex Salmond was still leader of his party, but now he was running a majority SNP-government with Nicola Sturgeon at his side He appointed her to the SNP front bench when they were both elected to Holyrood in 1999. However, a little over a year into the new parliament Alex Salmond gave up the leadership, passing the reins to John Swinney. When he resigned in 2004 Nicola Sturgeon made her move for the top party job. The then 34-year-old entered the contest, but when it looked like she would lose to rival Roseanna Cunningham Alex Salmond came to the rescue. His decision to make a leadership comeback saved her from defeat. Instead, she became a winner, running as his deputy on what they styled as a joint ticket. This was the beginning of the powerful political partnership that has dominated Scottish politics and made a big impact on the UK political scene in the early part of this century. They led the SNP into government for the first time in 2007, to an overall majority at Holyrood in 2011 and within touching distance of independence in 2014. What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? A brief history of Alex Salmond Profile: Nicola Sturgeon They worked well together. Not least because Alex Salmond tended to let Nicola Sturgeon and other trusted ministers do their jobs without interference. As his deputy, her skills and personality seemed to complement his. Where he revelled in the spotlight, she was more naturally reserved. While he enjoyed painting the big picture, she was content to fill in the detail. They offered each other advice and challenge in private, and presented a united front in public - a discipline upon which the SNP's success was built. That's not to say there were no disagreements. When the NHS faced a budget squeeze after the financial crash, Nicola Sturgeon took a stand. According to one Alex Salmond ally, she ""pushed very hard"" to protect cash spending and won the first minister's support. Had she failed, another source said, she was prepared to resign. Nicola Sturgeon's confidence grew further during the independence campaign. From 2012, she took charge of referendum preparations as the Scottish government's so called ""Yes"" minister. It was during this period that she started coming into her own, establishing an approach that was distinct from his. Contrast, for example, the responses they gave to protests by independence supporters against the BBC. Alex Salmond defended those involved, arguing they must be allowed to express a view. Nicola Sturgeon advised that they spend their time campaigning for a ""Yes"" vote rather than against the BBC. Where he could be strident, she was more pragmatic is how one source close to Alex Salmond put it. 2013 - A year before the independence referendum, Alex Salmond made his party conference leader speech. Nicola Sturgeon was still performing her supporting role While their relationship remained strong throughout the referendum there were points of tension. Nicola Sturgeon was frustrated not to be involved in Alex Salmond's preparation for his first debate with the pro-Union leader Alistair Darling. The head-to-head, hosted by STV, saw Alex Salmond struggle with currency questions. When he set off for China in November 2013 without leaving detailed comments on the latest draft of the independence White Paper, her team questioned his commitment. The first minister's feedback would eventually filter through from the People's Republic. None of this caused a serious rift between them - that would come later, once Alex Salmond had left office. On 18 September 2014the independence vote was lost by 55% to 45%and within two months of that date Alex Salmond was gone as party leader and first minister. As Nicola Sturgeon prepared to take over, she acknowledged Alex Salmond had left ""big boots to fill"". However, she also asserted her political independence. ""I will wear my own shoes"" she said ""and they will have higher heels"". 2014 - Alex Salmond applauds new SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon moments after she had addressed party members. She was now in charge and centre stage She promised a more female friendly-leadership that would give priority to key issues of gender equality and seek to advance the interests of women. That's a pledge that may have weighed heavily as she thought of her response to the #MeToo movement a few years later. The key point about this transfer of power is that it fundamentally changed this political couple's relationship. She was no longer the understudy, she was now the principal performer. The new first minister travelled the country, addressing large audiences in what became known as her ""rock star tour"" and under her leadershipthe SNP won spectacularly at the 2015 Westminster election. By contrast, Alex Salmond's political power was on the wane. He could have pursued a career in business, academia or on the lecture circuit but he could not resist the pull of politics. As part of the 2015 landslide, he returned to Westminster, as MP for Gordon, in search of a new role. The party appointed him international affairs spokesman with a certain licence to stir things up. Friends said it was difficult for him to adjust. According to one MP, he did not take kindly to no longer driving the bus. When Alex Salmond publicly suggested a referendum might not be the only route to independence, the new driver asserted her authority. Nicola Sturgeon made clear that winning a referendum was now the established way to leave the UK. Within a few months of replacing him, Nicola Sturgeon dropped Alex Salmond's policy of a blanket 3p cut to corporation tax in the event of independence. He was not consulted. He was, however, brought into the loop for some decisions, such as the ill-fated call for indyref2 in early 2017. They were still in touch but nothing like as much as when they were partners in power. With one at Westminster and the other at Holyrood, they saw each other less and were gradually drifting apart. 2021 - There have been five first ministers since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. Their portraits hang alongside each other in Bute House - the official residence for those who do Scotland's top job The relationship deteriorated more seriously after the 2017 general election which sawAlex Salmond defeated for the first time in 30 years of parliamentary service. When Nicola Sturgeon phoned to offer her commiserations, she found Alex Salmond unavailable. It was, apparently, two or three weeks before they spoke. Alex Salmond was dealing with the death of his father around that time as well as the loss of his parliamentary seat. But there was something else. A friend of his said he was ""not very impressed"" with the SNP's election campaign, considering it insubstantial and lacking in energy and purpose. The party lost 21 of its 56 seats in this first election after the Brexit referendum and the Scottish Conservatives won 13 - enough to sustain Theresa May in office with help from the DUP. If that was one source of tension in Alex Salmond's relationship with his successor, others soon emerged as he began a new career outside politics. Appearing in his own show at the Edinburgh Fringe, Alex Salmond was accused of sexism when he explained the absence of any high profile female guests with the double entendre that he ""couldn't make them come"". Nicola Sturgeon said he was ""not sexist"" just as she had done two years earlier whenAlex Salmond told Conservative minister, Anna Soubry in the Commons to ""behave yourself woman"". The first minister's defence of her predecessor was more qualified this time. She said he was not always as funny as he thought and that perhaps his joke belonged in the era of Benny Hill. It was apparent to some in the SNP that she was wearying of him. As one MP put it, he was ""seen as a nuisance"" by the leadership during 2017. The lowest point came in November of that year, when it was announced thatAlex Salmond was to host his own show on the Kremlin-backed TV station, RT. Nicola Sturgeon has since spoken of her ""incredulity"" at this decision. It would increase the distance between them. As one Nicola Sturgeon ally put it - ""the first minister cannot take advice from a presenter on Russian state TV"". The week before Alex Salmond's TV show was announced, SNP MSP Mark McDonald was forced to resign as a Holyrood minister over inappropriate behaviour. The Scottish government's wider response to the #MeToo movement, following this departure, would set these political titans on a collision course. There was speculation that if Mr McDonald stood down, Alex Salmond might want to fight the Aberdeen Donside by-election. 2017 - Alex Salmond was on the campaign trail with Joanna Cherry who won a Westminster seat that summer. But he did not win back his According to friends of Alex Salmond that was wrong - he had no interest in making another Holyrood comeback and Nicola Sturgeon's team did not take it seriously either. Even if they found him annoying, they did not appear to regard him as a political threat. They would not however have been unaware that Alex Salmond had helped nurture new talent at Westminster, including the QC turned MP, Joanna Cherry, whom some see as a future leader. What appeared to be of concern to team Sturgeon in November 2017 was an enquiry from Sky News about allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Alex Salmond at Edinburgh Airport. He denied wrongdoing and nothing was broadcast at the time, but according to a later account from Nicola Sturgeon, it raised suspicions about her predecessor's conduct. On the first minister's instruction, the Scottish government was revising its procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying and harassment against ministers, following Mr McDonald's resignation. Nicola Sturgeon specifically told the civil service that the new policy could apply to former ministers and she put that in writing after the Sky News enquiry. This note was sent after her private secretary met a potential complainer against Alex Salmond from within the civil service. The Scottish government insists the first minister did not know about that. Supporters of Alex Salmond suspected the new policy was designed with him in mind, however, the Scottish government rejects that claim. What is clear is that Nicola Sturgeon chose an approach that would not exempt her predecessor. Had she decided otherwise, there might never have been a scandal. Alternatively, one might have blown up in the media anyway and she might have faced criticism for protecting an old friend. Complaints of sexual harassment against Alex Salmond from two female civil servants were lodged and a seven month investigation by the Scottish government followed. Those findings were shelved when the 66-year-oldsuccessfully challenged the complaints handling process in court. It decided the investigation was ""tainted by apparent bias"" and he was awarded more than Â£500,000 in legal costs. But the former first minister faced a much bigger legal battle ahead. In January 2019, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was arrested and charged with a string of sexual offences against women he had worked with at the Scottish government or the SNP, during his term as first minister. When he looked at the names on the charge sheet - according to a Salmond ally - ""that was when it hit him"" that this could be a conspiracy. One of those who testified against him in court has since told the BBC that it is ""utterly absurd"" to suggest nine women would perjure themselves as part of a political plot. Their evidence did not persuade a jury to convict and on 23 March last year - hours before the UK went into coronavirus lockdown - he was acquitted of the 13 sexual assault charges he faced. This video can not be played Alex Salmond is cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault Alex Salmond is now trying to expose what he believes was a conspiracy, accusing Nicola Sturgeon of multiple rule breaches including misleading the Scottish Parliament. She denies his claims. Their toxic feud has destroyed their relationship and caused deep divisions within the SNP. It also threatens damage to the first minister's reputation and to the independence dream she still shares with Alex Salmond. While she seems confident of weathering the storm, her credibility has hardly been enhanced by the revisions she's made to her story along the way. For example, having told Holyrood she learned about the investigation into Alex Salmond directly from him, she now acknowledges that ""allegations of a sexual nature"" were mentioned at a meeting she had days earlier and claims to have forgotten. Exactly what did she know and when, what meetings were held and why, where does party business end and government business begin? These are the questions being picked over by a committee of MSPs at Holyrood. The inescapable point is that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon cannot both be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as they are obliged to do under oath before the committee. What started three years ago with complaints about the former first minister's behaviour has led to intense scrutiny of Nicola Sturgeon's conduct in handling those complaints. If Alex Salmond can prove his allegations, a clamour for her resignation will follow - ironically at a time when her party and its goal of independence are polling strongly. If his claims are not proven, he is unlikely to give up the fight. Some of his supporters have called for him to be readmitted to the SNP. Others hope that he will stand in this May's Holyrood election for one of the newly formed independence parties. While those who know him well think that unlikely, they note he has not publicly ruled it out. As one MP put it ""you just never know what Alex is going to do next"".

"MPs have launched an investigation into the safety of smart motorways, after a coroner said they created an ""ongoing risk"" of death. In 2019, 14 people reportedly died on the roads - on which hard shoulders can become driving lanes at peak congestion times, or on a permanent basis. The Transport Committee is looking at whether they should go altogether or need better safety measures. The government promised to assist ""this important inquiry"". 'Abandon smart motorways', says PCC Coroner calls for smart motorway review over deaths What to do if you break down on a smart motorway Smart motorways, which use technology to maintain the flow of traffic and give information on overhead displays, have existed in England since 2002. The all-lane-running version - which involves opening the hard shoulder permanently to drivers - began in 2014. Another version uses a ""dynamic hard shoulder"", which opens and closes to traffic, depending on congestion. The AA and RAC have raised concerns that vehicles that break down on these sections of road face greater dangers than before. And, in January, Sheffield coroner David Urpeth said they presented ""an ongoing risk of future deaths"", after two men died when a lorry driver ploughed into their vehicles while they were stationary on the M1 in South Yorkshire. Launching the Transport Committee investigation, chairman Huw Merriman said: ""The Department for Transport says smart motorways help us cope with a 23% rise in traffic since 2000, helping congestion."" The Conservative MP added that the department's own ""stocktake"" found ""lower fatal casualty rates for smart motorways without a permanent hard shoulder than on motorways with a hard shoulder"". ""This message isn't reaching the public, whose confidence in smart motorways has been dented by increasing fatalities on these roads,"" Mr Merriman continued. The committee will look at whether the government needs a ""rethink"" on smart motorways in general, whether ""enhanced"" safety measures are needed, or whether an ""awareness campaign"" is needed to help drivers use them better. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has published an 18-point action plan to improve motorway safety, including extending stopped vehicle-detection systems to all stretches of smart motorways. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said Mr Shapps had ""expressed his concerns"" over safety and committed Â£500m to improvements. ""We welcome this important inquiry from the Transport Committee and we will provide written evidence to help it in its work,"" she added. For Labour, shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""Dozens of people have lost their lives on smart motorways, so this investigation is welcome.""

"Villagers have been celebrating getting closer to reopening their beloved local pub Villagers are raising a glass after securing Â£350,000 of pledges to buy their local pub in under a week. Ty'n Llan, in Llandwrog, Gwynedd, closed more than three years ago. Residents say it's vital the village has a community hub. Scheme volunteer Grant Peisley said: ""It's the only place we've got where people can come together to enjoy some time together and be a real community."" He said he wasn't surprised by the enthusiastic reaction from neighbours. ""People feel so strongly about Ty'n Llan,"" he said. ""It's so important for us here in the community."" Beer and pub leaders plead for reopening date after sales halve in 2020 Brains to close more than 100 pubs due to Wales' alcohol rules Alcohol ban for pubs 'an insult' to industry The next step is for the campaign to turn the pledges into loans, then people can invest in the scheme by buying community shares. A total of Â£350,000 has been secured in pledges to save Ty'n Llan, in Llandwrog, Gwynedd The volunteers hope to be in a position to buy the pub within the next few months. The 200-year-old building could be used as village shop, cafÃ©, and community centre as well, Mr Peisley  said. Huw Jones, who was part of the group that started the campaign, said: ""One thing that has happened because of Covid, people have been feeling the lack of a meeting place even more than usual. ""We haven't got a village hall, we haven't got a village shop, the pub had been closed for three years, so there was a real sense of 'where will we get together when this is all over?'. ""It's the local village itself that wants this."" Mr Jones emphasised that ""other services will be provided"" in the pub and villagers had many ideas for what these would be. ""The questionnaire was returned by more than 200 people with lots of ideas about what should be provided there, so we're all looking forward to an exciting time ahead,"" he said. Carol Lewis, who was also behind the campaign, said: ""We had an amazing response, to tell the truth. ""This just shows that people feel strongly that we should be investing in Ty'n Llan as a community.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: On patrol with an indigenous leader trying to protect the Amazon from land grabbers Parts of Brazil's Amazon rainforest are being illegally sold on Facebook, the BBC has discovered. The protected areas include national forests and land reserved for indigenous peoples. Some of the plots listed via Facebook's classified ads service are as large as 1,000 football pitches. Facebook said it was ""ready to work with local authorities"", but indicated it would not take independent action of its own to halt the trade. ""Our commerce policies require buyers and sellers to comply with laws and regulations,"" the Californian tech firm added. The Amazon has been described as being the lungs of the Earth - and it is being destroyed The leader of one of the indigenous communities affected has urged the tech firm to do more. And campaigners have claimed the country's government is unwilling to halt the sales. ""The land invaders feel very empowered to the point that they are not ashamed of going on Facebook to make illegal land deals,"" said Ivaneide Bandeira, head of environmental NGO KanindÃ©. Anyone can find the illegally invaded plots by typing the Portuguese equivalents for search terms like ""forest"", ""native jungle"" and ""timber"" into Facebook Marketplace's search tool, and picking one of the Amazonian states as the location. Some of the listings feature satellite images and GPS co-ordinates. Cattle are often put to graze on land that is meant to be protected Many of the sellers openly admit they do not have a land title, the only document which proves ownership of land under Brazilian law. The illegal activity is being fuelled by Brazil's cattle ranching industry. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is at a 10-year high, and Facebook's Marketplace has become a go-to site for sellers like Fabricio GuimarÃ£es, who was filmed by a hidden camera. ""There's no risk of an inspection by state agents here,"" he said as he walked through a patch of rainforest he had burnt to the ground. Fabricio is using Facebook Marketplace to sell land he has grabbed from indigenous communities With the land illegally cleared and ready for farming, he had tripled his initial asking price to $35,000 (Â£25,000). Fabricio is not a farmer. He has steady middle-class job in a city, and views the rainforest as being an investment opportunity. The BBC later contacted Fabricio for his response to its investigation but he declined to comment. Many of the ads came from RondÃ´nia, the most deforested state in Brazil's rainforest region. The BBC arranged meetings between four sellers from the state and an undercover operative posing as a lawyer claiming to represent wealthy investors. One man, called Alvim Souza Alves, was trying to sell a plot inside the Uru Eu Wau Wau indigenous reserve for about Â£16,400 in local currency. It is the home to a community of more than 200 Uru Eu Wau Wau people. And at least five further groups that have had no contact with the outside world also live there, according to the Brazilian government. But at the meeting, Mr Alves claimed: ""There are no Indians [sic] there. From where my land is, they are 50km [31 miles] away. I am not going to tell you that at one time or another they are not walking around."" The Uru Eu Wau Wau people are trying to protect their land from invaders The BBC showed the Facebook ad to community leader BitatÃ© Uru Eu Wau Wau. He said the lot was in an area used by his community to hunt, fish and collect fruits. ""This is a lack of respect,"" he said. ""I don't know these people. I think their objective is to deforest the indigenous land, to deforest what is standing. To deforest our lives, you could say."" He said the authorities should intervene, and also urged Facebook - ""the most accessed social media platform"" - to take action of its own. Another factor driving the illegal land market is the expectation of amnesty. Mr Alves revealed he was working with others to lobby politicians to help them legally own stolen land. ""I'll tell you the truth: if this is not solved with [President] Bolsonaro there, it won't be solved anymore,"" he said of the current government. A common strategy is to deforest the land and then plead with politicians to abolish its protected status, on the basis it no longer serves its original purpose. The land grabbers can then officially buy the plots from the government, thereby legalising their claims. Alvim Souza Alves told a BBC undercover agent that he was selling indigenous land but did not show a legal land title Mr Alves took the BBC's undercover reporter to meet a man he described as the leader of the Curupira Association. Brazil's federal police have described the group as being an illegal land-grabbing operation focused on invading indigenous territory. The two men told the reporter that high-profile politicians were helping them set up meetings with government agencies in the capital BrasÃ­lia. They said their main ally was congressman Colonel ChrisÃ³stomo, a member of the Social Liberal Party, which Mr Bolsonaro used to be a member of until he founded his own party in 2019. When contacted by the BBC, Colonel ChrisÃ³stomo acknowledged having helped arrange meetings, but said he did not know the group was involved in land invasions. ""They didn't tell me,"" he said. ""If they invaded [the land], they don't have my support anymore."" When asked if he regretted setting up the meetings, he said: ""No."" The BBC contacted Mr Alves for his response but he declined to comment. The Amazon rainforest is home to one in 10 known species on Earth The BBC also approached Brazil's Minister of the Environment, Ricardo Salles. He said: ""President Jair Bolsonaro's government has always made it clear that his is a zero-tolerance government for any crime, including environmental ones."" The government has cut the inspections budget for Ibama, the federal agency that in charge of regulating deforestation, by 40%. But Mr Salles said the coronavirus pandemic had hampered law enforcement in the Amazon, and that state governments also bore responsibility for the deforestation. ""This year the government has created operation Verde Brasil 2, which seeks to control illegal deforestation, illegal fires, and to join efforts between the federal government and the states,"" he added. However Raphael Bevilaquia, a federal prosecutor based in RondÃ´nia, said the situation had worsened under the current government. ""The situation is really desperate,"" he said. ""The executive power is playing against us. It's disheartening."" For its part, Facebook claims trying to deduce which sales are illegal would be too complex a task for it to carry out itself, and should be left to the local judiciary and other authorities. And it does not appear to see the issue as being serious enough to warrant halting all Marketplace land sales across the Amazon. Ivaneide Bandeira, who has been trying to combat deforestation in the state of RondÃ´nia for 30 years, said she was losing hope. ""I think this is a very hard battle. It is really painful to see the forest being destroyed and shrinking more and more,"" she said. ""Never, in any other moment in history, has it been so hard to keep the forest standing.""

"Exports to Ireland are being blocked by extra paperwork and costs at customs, say CBI Wales Welsh exports to Ireland are being blocked by extra paperwork and costs at customs, says CBI Wales. Director Ian Price said the authorities in the Republic of Ireland were ""zealous"" when checking goods which was ""causing some delays."" He said documents had been rejected for being written in blue not black ink. Ireland's consul general in Wales insisted the Irish Government was ""focused"" on facilitating trade between the two countries. Mr Price called for ""consistency of approach"" when exporting to the EU. The republic is Wales' fourth biggest export market, behind Germany, France and the US and the fifth largest market for the UK. Brexit: Call to cut Welsh ports in a bid to boost trade Brexit: Stena Line 'committed to Wales' despite traffic drop Irish hauliers 'bypassing Welsh ports', say bosses Trade worth Â£20bn goes back and forth across the Irish Sea every week. But since 1 January, there has been a drop in UK-Ireland traffic at Holyhead and Pembroke Dock. CBI Wales' director Ian Price said documents had been rejected for being written in blue rather than black ink Mr Price said it's difficult to tell whether this was down to companies ""biding their time"" because they foresaw problems or if it is ""a genuine change in the way people are moving their goods."" ""There's no denying costs of freight have increased quite largely and it's hard to judge at the moment, whether this is a temporary glitch, or whether this is something that is with us for good,"" he explained. ""Quite clearly there's a lot more administration involved now we're moving goods from ourselves into mainland Europe and as a consequence, it requires more people, requires more time or documentation and that in itself creates a cost."" This was ""a burden"" being absorbed by UK businesses, he said. Ireland's consul general in Wales, Denise Hanrahan said the Brexit changes were a ""steep learning curve"" Ireland's consul general in Wales, Denise Hanrahan said: ""Ireland and Wales are so closely tied, our shared Irish sea border is one of the vital links between us. ""The UK has left the EU customs union, has left the single market, and that inevitably requires then systems to be put in place to manage the customs, the health aspects, the animal safety aspects. ""All of those normal aspects of trading."" Ms Hanrahan said it was a ""steep learning curve."" The Irish Government was supporting businesses ""to learn as much as possible as to how they can best interact with those systems."" Josh Burbidge, managing director of 150-year-old family firm Archwood Group, says the Irish market is ""significant"". It is worth more than Â£600,000 in annual revenue to the business, based in Chirk, Wrexham, he said. Archwood's Josh Burbidge said his firm won't be able to absorb extra costs in the long term ""We made the conscious decision to stop exporting anything to Ireland for two weeks at the start of January to help with the paperwork, and ensure that we had everything sorted in terms of all of the regulation,"" he explained. Deliveries have recently been delayed by six weeks and while currently absorbing extra costs, the firm cannot do so forever. ""Every pallet we send in as an extra Â£65, and every consignment or individual parcel is Â£6.50,"" he said. ""We're not in a high margin business. Therefore, we won't be able to continue absorbing those costs on the longer term."" Wrexham Lager sales manager Joss Roberts, said Brexit complications were having a ""major impact"", despite the majority of business comes from the UK. ""Prices are becoming unrealistic,"" said Mr Roberts. ""We've had to cancel three Irish orders this morning because the end receiver is expected to pay â¬11.50 per crate, that's on top of an admin courier fee. ""It's gone up around Â£17 alone to the Republic of Ireland where as to the likes of Spain it's gone up over â¬60 a crate."" Wrexham Lager will ""have to work out a way"" said sales manager Joss Roberts He has written to customers to warn them of the extra fees. The business will ""have to work out a way."" He said: ""Do they ring us and pay the extra over the phone? Do we put an extra addition on our cost on the website? It's hassle that from December wasn't there.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: On patrol with an indigenous leader trying to protect the Amazon from land grabbers Parts of Brazil's Amazon rainforest are being illegally sold on Facebook, the BBC has discovered. The protected areas include national forests and land reserved for indigenous peoples. Some of the plots listed via Facebook's classified ads service are as large as 1,000 football pitches. Facebook said it was ""ready to work with local authorities"", but indicated it would not take independent action of its own to halt the trade. ""Our commerce policies require buyers and sellers to comply with laws and regulations,"" the Californian tech firm added. The Amazon has been described as being the lungs of the Earth - and it is being destroyed The leader of one of the indigenous communities affected has urged the tech firm to do more. And campaigners have claimed the country's government is unwilling to halt the sales. ""The land invaders feel very empowered to the point that they are not ashamed of going on Facebook to make illegal land deals,"" said Ivaneide Bandeira, head of environmental NGO KanindÃ©. Anyone can find the illegally invaded plots by typing the Portuguese equivalents for search terms like ""forest"", ""native jungle"" and ""timber"" into Facebook Marketplace's search tool, and picking one of the Amazonian states as the location. Some of the listings feature satellite images and GPS co-ordinates. Cattle are often put to graze on land that is meant to be protected Many of the sellers openly admit they do not have a land title, the only document which proves ownership of land under Brazilian law. The illegal activity is being fuelled by Brazil's cattle ranching industry. Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon is at a 10-year high, and Facebook's Marketplace has become a go-to site for sellers like Fabricio GuimarÃ£es, who was filmed by a hidden camera. ""There's no risk of an inspection by state agents here,"" he said as he walked through a patch of rainforest he had burnt to the ground. Fabricio is using Facebook Marketplace to sell land he has grabbed from indigenous communities With the land illegally cleared and ready for farming, he had tripled his initial asking price to $35,000 (Â£25,000). Fabricio is not a farmer. He has steady middle-class job in a city, and views the rainforest as being an investment opportunity. The BBC later contacted Fabricio for his response to its investigation but he declined to comment. Many of the ads came from RondÃ´nia, the most deforested state in Brazil's rainforest region. The BBC arranged meetings between four sellers from the state and an undercover operative posing as a lawyer claiming to represent wealthy investors. One man, called Alvim Souza Alves, was trying to sell a plot inside the Uru Eu Wau Wau indigenous reserve for about Â£16,400 in local currency. It is the home to a community of more than 200 Uru Eu Wau Wau people. And at least five further groups that have had no contact with the outside world also live there, according to the Brazilian government. But at the meeting, Mr Alves claimed: ""There are no Indians [sic] there. From where my land is, they are 50km [31 miles] away. I am not going to tell you that at one time or another they are not walking around."" The Uru Eu Wau Wau people are trying to protect their land from invaders The BBC showed the Facebook ad to community leader BitatÃ© Uru Eu Wau Wau. He said the lot was in an area used by his community to hunt, fish and collect fruits. ""This is a lack of respect,"" he said. ""I don't know these people. I think their objective is to deforest the indigenous land, to deforest what is standing. To deforest our lives, you could say."" He said the authorities should intervene, and also urged Facebook - ""the most accessed social media platform"" - to take action of its own. Another factor driving the illegal land market is the expectation of amnesty. Mr Alves revealed he was working with others to lobby politicians to help them legally own stolen land.

"MPs have launched an investigation into the safety of smart motorways, after a coroner said they created an ""ongoing risk"" of death. In 2019, 14 people reportedly died on the roads - on which hard shoulders can become driving lanes at peak congestion times, or on a permanent basis. The Transport Committee is looking at whether they should go altogether or need better safety measures. The government promised to assist ""this important inquiry"". 'Abandon smart motorways', says PCC Coroner calls for smart motorway review over deaths What to do if you break down on a smart motorway Smart motorways, which use technology to maintain the flow of traffic and give information on overhead displays, have existed in England since 2002. The all-lane-running version - which involves opening the hard shoulder permanently to drivers - began in 2014. Another version uses a ""dynamic hard shoulder"", which opens and closes to traffic, depending on congestion. The AA and RAC have raised concerns that vehicles that break down on these sections of road face greater dangers than before. And, in January, Sheffield coroner David Urpeth said they presented ""an ongoing risk of future deaths"", after two men died when a lorry driver ploughed into their vehicles while they were stationary on the M1 in South Yorkshire. Launching the Transport Committee investigation, chairman Huw Merriman said: ""The Department for Transport says smart motorways help us cope with a 23% rise in traffic since 2000, helping congestion."" The Conservative MP added that the department's own ""stocktake"" found ""lower fatal casualty rates for smart motorways without a permanent hard shoulder than on motorways with a hard shoulder"". ""This message isn't reaching the public, whose confidence in smart motorways has been dented by increasing fatalities on these roads,"" Mr Merriman continued. The committee will look at whether the government needs a ""rethink"" on smart motorways in general, whether ""enhanced"" safety measures are needed, or whether an ""awareness campaign"" is needed to help drivers use them better. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has published an 18-point action plan to improve motorway safety, including extending stopped vehicle-detection systems to all stretches of smart motorways. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said Mr Shapps had ""expressed his concerns"" over safety and committed Â£500m to improvements. ""We welcome this important inquiry from the Transport Committee and we will provide written evidence to help it in its work,"" she added. For Labour, shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""Dozens of people have lost their lives on smart motorways, so this investigation is welcome.""
