"China's economy is growing at its slowest pace since 1990s as it fights a trade war with the US If you were in any doubt that the US-China trade war is having an impact on Asia, look no further than Singapore's latest export figures. Singaporesaw exports fall,externalfor a second month in a row, this time by 17.3% in the month of June compared to a year ago. This dramatic fall comes as Singapore'sgrowth figures released last week,externalshowed a 3.4% decline in growth in comparison to the last quarter. So why should you care if Singapore is selling less of its stuff to the world than it used to? The city state is one of the most trade-dependent economies in the world, and is often seen as a global indicator for trade. Singapore's economy is slowing as exports slide Analysts are calling Singapore's data the ""canary in the coal mine"", a reference to a well-worn expression to indicate there is danger ahead. The phrase comes from when miners used to carry caged canaries into mine shafts, to let them know if it was dangerous. The canaries would die if there was even a hint of poisonous gas in the mines, providing a warning signal for the miners to get out. The worry among Asia-watchers is that Singapore's numbers are just a sign of more bad news to come from the rest of the region. There is increasing evidence to show that Asia's economies are being hit by the US-China trade war. ""Around the region it is a similar story,"" says Song Seng Wun, South East Asia economist for CIMB Private Bank. ""This trade war is coming at a time when global growth is slowing down after ten years of relatively stable times. Even if by some miracle a fairy taps her magic wand and the trade war disappears, all that would happen is that things would just be less bad - rather than really bad."" Firms look to new factories as tariffs bite How worrying is China's economic slowdown? Data from India, Indonesia and South Korea reads like a list of bad news. June was a particularly gloomy month for the three countries. India saw exports fall by 9.7%,external, the first time in nine months. Indonesia, which counts China as its biggest trading partner,also saw exports fall by 8.98%,externalin comparison with the same period last year.  And South Koreaalso saw exports fall by 13.5%,external. All of these countries sell products ranging from palm oil and chemicals to semiconductor chips to China. This week China posted the lowest quarterly growth it has seen in close to three decades, partly on trade war worries. US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods now cover more than half of what China sells to the US.  Which means that Chinese companies either have to cut their costs for their buyers, or sell less to the US. Indonesia, a key exporter of palm oil, saw exports fall in the first half of this year And that means the countries supplying Chinese factories with products are also getting hit. It doesn't look like it's going to get any better anytime soon. A report from the Japanese research house Nomura released this week on Asian exports shows that exports ""should remain in the doldrums in the coming month"". Nomura blames this on the ""lack of progress on US-China trade negotiations"", heightened global uncertainty weighing on corporate investment decisions and signs that trade protectionism is being used as a ""weapon of foreign policy"" around the region. It isn't entirely clear yet when or if the US-China trade war will come to a resolution - or whether this is the start of a ""broader shift in US policy away from free trade"", as think tank Capital Economics points out. Mr Trump has already indicated that Vietnam - which up to now has been a beneficiary of the US-China trade war - could be next on his tariff list, and economists say Taiwan and South Korea could also be next in line. US and China agreed to resume trade talks at G20 summit in Japan this year Asia is home to the world's next generation of companies and consumers. By 2050 it could see its share of the global economy grow to 52%,according to the Asian Development Bank,external- which means the region would also be the main driver of global growth. But analysts say if the US's anti-free trade trend continues and hits more of Asia's economies, that could hurt the region's long term potential growth rate - in turn hurting the rest of us.

"Tourists could face a ""shock"" this summer when they travel abroad according to foreign currency experts. Those that buy euros at the airport can expect to receive around 98 euro cents for their pound. Better rates can be found by buying in advance, with the Post Office offering â¬1.0819. But that's still a long way from the summer of 2015, when tourists were getting at least â¬1.32 for their pound. The big fall came in 2016 after the UK voted to leave the European Union. Tourist rates are based on trading levels on the international currency markets. On those marketsthe pound earlier hit $1.2382, the lowest level against the dollar in 27 months. That fall was attributed to rising fears that the UK will leave the European Union without a withdrawal agreement. The poundalso fell against the euro, hitting â¬1.1062, its lowest level for the year. ""It will be a big shock for tourists to Europe if they are expecting to get good value this year,"" said James Hickman, the chief commercial officer of travel money firm FairFX. He does not expect any recovery in the pound until the Brexit situation is resolved. ""All pointers are that we're in for a rocky road,"" he says. ""If people are waiting to buy at a better rate I don't think that's going to happen."" If there is a no-deal Brexit then he thinks the pound could go lower. He points out that some in the financial markets think it could hit parity against the dollar, meaning tourists would receive just $1 for each pound they exchange. At the moment the tourist rate for the pound against the dollar is $1.2127. That's down 5% on this time last year, according to the Post Office. How to get the most from your travel cash Analysis by Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Millions of us would have spent many hours hunched over a computer trying to find the perfect accommodation and flights for a summer getaway, Currency experts say holidaymakers should put the same amount of effort into organisingholiday money,external. That certainly means never waiting until you reach the airport to exchange money, as bureaux in the airport complex usually have the worst rates. Timing can be tricky - it is difficult to predict how the value of the pound will move, so one common suggestion is to change half of your holiday money weeks in advance of departure, and the rest just before, to hedge your bets. Ordering currency online in advance and then collecting the cash in person can also secure a better rate. Cash exchange is not the only option. Carrying a wad of notes can be dangerous and not always covered by travel insurance. The market for specialist pre-loaded currency cards is growing, and banks are competing on the rates and deals for overseas use that they offer to current account holders. So doing your homework on charges and shopping around is advisable. In general, using your regular debit card can be expensive, owing to the extra charges, and remember to let your bank know if you are going away to avoid being locked out by anti-fraud processes. If you do use a card on your holiday, shops, restaurants and cash machines will usually ask if you want to pay in pounds rather than the local currency. Always choose the latter. Tourists can lose up to 10% by paying in sterling rather than the domestic currency. However, if you haven't already booked your trip, then there are destinations where your pound will go further. The Post Office says it has seen a surge in sales of Turkish lira, which has been hit by political turmoil. Compared to last summer, the pound is up around 14% against the lira. Iceland is also better value than last year, the pound is up 12% against the Icelandic krona. The pound's fall: A tale of two cities The pound is also a little higher against the South African rand. The weak pound can also be more than compensated for by falls in local prices, the Post Office says. It tracks the prices of a range of items in European family destinations, including meals and drinks. It found that prices had fallen in half of the 15 locations, including the Algarve in Portugal. ""Picking a destination where prices on the ground are low can outweigh the impact of a weak exchange rate, but a destination where prices and cheap and sterling is strong is the best bet,"" said Nick Boden, head of Post Office Travel Money.

"Deaths from natural and semi-synthetic opioids like oxycodone fell by 14.5% Drug overdose deaths in the US have fallen for the first time since 1999, according to preliminary official data. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) figures showed a drop of 5.1% in 2018 from the year before. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said this was down to a decline in deaths linked to opioids. US efforts ""to curb opioid use disorder and addiction are working,"" he said in a statement,external, although he added the issue ""will not be solved overnight"". The US is in the midst of an opioid crisis, with hundreds of thousands thought to have died over the last few decades. Fatal drug overdose numbers rose every year from 1999 to 2017, including a sharp spike between 2014 and 2017. Experts partially blame the overprescription of powerful and addictive painkillers for the epidemic. What are opioids and what are the risks? Why opioids are such an American problem The teachers battling opioid overdose fears The CDC research,externalshows that an estimated 68,557 people died in 2018, down from 72,224 people in 2017. Deaths from natural and semi-synthetic opioids - painkillers like morphine, codeine and oxycodone - fell by 14.5%, the sharpest drop for any drug category. However, those linked to synthetic opioids like fentanyl still rose. Fentanyl is said to be up to 100 times stronger than morphine and has flooded the illegal US drugs market. The numbers of deaths attributed to cocaine and methamphetamine also rose in 2018. This video can not be played On America's trail of destruction ""Lives are being saved, and we're beginning to win the fight against this crisis,"" Mr Azar's statement said, praising efforts by the Trump administration and community efforts across the US for the shift.

""This crisis developed over two decades and it will not be solved overnight.""

"The Netflix hit Stranger Things has just begun a third series Netflix added fewer paid subscribers than expected in the last three months, with the streaming service blaming price rises. Shares in the company sank 10% after Netflix added 2.7 million new customers worldwide in the April-June period, well below expectations. ""Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases,"" it said. It comes as competition increases from rivals such as Walt Disney and Apple. The company, behind such hits at The Crown and Orange is the New Black, said in its statement: ""We don't believe competition was a factor since there wasn't a material change in the competitive landscape during [the second quarter] and competitive intensity and our penetration is varied across regions,"" the company said. The additional 2.7 million subscribers fell far short of analysts' estimates of about five million. ""While our US paid membership was essentially flat in Q2, we expect it to return to more typical growth in Q3, and are seeing that in these early weeks of Q3,"" Netflix said. However, that failed to calm investors, who in after-hours trading on Wall Street bailed out of a stock that had risen by almost 35% so far this year. 'Crucial months' Netflix will be losing some of its hit shows such as Friends to rival platforms being launched in the coming months, but argued that it will make up for that with original content. ""Much of our domestic, and eventually global, Disney catalogue, as well as Friends, The Office, and some other licensed content will wind down over the coming years, freeing up budget for more original content,""the company said in its statement.,external ""From what we've seen in the past when we drop strong catalogue content... our members shift over to enjoying our other great content."" Net income fell to $270m in the second quarter ending 30 June, from $384m a year earlier. Total revenue rose to $4.92bn from $3.91bn. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Netflix could face tougher challenges as competition from rival streaming services intensifies. ""The performance in the next two quarters will be crucial. Fending off the likes of Disney and Apple with one hand while scooping in new customers with the other is a big ask,"" he said.

"Cairney and Jones spent 20 years pretending that Ms Fleming was still alive Two carers who murdered a vulnerable teenager whose body has never been found have each been ordered to spend a minimum of 14 years in prison. Edward Cairney, 77, and Avril Jones, 59, killed Margaret Fleming, 19, between December 1999 and January 2000. Jones then continued to claim Â£182,000 in benefits until it finally emerged Margaret was missing in October 2016. At the High Court in Glasgow Lord Matthews told Cairney he must serve at least 14 years. Jones' minimum life tariff was also set at 14 years. The teenager who was forgotten for 17 years The day I interviewed Margaret's killers She was also found guilty of benefit fraud as Margaret's money was paid directly into her account. Lord Matthewstold them,external: ""Only you two know the truth. Only you know where her remains are."" Margaret Fleming was last seen when she was 19 The judge said it was obvious the motive for the murder and the cover-up was financial. He added: ""Margaret Fleming was a vulnerable young woman with evident difficulties. She was in your care and you breached the trust placed in you. ""The manner in which you described her when you spoke about her was cruel and the fantastic web of deceit you spun was callous and calculating."" Thomas Ross QC, for Cairney, said his client uses a wheelchair and had his colon removed a few years ago after he contracted an infection. He also suffers from hip damage and the after effects of breaking three vertebrate. Mr Ross said: ""Mr Cairney continues to deny any involvement in the crime and, so far as he is concerned, he maintains that, to his knowledge, Margaret is still alive."" Iain Duguid QC, for Jones, said his client was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, a condition which affects the nervous system, in 1994. The court heard the case has left Jones, a former legal secretary and greenkeeper, ""isolated"" from her friends and family. The QC said his client also maintains her innocence and that, as recent as their last contact in October 2017, Margaret was still alive. How do you solve a murder without a body? Despite a painstaking search of their dilapidated property in Inverkip on the Clyde coast, and its garden, no trace of Margaret has ever been found. Testimony from Avril's brother, Richard Jones, was used to pinpoint the last independent sighting of the teenager on 17 December, 1999. Three weeks later, on 5 January, 2000, Avril told her mother, Florence Jones, Margaret had run off with a traveller. The couple, who had no previous convictions, then embarked on a cover up which involved bogus letters and erasing all trace of Margaret from the cottage where she had lived for around two years. This video can not be played Edward Cairney and Avril Jones spoke to the BBC in 2017 about Margaret Fleming's disappearance The catalyst for the teenager moving in with the couple was the death of her father in 1995. Cairney, who was his friend, offered to help and took advantage of Margaret's strained relationship with her mother. All ties between the pair were severed in November 1997 when Cairney assaulted Margaret Cruickshanks after she arrived at Seacroft to see her daughter. Thereafter the couple took control of the teenager's life and subjected her to what police described as a ""living hell"". 'Someone should have been looking out for her' Police confront the killer of missing woman Police and prosecutors narrowed the timeframe of the murder to a three-week period around the turn of the millennium. The trial heard that a benefits investigator attempted to visit Ms Fleming in June 2012 but was told by Jones that she would not see her. The investigator said a duty social worker should have visited the ""totally chaotic"" property to follow up on the young woman's welfare, but no-one did. This video can not be played Lord Matthews said the pair spun a ""web of deceit"" that was callous and calculating When police were finally alerted four years later it was as a result of an application for Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - which had been filled out by Jones. In it she wrote that Ms Fleming ""needs constant care"", had self-harmed and was ""caught eating out of a dog bowl"". A social worker phoned Jones to offer help and was told Ms Fleming had not been to the doctor, despite picking a hole in her head. Police Scotland subsequently launched a missing persons' investigation in October 2016. When justice eventually caught up with the couple a year later they maintained Margaret was still alive and often returned to visit them. This video can not be played Det Supt Paul Livingstone: ""If you have any decency left tell us where the body is."" Cairney even gave evidence in his defence, during which he was warned by the judge for insulting prosecutor Iain McSporran QC. But an exhaustive investigation failed to find any trace of the teenager and the jury took just three hours to find the pair guilty. Det Supt Paul Livingstone, the officer who led the investigation, said: ""Margaret was a very vulnerable young woman when she was abused, neglected, manipulated and murdered by these two greedy, evil individuals. ""Margaret's family and friends will never know just what happened to her and they have been denied the right to pay their final respects to her at her funeral. ""I would say to Cairney and Jones - if you have a scrap of decency you will give the answers to the questions that Margaret's family deserve. ""I am willing to meet either of them so that they can tell me in order to provide some kind of comfort to her family and allow them to put her to rest finally.""

"This video can not be played Michel Barnier says Theresa May and her ministers never threatened to leave without a deal during negotiations The UK will have to ""face the consequences"" if it opts to leave without a deal, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said. Michel Barnier told BBC Panorama the thrice-rejected agreement negotiated by Theresa May was the ""only way to leave the EU in an orderly manner"". He also insisted Mrs May and her ministers ""never"" told him during Brexit talks she might opt for no deal. Publicly, Mrs May has always insisted no deal is better than a bad deal. Meanwhile, the Office for Budget Responsibilityhas said the UK will fall into recession next yearif there is a no-deal Brexit. The fiscal watchdog said economic growth would fall by 2% by the end of 2020 if it left the bloc without an agreement. In his first UK broadcast interview - conducted in May before the start of the Conservative leadership contest - Mr Barnier was asked what would happen if the UK ""just tore up the membership card"" for the EU. ""The UK will have to face the consequences,"" he replied. Asked whether the UK had ever genuinely threatened to leave in such a way with no deal, Mr Barnier said: ""I think that the UK side, which is well informed and competent and knows the way we work on the EU side, knew from the very beginning that we've never been impressed by such a threat. ""It's not useful to use it."" Panorama: Britain's Brexit Crisis will be broadcast on Thursday at 21:00 BST. Conservative Party leadership contender Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the fact the EU ""never believed that no deal was a credible threat"" was ""one of our mistakes in the last two years"". He said while there will be economic consequences to no deal, ""we are much better prepared for no deal than we were before"". He said the issue of the Northern Ireland border could be solved with ""existing technology"" and the controversial Irish backstop, which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, ""isn't going to happen"". Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, a key figure in Boris Johnson's leadership campaign, accused Mr Barnier of trying to ""threaten"" the UK. He said Mr Barnier's remarks were an indictment of Britain's negotiating strategy and showed ""how useless"" Mrs May's approach had been. Leadership frontrunner Mr Johnson was asked for an interview by Panorama, but he declined. Elsewhere in the programme, Mrs May's de facto deputy David Lidington revealed that a senior EU official made a secret offer to the UK to put Brexit on hold for five years and negotiate a ""new deal for Europe"". Mr Lidington said the offer was passed on in 2018 by Martin Selmayr, a senior aide to EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. ""Martin sort of said, 'Look, why don't we have a deal whereby we just put all this on ice for five years?' ""Let's see how things go, let's get the UK involved with France and Germany, let's see how the dust settles and let's talk about whether we can come to a new deal for Europe.'"" 10 things that stopped Brexit happening 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? No-deal Brexit 'threat to UK research' In his own interview for the programme - also recorded in May - Mr Selmayr said he was ""very certain"" the UK was not ready to leave without a deal before the original Brexit deadline in March this year. ""We have seen what has been prepared on our side of the border for a hard Brexit. We don't see the same level of preparation on the other side of the border,"" he added. This video can not be played Timmermans: ""It's like Lance Corporal Jones: 'Don't panic, don't panic'... running around like idiots"" In another interview for the programme, the EU Commission's First Vice-President, Frans Timmermans, said UK ministers were ""running around like idiots"" when they arrived to negotiate Brexit in 2017. Mr Timmermans said while he expected a ""Harry Potter-like book of tricks"" from ministers, instead they were like a character from from Dad's Army. In an interview in March 2019 with the BBC's Nick Robinson, Mr Timmermans said he found it ""shocking"" how unprepared the UK team was when it began negotiations. ""We thought they are so brilliant,"" he said. ""That in some vault somewhere in Westminster there will be a Harry Potter-like book with all the tricks and all the things in it to do."" But after seeing the then-Brexit Secretary David Davis - who resigned over his disagreements with the deal - speaking in public, his mind changed. ""I saw him not coming, not negotiating, grandstanding elsewhere [and] I thought, 'Oh my God, they haven't got a plan, they haven't got a plan.' ""That was really shocking, frankly, because the damage if you don't have a plan... ""Time's running out and you don't have a plan. It's like Lance Corporal Jones, you know, 'Don't panic, don't panic!' Running around like idiots."" Mr Timmermans - interviewed two months before Mrs May announced her resignation - also criticised Boris Johnson's approach to Brexit negotiations from when they began. ""Perhaps I am being a bit harsh, but it is about time we became a bit harsh. I am not sure he was being genuine,"" he said. ""I have always had the impression he is playing games."" Negotiations between the UK and EU began in 2017 after Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the Article 50 process to leave the bloc. At the end of 2018, a withdrawal agreement was settled between the two sides and EU officials said the matter was closed. But MPs voted against the plan three times, which led to a number of delays to the exit date - now set for 31 October. Is the EU really united over Brexit?

"Attempts to tackle the disease have included screening of people entering other countries from the DRC The World Health Organization has declared the Ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo a ""public health emergency of international concern"". The move may encourage wealthy donor countries to provide more cash. But the WHO stopped short of saying borders should be closed, saying the risk of the disease spreading outside the region was not high. The outbreak in DR Congo has killed more than 1,600 people. This week, the first case was detected in Goma, home to more than a million. The PHEIC emergency provision is the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound and has only been used four times previously. This includes the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016, and killed more than 11,000 people. ""It is time for the world to take notice,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday at which the emergency was declared.

The outbreak, the second largest in history, started in August 2018 and is affecting two provinces in DR Congo - North Kivu and Ituri. More than 2,500 people have been infected and two-thirds of them have died. It took 224 days for the number of cases to reach 1,000, but just a further 71 days to reach 2,000. About 12 new cases are being reported every day. Yes. It is 99% effective and more than 161,000 people have been given it. However, everybody is not vaccinated - only those who come into direct contact with an Ebola patient, and people who come into contact with them.

Since January, there have been 198 attacks against healthcare workers or Ebola treatment facilities leading to seven deaths and 58 injuries. Another major problem has beendistrust of healthcare workersleading to about a third of deaths being in the community rather than at a specialist Ebola treatment centre.

"Street Valium is also known as Street Blues Scotland's latest drug death figures are to be published on Friday - with the country expected to still have the highest rate in Europe. Public health minister Joe FitzPatrick lost his job after figures released last year showed that 1,264 people died in 2019, which was even worse than the year before. In January, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced Â£250m in extra funding over five years to tackle the rising number of fatalities after admitting that her government should have done more. But almost three years after the deaths were declared a public health emergency, what can be done to tackle the problem? Opposition parties have accused the Scottish government of cutting rehab programmes in previous years, which they say has had a big part to play in the recent upward trend in the number of deaths. There are currently 408 rehab beds in Scotland, with the Scottish government pledging to spend Â£20m a year for the next five years to increase that number across the country. Castle Craig rehab clinic, aprivate hospital,externalnear West Linton in the Scottish Borders, has treated people for alcohol and drug addiction for 30 years. Of its current patient list of 60, only two are NHS-funded. Around a quarter of its clients are Dutch - reflecting the value placed on its services by insurers in the Netherlands - with the remainder being privately funded or via health insurance. The facility's medical director, Prof Jonathan Chick, said the proportion of Scottish patients - particularly those funded by the Scottish NHS - has fallen in recent years. The weekly cost of treatment at the clinic ranges starts from Â£2,500, which Prof Chick said was out of the reach of most families - but not out of the reach of health services. Castle Craig currently has 60 patients but only two are funded by the NHS He told BBC Scotland: ""They are providing quite expensive treatments for years and years and not looking at other opportunities."" Several frontline charities and critics of the Scottish government's approach to tackling the crisis have backed the Scottish Conservatives'Right to Recovery Bill,external. The Tories say it will enshrine in law individuals' right to their chosen drug treatment, including residential rehabilitation services, which the party says would help get people off drugs and recover rather than simply managing their addictions. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""This proposal has the backing of frontline groups and experts across the political spectrum. SNP MSPs are reportedly on board privately. We only need the government to wake up, stop stalling and support it."" Drugs minister Angela Constance said the government was working hard to get more people into treatment that works for them as quickly as possible. She added: ""Without treatment, there is little hope of recovery so we are funding as many community and third-sector initiatives as we can so that individuals have the widest possible choice and can opt for the support which suits them and their family."" Naloxone can reverse the effects of an opiate overdose if used in time The Scottish government set up a drugs deaths taskforce in response to the crisis, which met for the first time in September 2019. It has spent time gathering evidence and proposing changes that it says could quickly save lives. The main focus of this has been the distribution of Naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opiate-related overdose. Users often die because they are unable to breathe and, if used in time, Naloxone can restore breathing and save their lives. Drug campaigners have been trying to get the kits into the hands of anyone who might have or be a witness to a drug overdose. This is mainly drug users and relatives but could also be anyone involved in services such as hostels or outreach workers. Almost two-thirds of ambulance crews - who have been using Naloxone for many years - are now also able to distribute it to people who might need it, with the remainder due to be trained by the end of this year. Police Scotland has also run a pilot projectfor its officers to carry Naloxone while on patrol. The most significant harm reduction services are methadone and buprenorphine which are offered to heroin addicts to reduce the risk of fatal overdose. Methadone is controversial because it has been implicated in more drug-related deaths than heroin, the drug it is a substitute for. Experts point out that methadone is recognised by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine but say it is not always delivered effectively. David Liddell, of the Scottish Drugs Forum, said there was a ""massive issue"" around people on too low doses. ""We estimated around half of those on methadone are on too low a dose, so what is happening for individuals is they are then forced to top-up on street drugs,"" he said. ""That's fuelling the poly-drug use problem that we have and leading to deaths as a result."" He also said there were problems around access to methadone services and retention of drug users within treatment. He said some countries such as Norway had a policy of ""no unplanned discharges"" and they would actively seek to bring people back into treatment. Earlier this month, it was announced that Buvidal - an alternative to methadone that contains buprenorphine - wouldbe rolled outacross the country after a successful trial in prisons. It allows patients to receive an injection every 28 days instead of having to visit a chemist every day to take their medication. It is hoped this will allow patients to focus on improving their lives and overall health rather than managing their dependence. Scotland's new drug tsar has called for a public health approach All the experts who gave evidence to Westminster's Scottish affairs committee said the stigma around drug addiction was stopping people seeking treatment. Prof Matheson said the people who needed help were the ""most marginalised in Scottish society"". She said they were not willing, interested or engaged with services because they were stigmatised and did not want to come forward. Prof Matheson said only about 40% of people who needed treatment were getting it. She said: ""They don't want to go to their GP if they have health problems, they feel stigmatised if they have a criminal record and they are stigmatised about getting work. ""This is keeping people excluded from the help and the care they need."" Prof Matheson said that, as a result, older drug users - who have a range of respiratory, cardiac, liver and kidney issues - were not seeking treatment and were physically more vulnerable to an overdose. Denmark is among the countries to have introduced fix rooms It is now more than four years since Glasgow City Council first proposed allowing users to take their own drugs under the supervision of medical staff at a special facility in the city. The idea is to encourage users who inject heroin or cocaine on Glasgow's streets to enter a safe and clean environment. It is hoped the special room would encourage addicts into treatment, cut down on heroin needles on city streets and counter the spread of diseases such as HIV. The so-called ""fix rooms"" are already operating in some overseas countries but this would be the first of its kind in the UK. They have the support of the Scottish government but drug laws are reserved to Westminster. The House of Commons committee that investigated Scotland's drug crisisrecommended new legislation to provide for safe drug consumption facilitiesbut it was rejected in the UK government's response to its report. The UK government said: ""We want to do all we can to stop people having access to drugs that could ultimately kill them. No illegal drug-taking can be assumed to be safe and there is no safe way to take them."" Glasgow announced Scotland's first scheme giving drug addicts diamorphine, a pharmaceutical-grade form of heroin, in November 2019. The Enhanced Drug Treatment Service (EDTS) aims to use the medically-licensed drug to treat patients with the most severe, long-standing and complex addictions.Six ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis They will have to attend the clinic, which has been licensed by the Home Office, twice a day, every day. It is hoped the facility will help reduce street drug use, overdose deaths and the spread of HIV in the city. The Daily Record is campaigning for decriminalisation of drug use The Daily Record newspaper launched a campaign two years agocalling for the decriminalisation of drug use.,external It said Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Canada and, most notably, Portugal were among 25 nations to loosen the punitive attitude to drug possession to enable treatment programmes to succeed. The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (RCPE) has alsorecently calledfor the Scottish and UK governments to seriously consider decriminalising drug possession. Changing the law to ""decriminalise"" does not mean class A drugs would be legal, but people would not be prosecuted for possession for personal use. All UK drugs misuse legislation is currently reserved to Westminster. The 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act bans the possession, supply, manufacture, import and export of controlled drugs except by licence. A cross-party Westminster committee - chaired by SNP MP Pete Wishart but including four Conservative MPs, three Labour members, two Lib Dems and two other SNP MPs - found that decriminalisation was a ""public health"" approach that could cut the stigma around problem drug use and encourage people to seek treatment. Schemes elsewhere channel drug addicts committing low level crimes into treatment instead of jail. Police Scotland's Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson called for radical reform, saying politicians should have the ""confidence and courage"" to decriminalise. He said the criminal justice process was actually pushing people into a place where there was more harm. The woman leading the Scottish government's drugs taskforce, Prof Catriona Matheson, told BBC Scotland the evidence for decriminalisation was strong. She said: ""It is about not putting these marginalised drug users into prison because that further marginalises them and that makes the recovery all the more difficult."" The UK government later rejected the report's recommendation to reform the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act and decriminalise drugs for personal use. It said decriminalisation would not ""eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence"". It added: ""There is a strong link between drugs and crime, which is why we reject the assertion that the Department for Health and Social Care should lead on drug misuse. We know that people who regularly use heroin, cocaine or crack cocaine are estimated to commit around 45% of all acquisitive crime."" The Scottish Greens have called for both the UK and Scottish governments to admit that the so-called ""war on drugs"" has failed, and to instead focus on ""restoring people's dignity and treating their addiction, rather than criminalising them"".

"Jane Langford had been in a relationship with Air Commodore Christopher Green for 15 years A woman has won the right to her late partner's military pension in a landmark ruling for unmarried couples. Air Commodore Christopher Green had been in a relationship with Jane Langford, 72, for 15 years when he died unexpectedly in 2011. The RAF pension scheme allows unmarried partners of officers to receive their pension if they die. But Ms Langford was disqualified because she had not formally dissolved her marriage to her husband. On Wednesday the Court of Appeal unanimously held that this rule breached Ms Langford's human rights, in a move that is likely to have far-reaching consequences for other unmarried couples in the public sector. The rule - which was held to be unlawful in Ms Langford's case - is found in most public sector schemes, including education, the police, fire service, NHS and civil service. Anyone who has been refused a surviving partner's pension because they had not divorced an ex-partner may now be able to bring a claim, including for back payments. Lord Justice McCombe said the RAF's ""broad exclusionary rule"" barring married partners from receiving such compensation was ""a sledgehammer to crack a nut"". The judge ruled that the discrimination in the rule was ""unlawful and cannot be justified or proportionate in Ms Langford's case"". Sonia Bamford from Candey Solicitors, which represented Ms Langford, said the ruling was ""a gateway to justice"" for others who had been denied pension rights following the death of a partner. Military wives 'missing out' on pensions Widows' call for military pensions Air Cdre Green was a serving officer in the RAF when he died suddenly from a heart attack. Ms Langford, who lives near Reading in Berkshire, was shocked when she was told she would not be eligible for his pension. She had been estranged from her husband for 17 years. She said she struggled to pay her mortgage and was forced to rent out part of her home while she fought for eight years for the right to Mr Green's pension. ""I can't take it in,"" Ms Langford told the BBC following the judgement. ""I can't believe it's over and the worry I've had for the last eight years is gone. ""There hasn't been much spare money. Now I can have a holiday, I can have my friends and children to stay, I can buy Christmas presents for my children."" ""I'm so pleased if it can benefit others in a similar situation,"" she added. ""I wouldn't like to see anybody treated the way I was treated."" The judge accepted it was a ""legitimate aim"" of the RAF pension scheme ""to achieve parity of treatment between married and unmarried partners of scheme members"". ""But such parity is in reality achieved not by imposing restrictions based on a partner's marital status, but by requiring the demonstration of a substantial, exclusive and financially dependent relationship in practice,"" he said. Ms Langford previously claimed entitlement to an armed forces pension, but her claim was dismissed by the High Court in 2015.

The company that owns these shops says all cotton, linen and polyester they sell will be organic, sustainable or recycled. Zara has 64 UK stores, and its parent company has 7,490 shops worldwide. Reacting to the news, Friends of the Earth told Radio 1 Newsbeat it would be ""better for everyone if the industry sold clothes made to last."" Over the past few years, a lot of what we buy has been criticised for being fast fashion - clothes we barely use. From next year, containers will appear in Zara stores to collect your old clothes so they can be reused or recycled into new items.

"Cross-channel ferry companies have warned of gridlock around British ports, as they confirm they will not allow trucks to board ferries bound for France after a no-deal Brexit, unless they have the right paperwork. ""We cannot take lorries across that cannot enter the country,"" one ferry company told BBC Newsnight. Many UK exporters are yet to obtain the proper documentation. The Department for Transport said plans were in place to manage disruption. Newsnight has spoken to sources at the main freight ferry companies operating in the channel. ""If a truck doesn't have the right document we cannot board him. We cannot take lorries across that cannot enter the country,"" said Gert Jakobson, a spokesman for DFDS, which transports 1.2 million trucks between Dover and Calais and Dunkirk each year. That was corroborated by a source at a different ferry company, which did not want to comment publicly. ""There's no point in boarding vehicles, because at the other end our French colleagues have told us we won't be allowed to proceed,"" the source said. Both companies said the result of this procedure, given many trucks are expected to turn up without the right documentation, was likely to be tailbacks of trucks on the UK side of the channel. UK firms 'not even close to ready' for no deal No-deal Brexit: What you need to know ""For a period of time, for a few weeks and months, we assume the problems will be bigger. There will be more who are not yet accustomed to the paperwork. There will be a learning curve and then we believe it will work much better,"" said Mr Jakobsen. ""If you have a constant stream of lorries that don't have the right documentation and it may take anything from 24-48 hours to get that documentation, potentially you've got a whole bundle of trucks and nowhere for them to go,"" said the other source. Jean Marc Puissessau, the president and chief executive of Port Boulogne Calais, also told Newsnight that the French side expects ferry companies to deny boarding in the UK to trucks without the right paperwork. ""If hauliers don't have documents they won't be allowed to board. This was the rule on 29 March. Those same rules will apply on 31 October,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: ""There are well-developed plans in place to manage any traffic disruption in Kent in the event of a no deal scenario, keeping the M20 open with traffic continuing to flow in both directions. ""The government remains focused on ensuring the UK's smooth and orderly withdrawal from the EU."" Each day, around 10,000 lorries pass through the port of Dover Both French and UK port officials have previously sought to downplay concerns about traffic chaos in the wake of a no-deal Brexit. In June, the Dover Harbour Board CEO Doug Bannister said ""the Port of Dover, as with our sister ports in France and our ferry partners, are prepared for the 31st of October."" And his Calais counterpart Mr Puissesseau, had pointed to the construction of new customs facilities and vehicle holding pens at the French port, saying ""there will be no delay"" on the French side. But research by Imperial College London,commissioned by the BBC, suggested just two minutes of extra check times at UK borders could result in queues extending up to 30 miles from Dover into Kent. And Newsnight revealed that as of June 2019,two thirds of the relevant UK firms had still not appliedfor an Economic Operator Registration and Identification (EORI) number, which they would need to trade with the EU after a no-deal Brexit. Earlier this week, Chancellor Philip Hammond raised concerns that France could effectively push problems to the UK side of the channel. ""Many of the levers are held by others â the EU 27 or private business. We can seek to persuade them but we can't control it. For example, we can make sure that goods flow inwards through the port of Dover without any friction but we can't control the outward flow into the port of Calais,"" thechancellor told Panorama. Each day, around 10,000 lorries pass through the port of Dover, which handles 17% of the UK's goods trade, worth more than Â£120bn.

"Simon Brown was killed on the Gatwick Express in August 2016 A rail firm has been fined Â£1m after a man died leaning out of a train window. Simon Brown, 24, was killed when he hit his head on a steel gantry on the side of the track while on the Gatwick Express in London in August 2016. In May, Govia Thameslink Railway admitted a health and safety breach because a sign saying not to lean out was not displayed clearly enough. The rail regulator has written to firms demanding ""immediate action"" over trains with these types of windows. Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC, at Southwark Crown Court, said while there was a warning sticker on the door, it was ""jumbled"" around other notices. ""The signage around the window was confusing,"" he said, adding no risk assessment of the windows had been carried out. Judge Pegden said there was also no-one on the train to monitor the use of the window at the time. ""This was a tragic corporate blind spot in what is otherwise a well-run organisation,"" Judge Pegden said. The Office of Rail and Road said there were about 1,500 of the ""droplight"" windows - which allow passengers to reach through to open doors from the outside once the train has stopped at a station - in circulation on the rail network. Director of safety Ian Prosser, who is also HM Chief Inspector of Railways, said he had written ""to operators instructing them to take immediate action to prevent a similar tragedy happening again"". The only warning sign to not lean out of the window is in yellow on the left The accident happened on 7 August 2016 at Wandsworth Common station as the Class 442 train was travelling to London Victoria from Gatwick Airport. The train was travelling at 61mph when Mr Brown suffered the fatal injuries. Mr Brown, from East Grinstead, West Sussex, had been previously described by friends as a life-long railway fanatic who was working in the rail industry. He first volunteered on the Bluebell steam railway in Sussex aged nine and was working as an engineering technician with Hitachi Rail Europe in Bristol. The train stopped at Wandsworth Common station where paramedics tried to save Simon Brown The regulator said ""droplight"" windows were mostly confined to old InterCity trains and ""charter"" rolling stock, and in most cases there were four windows per carriage. Rail firms using carriages with these windows have been asked to carry out a risk assessment of their use. A report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch said the sticker on the door was ""cluttered"" with six other notices. The RAIB has also made recommendations telling operators to ""assess the risk arising from reduced clearance outside those windows"". Simon Brown's family said in a statement: ""Irrespective of the penalty imposed, we hope, as a result of our tragedy, that operating companies up and down the country will take their responsibilities to the travelling public more seriously."" Along with the fine, the firm was ordered to pay Â£52,267 in costs. Govia Thameslink said it had taken the health and safety failings very seriously and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Chief executive Patrick Verwer said: ""I am very sorry for the death of Mr Brown and the deep distress this tragic loss has caused his family and friends."" Following Mr Brown's death, GTR took steps to ""minimise risk"" by putting hazard tape across on the droplight windows of its 14 trains that had them. It also placed bars across the windows in such a way that it was still possible to lower the window. The trains were withdrawn from service in 2017 across all of GTR's network.

"Rescuers are relying on human chains of volunteers A human chain of rescuers is searching for survivors a day after a building collapsed in the Indian city of Mumbai, killing 13 people and trapping dozens. Officials say rescue efforts have been hampered by a warren of old streets which prevent access by heavy vehicles. Rescuers are hopeful of finding more people alive. A woman was saved on Wednesday but her two children died. Such disasters are not uncommon in Mumbai, which has thousands of old, dilapidated buildings. Rescuers are facing a huge challenge because Dongri - in the south of the city, where the building was located - is a web of cramped, narrow lanes, hemmed in by run-down buildings. This video can not be played Volunteers searching for survivors formed a human chain and rescued a little girl Officials say fire crews and ambulances could not even reach the site because the lane was too narrow. So a chain of fire-fighters, municipal workers and local volunteers has been ferrying rescue materials to the building and carrying away the injured and the dead. ""Tandel street, where the building stood, is so narrow that only one person can walk through it comfortably at a time,"" says BBC Marathi's Mayuresh Konnur. Rescuers worked through much of the night looking for people trapped by the debris. At least 10 other people were injured in the collapse and are in hospital. On Tuesday, fire-fighters were retrieving a body from the under the rubble when they discovered an outstretched hand. That's how they found and saved 23-year-old Zinat Salmani and her daughter. She was trapped under an iron beam, wooden doors and a gas cylinder. They are now recovering in hospital. Another woman, Alima Indrasi, 28, was pulled to safety on Wednesday. ""She has sustained injuries but is undergoing treatment,"" National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) spokesman Sachidanand Gawde told AFP. He said her two children had not survived. Some 15 families were living in the Kesarbai building when it came down early on Tuesday, police said. Peer Mohammed, who lives in the building next door, says he heard a huge sound about 11:40 local time (06:10 GMT). ""I ran outside and saw that people were stuck under the rubble. We rescued four people, but many others are still trapped, "" he told BBC Marathi's Janhavee Moole. Two of Mr Mohammed's relatives - his brother and his brother's daughter-in-law - died in the accident. Two other members of his family were injured. Mr Mohammed, his family and his neighbours - many of whom live in Dongri's crumbling buildings - want to know who will be held responsible. State housing minister Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil says there will be an inquiry into what caused the building to collapse and ""strict action"" will be taken against any officials who were found responsible for negligence. The Kesarbai building is reportedly 100 years old. While the cause in this particular instance still remains unclear, Mumbai administrators say the building's owners added a section to the original structure illegally, without securing the necessary permits. This, they say, is the part that collapsed, while the original building is largely still standing. Why people live in Mumbai's dangerous buildings The ANI news agency has since shared a 2017 official notice from the Maharashtra housing and area development authority asking residents to evacuate the building for demolition. This video can not be played Officials estimate around 2,000 people in India die each year when buildings collapse Mr Mohammed confirms that such a notice was indeed issued in 2017. ""But we need somewhere else to stay. We need help or where will we go with our family?"" This is a familiar story. Some 14,000 of Mumbai's buildings are more than 70-80 years old. And they are especially vulnerable during the monsoon season, between June and September. And dozens of them have collapsed in recent years, often during the monsoon season. But occupants refuse to leave despite the threat of demolition or a possible collapse. Many of them have been living in the same place for generations and have nowhere else to go. ""Some provision should be made for maintaining old buildings,"" says Harshad Bhatia, an architect and town planner. He says many old buildings have been declared ""heritage"" structures, increasing the bureaucratic hurdles standing in the way of renovation. He adds that due to an archaic law which limits raising rents, owners cannot afford to invest in the upkeep of their buildings. .

"""I still have a really deep relationship with that song,"" says Gary Lightbody. ""It's a beautiful moment every time you play it."" Snow Patrol's ballad Chasing Cars has been crowned the most-played song of the 21st Century on UK radio. Originally released in 2006, the lovestruck ballad never reached number one in the UK, but remained on the charts for more than three years. It took up a similar residency on the airwaves, where it has become the most popular song of the last 20 years. Second place went to Black Eyed Peas' I Gotta Feeling, while Pharrell's similarly upbeat Happy came third. ""It's unbelievable,"" Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody told the BBC. ""I'm not sure how that happened."" Asked to explain the Chasing Cars' appeal, he said: ""It's an emotionally open song and it's a simple song.  But it's also unabashedly a love song, and we don't really have any others. ""The way it unifies an audience is the thing I most cherish about it. It's a beautiful moment every time you play it.""

The song was taken from Snow Patrol's fourth album, Eyes Open. It was the 14th biggest-selling single of 2006, and the last song played live on Top of the Pops. Radio's most-played songs revealed Where did Snow Patrol go for seven years? Lightbody was presented with a special award marking the achievement on Tuesday by music licensing body PPL, which tracks all the music played on radio and television in the UK, as it marked its 85th anniversary. Speaking to BBC News, Lightbody looked back on the creation of Chasing Cars in a wine-fuelled, all-night recording session. I read that you'd written Chasing Cars in the garden of your producer's house. Is that right? Yes, Jacknife Lee had a studio in the shed of his garden and we went down there with a couple of bottles of wine, and we wrote through the night. In fact, we wrote 10 songs that night - and five of them ended up on Eyes Open, so that was pretty much half the album. Normally when you listen back to the music you wrote after a few glasses of wine, you go, 'Ah well, better luck next time'. But that particular evening, [we] gathered a lot of good stuff. So what was in the air that night? I'm not sure. We were writing a Snow Patrol record, but we were also tasked with writing some songs for some other people - so that might have taken some pressure off. But by the next morning, none of those songs were going to anybody else, that's for sure! Who might have recorded Chasing Cars if you hadn't kept it? Oh, I'm not going to tell you that! That's not fair! Lightbody received his award from PPL boss Peter Leathem on Tuesday night Everyone knows the ""If I just lay here"" part. Had you written that lyric before the session? No, it came spontaneously. The lyrics for that song all came that night. They just came out onto the page. And that's how I used to write - with just a flow. They would generally just sort of come out, and I wouldn't edit, for better or worse. So with Chasing Cars, it was just what was happening at that moment in my life. I was in love. So it was a true, true representation of what was going on. I guess that's the secret. It's real emotion, with no filter and no censorship. Yeah, yeah, that's very well put. It was as spontaneous a song as I've ever written. There's very few that were written so quickly. That's why trying to like follow up or trying to like recreate a hit like that is a fool's errand. It's just never going to work that way again, because it's just about the magic that's in the air, the environment, the mood that you're in that day. All the chemistry comes together in that moment, and it can't be recreated. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Chasing Cars beat I Gotta Feeling and Pharrell's Happy. What do you make of those songs? I mean, it would seem that there's a pattern in there, and that pattern has nothing to do with Chasing Cars. They're very upbeat songs that are giving an audience permission to kind of jump up and down and be happy. Whereas Chasing Cars is a little bit more reflective. But it's good company to be in, because those songs have been absolutely dominant. People always say that writing a hit Christmas song is like a retirement plan... So is this songyourretirement plan?

"""I still have a really deep relationship with that song,"" says Gary Lightbody. ""It's a beautiful moment every time you play it."" Snow Patrol's ballad Chasing Cars has been crowned the most-played song of the 21st Century on UK radio. Originally released in 2006, the lovestruck ballad never reached number one in the UK, but remained on the charts for more than three years. It took up a similar residency on the airwaves, where it has become the most popular song of the last 20 years. Second place went to Black Eyed Peas' I Gotta Feeling, while Pharrell's similarly upbeat Happy came third. ""It's unbelievable,"" Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody told the BBC. ""I'm not sure how that happened."" Asked to explain the Chasing Cars' appeal, he said: ""It's an emotionally open song and it's a simple song.  But it's also unabashedly a love song, and we don't really have any others. ""The way it unifies an audience is the thing I most cherish about it. It's a beautiful moment every time you play it.""

The song was taken from Snow Patrol's fourth album, Eyes Open. It was the 14th biggest-selling single of 2006, and the last song played live on Top of the Pops. Radio's most-played songs revealed Where did Snow Patrol go for seven years? Lightbody was presented with a special award marking the achievement on Tuesday by music licensing body PPL, which tracks all the music played on radio and television in the UK, as it marked its 85th anniversary. Speaking to BBC News, Lightbody looked back on the creation of Chasing Cars in a wine-fuelled, all-night recording session. I read that you'd written Chasing Cars in the garden of your producer's house. Is that right? Yes, Jacknife Lee had a studio in the shed of his garden and we went down there with a couple of bottles of wine, and we wrote through the night. In fact, we wrote 10 songs that night - and five of them ended up on Eyes Open, so that was pretty much half the album. Normally when you listen back to the music you wrote after a few glasses of wine, you go, 'Ah well, better luck next time'. But that particular evening, [we] gathered a lot of good stuff. So what was in the air that night? I'm not sure. We were writing a Snow Patrol record, but we were also tasked with writing some songs for some other people - so that might have taken some pressure off. But by the next morning, none of those songs were going to anybody else, that's for sure! Who might have recorded Chasing Cars if you hadn't kept it? Oh, I'm not going to tell you that! That's not fair! Lightbody received his award from PPL boss Peter Leathem on Tuesday night Everyone knows the ""If I just lay here"" part. Had you written that lyric before the session? No, it came spontaneously. The lyrics for that song all came that night. They just came out onto the page. And that's how I used to write - with just a flow. They would generally just sort of come out, and I wouldn't edit, for better or worse. So with Chasing Cars, it was just what was happening at that moment in my life. I was in love. So it was a true, true representation of what was going on. I guess that's the secret. It's real emotion, with no filter and no censorship. Yeah, yeah, that's very well put. It was as spontaneous a song as I've ever written. There's very few that were written so quickly. That's why trying to like follow up or trying to like recreate a hit like that is a fool's errand. It's just never going to work that way again, because it's just about the magic that's in the air, the environment, the mood that you're in that day. All the chemistry comes together in that moment, and it can't be recreated. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Chasing Cars beat I Gotta Feeling and Pharrell's Happy. What do you make of those songs? I mean, it would seem that there's a pattern in there, and that pattern has nothing to do with Chasing Cars. They're very upbeat songs that are giving an audience permission to kind of jump up and down and be happy. Whereas Chasing Cars is a little bit more reflective. But it's good company to be in, because those songs have been absolutely dominant. People always say that writing a hit Christmas song is like a retirement plan... So is this songyourretirement plan? No! I don't have a retirement plan. I never thought about retiring. I'm always going to be writing songs.

"This video can not be played Grant Weir has needed full-time care since the bomb attack The family of a former soldier left brain-damaged by a bomb 40 years ago said they will not accept a Troubles-related pension if injured ex-paramilitaries also receive one. County Fermanagh man Grant Weir was injured when the IRA attacked his Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) patrol. The victims' commissioner has said people badly injured in the Troubles should be able to apply for a pension. That includes those who were hurt while carrying out attacks. The commissioner, Judith Thompson, has advised the government on the issue and acknowledges there are political sensitivities around eligibility. Grant Weir was in the UDR and was on patrol when he was attacked She gave her advice to the government in May, butit has only now been made public,external. The legislation would help people who have been unable to work and earn their own pension due to severe and permanent physical and psychological injuries as a result of the conflict. Mr Weir suffered his injuries when the IRA detonated a bomb as his patrol drove past a bus stop near Rosslea in County Fermanagh on 17 July 1979. Sylvia Crowe, a church missionary who was waiting at the bus stop with two other women, was killed. Mr Weir, who was 22 when he was attacked, is cared for by his family, including his sisters Debbie Palmer and Michele Nixon. Grant's sisters Debbie (left) and Michele (right) say it is ""beyond belief"" that paramilitaries could be classified as victims ""From the moment that bomb went off, that changed our lives forever, and has affected three generations of our family,"" said Mrs Nixon. A victim's pension would ""make a massive difference"" to the family, said Mrs Palmer. ""Financially it would definitely allow us to help out with Grant a great deal,"" she said. ""However, if that also meant that potentially the... people responsible for blowing up Grant... would have an entitlement to that same pension... it's beyond belief. ""As a family, we would never accept a payment if it meant that the people who went out to destroy lives, destroy families, were to be put into the same category... as Grant, whose life they have destroyed."" Sylvia Crowe was killed in the bomb attack in which Grant Weir was injured Last month, the government saidit was examining the victims' commissioner's adviceabout the pensions. Mrs Thompson said the advice was a ""fair and reasonable response"" to support those who had suffered greatly. More than 3,600 people were killed during three decades of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland and a further 40,000 were injured. Campaigners have been calling for some time for a pension for those severely injured during the Troubles to be introduced. It states that recipients should be people who have been unable to work or earn their own pension due to a conflict-related injury. It would also allow for the pension to be passed on to a spouse, dependent or carer for their lifetime. Judith Thompson says the government cannot ""kick this issue down the road any longer"" It states that an independent assessor would look at applications and that payments should be made based on the severity of the impact of an individual's injury. It recommends backdating payments to 2014, when the political parties and the government formally recognised the need for a pension through the signing of the Stormont House Agreement. The advice refers to the Victims and Survivors (NI) Order 2006, which makes no distinction between paramilitaries who were killed or injured and victims. Under the order, a victim is defined as: Someone who has been physically or psychologically injured as a result of a conflict-related incident; Someone who provides a substantial amount of care on a regular basis for a person who has been physically or psychologically injured as a result of a conflict-related incident; Someone who has been bereaved as a result of a conflict-related incident. The order has proved controversial, with failedattempts by unionist politicians to change the definition of a victim,external. They argue that perpetrators of violence and those injured by their own hand should not be eligible for a pension. However, other parties at Stormont have previously insistedthere should be ""no hierarchy of victims"". The commissioner is urging Westminster to legislate for the pension in the absence of devolution at Stormont. Northern Ireland has been without a government since the assembly collapsed in January 2017. Several MPs and peers had tabled amendments relating to a pension to a Northern Ireland bill currently going through Parliament, but the government insists it is still considering the issue. Mrs Thompson said the government ""cannot kick this issue down the road any longer"".

"This video can not be played Health service treatment of family 'obscene' The killing of an elderly couple in their home by a man with severe mental health issues could have been avoided, a report has found. Michael and Marjorie Cawdery, both 83, were attacked by Thomas Scott McEntee in Portadown, County Armagh, in 2017. An independent panel, appointed by health authorities to investigate the deaths, has completed its work. The Health and Social Care (HSC) system said it would learn from the ""tragic incident"". Trust 'responsible' in Cawdery killings Court told of 'frenzied attack' on couple Man admits killing elderly couple The investigation found that McEntee's actions on the day the Cawderys died occurred in ""the context of a significant deterioration"" in his mental health. It concluded that the deaths ""could not have been predicted but could have been avoided"". A HSC spokesperson said it would work to reduce the risk of something similar happening in the future. McEntee was sentenced to 10 years in prison for killing the couple The couple's son-in-law Charles Little said it was ""shattering"" for the family to hear that the deaths were avoidable. ""We are also very angry that the Southern Health and Social Care Trust and the Health and Social Care Board have taken two years and two months to come to a conclusion that was obvious to the family by the end of June 2017,"" he added. In June 2018, McEntee, who suffers from paranoid schizophrenia,was sentenced to a minimum of 10 years in prison. The court case heard that authorities missed chances to take him off the streets. McEntee had been causing a public nuisance in Warrenpoint, County Down, the day before the killings. Police then took him to Newry train station, where McEntee said he planned to travel to Lurgan, County Armagh. However, he did not board a train and instead broke into a garage in nearby Derrybeg Lane. The next morning, police received reports about McEntee walking naked along the road between Bessbrook and Newry. He was taken to the nearby Daisy Hill Hospital but was not admitted. McEntee left hospital and attacked the Cawdreys in their home nearby Instead he was taken to Craigavon Area Hospital in an ambulance, with a police escort. While waiting to be assessed in the emergency department, he got up and left. A short time later, McEntee was in the Cawdery's home, which is near the hospital. They died in what the court case heard was a sustained, frenzied and gratuitous attack, which included the use of six knives. An independent panel was appointed to conduct a level three serious adverse incident (SAI) review and the findings were recently shared with the Cawdery family. Mr Little said his family was ""broadly content"" with the investigation's conclusion. But he added mental health patients need to be handled ""carefully"". ""The fact that the incident could not be predicted is no defence - it is the very unpredictability of behaviour of those mental health patients who lead chaotic lifestyles that means they must be handled very carefully if they are to remain in the community."" The HSC said it would consider the report and involve the family in the process. ""We fully recognise the enormous distress that the families affected by this tragedy have suffered and we would unreservedly apologise for this,"" it added.

"Cairney and Jones spent 20 years pretending that Ms Fleming was still alive Two carers who murdered a vulnerable teenager whose body has never been found have each been ordered to spend a minimum of 14 years in prison. Edward Cairney, 77, and Avril Jones, 59, killed Margaret Fleming, 19, between December 1999 and January 2000. Jones then continued to claim Â£182,000 in benefits until it finally emerged Margaret was missing in October 2016. At the High Court in Glasgow Lord Matthews told Cairney he must serve at least 14 years. Jones' minimum life tariff was also set at 14 years. The teenager who was forgotten for 17 years The day I interviewed Margaret's killers She was also found guilty of benefit fraud as Margaret's money was paid directly into her account. Lord Matthewstold them,external: ""Only you two know the truth. Only you know where her remains are."" Margaret Fleming was last seen when she was 19 The judge said it was obvious the motive for the murder and the cover-up was financial. He added: ""Margaret Fleming was a vulnerable young woman with evident difficulties. She was in your care and you breached the trust placed in you. ""The manner in which you described her when you spoke about her was cruel and the fantastic web of deceit you spun was callous and calculating."" Thomas Ross QC, for Cairney, said his client uses a wheelchair and had his colon removed a few years ago after he contracted an infection. He also suffers from hip damage and the after effects of breaking three vertebrate. Mr Ross said: ""Mr Cairney continues to deny any involvement in the crime and, so far as he is concerned, he maintains that, to his knowledge, Margaret is still alive."" Iain Duguid QC, for Jones, said his client was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, a condition which affects the nervous system, in 1994. The court heard the case has left Jones, a former legal secretary and greenkeeper, ""isolated"" from her friends and family. The QC said his client also maintains her innocence and that, as recent as their last contact in October 2017, Margaret was still alive. How do you solve a murder without a body? Despite a painstaking search of their dilapidated property in Inverkip on the Clyde coast, and its garden, no trace of Margaret has ever been found. Testimony from Avril's brother, Richard Jones, was used to pinpoint the last independent sighting of the teenager on 17 December, 1999. Three weeks later, on 5 January, 2000, Avril told her mother, Florence Jones, Margaret had run off with a traveller. The couple, who had no previous convictions, then embarked on a cover up which involved bogus letters and erasing all trace of Margaret from the cottage where she had lived for around two years. This video can not be played Edward Cairney and Avril Jones spoke to the BBC in 2017 about Margaret Fleming's disappearance The catalyst for the teenager moving in with the couple was the death of her father in 1995. Cairney, who was his friend, offered to help and took advantage of Margaret's strained relationship with her mother. All ties between the pair were severed in November 1997 when Cairney assaulted Margaret Cruickshanks after she arrived at Seacroft to see her daughter. Thereafter the couple took control of the teenager's life and subjected her to what police described as a ""living hell"". 'Someone should have been looking out for her' Police confront the killer of missing woman Police and prosecutors narrowed the timeframe of the murder to a three-week period around the turn of the millennium. The trial heard that a benefits investigator attempted to visit Ms Fleming in June 2012 but was told by Jones that she would not see her. The investigator said a duty social worker should have visited the ""totally chaotic"" property to follow up on the young woman's welfare, but no-one did. This video can not be played Lord Matthews said the pair spun a ""web of deceit"" that was callous and calculating When police were finally alerted four years later it was as a result of an application for Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - which had been filled out by Jones. In it she wrote that Ms Fleming ""needs constant care"", had self-harmed and was ""caught eating out of a dog bowl"". A social worker phoned Jones to offer help and was told Ms Fleming had not been to the doctor, despite picking a hole in her head. Police Scotland subsequently launched a missing persons' investigation in October 2016. When justice eventually caught up with the couple a year later they maintained Margaret was still alive and often returned to visit them. This video can not be played Det Supt Paul Livingstone: ""If you have any decency left tell us where the body is."" Cairney even gave evidence in his defence, during which he was warned by the judge for insulting prosecutor Iain McSporran QC. But an exhaustive investigation failed to find any trace of the teenager and the jury took just three hours to find the pair guilty. Det Supt Paul Livingstone, the officer who led the investigation, said: ""Margaret was a very vulnerable young woman when she was abused, neglected, manipulated and murdered by these two greedy, evil individuals. ""Margaret's family and friends will never know just what happened to her and they have been denied the right to pay their final respects to her at her funeral. ""I would say to Cairney and Jones - if you have a scrap of decency you will give the answers to the questions that Margaret's family deserve. ""I am willing to meet either of them so that they can tell me in order to provide some kind of comfort to her family and allow them to put her to rest finally.""

"NI bill being examined by MPs, including amendment from peers Lords voted for amendment aimed at preventing prorogation Kate Whannel, Thomas Mason and Richard Morris MPs approved two significant changes to the Northern Ireland bill - intended to make it harder for a new prime minister to prorogue Parliament and force through a no-deal Brexit. They endorsed last night's Lords amendment, to ensure Parliament sits for a fortnightly debate - on government updates on the restoration of power-sharing in Northern Ireland. And they backed the Burt-Benn amendment by 315 to 274 votes, to ensure that debates and ministerial statements on this topic go ahead, even if Parliament has been suspended. The Leader of the House of Commons set out the business for next week, saying: I feel sure that there will be an opportunity for the House to hear from the new prime minister next week, although clearly I cannot comment on the precise circumstances that may pertain to that; that will be a matter for him, whoever he is. Mel Stride, Leader of the House of Commons  Next week will also include any necessary consideration of Lords amendments, and a debate on Tuesday 22 July on on body image and mental health. Mr Stride said that, at the conclusion of business on Thursday 25 July, Parliament would rise for the summer recess and return on Tuesday 3 September. If you want to know more about the day's events, tune intoToday in Parliamenton BBC Radio 4, at 11:30pm. The measure aims to stop a future PM bypassing Parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit.

I regret these amendments being attached to this important piece of legislation in Northern Ireland - the negotiations to restore devolution, to get a devolved executive and assembly back up and running in Stormont - at a very sensitive time. I think it's actually slightly irresponsible to be messing around with this piece of Northern Irish business. Conor Burns MP, Boris Johnson backer We have to stop no deal.

"Adding more ethanol to the UK's fuel mix would cut carbon by as much as taking 700,000 cars off the roads, according to a group of MPs. The All-Party Parliamentary Group for British Bioethanol,externalsays the swift introduction of E10 fuel would also help the Â£1bn British biofuel industry. E10 is a mixture of 10% ethanol with 90% petrol, double the current permitted maximum. The MPs say that Brexit has distracted the government from taking action. Used cooking oil imports may boost deforestation Gove: Time running out to stop damage to planet Fishermen 'still illegally discarding fish' One of the unintended consequences of 2015'sdiesel emissions scandalhas been a jump in the sales of petrol cars, with a knock-on effect on sales of the fuel. This has contributed to thefirst increase in emissions of CO2 from new cars,externalin two decades recorded in 2017. A significant plank of the government's plan to reduce carbon on the roads has been the introduction of biofuels made from crops, which soak up CO2 as they are grown. At present, ethanol made from wheat or sugar beet is blended into petrol to a maximum of 5%. The report's authors say that while electric cars and vehicles are the long-term solution to emissions from transport, E10 represents a big advance that could be achieved right now. ""For many reasons it is absolutely a no-brainer,"" said Nic Dakin MP, the chairman of the all-party group. ""On the environmental front, it's a cleaner, greener fuel at a time when we're trying to address air pollution and tackle climate change. ""Cars aren't going to all switch to battery power overnight and if they did there isn't the capacity in the National Grid to power all of our transportation. ""This must be a top priority for the government and we renew our call for a mandate to introduce E10 by 2020 at the latest."" In other European countries, the change to E10 has been fully embraced. France introduced the fuel in 2009 and last year it was the largest volume petrol grade sold, with 47% of the market. Germany, Belgium and Finland have also introduced E10, with other countries including China and India set to do the same. In Brazil the minimum ethanol content is now 27%. The report says that without the introduction of E10 fuel the UK's bioethanol producers, based in the North of England, will struggle to survive. Last September Vivergo, one of the three main producers of the biofuelannounced it would close its facility on Humbersidewith the loss of 150 jobs. The introduction of E10 would likely secure and strengthen the industry which has the potential to support approximately 6,000 jobs in the UK. Wheat is one of the crops that is used for making ethanol in the UK ""We built a plant in 2010, we've had four periods when the plant has been offline, and the reason for that is lack of demand,"" said Grant Pearson from Ensus, one of the UK's three ethanol production companies. ""We expected that demand would be at least twice what it is, and that move from E5 to E10 would just get us back on track."" Last year the government issued a consultation on the idea of increasing this to 10%, but since then nothing has happened, a decision that MPs describe as ""baffling"" and likely due to the distraction of Brexit. ""It is bonkers that the Department of Transport has yet to publish its consultation on the introduction of E10,"" said Nic Daikin. ""The British bioethanol industry is in a state of collapse, and ministers can not allow the fog of Brexit to distract them any longer from saving a Â£1bn industry that will not only make our cars cleaner and greener, but provide thousands of green jobs in the North and prove that the government is serious about championing the green economy."" In response, a Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We are committed to supporting cleaner and greener fuels, and we recognise the important role they have to play in decarbonising transport."" ""Following our call for evidence on E10, we intend to publish our next steps in due course."" Critics of the introduction of E10 say that it is not certified to run in some older cars, principally those manufactured before 2000. One of the UK's bioethanol plants near Middlesbrough The report says that this threat is minimal and that there is no evidence from Europe or the US where E10 is widely used of the fuel causing any significant damage to to any vehicle manufactured before the turn of the century. Indeed the report says that the fuel industry has ""given express assurances that were E10 to be mandated, motorists would still be able to purchase E5 (as octane 98) at many forecourts. Thus any older cars which are not expressly warrantied for E10 can still have access to fuel that is compatible with their engines."" Other critics of the switch are worried that going for extra ethanol in the mix might push up prices on the forecourt. ""The cost impact is minuscule,"" said Grant Pearson. ""The price of ethanol compared to petrol varies over time, we've had periods where ethanol has been cheaper than petrol. There's a tiny reduction in terms of potential mileage but its less than 1%, so depending on how heavy your shoe is you wouldn't see it in the mileage that your are doing."" If the bioethanol industry flounders, the report says, the UK would likely have to increase imports of biofuel from overseas, including used cooking oil from China, which is likely boosting the use of palm oil from deforested lands.

"This video can not be played Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib: ""I'm dealing with the biggest bully I've ever had to deal with"" The ongoing row between US President Donald Trump and four non-white Democratic congresswomen has continued to escalate following a controversial campaign rally. During a speech in North Carolina, Mr Trump took aim at Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley as well as Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born lawmaker who he focused much of his criticism on. His rhetoric prompted a chant of ""send her back"" from his supporters, which Mr Trump on Thursday claimed he disagreed with. The rally fallout follows debate over a series of vitriolic tweets and statements by the president that have been widely condemned as racist. All the women are US citizens. So what else do we know of the lawmakers known as ""the Squad""? All four were elected to the House of Representatives in last November's mid-term elections, each making history as a result. Known to be progressive, they have clashed in recent weeks with the more pragmatic Speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi - divisions with racial overtones that Mr Trump has tried to exploit with his tweets. Ms Omar speaks at a news conference in Washington DC in June First-term congresswoman Ilhan Omar won a Minnesota seat in the House of Representatives last November, becoming the first Somali-American legislator in the US. Her family first came to the US as refugees from Somalia, settling in Minneapolis in 1997 after fleeing the country's civil war. She became a citizen in 2000. The 37-year-old mother of three is one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to the US Congress. Before her election to Congress, she served in Minnesota's state legislature, making her the then highest elected Somali-American public official in the US. Ms Omar's precedent-setting tenure has earned both adoration and criticism. Shortly after her election, she drew praise for fighting to change a 181-year ban on headwear in the House, allowing her to wear a hijab for her oath of office. But Ms Omar has also faced repeated accusations of anti-Semitism. She was forced to apologise for a series of tweets in February that suggested that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) was buying influence for pro-Israel policies. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said the tweets stoked anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money. Ms Omar later released a statement ""unequivocally"" apologising for her tweets. ""Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,"" Ms Omar wrote. This video can not be played Ilhan Omar on her journey to becoming the first Somali-American lawmaker in the US She came under fire from conservatives again in April for comments on 9/11 that Democrats said were taken out of context. A clip of Ms Omar apparently describing 9/11 as ""some people did something"" began circulating online, and the president tweeted a video showing footage of the terrorist attacks spliced with Ms Omar's speech. The quote was from a speech Ms Omar gave to a civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), in March. The comments in Mr Trump's video were taken from a point she made about the treatment of US Muslims in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks: ""For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. Cair was founded after 9/11 because they recognised that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties."" The 9/11 row embroiling a US congresswoman In recent weeks, Mr Trump has focused his attacks on Ms Omar saying she ""hates Israel"" and ""hates Jews"", and suggesting she supports the jihadist group al-Qaeda. US media reported that Mr Trump's accusations probably reference a 2013 interview where Ms Omar was discussing a college terrorism class. She did not praise al-Quaeda in the interview. Ms Omar remarked that a professor said the names of terrorist groups with a different kind of ""intensity"" compared with the tone he used when he said ""America"" or ""England"". Ms Ocasio-Cortez and Ms Tlaib at a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, often referred to as AOC, made waves in the Democratic Party last June when she defeated political veteran and establishment favourite Joe Crowley in their party's primary in a new York district. The 29-year-old went on to beat Republican candidate Anthony Pappas in the November mid-terms, becoming the youngest ever US congresswoman. The freshman lawmaker was born in the Bronx, New York to parents of Puerto Rican descent. She has a degree in economics and international relations from Boston University, and worked as a community organiser, educator and bartender before deciding to run for office. Trump to congresswomen of colour: Leave the US Ocasio-Cortez: 'No question' Trump racist Since her election, the self-described democratic socialist has become a lightning rod for the political right. Ms Ocasio-Cortez has not shied away from the spotlight, frequently taking to social media to hit back at Republicans, members of the media and other critics on a range of issues including immigration, poverty and race. This video can not be played Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on detained migrants: 'The women were told to drink out of a toilet bowl' She has earned a reputation for her impassioned testimonies at congressional hearings, which are often re-circulated among her nearly five million Twitter followers. She has been particularly vocal in her push for environmental policy, serving as one of the sponsors of the Green New Deal resolution, which calls upon the US to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions along with other goals. Ms Ocasio-Cortez has also been outspoken in her criticism of the president, saying there is ""no question"" that Mr Trump is racist. And she recently accused Ms Pelosi of ""singling out"" new congresswomen of colour following a number of clashes over their policy stances. Social media savvy, Ms Ocasio-Cortez inadvertently coined the term ""the squad"" after suggesting they hashtag a photoshoot image of the four of them #squadgoals. Ms Tlaib and Ms Omar talk before Mr Trump's second State of the Union address Much like the other congresswomen, Rashida Tlaib's election this November made history. The Michigan Democrat is the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress. Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Ms Tlaib is the daughter of Palestinian immigrant parents. Her grandmother still lives in the West Bank. Palestinian dress worn in new US Congress How women are changing the face of Congress She was sworn into office wearing a traditional Palestinian garment stitched by her mother. Ms Tlaib also joined Ms Omar as one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to serve in Congress. The eldest of 14 siblings, Ms Tlaib became the first member of her family to graduate from high school, and then from college and law school. Since assuming office, Ms Tlaib has been an outspoken critic of the president. She courted controversy when she used explicit language when calling for the president's impeachment.

Ms Tlaib was unapologetic about the furore incited by her remark, tweeting that she would ""always speak truth to power"". After his twitter storm, she said Mr Trump was ""biggest bully I've ever had to deal with in my lifetime"", and said his attacks were a ""distraction"" from her job of representing people in her congressional district. Ms Pressley at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, 45, is the first African-American woman to be elected to the US Congress from Massachusetts. Born in Cincinnati and raised in Ohio, Ms Pressley is the only child of a single mother. After attending Boston University, she served as a senior aide to Congressman Joseph P Kennedy II, and worked for Senator John Kerry for 13 years. Times when Americans were told to 'go back' Trump steps up attack on 'US-hating' congresswomen Her own political career began in 2009 when she waged a successful bid for a seat on Boston City Council, becoming the first woman of colour elected to the council in its 100-year history. Similar to Ms Ocasio-Cortez, Ms Pressley's election to the US Congress involved a major political upset: she unseated 10-term Democratic congressman Michael Capuano in their party's primary. Since assuming office in January, Ms Pressley has been a vocal advocate of abortion rights, pushing to repeal an amendment that prevents Medicaid from covering abortions for low-income Americans. A survivor of sexual violence, Ms Pressley has also spoken up for better protections for assault victims, writing on her website that ""the people closest to the pain should be closest to the power"". She said she could not call Mr Trump the president, only the ""occupant"" of the White House. ""He does not embody the principles, the responsibility, the grace, the integrity of a true president,"" she told CBS.

"""I still have a really deep relationship with that song,"" says Gary Lightbody. ""It's a beautiful moment every time you play it."" Snow Patrol's ballad Chasing Cars has been crowned the most-played song of the 21st Century on UK radio. Originally released in 2006, the lovestruck ballad never reached number one in the UK, but remained on the charts for more than three years. It took up a similar residency on the airwaves, where it has become the most popular song of the last 20 years. Second place went to Black Eyed Peas' I Gotta Feeling, while Pharrell's similarly upbeat Happy came third. ""It's unbelievable,"" Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody told the BBC. ""I'm not sure how that happened."" Asked to explain the Chasing Cars' appeal, he said: ""It's an emotionally open song and it's a simple song.  But it's also unabashedly a love song, and we don't really have any others. ""The way it unifies an audience is the thing I most cherish about it. It's a beautiful moment every time you play it.""

The song was taken from Snow Patrol's fourth album, Eyes Open. It was the 14th biggest-selling single of 2006, and the last song played live on Top of the Pops. Radio's most-played songs revealed Where did Snow Patrol go for seven years? Lightbody was presented with a special award marking the achievement on Tuesday by music licensing body PPL, which tracks all the music played on radio and television in the UK, as it marked its 85th anniversary. Speaking to BBC News, Lightbody looked back on the creation of Chasing Cars in a wine-fuelled, all-night recording session. I read that you'd written Chasing Cars in the garden of your producer's house. Is that right? Yes, Jacknife Lee had a studio in the shed of his garden and we went down there with a couple of bottles of wine, and we wrote through the night. In fact, we wrote 10 songs that night - and five of them ended up on Eyes Open, so that was pretty much half the album. Normally when you listen back to the music you wrote after a few glasses of wine, you go, 'Ah well, better luck next time'. But that particular evening, [we] gathered a lot of good stuff. So what was in the air that night? I'm not sure. We were writing a Snow Patrol record, but we were also tasked with writing some songs for some other people - so that might have taken some pressure off. But by the next morning, none of those songs were going to anybody else, that's for sure! Who might have recorded Chasing Cars if you hadn't kept it? Oh, I'm not going to tell you that! That's not fair! Lightbody received his award from PPL boss Peter Leathem on Tuesday night Everyone knows the ""If I just lay here"" part. Had you written that lyric before the session? No, it came spontaneously. The lyrics for that song all came that night. They just came out onto the page. And that's how I used to write - with just a flow. They would generally just sort of come out, and I wouldn't edit, for better or worse. So with Chasing Cars, it was just what was happening at that moment in my life. I was in love. So it was a true, true representation of what was going on. I guess that's the secret. It's real emotion, with no filter and no censorship. Yeah, yeah, that's very well put. It was as spontaneous a song as I've ever written. There's very few that were written so quickly. That's why trying to like follow up or trying to like recreate a hit like that is a fool's errand. It's just never going to work that way again, because it's just about the magic that's in the air, the environment, the mood that you're in that day. All the chemistry comes together in that moment, and it can't be recreated. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Chasing Cars beat I Gotta Feeling and Pharrell's Happy. What do you make of those songs? I mean, it would seem that there's a pattern in there, and that pattern has nothing to do with Chasing Cars. They're very upbeat songs that are giving an audience permission to kind of jump up and down and be happy. Whereas Chasing Cars is a little bit more reflective. But it's good company to be in, because those songs have been absolutely dominant. People always say that writing a hit Christmas song is like a retirement plan... So is this songyourretirement plan? No! I don't have a retirement plan. I never thought about retiring. I'm always going to be writing songs.

"Chimpanzees watching a video together get the same sense of bonding and closeness that humans can feel from watching a movie or TV show together, say US university researchers. Pairs of chimps were monitored as they watched videos - and psychologists found an increased sense of closeness between them in a way previously thought to be unique to humans. Researchers say it shows the ""deep evolutionary roots"" of the heightened emotional impact of watching something with someone else. It also raises questions about what is lost when there are fewer shared experiences - such as if families stop watching television together and are separately plugged into social media or using their own mobile phones. ""Experiences are richer watching together,"" says report co-author Wouter Wolf, from the department of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University in the US. There was closer bonding and touching after watching a video together The study, being published by the Royal Society, put chimpanzees and bonobos in front of a screen showing a video. Eye-trackers were used to make sure the apes were watching the film and fruit drinks were used to encourage them to stay relatively still and in the same place. Mr Wolf says the choice of video was decided by previous research revealing what apes most liked to watch - which was film of other apes. The end of watching TV as a family Loneliness most likely to affect young people Young like to watch Friends but on-demand and online Using data from 45 apes, mostly chimpanzees and some bonobos, the researchers studied changes in behaviour after they had watched a video of a family of chimps playing with a young chimp. Shared viewing is being challenged by online and social media services Watching the film together made them much more likely to bond afterwards - such as staying close together, touching or interacting with each other. The psychologist says the findings have challenged the idea that there was something ""uniquely human"" about such shared social experiences from watching an activity. The research concluded that this sense of feeling closer from watching something with someone is ""present in both humans and great apes and thus has deeper evolutionary roots than previously suspected"". Watching something together creates a deep-rooted sense of social bonding The psychologist says it might say something about how people in an audience or watching a sports event can feel a sense of bonding with people they otherwise do not know. Mr Wolf says there is something very distinctive about the enjoyment of shared watching - with a sense of irritation if this is interrupted. Chimps can be a tough audience - their favourite viewing is film of other chimps ""Experiencing and sharing something between two people creates common ground,"" he says. ""If you go to the movies together, you're sitting side by side, it's a really social phenomenon."" But he says ""you get really annoyed if the other person starts to play with their phone. It's annoying because you're no longer watching together"". The psychologist says part of the attraction of social media is that it taps into the human appetite for sharing moments - creating a sense of seeing something together. Humans are ""addicted to sharing"", he says. ""But do you get the deeper experience from social media? The quality of such a social network online is different,"" he says.

"Dyson argued that consumers would not think the fan was cordless An advert for one of Dyson's Â£400 fans has been labelled misleading by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The video, for the company's Pure Hot and Cool Fan, suggests the fan is cordless when it actually needs to be plugged in, it said. Dyson told the ASA it did not think there was ""any reasonable prospect"" of consumers thinking a tower fan or purifier could be cordless. But after examining the ad, the ASA ordered it should not be shown again. No power sockets or electrical leads could be seen in the ad â until the final shot, when a cord appeared which was ""very thin and coloured grey on a light background"".

"Adding more ethanol to the UK's fuel mix would cut carbon by as much as taking 700,000 cars off the roads, according to a group of MPs. The All-Party Parliamentary Group for British Bioethanol,externalsays the swift introduction of E10 fuel would also help the Â£1bn British biofuel industry. E10 is a mixture of 10% ethanol with 90% petrol, double the current permitted maximum. The MPs say that Brexit has distracted the government from taking action. Used cooking oil imports may boost deforestation Gove: Time running out to stop damage to planet Fishermen 'still illegally discarding fish' One of the unintended consequences of 2015'sdiesel emissions scandalhas been a jump in the sales of petrol cars, with a knock-on effect on sales of the fuel. This has contributed to thefirst increase in emissions of CO2 from new cars,externalin two decades recorded in 2017. A significant plank of the government's plan to reduce carbon on the roads has been the introduction of biofuels made from crops, which soak up CO2 as they are grown. At present, ethanol made from wheat or sugar beet is blended into petrol to a maximum of 5%. The report's authors say that while electric cars and vehicles are the long-term solution to emissions from transport, E10 represents a big advance that could be achieved right now. ""For many reasons it is absolutely a no-brainer,"" said Nic Dakin MP, the chairman of the all-party group. ""On the environmental front, it's a cleaner, greener fuel at a time when we're trying to address air pollution and tackle climate change. ""Cars aren't going to all switch to battery power overnight and if they did there isn't the capacity in the National Grid to power all of our transportation. ""This must be a top priority for the government and we renew our call for a mandate to introduce E10 by 2020 at the latest."" In other European countries, the change to E10 has been fully embraced. France introduced the fuel in 2009 and last year it was the largest volume petrol grade sold, with 47% of the market. Germany, Belgium and Finland have also introduced E10, with other countries including China and India set to do the same. In Brazil the minimum ethanol content is now 27%. The report says that without the introduction of E10 fuel the UK's bioethanol producers, based in the North of England, will struggle to survive. Last September Vivergo, one of the three main producers of the biofuelannounced it would close its facility on Humbersidewith the loss of 150 jobs. The introduction of E10 would likely secure and strengthen the industry which has the potential to support approximately 6,000 jobs in the UK. Wheat is one of the crops that is used for making ethanol in the UK ""We built a plant in 2010, we've had four periods when the plant has been offline, and the reason for that is lack of demand,"" said Grant Pearson from Ensus, one of the UK's three ethanol production companies. ""We expected that demand would be at least twice what it is, and that move from E5 to E10 would just get us back on track."" Last year the government issued a consultation on the idea of increasing this to 10%, but since then nothing has happened, a decision that MPs describe as ""baffling"" and likely due to the distraction of Brexit. ""It is bonkers that the Department of Transport has yet to publish its consultation on the introduction of E10,"" said Nic Daikin. ""The British bioethanol industry is in a state of collapse, and ministers can not allow the fog of Brexit to distract them any longer from saving a Â£1bn industry that will not only make our cars cleaner and greener, but provide thousands of green jobs in the North and prove that the government is serious about championing the green economy."" In response, a Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We are committed to supporting cleaner and greener fuels, and we recognise the important role they have to play in decarbonising transport."" ""Following our call for evidence on E10, we intend to publish our next steps in due course."" Critics of the introduction of E10 say that it is not certified to run in some older cars, principally those manufactured before 2000. One of the UK's bioethanol plants near Middlesbrough The report says that this threat is minimal and that there is no evidence from Europe or the US where E10 is widely used of the fuel causing any significant damage to to any vehicle manufactured before the turn of the century. Indeed the report says that the fuel industry has ""given express assurances that were E10 to be mandated, motorists would still be able to purchase E5 (as octane 98) at many forecourts. Thus any older cars which are not expressly warrantied for E10 can still have access to fuel that is compatible with their engines."" Other critics of the switch are worried that going for extra ethanol in the mix might push up prices on the forecourt. ""The cost impact is minuscule,"" said Grant Pearson. ""The price of ethanol compared to petrol varies over time, we've had periods where ethanol has been cheaper than petrol. There's a tiny reduction in terms of potential mileage but its less than 1%, so depending on how heavy your shoe is you wouldn't see it in the mileage that your are doing."" If the bioethanol industry flounders, the report says, the UK would likely have to increase imports of biofuel from overseas, including used cooking oil from China, which is likely boosting the use of palm oil from deforested lands.

"This video can not be played Grant Weir has needed full-time care since the bomb attack The family of a former soldier left brain-damaged by a bomb 40 years ago said they will not accept a Troubles-related pension if injured ex-paramilitaries also receive one. County Fermanagh man Grant Weir was injured when the IRA attacked his Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) patrol. The victims' commissioner has said people badly injured in the Troubles should be able to apply for a pension. That includes those who were hurt while carrying out attacks. The commissioner, Judith Thompson, has advised the government on the issue and acknowledges there are political sensitivities around eligibility. Grant Weir was in the UDR and was on patrol when he was attacked She gave her advice to the government in May, butit has only now been made public,external. The legislation would help people who have been unable to work and earn their own pension due to severe and permanent physical and psychological injuries as a result of the conflict. Mr Weir suffered his injuries when the IRA detonated a bomb as his patrol drove past a bus stop near Rosslea in County Fermanagh on 17 July 1979. Sylvia Crowe, a church missionary who was waiting at the bus stop with two other women, was killed. Mr Weir, who was 22 when he was attacked, is cared for by his family, including his sisters Debbie Palmer and Michele Nixon. Grant's sisters Debbie (left) and Michele (right) say it is ""beyond belief"" that paramilitaries could be classified as victims ""From the moment that bomb went off, that changed our lives forever, and has affected three generations of our family,"" said Mrs Nixon. A victim's pension would ""make a massive difference"" to the family, said Mrs Palmer. ""Financially it would definitely allow us to help out with Grant a great deal,"" she said. ""However, if that also meant that potentially the... people responsible for blowing up Grant... would have an entitlement to that same pension... it's beyond belief. ""As a family, we would never accept a payment if it meant that the people who went out to destroy lives, destroy families, were to be put into the same category... as Grant, whose life they have destroyed."" Sylvia Crowe was killed in the bomb attack in which Grant Weir was injured Last month, the government saidit was examining the victims' commissioner's adviceabout the pensions. Mrs Thompson said the advice was a ""fair and reasonable response"" to support those who had suffered greatly. More than 3,600 people were killed during three decades of sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland and a further 40,000 were injured. Campaigners have been calling for some time for a pension for those severely injured during the Troubles to be introduced. It states that recipients should be people who have been unable to work or earn their own pension due to a conflict-related injury. It would also allow for the pension to be passed on to a spouse, dependent or carer for their lifetime. Judith Thompson says the government cannot ""kick this issue down the road any longer"" It states that an independent assessor would look at applications and that payments should be made based on the severity of the impact of an individual's injury. It recommends backdating payments to 2014, when the political parties and the government formally recognised the need for a pension through the signing of the Stormont House Agreement. The advice refers to the Victims and Survivors (NI) Order 2006, which makes no distinction between paramilitaries who were killed or injured and victims. Under the order, a victim is defined as: Someone who has been physically or psychologically injured as a result of a conflict-related incident; Someone who provides a substantial amount of care on a regular basis for a person who has been physically or psychologically injured as a result of a conflict-related incident; Someone who has been bereaved as a result of a conflict-related incident. The order has proved controversial, with failedattempts by unionist politicians to change the definition of a victim,external. They argue that perpetrators of violence and those injured by their own hand should not be eligible for a pension. However, other parties at Stormont have previously insistedthere should be ""no hierarchy of victims"". The commissioner is urging Westminster to legislate for the pension in the absence of devolution at Stormont. Northern Ireland has been without a government since the assembly collapsed in January 2017. Several MPs and peers had tabled amendments relating to a pension to a Northern Ireland bill currently going through Parliament, but the government insists it is still considering the issue. Mrs Thompson said the government ""cannot kick this issue down the road any longer"".

"Street Valium is also known as Street Blues Scotland's latest drug death figures are to be published on Friday - with the country expected to still have the highest rate in Europe. Public health minister Joe FitzPatrick lost his job after figures released last year showed that 1,264 people died in 2019, which was even worse than the year before. In January, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced Â£250m in extra funding over five years to tackle the rising number of fatalities after admitting that her government should have done more. But almost three years after the deaths were declared a public health emergency, what can be done to tackle the problem? Opposition parties have accused the Scottish government of cutting rehab programmes in previous years, which they say has had a big part to play in the recent upward trend in the number of deaths. There are currently 408 rehab beds in Scotland, with the Scottish government pledging to spend Â£20m a year for the next five years to increase that number across the country. Castle Craig rehab clinic, aprivate hospital,externalnear West Linton in the Scottish Borders, has treated people for alcohol and drug addiction for 30 years. Of its current patient list of 60, only two are NHS-funded. Around a quarter of its clients are Dutch - reflecting the value placed on its services by insurers in the Netherlands - with the remainder being privately funded or via health insurance. The facility's medical director, Prof Jonathan Chick, said the proportion of Scottish patients - particularly those funded by the Scottish NHS - has fallen in recent years. The weekly cost of treatment at the clinic ranges starts from Â£2,500, which Prof Chick said was out of the reach of most families - but not out of the reach of health services. Castle Craig currently has 60 patients but only two are funded by the NHS He told BBC Scotland: ""They are providing quite expensive treatments for years and years and not looking at other opportunities."" Several frontline charities and critics of the Scottish government's approach to tackling the crisis have backed the Scottish Conservatives'Right to Recovery Bill,external. The Tories say it will enshrine in law individuals' right to their chosen drug treatment, including residential rehabilitation services, which the party says would help get people off drugs and recover rather than simply managing their addictions. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""This proposal has the backing of frontline groups and experts across the political spectrum. SNP MSPs are reportedly on board privately. We only need the government to wake up, stop stalling and support it."" Drugs minister Angela Constance said the government was working hard to get more people into treatment that works for them as quickly as possible. She added: ""Without treatment, there is little hope of recovery so we are funding as many community and third-sector initiatives as we can so that individuals have the widest possible choice and can opt for the support which suits them and their family."" Naloxone can reverse the effects of an opiate overdose if used in time The Scottish government set up a drugs deaths taskforce in response to the crisis, which met for the first time in September 2019. It has spent time gathering evidence and proposing changes that it says could quickly save lives. The main focus of this has been the distribution of Naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an opiate-related overdose. Users often die because they are unable to breathe and, if used in time, Naloxone can restore breathing and save their lives. Drug campaigners have been trying to get the kits into the hands of anyone who might have or be a witness to a drug overdose. This is mainly drug users and relatives but could also be anyone involved in services such as hostels or outreach workers. Almost two-thirds of ambulance crews - who have been using Naloxone for many years - are now also able to distribute it to people who might need it, with the remainder due to be trained by the end of this year. Police Scotland has also run a pilot projectfor its officers to carry Naloxone while on patrol. The most significant harm reduction services are methadone and buprenorphine which are offered to heroin addicts to reduce the risk of fatal overdose. Methadone is controversial because it has been implicated in more drug-related deaths than heroin, the drug it is a substitute for. Experts point out that methadone is recognised by the World Health Organization as an essential medicine but say it is not always delivered effectively. David Liddell, of the Scottish Drugs Forum, said there was a ""massive issue"" around people on too low doses. ""We estimated around half of those on methadone are on too low a dose, so what is happening for individuals is they are then forced to top-up on street drugs,"" he said. ""That's fuelling the poly-drug use problem that we have and leading to deaths as a result."" He also said there were problems around access to methadone services and retention of drug users within treatment. He said some countries such as Norway had a policy of ""no unplanned discharges"" and they would actively seek to bring people back into treatment. Earlier this month, it was announced that Buvidal - an alternative to methadone that contains buprenorphine - wouldbe rolled outacross the country after a successful trial in prisons. It allows patients to receive an injection every 28 days instead of having to visit a chemist every day to take their medication. It is hoped this will allow patients to focus on improving their lives and overall health rather than managing their dependence. Scotland's new drug tsar has called for a public health approach All the experts who gave evidence to Westminster's Scottish affairs committee said the stigma around drug addiction was stopping people seeking treatment. Prof Matheson said the people who needed help were the ""most marginalised in Scottish society"". She said they were not willing, interested or engaged with services because they were stigmatised and did not want to come forward. Prof Matheson said only about 40% of people who needed treatment were getting it. She said: ""They don't want to go to their GP if they have health problems, they feel stigmatised if they have a criminal record and they are stigmatised about getting work. ""This is keeping people excluded from the help and the care they need."" Prof Matheson said that, as a result, older drug users - who have a range of respiratory, cardiac, liver and kidney issues - were not seeking treatment and were physically more vulnerable to an overdose. Denmark is among the countries to have introduced fix rooms It is now more than four years since Glasgow City Council first proposed allowing users to take their own drugs under the supervision of medical staff at a special facility in the city. The idea is to encourage users who inject heroin or cocaine on Glasgow's streets to enter a safe and clean environment. It is hoped the special room would encourage addicts into treatment, cut down on heroin needles on city streets and counter the spread of diseases such as HIV. The so-called ""fix rooms"" are already operating in some overseas countries but this would be the first of its kind in the UK. They have the support of the Scottish government but drug laws are reserved to Westminster. The House of Commons committee that investigated Scotland's drug crisisrecommended new legislation to provide for safe drug consumption facilitiesbut it was rejected in the UK government's response to its report. The UK government said: ""We want to do all we can to stop people having access to drugs that could ultimately kill them. No illegal drug-taking can be assumed to be safe and there is no safe way to take them."" Glasgow announced Scotland's first scheme giving drug addicts diamorphine, a pharmaceutical-grade form of heroin, in November 2019. The Enhanced Drug Treatment Service (EDTS) aims to use the medically-licensed drug to treat patients with the most severe, long-standing and complex addictions.Six ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis They will have to attend the clinic, which has been licensed by the Home Office, twice a day, every day. It is hoped the facility will help reduce street drug use, overdose deaths and the spread of HIV in the city. The Daily Record is campaigning for decriminalisation of drug use The Daily Record newspaper launched a campaign two years agocalling for the decriminalisation of drug use.,external It said Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Canada and, most notably, Portugal were among 25 nations to loosen the punitive attitude to drug possession to enable treatment programmes to succeed. The Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (RCPE) has alsorecently calledfor the Scottish and UK governments to seriously consider decriminalising drug possession. Changing the law to ""decriminalise"" does not mean class A drugs would be legal, but people would not be prosecuted for possession for personal use. All UK drugs misuse legislation is currently reserved to Westminster. The 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act bans the possession, supply, manufacture, import and export of controlled drugs except by licence. A cross-party Westminster committee - chaired by SNP MP Pete Wishart but including four Conservative MPs, three Labour members, two Lib Dems and two other SNP MPs - found that decriminalisation was a ""public health"" approach that could cut the stigma around problem drug use and encourage people to seek treatment. Schemes elsewhere channel drug addicts committing low level crimes into treatment instead of jail. Police Scotland's Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson called for radical reform, saying politicians should have the ""confidence and courage"" to decriminalise. He said the criminal justice process was actually pushing people into a place where there was more harm. The woman leading the Scottish government's drugs taskforce, Prof Catriona Matheson, told BBC Scotland the evidence for decriminalisation was strong. She said: ""It is about not putting these marginalised drug users into prison because that further marginalises them and that makes the recovery all the more difficult."" The UK government later rejected the report's recommendation to reform the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act and decriminalise drugs for personal use. It said decriminalisation would not ""eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence"". It added: ""There is a strong link between drugs and crime, which is why we reject the assertion that the Department for Health and Social Care should lead on drug misuse. We know that people who regularly use heroin, cocaine or crack cocaine are estimated to commit around 45% of all acquisitive crime."" The Scottish Greens have called for both the UK and Scottish governments to admit that the so-called ""war on drugs"" has failed, and to instead focus on ""restoring people's dignity and treating their addiction, rather than criminalising them"".

"""I still have a really deep relationship with that song,"" says Gary Lightbody. ""It's a beautiful moment every time you play it."" Snow Patrol's ballad Chasing Cars has been crowned the most-played song of the 21st Century on UK radio. Originally released in 2006, the lovestruck ballad never reached number one in the UK, but remained on the charts for more than three years. It took up a similar residency on the airwaves, where it has become the most popular song of the last 20 years. Second place went to Black Eyed Peas' I Gotta Feeling, while Pharrell's similarly upbeat Happy came third. ""It's unbelievable,"" Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody told the BBC. ""I'm not sure how that happened."" Asked to explain the Chasing Cars' appeal, he said: ""It's an emotionally open song and it's a simple song.  But it's also unabashedly a love song, and we don't really have any others. ""The way it unifies an audience is the thing I most cherish about it. It's a beautiful moment every time you play it.""

The song was taken from Snow Patrol's fourth album, Eyes Open. It was the 14th biggest-selling single of 2006, and the last song played live on Top of the Pops. Radio's most-played songs revealed Where did Snow Patrol go for seven years? Lightbody was presented with a special award marking the achievement on Tuesday by music licensing body PPL, which tracks all the music played on radio and television in the UK, as it marked its 85th anniversary. Speaking to BBC News, Lightbody looked back on the creation of Chasing Cars in a wine-fuelled, all-night recording session. I read that you'd written Chasing Cars in the garden of your producer's house. Is that right? Yes, Jacknife Lee had a studio in the shed of his garden and we went down there with a couple of bottles of wine, and we wrote through the night. In fact, we wrote 10 songs that night - and five of them ended up on Eyes Open, so that was pretty much half the album. Normally when you listen back to the music you wrote after a few glasses of wine, you go, 'Ah well, better luck next time'. But that particular evening, [we] gathered a lot of good stuff. So what was in the air that night? I'm not sure. We were writing a Snow Patrol record, but we were also tasked with writing some songs for some other people - so that might have taken some pressure off. But by the next morning, none of those songs were going to anybody else, that's for sure! Who might have recorded Chasing Cars if you hadn't kept it? Oh, I'm not going to tell you that! That's not fair! Lightbody received his award from PPL boss Peter Leathem on Tuesday night Everyone knows the ""If I just lay here"" part. Had you written that lyric before the session? No, it came spontaneously. The lyrics for that song all came that night. They just came out onto the page. And that's how I used to write - with just a flow. They would generally just sort of come out, and I wouldn't edit, for better or worse. So with Chasing Cars, it was just what was happening at that moment in my life. I was in love. So it was a true, true representation of what was going on. I guess that's the secret. It's real emotion, with no filter and no censorship. Yeah, yeah, that's very well put. It was as spontaneous a song as I've ever written. There's very few that were written so quickly. That's why trying to like follow up or trying to like recreate a hit like that is a fool's errand. It's just never going to work that way again, because it's just about the magic that's in the air, the environment, the mood that you're in that day. All the chemistry comes together in that moment, and it can't be recreated. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Chasing Cars beat I Gotta Feeling and Pharrell's Happy. What do you make of those songs? I mean, it would seem that there's a pattern in there, and that pattern has nothing to do with Chasing Cars. They're very upbeat songs that are giving an audience permission to kind of jump up and down and be happy. Whereas Chasing Cars is a little bit more reflective. But it's good company to be in, because those songs have been absolutely dominant. People always say that writing a hit Christmas song is like a retirement plan... So is this songyourretirement plan?
