"This video can not be played Four candidates remain in the race for the Labour leadership The five Labour MPs standing for leader have said party divisions stand in the way of winning an election. In the first hustings, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Emily Thornberry, Sir Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips made their pitches to the membership. Sir Keir said ""we've had far too much division"", while Ms Phillips said the ""name-calling has been horrendous"". Party members in Liverpool questioned them on issues from Brexit to anti-Semitism. It was the first in a series of events across the country before Jeremy Corbyn's successor is elected on 4 April. This video can not be played The five candidates in the race for the Labour leadership set out how they would take on Boris Johnson. Deputy leader candidates Rosena Allin-Khan, Dawn Butler, Richard Burgon, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner are also answering questions in a separate hustings. Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour leadership: What does Keir Starmer stand for? Long-Bailey against 24-week disability abortion Which Labour contender is the most working-class? The five leadership candidates all acknowledged that Labour had suffered from division and in-fighting. ""We have to be honest with ourselves that over the last four years we haven't been united as a party,"" said Mrs Long-Bailey. Sir Keir said that the unity of the party ""has to be modelled from the top"". ""Don't trash the last Labour government, don't trash the last four years,"" he said. Although all the candidates criticised the party's record on anti-Semitism, Ms Phillips accused some others of ""keeping quiet"" on the issue. ""As somebody who was in the room, struggling for an independent system - at lots and lots of meetings - I have to say I don't remember some of the people here being in that particular room or being in those particular fights,"" she said. Ms Nandy said a ""collective failure of leadership at the top of the party has let us all down"", while Mrs Long-Bailey, a Jeremy Corbyn ally, said: ""We can never let that level of mistrust happen again."" Ms Thornberry said Labour ""must be critical of a far-right government of Israel""  but said that blaming Jews is ""where racism begins"". Candidates were asked how they would bring the party and the country together over Brexit. Warning of the threat of no trade deal with the EU at the end of the transition period this year, Ms Thornberry said the party needs ""someone in this fight who has been on the right side all along"". Ms Nandy said Labour has allowed the Tories to divide people, pitting the young against the old and cities against towns, as they ""airbrushed out the nuance"". She called for the Labour HQ to be moved out of London, as a ""powerful symbol"" of its commitment to empower regional communities. Sir Keir urged the party to let go of the Leave and Remain labels and ""focus on the future"", while Ms Long-Bailey said the country needed a ""democratic revolution"" because voters disliked the centralisation of power in Westminster as much as Brussels. Ms Phillips said the party needed to ""start talking to people's hearts and talking to people in a language people hear and receive, because that is what Boris Johnson does"". Find out more about the candidates, including their early life, time before Parliament, record as an MP, and leadership pitch: Sir Keir Starmer Emily Thornberry Rebecca Long-Bailey Jess Phillips Lisa Nandy The hunt for a new Labour leader was triggered when Mr Corbyn stepped down following the party's fourth general election defeat in a row. In order to make the final ballot, each of the Labour leadership hopefuls must securethe backing of unions and local parties. The five contenders need the support of 5% of local parties or at least three affiliates - two must be unions - by 14 February to make the final ballot. Members of the public who join the party or become affiliated supporters before 20 January will be eligible to vote in the contest. This video can not be played What matters to members in this leadership election? AYouGov poll of 1,005 Labour members for the Times,externalon Friday suggested Ms Thornberry would go out in the first round of voting with just 3%, with Ms Nandy knocked out in the second round and Ms Phillips in the third, with most of her second preference votes going to Sir Keir. The poll - which only includes full Labour members, and not others who are entitled to vote - indicates Sir Keir would beat Mrs Long-Bailey in the final round by 63% to 37%, once the other candidates have been eliminated. It suggests Angela Rayner is on course to win the deputy leadership election in the first round with 57%. Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour leadership: What does Keir Starmer stand for?

"Saracens have won four of the last five Premiership titles Reigning champions Saracens will be relegated from rugby union's top flight at the end of this season following persistent salary cap breaches, Premiership Rugby has confirmed. Sarries had already been deducted 35 points for the current Premiership campaign and fined Â£5.4m for three seasons' spending above the cap. Proof of immediate cap compliance was required to avoid further sanctions. Saracens ""accept"" the relegation and ""apologise for the mistakes made"". In a statement, the club added: ""Our goal is to rebuild confidence and trust. We have accepted the unprecedented measure of automatic relegation from the Premiership at the end of the 2019-2020 season. ""The board must embody the values of the club, learn from its mistakes so the club can come back stronger. ""It is in the wider interests of the Premiership and English rugby to take this decisive step, to ensure everybody is able once again to focus on the game of rugby, which we all love."" Saracens will finish this season before entering the Championship for 2020-21. 'The most remarkable scandal in the domestic game' Saracens Q&A: Why are Saracens being relegated and what happens next? Stars can still play for England despite relegation ""Premiership Rugby is prepared to take strong action to enforce the regulations governing fair competition between our clubs,"" chief executive Darren Childs said. ""At the conclusion of dialogue with Saracens about their compliance with the Salary Cap Regulations, it has been decided that Saracens will be relegated at the end of this season. ""At the same time as enforcing the existing regulations, we want to ensure a level playing field for all clubs in the future, which is why we have asked Lord Myners to carry out an independently-led review of the salary cap."" In the past five years Saracens have dominated both domestically and in Europe, winning four Premiership titles and three European crowns. This decision also means that should the club successfully retain its European Champions Cup crown, they would not be permitted to defend the title next season. Their cup campaign continues on Sunday, when they welcome Pool Four leaders Racing 92 to Allianz Park, hoping to better Munster's result and qualify for the knockout phase. Neil Golding, whotook over from Nigel Wrayas Saracens chairman earlier this month, said: ""I acknowledge the club has made errors in the past and we unreservedly apologise for those mistakes. ""I and the rest of the board are committed to overseeing stringent new governance measures to ensure regulatory compliance going forward."" Premiership Rugby introduced the salary cap in 1999 to ensure the financial viability of all clubs and the competition. Exeter's frustrations were highlighted by back-to-back Twickenham defeats by Saracens Although Saracens' relegation is the punishment some clubs were seeking, there is still a sense of dissatisfaction with the outcome among their fiercest critics. Exeter Chiefs were beaten by Sarries two years in succession in the Premiership's showpiece final, and their chief executive Tony Rowe is still bitter about how long it has taken the game's authorities to take firm action. ""They've taken relegation,"" Rowe told BBC Radio Devon following the news. ""Let's be very honest about this before people have sympathy with Saracens. ""They had two choices: they could either open up their books so that Premiership Rugby could do a forensic audit of exactly what has gone on, or they could take relegation. So it was their choice not to open up their books. ""Premiership Rugby - all the chairmen - we just want to move on. It was their opportunity to open up everything to the salary cap people, or take relegation. They have decided to take relegation."" He added: ""We just want to move on. They have cheated. And I'm just a bit upset it has taken so long to do this. At the moment they are still picking their team each week largely from the squad they had last year which is still in breach of the salary cap. They have been asked by the rest of the Premiership clubs to reduce that (the squad) back as well. ""Everybody has had their suspicions for a long time. Five years ago they were hauled over the coals for similar offences. We just want a level playing field. Every club just wants the same opportunity and chances and let's hope we get back to that."" Asked whether Saracens should be allowed to keep their titles, he replied: ""I'm not sure about that. There is still some more to come out and I'm not privy to talk about that at the moment."" The move calls into question the futures of the club's international stars, such as England players Owen Farrell, Mako Vunipola and Maro Itoje, given the need to trim the wage bill and the fact the club will no longer be competing in elite competition, both domestically and continentally. While the Rugby Football Union have confirmed that players operating in the Championship will be eligible for England duty, financial constraints could make it difficult for the club to retain the services of their elite personnel. One issue the players themselves may find is that potential suitors among other clubs have already put much of their recruitment for next season in place and already spent a large extent of their cap. The other concern is that a move to France's Top 14, a regular destination for top-level southern hemisphere talent and rugby league converts from the Australasian National Rugby League, may be a potentially lucrative option. Such a move would guarantee elite-level competition but would also rule out international representative rugby as the RFU will only select home-based talent. Thus far, Scarlets-bound full-backLiam Williams is the only confirmed departurefrom the club, and the Wales international was due to end his contract at Saracens at the end of the season in any event. BBC Rugby Union correspondent Chris Jones This is an extraordinary story - the biggest in English club rugby history - as the Saracens dynasty dramatically crumbles. Who knows what would have happened if the club had taken a different approach back in November, when they met the initial punishment with indignation rather than contrition - a stance that infuriated their rivals. But with the club still breaching the cap in January, Saracens and Premiership Rugby have come to what appears to be a negotiated settlement, with the club accepting relegation. However, while there is finally confirmation of their fate, the questions still come thick and fast: namely, what on earth happens to this star-studded squad between now and next season?

"The Duke of Sussex grew up in the media spotlight - from a young royal dealing with his mother's death, through his partying teenage years, to his career in the military. Since then Harry has followed in his mother's footsteps, doing charity work across the globe. He has got married and become a father. Now he and the Duchess of Sussex have begun a new chapter:giving up their royal duties, HRH titles and public fundingand living in California. Harry has tried to balance his public and private lives. At times, the publicity that comes with being sixth in line to the throne has helped him to bolster support for his charitable endeavours. But there have also been times when that attention has become too much, and he has fought fiercely for his family's privacy. Prince Harry was born in 1984, the second child of the Prince and Princess of Wales Born at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, on 15 September 1984, the prince was christened Henry Charles Albert David by the Archbishop of Canterbury in December of that year in St George's Chapel, Windsor. But it was officially announced from the start of his life that he would be known as Harry. Although christened Henry, he has always been known as Harry Harry with his mother and brother on a trip to Thorpe Park in 1993 The prince's childhood was cut short when his mother died in 1997. Princess Diana was killed in a crash in Paris, aged 36, as the car she was in sped through a tunnel followed by paparazzi photographers. Her death shook royal fans the world over, but it was 12-year-old Harry and 15-year-old William whose lives changed forever. The funeral, which featured the image of the boys walking behind their mother's hearse to attend the service at Westminster Abbey, remainsone of the most-watched programmes on the BBC. Prince Harry stood between his father, Prince Charles, and his older brother, Prince William, as they watched the hearse carry Diana's coffin ""I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well,"" the prince said in aninterview with the Daily Telegraph,externalin 2017. He added: ""I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and all sorts of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle."" The prince followed the educational path of his older brother William, at Wetherby School in Notting Hill, before entering Eton in 1998. Harry, five, on his first day at Wetherby School, Notting Hill Prince Harry watching his brother sign the Eton College entrance book in 1995 - he would follow in his footsteps, joining the school three years later After leaving Eton with two A-levels in 2003, Harry took a gap year. He worked on a sheep farm in Australia and with Aids orphans in Lesotho, paving the way for the charity he later set up there. Prince Charles took his sons on annual skiing holidays to Switzerland Attention from the press has been a constant in Harry's life. The front page of a 2002 edition of the (now defunct) News of the World roared: ""Harry's drugs shame"",  and claimed Prince Charles sent his son to visit a rehab clinic as punishment for smoking cannabis. St James's Palace confirmed the then 17-year-old had ""experimented with the drug on several occasions"" but said the use was not ""regular"". Then in October 2004, there was a scuffle with a photographer outside a club. A royal spokesman said at the time the 20-year-old prince was hit in the face by a camera ""when photographers crowded around him"". As part of his gap year, Prince Harry spent time at an orphanage in Lesotho, in southern Africa When Harry pushed the camera away, ""it's understood that a photographer's lip was cut"", the spokesman added. The following year, an image of the prince dressed as a Nazi at a fancy dress party sparked outrage. Clarence House later said the prince had apologised for any ""offence or embarrassment"" caused and had realised ""it was a poor choice of costume"". And in 2009, video footage emerged of Harry using offensive language to describe an Asian member of his Army platoon. St James's Palace said the prince was ""extremely sorry for any offence his words might cause"" but said he had ""used the term without any malice and as a nickname about a highly popular member of his platoon"". Harry enjoyed lighter-hearted press coverage during the London 2012 Olympic Games, in his role as an Olympic ambassador. The prince was an Olympic ambassador at the London 2012 Games In the same year he spent a lot of time in front of the cameras for the Queen's Jubilee. As part of those celebrations Harry completed his first royal solo tour overseas with visits to Belize, the Bahamas, Brazil and Jamaica. However, that August, photos emerged of the prince and a young woman naked in a Las Vegas hotel room. The two photos,published on US gossip website TMZ and later in the Sun newspaper, were taken on a private break with friends, with the site reporting the prince was in a group playing ""strip billiards"". He later said he had ""probably let myself down"" but added: ""I was in a private area and there should have been a certain amount of privacy that one should expect."" There is, however, a saving grace to the scrapes Harry has found himself in. As the younger brother to the expected future king, Harry has relatively little responsibility. Like the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and Prince Charles's younger siblings, Harry is a ""spare to the heir"" - and a world away from the throne. So Harry's indiscretions have done little to dent public opinion of him. And he has perhaps had a freer existence because of it; security worries would have made active service in Afghanistan impossible for his older brother, for example. Harry served a tour in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot Harry spent 10 years in the armed forces, becoming the first royal in more than 25 years to serve in a war zone. He was left disappointed in 2007 when Army chiefs decided not to send him to Iraq because of ""unacceptable risks"", but later spent 10 weeks serving in Afghanistan in 2008. Harry returned to the country as an Apache helicopter pilot from September 2012 to January 2013, before qualifying as an Apache commander in July 2013. He later describedhow he had shot at Taliban insurgents, and said that being in Afghanistan was ""as normal as it's going to get"" for him. The prince said quitting the Army had been a ""really tough decision"" When heannounced he would be leaving the Army in 2015, the prince said his time in the military would ""stay with me for the rest of my life"". This is reflected in his charity work, which mostly concentrates on mental health and helping service veterans. Harry's most notable charity work so far is his founding and chairing of the Invictus Games in 2014. The Paralympic-style international competition for injured ex-service personnel has been held in London, Orlando, Toronto and Sydney. The prince has been the driving force behind the Invictus Games He has also supported the charity Walking With the Wounded, for injured veterans. The prince's other charity work includes supporting conservation projects in Africa and jointly founding Sentebale, a charity to help orphans in Lesotho. On his visit to Angola in September, Harry said landmines are ""an unhealed scar of war"" Harry and his brother William have worked together on various charity initiatives He has continued his mother's work helping children affected by HIV and Aids, and supporting the Halo Trust's work in clearing landmines. Diana captured global attention when she walked through a live minefield in central Angola in 1997. She died in Paris later that year, before seeing the full impact of her visit - such as the signing of an international treaty to outlaw the weapons - but Harry highlighted her achievements whenhe retraced her stepsin September 2019. Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge supported Heads Together runners at the London Marathon in 2017 In later years, Harry has had counselling to help him deal with his mother's death. He was best man at his brother William's wedding in April 2011, and has since spoken of how hard it was not to have Diana there. In acandid interview with the Daily Telegraph,external, he described shutting down all of his emotions for nearly 20 years and refusing to thinking about his mother. This, he said, had a ""quite serious effect"" on his personal life and his work, and brought him close to a breakdown ""on numerous occasions"". He also said he would probably regret""for the rest of his life"" how brief his last phone call with his mother was, and spoke of her ""fun"" parenting. She was a ""total kid through and through"", he said. Harry, William and the Duchess of Cambridge joined forces to focus their campaigning efforts on mental health. They founded Heads Together, which aims to tackle stigma and fundraise for new support services. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were first pictured together at the Invictus Games in 2017 As one of the world's most high-profile bachelors, Harry's love life has drawn much interest over the years. In late 2016, he confirmed a new relationship with US actor, Meghan Markle,while issuing a statement,externalaccusing journalists of harassing her. He described ""nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers"", attempts by reporters and photographers to get into her home and the ""bombardment"" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life. The pair had met on a blind date, organised by a mutual friend. Then after just two dates, they went on holiday together to Botswana. Profile: Duchess of Sussex In September 2017, the year before their wedding, Meghan told Vanity Fair magazine she and Harry were ""two people who are really happy and in love,external"". Andin an interview that November, when their engagement was announced, Harry admitted he had never heard of Meghan before his friend introduced them, and was ""beautifully surprised"". He designed the engagement ring for Meghan, including two diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection. The couple married in May 2018at a ceremony at St George's Chapel in Windsor, and consequently became known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. On a 16-day tour of Australia that October, the duke and duchess announced they were expecting their first child, adding that they were happy to share the ""personal joy"" of their news. Baby Archie, described by Harry as ""our own little bundle of joy"", was born on 6 May 2019. Prince Harry said he was ""absolutely thrilled"" with the birth of his first child, Archie The duke's past few years have been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows. In 2019, he and his wife split their household office from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the subsequent launch of the Sussexes' Instagram account amassed more than one million followers in record-breaking time (five hours and 45 minutes). The joy of becoming parents was followed days later by news Harry had accepted damages and an apology from a paparazzi agency that had used a helicopter to take photographs of his home in the Cotswolds. In June, the Sussexes announced they would split from the charity they shared with the Cambridges - fuelling speculation of a rift between brothers Harry and William. This video can not be played Prince Harry on his brother, William in 2019: ""We are certainly on different paths at the moment"" A 10-day tour of Africa at the end of September 2019 started well. Harry raised awareness for causes close to his heart, and the couple introduced Archie to anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu. But during the tour, the Duchess of Sussex launched legal action against the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The duke and duchess went on a 10-day tour of Africa in September 2019 In a lengthy statement Harry said ""positive"" coverage of the tour of Africa had exposed the ""double standards"" of the ""press pack that has vilified [the duchess] almost daily for the past nine months"". And in an ITV documentary, filmed during the tour and broadcast the following month, the duchess admitted she was struggling to adjust to royal life, while the duke said his mental health was a matter of ""constant management"". Then, at the start of 2020, the couplemade a bombshell announcementthat they would be stepping back as senior royals. Later, Harry would tell host James Corden that the decision to step back was taken to protect himself and his family from the ""toxic"" situation created by the UK press. Their difficult relationship with the UK press saw both Harry and Meghan take legal action against publishers, as well ascutting ties with tabloid newspapers. After a brief stint in Canada, the couple now lives in California and are expecting their second child. The duke has since spoken out on several issues, includingon structural racism,human rightsandunconscious bias. The duke and duchess gave an interview with Oprah, who went to their wedding And the couple have signed deals to make shows and podcasts with Netflix and Spotify. His charity work continues - although he has returned his military appointments and royal patronages. Buckingham Palace said he and Meghan will keep their ""private patronages and associations"". He told interviewer Corden that his ""life is always going to be about public service"". But much of the rest of his future - including how he will continue to carve his own path - remains unclear.

"The Duke of Sussex grew up in the media spotlight - from a young royal dealing with his mother's death, through his partying teenage years, to his career in the military. Since then Harry has followed in his mother's footsteps, doing charity work across the globe. He has got married and become a father. Now he and the Duchess of Sussex have begun a new chapter:giving up their royal duties, HRH titles and public fundingand living in California. Harry has tried to balance his public and private lives. At times, the publicity that comes with being sixth in line to the throne has helped him to bolster support for his charitable endeavours. But there have also been times when that attention has become too much, and he has fought fiercely for his family's privacy. Prince Harry was born in 1984, the second child of the Prince and Princess of Wales Born at St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, on 15 September 1984, the prince was christened Henry Charles Albert David by the Archbishop of Canterbury in December of that year in St George's Chapel, Windsor. But it was officially announced from the start of his life that he would be known as Harry. Although christened Henry, he has always been known as Harry Harry with his mother and brother on a trip to Thorpe Park in 1993 The prince's childhood was cut short when his mother died in 1997. Princess Diana was killed in a crash in Paris, aged 36, as the car she was in sped through a tunnel followed by paparazzi photographers. Her death shook royal fans the world over, but it was 12-year-old Harry and 15-year-old William whose lives changed forever. The funeral, which featured the image of the boys walking behind their mother's hearse to attend the service at Westminster Abbey, remainsone of the most-watched programmes on the BBC. Prince Harry stood between his father, Prince Charles, and his older brother, Prince William, as they watched the hearse carry Diana's coffin ""I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well,"" the prince said in aninterview with the Daily Telegraph,externalin 2017. He added: ""I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and all sorts of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle."" The prince followed the educational path of his older brother William, at Wetherby School in Notting Hill, before entering Eton in 1998.

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex recently announced they would step back as senior royals. Here we answer some of the questions we have received from readers about Prince Harry and Meghan's possible plans. The duke and duchess have said they do not have any special tax privileges, so it is likely the usual rules apply. It's not clear how much time Prince Harry and Meghan intend to spend in Canada. But if they seek permanent residency there, or they spend 183 days in a tax year in the country, then Canada will consider them resident for tax purposes. Even if they spend less time abroad - perhaps so Meghan cancontinue to fulfil the requirements for British citizenship- they will be expected to pay tax on any income they earn from working in Canada. The Queen is Canada's head of state. Recent polls have found Canadians leaning towards severing ties with the monarchy but some individual royals are still seen very favourably. Prince Harry and Meghan enjoy a laugh at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto A poll of 1,000 people last year by Research Co suggested33% wanted an elected head of state, while 31% wanted to keep the monarchy,external. Republican sentiment is more common in French-speaking Quebec, where 53% said they wanted a republic. But Prince Harry himself has a 70% favourability rating in Canada, while for Meghan it is 60%. Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights The Sussexes' statement in fulland palace response How could Harry and Meghan make money? Prince Harry and Meghan have said they will no longer use their HRH titles. From this spring, they will become known as Harry, Duke of Sussex, and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. The Queen made Prince Harry Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel on his wedding day, in May 2018. Meghan became the Duchess of Sussex. Prince Harry and Meghan became Duke and Duchess of Sussex on their wedding day Prince Harry will remain a prince, having been born one. Only the monarch could restore any of their other titles. Prince Harry and Meghan applied in June 2019 totrademark the ""Sussex Royal"" brand,externalin the UK, for items including books, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social-care services. Their application was published in December 2019. If no-one objects, the trademark could be registered as early as February 2020. They are also reportedly seeking to register the brand as a global trademark covering a wide range of goods and services including clothing, stationery and ""emotional support"" groups. The couple spent Christmas in Canada and Meghan recently returned to the country with her eight-month-old son, Archie. As a Briton, the prince is entitled to spendup to six months a year as a visitor,externalin Canada - anything longer than that and he would have to apply for a visa. As an American citizen, the same rules apply for his wife. What questions do you have about Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to step back as senior royals?

"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The couple said last year that they would step back as ""senior"" royals, and work to become financially independent. In 2016, Kensington Palace released a statement confirming Harry had been dating US actress Meghan Markle ""for a few months"". They were pictured in public for the first time in Toronto, attending a wheelchair tennis match during the 2017 Invictus Games. They announced their engagement a few weeks after being first pictured together. Meghan told BBC News that Harry's proposal was ""just an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic"". In February 2018, the couple took part in their first joint engagement with Prince Harry's brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. As Meghan joined their Royal Foundation charity, Harry joked the foursome were now ""stuck together"". The couple were married at Windsor Castle, on 19 May 2018, with 1,200 public invitations to the grounds of the castle. They travelled through the town in a horse-drawn carriage. Up to 100,000 well-wishers lined the route as the duke and duchess travelled through Windsor. The couple exchanged vows and rings before the Queen and 600 guests at St George's Chapel. The couple kissed on the steps of St George's Chapel. The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal Family attended the wedding. The newlyweds held hands after the ceremony. In June 2018, the Queen and the duchess were seen at their first royal engagement together, as they officially opened the Mersey Gateway Bridge and Chester's Storyhouse Theatre. That autumn, Kensington Palace revealed the duchess was pregnant and the couple's baby was due in the spring. Shortly after the announcement, they embarked on their first official overseas tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. On one of their engagements, the couple posed with OneWave, a surfing community group that raises awareness of mental health and wellbeing, at Bondi Beach, in Sydney, Australia On 6 May, 2019, Meghan gave birth to a boy, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, who became seventh in line to the throne. Harry told reporters: ""It's been the most amazing experience I could ever possibly imagine"". In June 2019, the couple announced they were splitting from the charity they shared with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, to set up their own foundation. Last autumn, Archie travelled with the couple to southern Africa on their first royal tour as a family, and was a big hit with Archbishop Desmond Tutu. An image of a beaming Prince Harry holding his son while on an extended stay in Canada was released by the couple as part of an Instagram compilation summing up their year. Following their trip, the couple were pictured in January on a visit to Canada House. In February, the couple announced that they are expecting their second child.

"Prince Harry and Meghan will no longer use their HRH titles and will not receive public funds for royal duties, Buckingham Palace has announced. The couple will also no longer formally represent the Queen. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex intend to repay Â£2.4m of taxpayer money for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, which will remain their UK family home, the statement added. The new arrangement comes into effect in spring this year, the palace said. The statement comes after the Queen held talks with the couple on Monday about their future, following their announcement that they wanted to""step back"" as senior royalsand divide their time between the UK and Canada. Queen's statement on Harry and Meghan in full The Harry and Meghan story Their future: Your questions answered The Queen said following ""many months of conversations and more recent discussions"" she was ""pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family"". ""Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family,"" the statement continued. She thanked them for their ""dedicated work"", adding that she was ""particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family."" On Sunday, the Queen made her first public appearance since the announcement, arriving at church with the Duke of York. The Queen smiled broadly as she was greeted at St Mary the Virgin Church in Norfolk In a separate statement, Buckingham Palace said: ""The Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family."" HRH, an abbreviation of His/Her Royal Highness, is used as part of the title of some members of the royal family. BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""When they first issued that statement about what they wanted, they talked about forging this progressive role within the Royal Family, about stepping back from royal duties. This isn't stepping back, it's stepping away entirely."" She said the question that will ""hang over them"" for the next year is what their commercial life will look like. ""This will be a test of the integrity of Harry and Meghan,"" she said. This video can not be played ""Nothing like this has ever happened before"" â royal correspondent Daniela Relph explains As well as repaying the cost of refurbishing Frogmore Cottage, the couple will pay a ""commercial rent"" for the property. Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess understood they were required to withdraw from royal duties, including official military appointments. ""While they can no longer formally represent the Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty,"" it said. The statement added that the pair would continue to maintain their private patronages and associations. The Rugby Football League said it was ""delighted"" to continue to have the duke as patron, praising his ""genuine commitment"". Map Ives, director and founder of Rhino Conservation Botswana, said he had already been told by an official in Harry's office that the duke ""wants to continue"" his patronage of the organisation. ""If anything our relationship should get stronger,"" Mr Ives said. There has been much speculation on who will provide security arrangements for the couple and how much it will cost, but the palace said it would not comment on such matters. Prince Harry hosted the Rugby League World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace on Thursday Harry and Meghan's new website, sussexroyal.com, was updated following the Queen's statement to say: ""Information on the roles and work of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be updated on this website in due course."" The party prince who carved his own path Your questions answered: Tax, titles and trademarks Earlier this month, Harry and Meghan said they wanted to create a ""progressive new role"" within the institution, where they would be financially independent and divide their time between the UK and North America. Last year, they both spoke about the difficulties of royal life and media attention. The duke said he feared his wife would fall victim to""the same powerful forces"" that led to his mother's death. A legal case against the Mail on Sunday for publishing what the duchess says was a private letter has also raised the prospect ofher father testifying against her. In comments for a forthcoming Channel 5 documentary, Thomas Markle accused the couple of ""cheapening"" the Royal Family and ""making it shabby"". ""Every young girl wants to become a princess and she got that and now she's tossing that away,"" he said. ""It looks like she's tossing that away for money."" They will always be, the Queen writes, ""much loved members of my family"". But that's about it. No royal title, no royal duties, no military appointments, no tours, most of their time spent in Canada, no public money. It is harder to think of a much cleaner break than this. Harry and Meghan are still members of the Royal Family, but they are effectively no longer royal. The early talk was of a much more mixed life - one where perhaps Harry and Meghan continued with some royal duties, dividing their time equally between the UK and Canada. But the contradictions and conflicts of interest were too many. There are still lots of details to thrash out. And the whole thing will be reviewed after a year. But a new life awaits Harry and Meghan - celebrities, certainly, but a different kind of royalty. Some questions about the couple's future status remain unanswered, including what their tax and immigration status will be in the UK and Canada. It is not yet known whether Meghan still intends to gain British citizenship, which would entail her spending a certain amount of time in the UK. While the couple intend to divide their time between the UK and Canada, it is expected that they will spend the majority of their time in Canada. Former press secretary to the Queen Dickie Arbiter said the new arrangement brings a crisis for the Royal Family to an acceptable conclusion. ""It's a win-win situation. It's the best sort of deal that they could have come up with, without totally upsetting the apple cart - although Harry and Meghan made a pretty good job of that with their bombshell announcement,"" he said. ""It's a workable situation and it's a situation that is going to be reviewed after a year which kind of indicates that the door might be just left ajar."" But Katie Nicholl, Vanity Fair royal correspondent, said Harry and Meghan stepping away from royal duties was a loss for the institution. ""The Sussexes have won because they've got what they want, which is independence from the Royal Family. I do think the Royal Family will have lost out. Harry and Meghan brought a very magical and unique brand to the Royal Family,"" she said. She said that the agreement could also pave the way for younger royals, however. ""Prince Charles wants a slimmed-down monarchy. Maybe this is all in keeping with how the monarchy sees itself moving forward. If this works, if it's seen as a success, I think it could be a blueprint for future generations,"" she said. One question that still needs to be resolved is the issue of their security bill when they are in Canada, said David McClure, an expert on royal finances. He told BBC Breakfast that the overall royal security bill was estimated at more than Â£100m a year, and that one Canadian security company believed it would cost about Â£7m a year to protect Harry and Meghan when they are out of the UK. ""The Canadians are not keen on picking up the tab, so I'm sure there will be quite heated discussions between the Canadian government and the British government as to who pays for it,"" he said. If they plan to ""maximise the commercial opportunities"", the Sussexes may come under pressure to contribute to that cost, Mr McClure added. Megan this week visited a girls' charity in Vancouver Meghan and Harry have already begun a transition phase of living in Canada and the UK. The move was agreed by the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. The duchess is in the Commonwealth country with son Archie, where the Sussexes spent six weeks over the festive period. On Tuesday she visited a charity in Vancouver which campaigns for teenage girls living in poverty. On Thursday,the Duke of Sussex hosted the Rugby League World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace- his first public event since he and his wife said they would step back from royal life.

"In the great chess game that is world trade, the pieces are shifting slowly around the board. Only in this game there are three major players not two: the US, China and the European Union. EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan likes to speak plainly We've now had a chance to see the first moves from new EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan after his appearance at an event in Washington. And he's choosing a new way to play the game. Whereas here in the UK, the government treads delicately when dealing with the nations it wants to strike trade deals with, Mr Hogan was rather more blunt, talking about the ""bluffing"", ""sabre-rattling"" and ""short term thinking"" of the Trump administration. Mr Hogan reflected sceptically on whether yesterday's China-US partial deal had achieved much, and also suggested that the EU would examine that deal for compliance with global trade rules. The US administration has threatened to withdraw security cooperation from countries that use 5G equipment from the Chinese firm Huawei. Mr Hogan said: ""I think it's a bit of sabre rattling. At the end of the day we can call their bluff on that one"". Phil Hogan: The ex-farmer leading trade negotiations for the EU And yet at the same time, he has joined forces with the US and Japan to tackle the ""threat"" of China's use of industrial subsidies. There are other emerging fronts in the US-EU battle - on tech taxes, and on the environment and carbon taxes. The UK is about to join the players at the table in its own right, stepping in at a time of tumult, and working out how closely it wants to sit by the EU. The EU meanwhile has other priorities on the world stage. That is one reason why Mr Hogan dismissed Boris Johnson's self-imposed end of 2020 deadline for a post-Brexit trade deal as ""just not possible"" describing it as ""brinkmanship"". More than that, he specifically indicated that if this was the approach the UK wanted to take, then only a subset of the agreed Brexit political declaration would be up for detailed discussion, and that agreement on that would be needed by 30 June. This suggests that the EU may be planning to ""prioritise"" - ie not follow the mandate from the EU27 for UK-EU talks to reflect the UK's timetable - and will not talk about the full 36-page political agreement. The UK now has to choose its strategy: on whether to pursue fully parallel talks with the US, whether to publish a detailed negotiating mandate for such talks, and how to assert itself alongside Japan at a World Trade Organisation dominated by US-EU-China. That is all still to be fleshed out. No one seems entirely sure if the Department for International Trade will even continue to exist as the government contemplates restructuring Whitehall. There are many fundamental decisions to be made. But when it comes to sizing up the UK's opponents across the table, the EU is making one thing clear: it can talk as tough as Trump.

"EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said negotiating all aspects of the UK's future relationship with the EU by the end of 2020 would be ""basically impossible"" They say an army marches on its stomach. The European Union does it with slides. The EU negotiating team is gearing up for talks with the UK about the post-Brexit relationship by holding a series of seminars for diplomats from the 27 member states. Thepresentations are being published online,external. Stuffed with jargon and seriously lacking in inspirational clipart, they provide important clues about how things might play out. Remember the Political Declaration? Known in Brussels as ""the PD"", it's the 26-page sketch of the future relationship agreed alongside the 600-page Withdrawal Agreement, which settled the terms of the UK's departure. The UK officially leaves the European Union on 31 January 2020 The Political Declaration is often seen as a lesser document because it isn't legally binding, or as a sweetener to make the divorce terms more palatable. Brexit jargon explained A simple guide to Brexit What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? It's clear that the EU takes the document as gospel because it's quoted at length in the slides. At length. Like it's the law. EU officials are alert for signs that the UK might be softening on commitments made in the PD. It's also a handy tool for keeping EU member states in line. For example, some have asked for other things to be added, to be told it's now too late. So it's worth re-reading,external. One of the sessions for diplomats was about the centrepiece of the new relationship with the UK - the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). This presentation was full of the EU's usual catch-phrases about this stuff: being out can't be as good as being in, there's no way to replicate membership of the single market without the free movement of people, etc etc. This video can not be played Barclay: 'Let's be positive' about 2020 Brexit trade deal deadline In the Theresa May era, this would read like a comprehensive rejection by Brussels of requests made by the UK. It doesn't feel that way, now that there's a new British government which is relaxed about a looser economic relationship and can live with some friction in its trade with the EU. What is the transition period? Who is EU's powerful head Ursula von der Leyen? But the EU thinks the UK still has to be reminded about what it can and can't get. And the message on financial services in the slides is unambiguous: ""not subject to negotiation."" That's because both sides will use existing ways of monitoring each other's regulations rather than inventing new ones. Get used to another acronym - the LPF, or Level Playing Field. This is a series of measures to manage economic competition with the UK, which the EU says is necessary to reduce the risk of it being undercut by British firms that benefit from the new free trade agreement. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a level playing field was needed to ensure the single market and customs union were ""not diluted"" The EU intends that the level playing field will cover taxation, labour relations and environmental policies, and government support for companies, known as ""state aid."" The main tool will be a promise not to fall below current shared standards known as the non-regression clause. But the EU has introduced an extra concept via the slides - ""non-lowering"". At first this sounds the same as non-regression but it means that if one party raises standards then there's a possibility they may never be allowed to be lowered again. This goes beyond merely maintaining existing standards. Backlash against Flybe's government rescue grows Irish PM calls for 'level playing field' on negotiations Why Brexit Stage Two may turn into a rocky ride And the EU wants the UK to stay in lock-step with European policies on the environment and state aid as they develop. It's described in the presentations to diplomats as an ""ambition to improve over time"", but in negotiating parlance is called ""dynamic alignment"". This is a massive no-no for the British government and will likely cause a big row. The EU negotiators think this will all have to be managed and they place great importance on an ""overarching governance framework"", part of which would be a joint committee of ministers and officials. According to the slides, one of its big tasks would be deciding how to apply new EU laws or initiatives that didn't exist when the deal was negotiated. Another would be working out what to do when one side or the other diverged from where things started. At the same time, the EU would develop its own tools to retaliate quickly if the UK did something deemed unacceptable. This is at the heart of the deal the EU agreed with Switzerland (but which hasn't been approved yet) and my hunch is it'll be at the heart of what's negotiated with the UK. And finally, who could forget what access the EU will get to UK waters to catch fish, and British access to the EU market to sell it, billed as the biggest flashpoint? The slides reiterate that a deal on trade is contingent on a deal on fish. What's not clear is how the two will be linked - either in the negotiation process or in the final agreements. The UK will have to decide if it is going to allow access by foreign vessels to its fishing waters The EU says it will look at ""socio-economic"" factors - the real-world effect on fishing communities. That might be surprising if you think this should be a purely technical, environmental matter, but it reflects the importance of the sector in the European psyche. Another key phrase is ""relative stability"". This is code for agreeing the broad outlines of how many fish can be caught over a long period of time, maybe decades. It means there might not be much to decide in annual fishing negotiations between the UK and the EU. There are more presentations and a lot of details still to come. They might seem dull but today's slides are tomorrow's big news stories.

"Lee Child has written 24 Jack Reacher novels The author of the best-selling Jack Reacher novels is handing over the writing duties to his younger brother. Lee Child, 65, reportedly considered killing off the 6ft 5ins vigilante hero, who is played by actor Tom Cruise in film adaptations. But the writer said: ""I love my readers and know they want many, many more Reacher stories in the future."" His brother Andrew Grant, 51, who will write under the pen name Andrew Child, is already an established author. Child, whose real name is James Grant, said he felt he was ""ageing out"" of being able to produce more of the books. He said: ""So I have decided to pass the baton to someone who can."" He described his younger sibling as the ""best tough-guy writer I have read in years."" ""We share the same DNA, the same background, the same upbringing,"" he said, adding: ""He's me, fifteen years ago, full of energy and ideas."" There have been two Jack Reacher films starring Tom Cruise The Coventry-born author said they would work on the next few novels together ""and then he'll strike out on his own"". Childstarted writing after being fired from his jobas a presentation director at Granada Television in 1995. His first Reacher novel, Killing Floor, was published in 1997.

"The pair were first pictured together at the 2017 Invictus Games after months avoiding the cameras Meghan Markle was the American actress, with a passion for humanitarian and feminist causes. Harry was the rebel prince turned soldier, considered the world's most eligible bachelor. In the summer of 2016, the two were brought together on a blind date by a mutual friend in London. ""Beautiful"" Meghan ""just tripped and fell into my life"",Harry later told the press,and he knew immediately she was ""the one"". After just two dates, the new couple went on holiday together to Botswana, camping out under the stars. They fell in love ""so incredibly quickly"", proof the ""stars were aligned"", said Harry. To the British press, their romance was catnip. Here was a golden couple who were able to draw vast crowds, speak the language of younger generations and sprinkle royal stardust on any cause. For months the couple avoided the cameras and it wasn't until the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto that the the two were first photographed holding hands in public, smiling and laughing. Royals 'hurt' over Sussexes' announcement Royal Family tree and line of succession Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? But there had been signs early on that the fairytale was some way off a ""happily ever after"". When Harry first confirmed the relationship in late 2016, it came with a stark attack on the media, accusing them of subjecting his girlfriend to ""a wave of abuse and harassment"". He spoke of nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers, attempts by reporters and photographers to get into Meghan's home and the ""bombardment"" of nearly every friend and loved one in her life. It was a problem that was only going to get worse. Despite that - or perhaps because of that - the two grew ever closer and in September 2017, Meghan declared to Vanity Fair magazine: ""Personally, I love a great love story."" The two of them had been enjoying a special time together and were really happy and in love, she said. The media was now on high alert for the sound of royal wedding bells - and they didn't have to wait long. This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan Markle posed for the cameras in the garden at Kensington Palace In November 2017, Harry got down on one knee to propose to Meghan as they made roast chicken together at their home in Kensington Palace. Harry had designed the ring, made with two diamonds which had belonged to his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. At the centre was a diamond from Botswana. The couple shared their story in a candid interview with the BBC, and appearing brimming with positivity for the future. They revealed Meghan would give up acting to focus on causes close to her heart, working alongside her husband-to-be. ""I know that she will be unbelievably good at the job part of it,"" said Harry. Things began to shift as preparations got under way for a May 2018 wedding in Windsor. This video can not be played Highlights from the wedding ceremony It quickly became clear that this was a royal couple who wanted to do things differently - their way. The wedding, which much of the world tuned in to watch, had all the traditions - a stunning dress, cheeky bridesmaids and heartfelt vows. But, as our royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said at the time, the service with its gospel choir, young black cellist and breathtaking address from Bishop Curry, marked it out as a modern, diverse wedding for a modern, diverse couple, which seemed to point to a different future for the Royal Family. Married life brought with it new titles - the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - and a new home at Windsor in Frogmore Cottage. During a trip to Merseyside, the duchess told well-wishers she was six months pregnant and did not know if it was a boy or a girl In October of that year, the couple embarked on their first royal tour, visiting Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, over 16 days. It was there that they shared the news that they were expecting their first baby. Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, seventh in line to throne and the Queen's eighth great-grandchild, was born on 6 May 2019. To Harry, who was by Meghan's side at the birth, little Archie was ""absolutely to die for"". Throughout Meghan's pregnancy, the continual redrawing of battlelines had gone on between the press and the couple. This was to be no repeat of the Duchess of Cambridge's birth with the circus of journalists and photographers lying in wait outside hospital doors for days on end. The press had been told there would be no information about the birth, beyond that it was happening. Such scrutiny and pressure proved to be a struggle for the newly-wed Meghan during her pregnancy and in early motherhood, she later admitted in an ITV documentary filmed during their tour of southern Africa in September. ""Not many people have asked if I'm OK,"" she said, looking lost. She spoke of her vulnerability during pregnancy and the challenges of having a new-born - ""it's a lot"". Asked if she could cope, she said she had long told Harry it was not enough to just survive - ""that's not the point of life - you have got to thrive"". Archie was christened in a private ceremony, from which the press and the public were excluded There were further signs that the couple were not happy, when the prince opened up about his mental health. He said it was under constant management and he lived with the pressures of avoiding a repeat of the past that took his mother, the Princess of Wales, from him. She died in a car crash in Paris when Harry was just 12. The driver had been drinking and the car was being followed by paparazzi on motorbikes. ""Everything that she went through, and what happened to her, is incredibly important every single day, and that is not me being paranoid,"" he said. ""Part of this job is putting on a brave face but, for me and my wife, there is a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it is untrue,"" he added. It has also been suggested the scrutiny of Meghan has been greater because of her African-American heritage. Former US presidential candidateHillary Clinton said she wanted to hug Meghanfor the British media's ""racist"" treatment of her, while Harry hashighlighted how ""unconscious bias""can lead to racist behaviour even if people do not consider themselves to be racist. Their struggles were shared in an interview while touring southern Africa The couple's frustration and anger with some sections of the press has gone from being a matter between the palace and editors into the full glare of the public spotlight. Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters and Harry filed proceedings at the High Court against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking. As such a dramatic year came to a close, the royal couple took an extended break from royal duties over Christmas, taking Archie to the Canadian province of British Columbia. It gave them time to mull over their next move and, within days of the start of a new decade, they dropped theirbombshell announcement. Neither Harry's father, Prince Charles, nor his older brother, Prince William, with whom Harry has said he has ""good days"" and ""bad days"", were consulted. Harry and Meghan were, they told their Instagram followers, planning to leave their royal duties - and the royal purse - behind. They hope their next chapter, spent in North America as well as the UK, will see the two of them, together with baby Archie, make their own path to the future.

"Businesses have warned that food prices may rise and jobs may be affected after the chancellor vowed to end alignment with EU rules after Brexit. Sajid Javidtold the Financial Times,externalthe UK would not be a ""ruletaker"" after Brexit, urging businesses to ""adjust"". The Food and Drink Federation said the proposals were likely to cause food prices to rise at the end of this year. The Confederation of British Industry said for many firms, keeping existing EU rules would support jobs. The automotive, food and drink and pharmaceutical industries allwarned the governmentlast year that moving away from key EU rules would be damaging. Clock to illuminate No 10 as UK leaves the EU How soon will Brexit happen? In an interview with Financial Times, the chancellor said the Treasury would not support manufacturers that favour staying aligned with EU rules, as companies had known since 2016 that the UK was going to leave the EU. ""Admittedly they didn't know the exact terms,"" he said. The UK's 11-month transition period begins after it leaves the EU on 31 January. Mr Javid declined to specify which EU rules he wanted to drop, but said some businesses would benefit from Brexit, while others would not. He added: ""There will not be alignment, we will not be a ruletaker, we will not be in the single market and we will not be in the customs union - and we will do this by the end of the year."" Tim Rycroft, chief operating officer of the Food and Drink Federation, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it sounded like the ""death knell"" for frictionless trade with the EU. Acknowledging that some industries might benefit from Brexit, he said: ""We also have to make sure the government clearly understands what the consequences will be for industries like ours if they go ahead and change our trading terms."" The Food and Drink Federation warned of price rises at the end of the year The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it welcomed the chancellor's ""ambitious"" vision but said the government should not feel an ""obligation"" to depart from EU rules. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, said for many companies, ""particularly in some of the most deprived regions of the UK"", keeping the same rules would support jobs and maintain competitiveness. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the automotive industry in the UK and EU was ""uniquely integrated"" and its priority was to avoid ""expensive tariffs and other 'behind the border' barriers"". It said it was vital to have ""early sight"" of the government's plans so companies could evaluate their impact. And the Chemical Industries Association said: ""The industry continues to support regulatory alignment with our European counterparts, which represents the largest single market for our products."" BBC business correspondent Katy Austin pointed out that the association's members were concentrated in the north of England, an area the government is particularly keen to be seen to support. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted,externalthat Conservative promises about frictionless trade with the EU after Brexit were ""now exposed as not worth paper they were written on"". By BBC political correspondent Susana Mendonca This tough tone from the chancellor appears to have a two-pronged intention. Firstly, there's the message to business, which is, effectively, that Brexit is going to happen so just get on with it. Getting on the wrong side of businesses has never been familiar ground for the Conservatives, but a majority government gives you the freedom to do the uncomfortable stuff. It means the Tories can now be emboldened to say some companies will suffer because of Brexit in a way they never would have before. And with the general election now behind them, they can also pay little heed to warnings from the shadow chancellor that no alignment could lead to food shortages and job cuts. The second motivation for this tough talk is likely to be about positioning ahead of the trade deal yet to be done with the EU. The rhetoric around not being a ""rule-taker"" suggests the Conservatives want to be seen as preparing to have a tough battle with the EU to secure a deal without regulations - if they can. Could the UK and EU sort a trade deal in months? The government has not yet agreed a future trading relationship with the EU - it plans to do soduring the 11-month transition period. During this period the UK will continue to follow EU rules and contribute to its budget. Sajid Javid (right) visiting Trafford Park Metrolink tram The chancellor also said he wanted to double the UK's annual economic growth to between 2.7 and 2.8%. The outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney,told the Financial Times,externallast week he thought the UK's trend growth rate was much lower, at between 1 and 1.5%. Mr Javid said the extra growth would come from spending on skills and infrastructure in the Midlands and the north of England - even if they did not offer as much ""bang for the buck"" as projects in other parts of the country. He also pledged to rewriteTreasury investment rules, which have tended to favour government investment in places with high economic growth and high productivity.

"Prince Harry and Meghan will no longer use their HRH titles and will not receive public funds for royal duties, Buckingham Palace has announced. The couple will also no longer formally represent the Queen. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex intend to repay Â£2.4m of taxpayer money for the refurbishment of Frogmore Cottage, which will remain their UK family home, the statement added. The new arrangement comes into effect in spring this year, the palace said. The statement comes after the Queen held talks with the couple on Monday about their future, following their announcement that they wanted to""step back"" as senior royalsand divide their time between the UK and Canada. Queen's statement on Harry and Meghan in full The Harry and Meghan story Their future: Your questions answered The Queen said following ""many months of conversations and more recent discussions"" she was ""pleased that together we have found a constructive and supportive way forward for my grandson and his family"". ""Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family,"" the statement continued. She thanked them for their ""dedicated work"", adding that she was ""particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family."" On Sunday, the Queen made her first public appearance since the announcement, arriving at church with the Duke of York. The Queen smiled broadly as she was greeted at St Mary the Virgin Church in Norfolk In a separate statement, Buckingham Palace said: ""The Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family."" HRH, an abbreviation of His/Her Royal Highness, is used as part of the title of some members of the royal family. BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""When they first issued that statement about what they wanted, they talked about forging this progressive role within the Royal Family, about stepping back from royal duties. This isn't stepping back, it's stepping away entirely."" She said the question that will ""hang over them"" for the next year is what their commercial life will look like. ""This will be a test of the integrity of Harry and Meghan,"" she said. This video can not be played ""Nothing like this has ever happened before"" â royal correspondent Daniela Relph explains As well as repaying the cost of refurbishing Frogmore Cottage, the couple will pay a ""commercial rent"" for the property. Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess understood they were required to withdraw from royal duties, including official military appointments. ""While they can no longer formally represent the Queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty,"" it said. The statement added that the pair would continue to maintain their private patronages and associations. The Rugby Football League said it was ""delighted"" to continue to have the duke as patron, praising his ""genuine commitment"". Map Ives, director and founder of Rhino Conservation Botswana, said he had already been told by an official in Harry's office that the duke ""wants to continue"" his patronage of the organisation. ""If anything our relationship should get stronger,"" Mr Ives said. There has been much speculation on who will provide security arrangements for the couple and how much it will cost, but the palace said it would not comment on such matters. Prince Harry hosted the Rugby League World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace on Thursday Harry and Meghan's new website, sussexroyal.com, was updated following the Queen's statement to say: ""Information on the roles and work of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will be updated on this website in due course."" The party prince who carved his own path Your questions answered: Tax, titles and trademarks Earlier this month, Harry and Meghan said they wanted to create a ""progressive new role"" within the institution, where they would be financially independent and divide their time between the UK and North America. Last year, they both spoke about the difficulties of royal life and media attention. The duke said he feared his wife would fall victim to""the same powerful forces"" that led to his mother's death. A legal case against the Mail on Sunday for publishing what the duchess says was a private letter has also raised the prospect ofher father testifying against her. In comments for a forthcoming Channel 5 documentary, Thomas Markle accused the couple of ""cheapening"" the Royal Family and ""making it shabby"". ""Every young girl wants to become a princess and she got that and now she's tossing that away,"" he said. ""It looks like she's tossing that away for money."" They will always be, the Queen writes, ""much loved members of my family"". But that's about it. No royal title, no royal duties, no military appointments, no tours, most of their time spent in Canada, no public money. It is harder to think of a much cleaner break than this. Harry and Meghan are still members of the Royal Family, but they are effectively no longer royal. The early talk was of a much more mixed life - one where perhaps Harry and Meghan continued with some royal duties, dividing their time equally between the UK and Canada. But the contradictions and conflicts of interest were too many. There are still lots of details to thrash out. And the whole thing will be reviewed after a year. But a new life awaits Harry and Meghan - celebrities, certainly, but a different kind of royalty. Some questions about the couple's future status remain unanswered, including what their tax and immigration status will be in the UK and Canada. It is not yet known whether Meghan still intends to gain British citizenship, which would entail her spending a certain amount of time in the UK. While the couple intend to divide their time between the UK and Canada, it is expected that they will spend the majority of their time in Canada. Former press secretary to the Queen Dickie Arbiter said the new arrangement brings a crisis for the Royal Family to an acceptable conclusion. ""It's a win-win situation. It's the best sort of deal that they could have come up with, without totally upsetting the apple cart - although Harry and Meghan made a pretty good job of that with their bombshell announcement,"" he said. ""It's a workable situation and it's a situation that is going to be reviewed after a year which kind of indicates that the door might be just left ajar."" But Katie Nicholl, Vanity Fair royal correspondent, said Harry and Meghan stepping away from royal duties was a loss for the institution. ""The Sussexes have won because they've got what they want, which is independence from the Royal Family. I do think the Royal Family will have lost out. Harry and Meghan brought a very magical and unique brand to the Royal Family,"" she said. She said that the agreement could also pave the way for younger royals, however. ""Prince Charles wants a slimmed-down monarchy. Maybe this is all in keeping with how the monarchy sees itself moving forward. If this works, if it's seen as a success, I think it could be a blueprint for future generations,"" she said. One question that still needs to be resolved is the issue of their security bill when they are in Canada, said David McClure, an expert on royal finances. He told BBC Breakfast that the overall royal security bill was estimated at more than Â£100m a year, and that one Canadian security company believed it would cost about Â£7m a year to protect Harry and Meghan when they are out of the UK. ""The Canadians are not keen on picking up the tab, so I'm sure there will be quite heated discussions between the Canadian government and the British government as to who pays for it,"" he said. If they plan to ""maximise the commercial opportunities"", the Sussexes may come under pressure to contribute to that cost, Mr McClure added. Megan this week visited a girls' charity in Vancouver Meghan and Harry have already begun a transition phase of living in Canada and the UK. The move was agreed by the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. The duchess is in the Commonwealth country with son Archie, where the Sussexes spent six weeks over the festive period. On Tuesday she visited a charity in Vancouver which campaigns for teenage girls living in poverty. On Thursday,the Duke of Sussex hosted the Rugby League World Cup draw at Buckingham Palace- his first public event since he and his wife said they would step back from royal life.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton A police chief has asked to meet the commander of the RAF base near where Harry Dunn died, to discuss cars being driven on the wrong side of the road. Mr Dunn, 19, was hit by a car driven by Anne Sacoolas, who left for the US claiming diplomatic immunity. Video has now emerged of a car being driven on the wrong side of the road near RAF Croughton on Friday night. Northamptonshire Chief Constable Nick Adderley said these events ""cannot keep happening"". This video can not be played This car was filmed on Friday on the wrong side of the road near the RAF base close to where Harry Dunn died A police vehicle was also struck by a car on the wrong side of the same road in October. The footage that was captured on Friday shows a blue BMW having to brake sharply on a road near the base. Harry Dunn's family, including his mother Charlotte Charles, have been campaigning for justice In a statement, the chief constable said: ""I do not underestimate how much of a concerning incident this was and how much worse it could have been, especially considering the circumstances in which 19-year-old Harry Dunn tragically died. ""This is compounded by the fact that yesterday, myself and Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner Stephen Mold were made aware of another incident in Northampton in which a police vehicle was struck in early October by a vehicle also driving on the wrong side of the road. ""Thankfully, there were no injuries. ""I want to be absolutely clear on the fact that these incidents just cannot keep happening."" He said he had requested a meeting with officials from the base to discuss road safety and that he expected it to take place next week. The Dunn family spokesman, Radd Seiger, said watching the footage made him feel sick. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 ""Harry's parents want, more than anything else, for this to never happen to a family again, and I look forward to entering into talks with the authorities, on both sides of the Atlantic, to make sure it never does,"" Mr Seiger said. Mr Dunn died in hospital after a head-on collision with a car on 27 August last year near RAF Croughton. Anne Sacoolas, 42, the wife of a US intelligence officer, is believed to have been driving on the wrong side of the road and is to be charged with causing death by dangerous driving. She claimed diplomatic immunity after the collision, left for her home country and has refused to return to the UK despite an extradition attempt.

"Sainsbury's has beaten rivals Morrisons and Asda to be named the cheapest supermarket of 2019, according to a survey by Which?.

"Sajid Javid said Brexit would impact businesses ""one way or the other"" The chancellor has warned manufacturers that ""there will not be alignment"" with the EU after Brexit and insists firms must ""adjust"" to new regulations. Speaking to the Financial Times,external, Sajid Javid admitted not all businesses would benefit from Brexit. The Food and Drink Federation said it sounded like the ""death knell"" for frictionless trade with the EU and was likely to cause food prices to rise. Mr Javid declined to specify which EU rules he wanted to drop. The automotive, food and drink and pharmaceutical industries allwarned the governmentlast year that moving away from key EU rules would be damaging. Clock to illuminate No 10 as UK leaves the EU How soon will Brexit happen? But Mr Javid told the paper: ""There will be an impact on business one way or the other, some will benefit, some won't."" He said Japan's car industry was an example of a manufacturing sector which found success without following EU rules. Asked how differing regulations between the UK and EU may impact industries such as automotive and pharmaceuticals, he said: ""We're also talking about companies that have known since 2016 that we are leaving the EU. ""Admittedly, they didn't know the exact terms."" Tim Rycroft, chief operating officer of the Food and Drink Federation, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""it sounds awfully like the death knell for the concept of frictionless trade with the EU"". He said it probably meant that food prices would rise when the transition period finishes at the end of this year. Mr Rycroft acknowledged that some other industries might benefit from UK-specific trade rules. But he said: ""We also have to make sure the government clearly understands what the consequences will be for industries like ours if they go ahead and change our trading terms."" The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it welcomed the chancellor's ""ambitious"" vision but said government should not feel it has an ""obligation"" to depart from EU rules. Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general, said for many companies, ""particularly in some of the most deprived regions of the UK"", keeping the same rules would support jobs and maintain competitiveness. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the automotive industry in the UK and EU was ""uniquely integrated"" and its priority was to avoid ""expensive tariffs and other 'behind the border' barriers"". It said it was vital to have ""early sight"" of the government's plans so companies could evaluate their impact. The government has not yet agreed a future trading relationship with the EU - it plans to do so in the11-month transition periodwhich begins after the UK leaves the bloc on 31 January. During the transition period the UK will continue to follow EU rules and contribute to its budget. The chancellor also said he wanted to double the UK's annual economic growth to between 2.7 and 2.8%. However, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney,told the Financial Times,externallast week he thought the UK's trend growth rate was much lower, at between 1 and 1.5%. Mr Javid said the extra growth would come from spending on skills and infrastructure in the Midlands and the north of England - even if they did not offer as much ""bang for the buck"" as projects in other parts of the country. Historically low interest rates, which allow the government to borrow money relatively cheaply, were ""almost a signal to me from the market - from investors - that here's the cash, use it to do something productive"", Mr Javid said. He pledged to rewriteTreasury investment rules, which have tended to favour government investment in places with high economic growth and high productivity. Mr Javid said the rules had helped to ""entrench"" inequality and insisted weaker parts of the country would have first call on the new money. How Treasury rules may be rewritten In November,the Bank of England saida weaker global economy and its new assumptions about Brexit would knock 1% off UK growth over the next three years compared with its previous August forecast.

"This video can not be played Four candidates remain in the race for the Labour leadership The five Labour MPs standing for leader have said party divisions stand in the way of winning an election. In the first hustings, Rebecca Long-Bailey, Emily Thornberry, Sir Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips made their pitches to the membership. Sir Keir said ""we've had far too much division"", while Ms Phillips said the ""name-calling has been horrendous"". Party members in Liverpool questioned them on issues from Brexit to anti-Semitism. It was the first in a series of events across the country before Jeremy Corbyn's successor is elected on 4 April. This video can not be played The five candidates in the race for the Labour leadership set out how they would take on Boris Johnson. Deputy leader candidates Rosena Allin-Khan, Dawn Butler, Richard Burgon, Ian Murray and Angela Rayner are also answering questions in a separate hustings. Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour leadership: What does Keir Starmer stand for? Long-Bailey against 24-week disability abortion Which Labour contender is the most working-class? The five leadership candidates all acknowledged that Labour had suffered from division and in-fighting. ""We have to be honest with ourselves that over the last four years we haven't been united as a party,"" said Mrs Long-Bailey. Sir Keir said that the unity of the party ""has to be modelled from the top"". ""Don't trash the last Labour government, don't trash the last four years,"" he said. Although all the candidates criticised the party's record on anti-Semitism, Ms Phillips accused some others of ""keeping quiet"" on the issue. ""As somebody who was in the room, struggling for an independent system - at lots and lots of meetings - I have to say I don't remember some of the people here being in that particular room or being in those particular fights,"" she said. Ms Nandy said a ""collective failure of leadership at the top of the party has let us all down"", while Mrs Long-Bailey, a Jeremy Corbyn ally, said: ""We can never let that level of mistrust happen again."" Ms Thornberry said Labour ""must be critical of a far-right government of Israel""  but said that blaming Jews is ""where racism begins"". Candidates were asked how they would bring the party and the country together over Brexit. Warning of the threat of no trade deal with the EU at the end of the transition period this year, Ms Thornberry said the party needs ""someone in this fight who has been on the right side all along"". Ms Nandy said Labour has allowed the Tories to divide people, pitting the young against the old and cities against towns, as they ""airbrushed out the nuance"". She called for the Labour HQ to be moved out of London, as a ""powerful symbol"" of its commitment to empower regional communities. Sir Keir urged the party to let go of the Leave and Remain labels and ""focus on the future"", while Ms Long-Bailey said the country needed a ""democratic revolution"" because voters disliked the centralisation of power in Westminster as much as Brussels. Ms Phillips said the party needed to ""start talking to people's hearts and talking to people in a language people hear and receive, because that is what Boris Johnson does"". Find out more about the candidates, including their early life, time before Parliament, record as an MP, and leadership pitch: Sir Keir Starmer Emily Thornberry Rebecca Long-Bailey Jess Phillips Lisa Nandy The hunt for a new Labour leader was triggered when Mr Corbyn stepped down following the party's fourth general election defeat in a row. In order to make the final ballot, each of the Labour leadership hopefuls must securethe backing of unions and local parties. The five contenders need the support of 5% of local parties or at least three affiliates - two must be unions - by 14 February to make the final ballot. Members of the public who join the party or become affiliated supporters before 20 January will be eligible to vote in the contest. This video can not be played What matters to members in this leadership election? AYouGov poll of 1,005 Labour members for the Times,externalon Friday suggested Ms Thornberry would go out in the first round of voting with just 3%, with Ms Nandy knocked out in the second round and Ms Phillips in the third, with most of her second preference votes going to Sir Keir. The poll - which only includes full Labour members, and not others who are entitled to vote - indicates Sir Keir would beat Mrs Long-Bailey in the final round by 63% to 37%, once the other candidates have been eliminated.

"There were six coronaviruses known to infect people before the latest discovery The number of people already infected by the mystery virus emerging in China is far greater than official figures suggest, scientists have told the BBC. There have been more than 60 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, but UK experts estimate a figure nearer 1,700. Two people are known to have died from the respiratory illness, which appeared in Wuhan city in December. ""I am substantially more concerned than I was a week ago,"" disease outbreak scientist Prof Neil Ferguson, said. The work was conducted by the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, which advises bodies including the UK government and the World Health Organization (WHO). 'Sars-family' virus claims second victim in China Mystery virus: How worried should we be? Singapore and Hong Kong have been screening air passengers from Wuhan, and US authorities announced similar measures starting on Friday at three major airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. The crucial clue to the scale of the problem lies in the cases being detected in other countries. While the outbreak is centred on the central Chinese city of Wuhan, there have been two cases in Thailand and one in Japan. ""That caused me to worry,"" said Prof Ferguson. He added: ""For Wuhan to have exported three cases to other countries would imply there would have to be many more cases than have been reported."" It is impossible to get the precise number, but outbreak modelling, which is based on the virus, the local population and flight data, can give an idea. Wuhan International Airport serves a population of 19 million people, but only 3,400 a day travel internationally. The detailed calculations, which have beenposted online,externalahead of publication in a scientific journal, came up with a figure of 1,700 cases. Allow Twitter content?

Prof Ferguson said it was ""too early to be alarmist"" but he was ""substantially more concerned"" than a week ago. Chinese officials say there have been no cases of the virus spreading from one person to another. Instead they say the virus has crossed the species barrier and come from infected animals at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. Prof Ferguson argues: ""People should be considering the possibility of substantial human-to-human transmission more seriously than they have so far. ""It would be unlikely in my mind, given what we know about coronaviruses, to have animal exposure, be the principal cause of such a number of human infections."" Understanding how a novel virus is spreading is a crucial part of assessing its threat. The WHO's China office said the analysis was helpful and would help officials plan the response to the outbreak. ""Much remains to be understood about the new coronavirus,"" it said. ""Not enough is known to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted, the clinical features of the disease, the extent to which it has spread, or its source, which remains unknown."" The outbreak occurred in the city of Wuhan, south of Beijing Viral samples have been taken from patients and analysed in the laboratory. And officials in China andthe World Health Organization,externalhave concluded the infection is a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a broad family of viruses, butonly six (the new one would make it seven) are known to infect people,external. At the mild end they cause the common cold, but severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) is a coronavirus that killed 774 of the 8,098 people infected in an outbreak that started in China in 2002. Analysis of the genetic code of the new virus shows it is more closely related to Sars than any other human coronavirus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The virus has caused pneumonia in some patients and been fatal in two of them. Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome medical research charity, said: ""There is more to come from this epidemic. ""Uncertainty and gaps remain, but it's clear that there is some level of person-to-person transmission. This video can not be played Coronavirus feared to have infected more than initially thought, according to scientists ""We are starting to hear of more cases in China and other countries and it is likely, as this modelling shows, that there will be many more cases in a number of countries."" Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, said: ""What's really important is until there has been widespread laboratory testing it is very difficult to put a real number on the cases out there. ""But this is a figure we should take seriously until we know otherwise, 41 animal-to-human 'spillovers' is stretching it a bit and there probably is more underlying infection than has been detected so far.""

"Magaluf is a popular destination for young holidaymakers Spain's Balearic Islands have passed a law banning pub crawls and happy hours in three popular tourist destinations in a bid to crack down on alcohol-fuelled holidays. Restrictions apply to the tourist hotspots of Playa de Palma and Magaluf in Majorca and Sant Antoni in Ibiza. The regional government said it was the first law of its kind in Europe. Ibiza and Majorca have long been magnets for young British, German and Irish tourists. The measures adopted on Friday are just the latest effort by authorities to try to rein in heavy drinking on the Mediterranean islands.

The new law includes a string of measures aimed at cracking down on so-called ""booze tourism"", where visitors are encouraged to binge drink. Organised pub crawls can no longer be advertised or held in Playa de Palma, Magaluf or Ibiza's West End. The law also bans happy hours and says party boats can no longer advertise in the three areas or pick up or drop off tourists there. Alcohol vending machines, free bars and adverts for alcoholic drinks are also forbidden, while authorities say shops selling alcohol must close from 21:30 to 08:00 (20:30 to 07:00 GMT). The new regulations have also outlawed ""balconing"", where people jump from hotel balconies, often into swimming pools. The practice has been linked to a number of tourist deaths and injuries. Authorities said those caught taking part in the activity would now be forced to leave their hotel and could face fines. Local businesses caught violating the new law could face fines of up to â¬600,000 (Â£510,000) or be shut down for up to three years. The regional government said the law was the first in Europe to restrict the promotion and sale of alcohol in certain tourist zones.

"Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm is currently Scotland's single largest source of renewable energy Scotland generated enough electricity from renewable sources last year to meet the equivalent of 90.1% of its total electricity consumption, according to latest figures. The Scottish government data for 2019 showed an increase of 13.4% on 2018 - meaning the country generated 30.5 TWh of electricity from renewable sources. That's enough to charge almost 6.7bn mobile phones for a year, or boil about 700bn kettles. The target is for 100% of the country's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by the end of 2020. And good progress is being made - in 2009, it was only 27.2%. But we won't know whether Scotland has met this target or not until more data is published next year. Although electricity only makes up part of the mix of the energy Scotland needs, the amount of energy produced in Scotland from renewable resources increased between 2017 and 2018 to 21.1%. The Scottish government said to decarbonise energy-intensive industries, heating buildings and transport, renewable electricity supplies would need to be further enhanced. By 2030, Scottish ministers want renewable energy generation to account for 50%,externalof energy demand across electricity, heat and transport. In order to achieve the target, Scotland has been moving away from burning fossil fuels, with the last coal-fired power station,Longannet, closing in 2016. The only remaining gas-fired power station is at Peterhead in Aberdeenshire. Can Scotland ever be 'the Saudi Arabia of renewables'? Onshore wind delivers about 70% of capacity, followed by hydro and offshore wind as Scotland's main sources of renewable power. Scotland's largest single source is the Beatrice offshore wind farm. Its 84 turbines - each with three 75m (246ft) blades - went into operation last year. The wind farm isis capable of generating enough power for 450,000 homes.,external The Seagreen Wind Farm, under construction off Angus, will eventually be even bigger andable to power 1.3m homes,external. This video can not be played What is climate change? While the pandemic has led to a temporary dip in greenhouse gas emissions, there is still requirement for fundamental changes in the way we live our lives in order to achieve net zero. Net zero means any emissions will be balanced out by schemes to offset an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere - such as planting trees, or using technology to capture carbon and store it. So what are Scotland's climate change targets, and are they the most ambitious in the worldas has been claimed,external? The Scottish government has set itself a legally-binding target tocut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2045, five years ahead of thedate set for the UK as a whole.,external The Scottish government says its targets are ""the toughest anywhere in the world"". They are certainly among the most ambitious. However, other countries -such as Sweden,external- have passed legislation with the same goal. Sweden did so two years before Scotland, and it has also set milestones along the way. But Scotland's milestone targets are more ambitious and include emissions from aviation and shipping. They also don't rely on international credits, which is wherecountries can pay for emissions to be reduced,externalelsewhere instead of reducing their own. Much progress has been made, but the hardest changes are still to come. Emissions of greenhouse gases - such as carbon dioxide - have been cut toabout half of what they were 30 years ago,external. Answers to your questions about climate change However,experts say,externalmuch of this progress has been accomplished by picking off the ""low hanging fruit"" - the most cost effective or publicly-acceptable changes to make. The areas that need tackling are transport (about a third of all emissions), farming and land use (about a quarter), business and heavy industry (about a fifth) and how we heat our homes. Tricky decisions will have to be made, especially with so much of Scotland's economy based around the oil and gas industry. A Scottish government-appointed commission is grappling with the question of how to protect the economy and ensure a ""just transition"" so oil workers and farmers don't lose out as the world moves away from fossil fuels. The commission has already published some advice to the Scottish government on how to make recovery from the pandemic greener. It saysimmediate actions that can be taken,externalinclude investing in warmer homes, supporting bus travel, and attaching green conditions to funding. This video can not be played Electric vehicles account for more than 2% of all cars and vans on the road in Orkney Transport accounts for about a third of Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions and some steps have been taken to reduce this but the overwhelming majority of vehicles on the road are still greenhouse gas-emitting petrol or diesel engines. The Scottish government has said,externalit wants to have ""phased out"" the need for new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 - and hopes to reduce the use of cars generally, with the number of kilometres driven to be reduced by 20%. There are now more than 1,500 publicly-available charge points in Scotland for electric vehicles and the number of new EV and hybrid cars registered in the UK was up nearly 40% on the same period last year. Should my next car be an electric one? But for many drivers an EV is prohibitively expensive and concerns over the range the cars can currently offer is a concern for some potential owners. Their popularity is expected to increase significantly as the technology gets better but this will see demand for electricity generation rise too. The UK government'sDepartment for Transport says,externalScotland now has more than 1,500 charging devices, and across the UK there are now more charging locations than petrol stations. Of course, this year has seen some huge changes to everyone's lives. During lockdown, the whole country was asked to stay at home unless leaving was essential. In Scotland, everyone who can work from home was asked to keep doing so. That has had a big impact on how often we travel, how far, and how we get to places - and as the number of Covid cases has risen, travel has dropped again. At the beginning of this month, compared with the same time last year,,externaltrain travel was down by 85%, air by 75%, concessionary bus travel by 60%, and ferry journeys by 55%. Despite the public being advised to avoid public transport where possible and not to car share, car journeys were still down by 25%. But the pandemic doesn't mean planning for a greener future has stopped. Low emission zones,externalthat will see polluting vehicles banned from entering city centres (and receive a penalty notice if they don't comply) are planned for Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Dundee but so far only Glasgow has introduced measures which only apply to 60% of buses that enter the zone. Because of the pandemic, implementing the low emission zones waspaused over the summer,external, but officials have vowed to see the changes through ""at the earliest possible time"". In a bid to discourage commuters from taking their cars to work, the Scottish government brought in theWorkplace Parking Levy. It allows councils to tax businesses on staff parking spaces but, so far, no councils have committed to introducing the levy this year. As well as cutting road transport emissions, the government needs to find a way to stop the growth in emissions from air travel. Since 1990, emissions from international aviation from Scotland have increased by 181% andthe latest data, from 2018,external, showed they were still increasing. The overall statistics have not been released yet to show the impact lockdown had on aviation emissions. But,according to the Global Carbon Project, the mass grounding of flights during the peak of the pandemic saw CO2 emissions from aviation reduced by up to 60%. The Scottish government has alsoscrapped plans to cut the amount of tax paid by passengers flying from Scottish airportsafter facing a backlash over the environmental impact. Electric-powered planes could be a solution to aviation emissions, but they are still at an early stage. Plans for the shortest scheduled flight in the world - the 1.7 mile jump between the Orkney islands of Westray and Papa Westray -to use an electric-powered planecould happen soon. The UN sayshigh consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling global warming, and researchers based in Scotland have been investigating ways of reducing the environmental impact of farming. For example, one group of scientists has found a way ofreducing the methane produced by cattle,external. About 15% of Scotland's emissions come from domestic housing, with most homes (about 80%) still relying on gas central heating systems. Ministers have set a target,externalof having 50% of all new heating systems being installed to be zero-emissions models by 2025. Instead of gas, heating systems should use renewable energy, or rely on low-carbon alternatives such as heat pumps. And20,000 households have benefited,externalfrom better insulation and new, more efficient - although still often gas - heating systems, funded by the Scottish government. Trees are still the most effective way of absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. To meet targets, the UK needsa net increase of 32,000 hectares of woodland,externalplanted every year for the next 30 years - equating to about 1.5bn trees. Figures claim most of the trees planted in the UK were planted in Scotland -11,000 of the 13,700 hectares planted in 2019-20,external. By 2024,the Scottish government aims,externalto be creating 18,000 hectares of new woodlands per year, with the ultimate goal of having 21% of Scotland's land covered by forest by 2032 - compared to 19% today. But there's more to it than just planting trees- it's important that the right trees are planted in the right places, taking into consideration factors such as soil type, water levels, temperatures and the surrounding landscape and tree species.

Labour leadership: What does Keir Starmer stand for? Long-Bailey against 24-week disability abortion Which Labour contender is the most working-class? The five leadership candidates all acknowledged that Labour had suffered from division and in-fighting. ""We have to be honest with ourselves that over the last four years we haven't been united as a party,"" said Mrs Long-Bailey. Sir Keir said that the unity of the party ""has to be modelled from the top"". ""Don't trash the last Labour government, don't trash the last four years,"" he said. Although all the candidates criticised the party's record on anti-Semitism, Ms Phillips accused some others of ""keeping quiet"" on the issue. ""As somebody who was in the room, struggling for an independent system - at lots and lots of meetings - I have to say I don't remember some of the people here being in that particular room or being in those particular fights,"" she said. Ms Nandy said a ""collective failure of leadership at the top of the party has let us all down"", while Mrs Long-Bailey, a Jeremy Corbyn ally, said: ""We can never let that level of mistrust happen again."" Ms Thornberry said Labour ""must be critical of a far-right government of Israel""  but said that blaming Jews is ""where racism begins"". Candidates were asked how they would bring the party and the country together over Brexit. Warning of the threat of no trade deal with the EU at the end of the transition period this year, Ms Thornberry said the party needs ""someone in this fight who has been on the right side all along"". Ms Nandy said Labour has allowed the Tories to divide people, pitting the young against the old and cities against towns, as they ""airbrushed out the nuance"". She called for the Labour HQ to be moved out of London, as a ""powerful symbol"" of its commitment to empower regional communities. Sir Keir urged the party to let go of the Leave and Remain labels and ""focus on the future"", while Ms Long-Bailey said the country needed a ""democratic revolution"" because voters disliked the centralisation of power in Westminster as much as Brussels. Ms Phillips said the party needed to ""start talking to people's hearts and talking to people in a language people hear and receive, because that is what Boris Johnson does"".

Although all the candidates criticised the party's record on anti-Semitism, Ms Phillips accused some others of ""keeping quiet"" on the issue. ""As somebody who was in the room, struggling for an independent system - at lots and lots of meetings - I have to say I don't remember some of the people here being in that particular room or being in those particular fights,"" she said. Ms Nandy said a ""collective failure of leadership at the top of the party has let us all down"", while Mrs Long-Bailey, a Jeremy Corbyn ally, said: ""We can never let that level of mistrust happen again."" Ms Thornberry said Labour ""must be critical of a far-right government of Israel""  but said that blaming Jews is ""where racism begins"". Candidates were asked how they would bring the party and the country together over Brexit. Warning of the threat of no trade deal with the EU at the end of the transition period this year, Ms Thornberry said the party needs ""someone in this fight who has been on the right side all along"". Ms Nandy said Labour has allowed the Tories to divide people, pitting the young against the old and cities against towns, as they ""airbrushed out the nuance"". She called for the Labour HQ to be moved out of London, as a ""powerful symbol"" of its commitment to empower regional communities. Sir Keir urged the party to let go of the Leave and Remain labels and ""focus on the future"", while Ms Long-Bailey said the country needed a ""democratic revolution"" because voters disliked the centralisation of power in Westminster as much as Brussels. Ms Phillips said the party needed to ""start talking to people's hearts and talking to people in a language people hear and receive, because that is what Boris Johnson does"". Find out more about the candidates, including their early life, time before Parliament, record as an MP, and leadership pitch: Sir Keir Starmer Emily Thornberry Rebecca Long-Bailey Jess Phillips Lisa Nandy The hunt for a new Labour leader was triggered when Mr Corbyn stepped down following the party's fourth general election defeat in a row. In order to make the final ballot, each of the Labour leadership hopefuls must securethe backing of unions and local parties. The five contenders need the support of 5% of local parties or at least three affiliates - two must be unions - by 14 February to make the final ballot. Members of the public who join the party or become affiliated supporters before 20 January will be eligible to vote in the contest. This video can not be played What matters to members in this leadership election? AYouGov poll of 1,005 Labour members for the Times,externalon Friday suggested Ms Thornberry would go out in the first round of voting with just 3%, with Ms Nandy knocked out in the second round and Ms Phillips in the third, with most of her second preference votes going to Sir Keir. The poll - which only includes full Labour members, and not others who are entitled to vote - indicates Sir Keir would beat Mrs Long-Bailey in the final round by 63% to 37%, once the other candidates have been eliminated.

"Universities in England are to face a ""value for money"" review of how Â£1.3bn per year of funding might give more support to ""priority"" subjects. Higher education watchdog the Office for Students (OFS) is understood to be launching the review in the spring. But it will not consider tuition fees - with the government set to publish a separate response to calls to cut fees. Universities UK warns it will matter ""how much"" funding is left after the review, as well as how it is allocated. The Conservative manifesto has promised to tackle what it calls ""low-quality courses"" in university - and the review will examine how funding can be targeted for priority subjects. While most university funding is delivered through tuition fees, the government still provides a significant direct stream of grants. This includes subsidies for subjects that are more expensive to teach, such as medicine, science and technology. University fees should be cut to Â£7,500, says review Universities warned on low-value courses Which degrees deliver the highest earnings? There is also money to improve access to higher education for disadvantaged youngsters. At present the funding is widely distributed, to more than 300 higher education providers. But the future allocation and focus of the money is to be examined by the OFS review. The Russell Group, representing some of the UK's major research universities, says the annual grants represent 13% of funding for undergraduate places. The university group has raised concerns about these grants being cut, arguing that funding for many courses is already stretched. A separate consultation has already been launched on Â£70m reductions to next year's teaching grant. But the OFS review has been backed by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. ""I am strongly in support of this move to evaluate value for money and to consider the best way to target grant funding to the higher education sector in future,"" said Mr Williamson, in a letter to the OFS earlier this month. The education secretary has told the OFS he wants to prioritise support for the government's industrial strategy, which aims to invest in ""skills, industries and infrastructure"". There will also be a push for more effective ways to spend money allocated for recruiting disadvantaged students, and support for specialist institutions. But Jo Grady, leader of the University and College Union, criticised how value for money was based on an ""obsession with flimsy metrics"" around graduate earnings. ""What can future employment or earnings potential really tell us about teaching quality?"" she said. But what remains unknown is how the OFS review will combine with the government's promised response to Philip Augar's review, which recommended reducing tuition fees from Â£9,250 to Â£7,500 per year. The review, commissioned by the former prime minister, Theresa May, also called for further education and skills to have a fairer share of funding. A spokeswoman for Universities UK warned that any changes to the teaching grant or fees could leave a ""funding gap"". ""The fundamental review will cover 'how' teaching funding will be allocated - what will also matter is 'how much' teaching funding will there be, particularly if the government is minded to make any changes to fees,"" said the spokeswoman.

"This video can not be played Danny Butcher's family said he was reassured that after the course he would soon make enough money to pay off his debts A soldier killed himself after paying Â£13,000 for training with a property company that promises to help people become ""financially free"". The family of army reservist Danny Butcher, 37, said he never made the money he thought he would. Dozens of people want refunds from Property Investors, which has been described as operating like a ""cult"". The company, run by former illusionist Samuel Leeds, said: ""People should only purchase courses they can afford."" Mr Butcher's widow Charlotte has visited his grave almost every day since he died in October Mr Butcher, from Doncaster, had spoken about his mental health in the past and his family said he had existing debt before he took on loans and credit card debt to pay Property Investors. His family said he had been led to believe he would make enough money from property deals and rental income to replace a wage or salary. Mr Butcher's widow Charlotte, 32, said: ""I think that he felt that he'd let everyone down, that he'd messed everything up and that there was no way out of it. ""All he wanted was his own chance at making something of himself for me and his son, he saw this as his opportunity. ""Obviously taking out all of the loans, he put himself on the line, but it was a bit like 'yeah it's scary but without risk there's no reward'. ""He genuinely thought this was his chance because of how easy they made it all sound."" Samuel Leeds said at the time of Mr Butcher's death he was ""heartbroken"" it had happened Property Investors puts on free two-day crash courses, offering people the option to sign up to a training academy where they will learn how to become ""financially free"" by investing in property. The company described Mr Leeds as having ""found his own success"" after attending training courses, with his wealth coming ""primarily from his property investment activity"". Mr Leeds posts videos on YouTube nearly every day promoting his methods. In one he joked that he would punch people in the throat unless they subscribed to his YouTube channel. In one clip he promises to work one-on-one with his customers, to provide ""a custom, tailored, bespoke plan"" and ""hold your hand, make it happen"". Mr Butcher attended a free course in March with his brother-in-law Glyn Jones. Glyn Jones, Mr Butcher's brother-in-law, said he felt people on the crash course were ""pressurised"" into signing up for further training Mr Jones said: ""It felt like brainwashing, like a religious cult kind of thing but done on a much smaller scale. ""What he's offering never appears, I don't see how it can."" According to his wife, Mr Butcher's ""gut instinct"" told him not to sign up for the academy and he held out for two days before changing his mind, swayed by the promise of exclusive mentorship and one-to-one training. Mr Butcher's family said he did not get the support he had been promised. The company said academy members had access to weekly video calls and monthly webinars with specialist property coaches. After failing to make any money, Danny Butcher took his own life in October. At the time, Mr Leeds made a public statement on Facebook: ""I am deeply saddened to hear that Danny Butcher took his own life. ""This tragic news comes as a great shock to many and I am heartbroken that this has happened. My thoughts and prayers are with Danny's family at this time."" Mr Butcher took his own life just 11 weeks after his wedding The BBC has become aware of dozens of people who have said they signed up for Property Investors' training and now wanted their money back. At least 78 people are trying to claim back more than Â£200,000 between them. Dianne Granville got a refund from Property Investors in 2018 and has been helping a group of people to try to get their money back. She said: ""There are very vulnerable people out there and he's preying on them. ""I'm lucky. I realised what was happening to me and I dealt with it."" In a statement, the company said it was ""proud to run the largest property investment training business in the UK"". ""We are humbled to have the opportunity to help thousands of people on their journey towards financial freedom through property investments every year,"" the statement said. Andrew Whyte said all he had to show for his money was a folder full of documents Army veteran Andrew Whyte, who served in the Falklands and Afghanistan, said he intended to pursue the company through the small claims court. He said he handed over his armed forces pension payout to cover the cost of the training. Mr Whyte said: ""I ended up having to skip meals or have Pot Noodle sandwiches, stuff like that, the cheapest tins and cheapest noodles, just to have food and to eat. ""If I was living on my own I'd probably be on the streets by now. I'd be surviving off the street if I hadn't had the support from friends and family members."" In a statement, the company said: ""While we are not lenders or financial advisors, our stated view is that people should only purchase courses that they can afford."" It said there was no obligation for people who attended the crash course to sign up for further paid training, while there was a two-stage application process for the training academy and a 14-day cooling-off period during which people could request a refund. The company said any requests for refunds outside the cooling-off period would be considered on a case by case basis but it was not ""fair or right"" for people to attend courses and then ""seek not to pay for them with no legitimate reason"". The BBC has been told the training academy provides the same information freely available on Mr Leeds's YouTube channel A BBC reporter went undercover on one of Property Investors' crash courses and filmed a speaker telling people it was possible to make up to Â£50,000 a month from something called ""deal sourcing"". This involved finding houses for sale on property websites such as Rightmove and working out how much rental income they could generate before selling this information to investors. On the first day of the course, which lasted from 09:00 to 23:00, the reporter was invited to apply for the training academy. During a selection interview the next day, she was encouraged to sign up despite saying she was unable to afford it and would have to increase her credit card limit to cover the costs. Property expert Bruce Collinson said: ""There's nothing easy about property investing, you get out of it what you put in to it. ""This is a scheme, an investment, a gamble, where you could lose the lot and if you haven't got anything to start with then where are you going to end up? Bankrupt, repossessed, if you have property, or worse."" In a statement, the company said: ""Investing in property is not for everyone. We do not advise those who cannot fully commit to the time and effort it takes to participate."" Mr Butcher's dad Alan said his son ""totally believed"" what he had been told by Property Investors There is currently no regulation of the property training industry in the UK, anyone can set themselves up as a trainer and no-one verifies whether they are what they say they are, or if they provide the training they promise. This is something Mr Butcher's family said they wanted to see changed. His father Alan said: ""The only thing I can do for Danny is to try and make people aware so they don't end up wasting their money and putting themselves in a bad place. If it does that, what's a meaningless loss of life won't be quite so meaningless."" In a statement, the company said: ""We think that debate about standards and regulation in our sector is a good thing and it is something that we look forward to actively leading as it develops.""

"Canada has offered compensation to help with the immediate costs for families of some victims of Flight PS752 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Canada will compensate families of the victims of the Ukraine Airlines crash. The funds are designed to assist families of victims who are Canadians citizens or permanent residents in covering related costs such as travel. Mr Trudeau said families would receive C$25,000 ($19,200; Â£14,600) per victim. Fifty-seven Canadian nationals were on the plane when it was hit by an Iranian air defence missile earlier this month. ""This is a unique and unprecedented situation because of the international sanctions place in Iran and the difficulties that that imposes on these families,"" Mr Trudeau said on Friday. ""This is the first step. These families have lost a loved one in extraordinary circumstances and this grieving is even more difficult as a result,"" he said. Families are facing immediate financial pressures as they sort out the necessary funeral arrangements and travel in the wake of the tragedy, said Mr Trudeau. ""These families need help now,"" he said. The prime minister said Canada still expected Iran to financially compensate the victims' families for their loss. The Ukraine International Airlines flight crashed shortly after taking off from the Iranian capital Tehran on 8 January, killing all 176 passengers and crew members on board. Iran initially denied it was involved, but later admitted the plane was brought down by a missile fired in error. Mr Trudeau said Iran has been asked to send the ""black box"" flight and cockpit data recorders from a crashed jet to France, saying it was one of the few countries with the ability to quickly analyse the badly damaged devices. Why were so many Canadians on doomed Iran plane? Who are the victims of Iran plane crash? He also said 20 families of Canadian victims had requested the repatriation of remains and that the first of those remains are expected to be returned to Canada in the coming days. Also on Friday, Canada's Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne met with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, in Oman to press Mr Zarif on full access for officials from Canada  and other affected nation to assist in the investigation into the passenger plane crash. On Thursday, ministers from five nations which lost citizens on the flight demanded full co-operation from Iran in a transparent international inquiry into the crash. The foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Britain, Canada, Sweden and Ukraine also said Iran must pay compensation. They agreed on five key demands to Iran, including a ""thorough, independent and transparent international investigation"" and compensation to the victims' families.

"In the great chess game that is world trade, the pieces are shifting slowly around the board. Only in this game there are three major players not two: the US, China and the European Union. EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan likes to speak plainly We've now had a chance to see the first moves from new EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan after his appearance at an event in Washington. And he's choosing a new way to play the game. Whereas here in the UK, the government treads delicately when dealing with the nations it wants to strike trade deals with, Mr Hogan was rather more blunt, talking about the ""bluffing"", ""sabre-rattling"" and ""short term thinking"" of the Trump administration. Mr Hogan reflected sceptically on whether yesterday's China-US partial deal had achieved much, and also suggested that the EU would examine that deal for compliance with global trade rules. The US administration has threatened to withdraw security cooperation from countries that use 5G equipment from the Chinese firm Huawei. Mr Hogan said: ""I think it's a bit of sabre rattling. At the end of the day we can call their bluff on that one"". Phil Hogan: The ex-farmer leading trade negotiations for the EU And yet at the same time, he has joined forces with the US and Japan to tackle the ""threat"" of China's use of industrial subsidies. There are other emerging fronts in the US-EU battle - on tech taxes, and on the environment and carbon taxes. The UK is about to join the players at the table in its own right, stepping in at a time of tumult, and working out how closely it wants to sit by the EU. The EU meanwhile has other priorities on the world stage. That is one reason why Mr Hogan dismissed Boris Johnson's self-imposed end of 2020 deadline for a post-Brexit trade deal as ""just not possible"" describing it as ""brinkmanship"". More than that, he specifically indicated that if this was the approach the UK wanted to take, then only a subset of the agreed Brexit political declaration would be up for detailed discussion, and that agreement on that would be needed by 30 June. This suggests that the EU may be planning to ""prioritise"" - ie not follow the mandate from the EU27 for UK-EU talks to reflect the UK's timetable - and will not talk about the full 36-page political agreement. The UK now has to choose its strategy: on whether to pursue fully parallel talks with the US, whether to publish a detailed negotiating mandate for such talks, and how to assert itself alongside Japan at a World Trade Organisation dominated by US-EU-China. That is all still to be fleshed out. No one seems entirely sure if the Department for International Trade will even continue to exist as the government contemplates restructuring Whitehall. There are many fundamental decisions to be made. But when it comes to sizing up the UK's opponents across the table, the EU is making one thing clear: it can talk as tough as Trump.
