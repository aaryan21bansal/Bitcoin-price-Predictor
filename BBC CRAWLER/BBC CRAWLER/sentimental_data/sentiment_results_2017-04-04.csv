"Jeff De Young served in Afghanistan with a bomb-detection dog named Cena N641, a black Labrador. In the intense atmosphere of war the two developed an unbreakable bond. This is the story of how Cena helped Jeff survive not only war, but also life after war. The day I turned 18 I started Marine Corps boot camp, and 15 months later I went to Afghanistan. It was 2009 and I was absolutely terrified. They paired us with the dogs based on our personalities. Cena was a slightly goofy, quiet dog, and I was a slightly goofy, quiet kid, so it made sense for us to be with each other. Together we were known as Kid and Chicken. Chicken was one of those nicknames that you don't remember where it came from, it just kinda stuck. And although I was 19 by this stage, I looked like I was about 12, I didn't even have any facial hair. As a joke, the Marines mailed a permission slip home for my mom to sign because I looked so young they didn't believe that I was allowed to be over there. I would operate Cena using hand and arm commands and a whistle. I'd be in front of the patrol and Cena would be further ahead again, so if either of us walked on an improvised explosive device, although we would have been hurt, the rest of the patrol would be safe. I'd never been faced with a situation like that before and it felt like a crash course in adulthood, responsibility, and survival. Cena had been a champion bird dog. When waterfowl falls from the sky there is no scent trail to follow like there would be with a rabbit or a deer, so the dog has to investigate the area and find the scent on the wind, it's amazing. Dogs' noses are so much more powerful than ours. We smell cookies, but they smell the flour, the nutmeg, the butter, the eggs, the milk - they can dissect everything and they can detect smells that we don't even know exist. He'd been trained to detect more than 300 different types of explosives and if he smelled something interesting on patrol he would lie down and notify me, and then I'd call in an explosives technician. We had to trust each other - we would have a dozen, two dozen marines behind us and any mistake could have been fatal. This video can not be played Listen: Jeff describes how Cena supported him during his darkest hours serving in Afghanistan The battle of Marjah was a turning point in my life. We approached the town before the sun came up, no-one was talking, no-one was joking. It was very tense. You could hear the rounds snap overhead, and then when the round went past you, you heard a zing almost like a whistle. I was so worried about getting Cena to safety, I even had to lie on top of him to protect him from gunfire. Another time I carried him through a freezing cold, flooded river on my shoulders like a hunter would a deer. It got so cold in the fighting holes that even Cena's body heat didn't help, so one day I offered an Afghan soldier the entire contents of my wallet for his scratchy, olive, drab wool army blanket. I had $100 (Â£80) in my wallet. I was either going to burn the money or get the blanket, that's how cold I was. I still have that blanket. The first week inside Marjah I lost a couple of very good friends. One of them was a former room-mate I'd trained with, Lance Corporal Alejandro Yazzie. He was 23, a Navajo, and an all-round good guy. His grandfather had been awind talker [code talker]in World War Two. When I found out it was Yazzie I was devastated. I held on to Cena and cried into him. Yazzie was the first of seven friends I lost in Afghanistan. I carried a flag inside my helmet and whenever a friend would pass away I'd add their name to it. Eventually I just couldn't cope any more. I grabbed my military rifle and went to the latrine area. I remember sitting there trying to prepare my mind and make peace, and then Cena peeked around the corner. His ears went up like in the cartoons and he opened his mouth like he was smiling. His tail started spinning so hard that his whole body was rocking back and forth like he was excited by a piece of bacon. I started laughing, and I laughed so much that I just broke down crying. I realised then that I couldn't leave Cena because I didn't know if his next handler would love him the way I did. He really was the only person in my life that I had a deep relationship with at that time. I left the latrine, put my rifle back and focused on work. Jeff De Young spoke toThe Documentary: It's a dog's lifeon the BBC World Service It's really hard to explain what it's like, psychologically, coming back from war. Even the drive home was strange. New music was out, new cars were on the roads, there were new stores. It felt like when you leave the cinema to get popcorn and then miss the best part of the film. I got married three days after returning and I was so busy doing all this happy stuff, it was like a Band-Aid over Afghanistan. But I wasn't really taking care of myself and dealing with what had happened over there. A couple of weeks after coming home the post-traumatic stress (PTSD) and separation anxiety from being away from Cena really hit me. I'd always understood that I wouldn't have him forever but I'd had no idea how being apart from him would affect me. I felt like a stranger at home and I didn't feel comfortable unless I was with my battalion members or other veterans. I had nightmares and spent many nights crying in the bedroom corner or talking out loud to my fallen friends. Over the next four years Cena was always on my mind, but as time went on it became hard to keep up hope that we would be together again. Then one day, when I was in college, I got a call. The woman on the phone said: ""Mr De Young? My name is Mrs Godfrey, would you like to adopt your bomb dog?"" Without even thinking I said, ""Heck, yes!"" That was 24 April 2014, one day shy of four years since Cena and I had been separated. It was just a turmoil of emotions on the car ride there. When Cena came down the aisle I very awkwardly - like a guy crossing a high school dance floor - ran up, kneeled down and started hugging him. He leaned into me like, ""Hey man, what's up?"" and started licking my face. Aside from my children being born and the day I was married, that was the happiest day of my life. It was like all of my Christmases rolled into one. I'd been married for four years by the time I got Cena back. Unfortunately, my inability to recognise that I had issues as a result of being in Afghanistan ultimately led to my divorce. Cena was helping me with healing and support but the damage to my relationship was already done. On 5 June 2015 I ended my marriage. I have three daughters, they are six, five and two-and-a-half. Cena took to them instantly, and they love him back - they try to paint his nails and put bows on him. Before getting Cena back, the sound of a child crying would trigger a panic attack in me,  as a result of an incident in Afghanistan, and it was tough knowing that I couldn't help my kids because my brain couldn't process that memory. With Cena, if my daughters cried I would sit on the couch, put my forehead to his, scratch his ears and just breathe. Gradually, Cena would only need to be beside me and I could cope. By the time my third daughter was born I was able to do a lot of the diaper changes and bottle feeding even if she was crying, and to finally be able to help my daughter felt like being released from jail, it was freedom. I'm a military ambassador for the American Humane Association now and I travel around the country raising awareness about how important it is to reunite service dogs with their handlers, and how the dogs can be a vital form of treatment for veterans with PTSD. My work is most definitely therapy for me, too. The military teaches us how to put the uniform on, but it doesn't teach us how to take it off, metaphorically speaking. I've lost count of how many friends I've lost now, who've taken their lives - four just last year alone. I couldn't even think about talking about what I saw in Afghanistan four or five years ago, but slowly, by opening up to other veterans, by putting myself out there and airing everything that happened it's becoming so much easier. I've recently found out that I have a heart condition called tachycardia. The doctors say it was probably triggered by an explosion or something that happened in Afghanistan. When I'm stressed my heart rate goes up to 200 beats per minute, high enough for a heart attack, so I'm having an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) fitted in my chest. I'm still mentally processing the idea that soon I'm going to have an electronic box in my chest to keep my heart in check. Cena is in OK health, although his front wrist bothers him and his hips are pretty bad. He'd been back to Afghanistan, and I tracked down two of his other handlers through Facebook. I keep them up to date with how he is doing and I hope to get them to come to Michigan to see him - it's been years since they've seen Cena too. Cena was retired after his third deployment because of a hip injury and there's no doubt in my mind that he has PTSD. I think he has memories of things that he saw that he doesn't like. He has nightmares, he'll whimper, he'll run around in his sleep and his teeth will snarl. But he's always by my side - we go to the gym together, we go to college together - my college even wants to get him his own cap and gown for when I graduate. Cena's nine-and-a-half now. Dogs tend to live to 11 or 12, so I've started making peace with the fact that he may pass away soon. I've been preparing my mind for that.

"Anna says she would have been in hospital for longer if it wasn't for the system On a hospital ward in Leeds, parents of premature babies are encouraged to help care for their newborns - from taking temperatures to the delicate task of inserting feeding tubes. So how does the approach benefit families? ""It is just nice to feel like a mum, rather than just somebody watching,"" Anna Cox tells theVictoria Derbyshire programme, as she takes the temperature of her baby. Lola was born at just 23 weeks. She had a twin brother who sadly did not survive and she was given little hope of survival. ""During labour, one of the neo-natal consultants came to see us and painted a really bad picture that she could have all sorts of problems,"" Anna says. Lola was cared for at St James's University Hospital in Leeds -the first in the UK to implement a family integrated care system. It put parents - not nurses - in charge of everything other than the most complicated medical treatments for their premature babies while they were in hospital. ""One of the jobs we have to do is take her temperature, maybe every three or four hours,"" Anna says. ""It is a pretty simple procedure really."" However, parents also perform more complicated tasks, including inserting a tube into their baby's nose to allow them to feed. ""There are certain things they [nurses] obviously watch over you quite a bit to begin with because it needs to be done right,"" she says. ""They do like to make sure you know what you're doing, they wouldn't just leave you to it."" This video can not be played Lola was born at just 23 weeks Katie Crossley's daughter, Molly, was born eight weeks early and had breathing difficulties. ""While I'm here, I pretty much do everything that a normal mum would do,"" she says. ""Everything, from feeding to medicine, cleaning, bathing."" She has also been taught how to insert a tube up Molly's nose and into her stomach allowing her to be fed. ""Being around it and watching it has made me more confident when I've come to actually doing it,"" she says. In the past, caring for premature babies usually meant keeping parents at arm's length. As recently as 20 years ago, the closest parents of premature babies could get to their newborns was looking at them through a glass window. It meant the bond between parent and child was harder to establish and breastfeeding rates were often lower. But the idea of putting parents in charge of neonatal care is not a new one. In the 1970s in Tallinn, Estonia - then part of the Soviet Union - the head of the local hospital faced a problem. The hospital had too many premature babies to look after and not enough nurses. However, they soon noticed the system was helping babies. Under his system, mothers had more regular ""skin to skin"" contact with premature babies. It resulted in better breastfeeding rates and shorter hospital stays. It took 30 years for other hospitals to copy the system, but now the system has been introduced in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and now Leeds. Katie Crossley says she is now confident inserting a tube to feed her baby Dr Liz McKechnie, consultant neonatologist at St James's, says the family integrated care scheme aims to put the parent at ""the very centre of the team caring for the baby"". ""It is not rocket science, it is such a straightforward thing to do, to allow parents to look after their babies,"" she says. She is adamant the move was not down to cost-cutting and that nursing levels on the unit have not dropped. ""In the past, care has been very much the nurse leading it, so they're saying 'right, it's feed time, it's bath time'. Whereas now, it is very much the parents who are leading that. ""They are feeding the baby when the baby needs feeding, rather than when the clock says it is feed time - and that's much better for the baby."" She says the new system was a ""major cultural change"" and caused anxiety among nurses on the neonatal unit when it was introduced 18 months ago. Nurses on the ward say training parents to care for their babies takes as long - if not longer - than doing the procedures themselves. But they say families are getting home sooner, the long-term development of babies is improving and breastfeeding rates have increased. The system is about to be trialled in the intensive care unit in St James's sister hospital. Parents are encouraged to take the temperature of their babies As for Lola, she was allowed home just before she was 14 weeks old. ""Without the family integrated care we would've been in a lot longer,"" says her mother, Anna. ""Lola is still on oxygen and [otherwise] they wouldn't have allowed us to come home with that. ""I feel really confident in everything they taught us."" Dr McKechnie adds: ""The fact is that families are going home more confident and more able to care for their babies, and that means a lot. ""Nobody wants to stop it, it is definitely here to stay, everybody can see the benefits of it.""

"Donald Trump campaigned for president as the ultimate outsider, promising to unseat a corrupt and atrophied Washington establishment. Now, after two months in office, has he become the establishment? Are Trump and his team the insiders now? One thing the recent collapse of healthcare reform efforts in the House of Representatives has revealed is just how quickly attitudes and alliances can shift in Washington, DC. Last year Mr Trump and members of the House Freedom Caucus, a collection of 30 or so libertarian-leaning fiscal conservatives in Congress, were singing from the same anti-government hymnal. Now, however, Mr Trump is the government - and he teamed up with congressional leadership to back a healthcare bill that conservative hard-liners believe didn't go far enough in undoing the 2009 Democratic-designed system. The effort's failure set off back-and-forth sniping between Mr Trump and the Freedom Caucus that morphed into a classic insider-outsider faceoff, with Mr Trump cast as the new voice of the powers that be. Freedom Caucus - Do these 29 white men run America? Congressman Justin Amash said the White House has become part of the hated status quo - the ""Trumpstablishment"", he called it in a Saturday tweet. This video can not be played Ivanka Trump treads gingerly into West Wing ethics minefield That line drew the ire of Mr Trump's director of social media, Dan Scavino Jr, whotweeted,externalthat Mr Amash was a ""big liability"" and encouraged Michigan voters to unseat him in next year's Republican primary. (The tweet hassince been criticised,externalas a possible violation of a federal law preventing executive branch officials from attempting to influence election campaigns.) If Mr Trump's conservative critics are trying to make the case that the president has become the establishment he campaigned against, their arguments have been buttressed by the financial disclosure documents released by the White House on Friday evening, which revealed exactly how well-heeled and connected many of the top White House staff are.According to,externalthe Washington Post, 27 members of Mr Trump's team have combined assets exceeding $2.3bn (Â£1.84bn). Presidential daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner - both unpaid presidential advisers - are worth roughly $740m. Senior White House strategist Steve Bannon earned as much as $2.3 million in 2017. Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs executive who is one of Mr Trump's top economics advisers, has a net worth approaching $611m. The New York Timespoints out,externalthat many in the inner circle of the putatively anti-establishment Mr Trump drew significant sums from the network of big-money political donors, think tanks and associated political action committees that populate the Washington insider firmament. ""The figures reveal the extent to which private political work has bolstered the financial fortunes of Trump aides, who have made millions of dollars from Republican and other conservative causes in recent years,"" the paper reported. Already there are signs that conservative true-believers - some of whom were never fully sold on  Mr Trump to begin with - are questioning Mr Trump's anti-establishment bona fides. ""That's the dirty little secret,""writes,externalconservative columnist Ben Shapiro. ""Trump isn't anti-establishment; he's pro-establishment so long as he's the establishment."" Even conservative radio host Laura Ingraham, an early Trump supporter, is having some doubts. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump railed against the Washington establishment ""I think it is really, really unhelpful to Donald Trump's ultimate agenda to slam the very people who are going to be propping up his border wall, all the things he wants to do on immigration, on trade,""she said,externalon Fox News.""I don't know where he thinks he's going to get his friends on those issues."" Perhaps of greatest concern to Mr Trump is that the failure to enact promised healthcare reform, along with his recent feud with members of his own party, have been accompanied by a softening of his core support in recent polls. In aRasmussen survey,external, the number of Americans who ""strongly approve"" of the president has dropped from 44% at shortly after his inauguration to 28% today. While the Republican base is largely sticking with Mr Trump so far, they may be starting to have some doubts. For much of 2016 Donald Trump was the barbarian at the gate, threatening to rain fire on the comfortable Washington power elite. Even in his January inaugural address, he condemned an establishment that ""protected itself"" at the cost of average Americans. ""Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land,"" he said. Now, however, Mr Trump and his team of formerly angry outsiders meet in the Oval Office. They fly on Air Force One. They host events in the White House rose garden. They issue tweets warning apostates of harsh political consequences. They walk the halls of power and call the shots. It doesn't get any more ""insider"" than that.

"Trond Bonesmo welcomes Norway's new low-carbon electric ferries It might be slow, but the romance of commuting by ferry is not lost on Trond Bonesmo as he boards MF Norangsfjord for the crossing from Magerholm to Sykkylven. ""It's a welcome break, and the view isn't too bad either,"" he says as he looks across the sea towards the Sunnmoere Alps' snow-covered peaks. ""A bridge across the fjord would obviously make the crossing faster, but Storfjorden is two or three kilometres wide and 700 metres deep, which makes it very expensive to build one,"" says Mr Bonesmo, IT and operations manager for a consumer goods company. Many Norwegian fjords present similar difficulties to bridge builders, so instead the country's coastal population relies on ferries that link their often remote communities. Each year, some 20 million cars, vans and trucks cross the country's many fjords on roughly 130 ferry routes. Most of Norway's ferries run on diesel, spewing out noxious fumes and CO2. But this is about to change. Building bridges across Norway's mountain-flanked fjords would be difficult and costly Following two years of trials of the world's first electric car ferry, named Ampere, ferry operators are busy making the transition from diesel to comply with new government requirements for all new ferry licensees to deliver zero- or low-emission alternatives. ""We continue the work with low-emission ferries because we believe it will benefit the climate, Norwegian industry and Norwegian jobs,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg said in a speech in April 2016, in which she vowed to help fund required quayside infrastructure. Ferry company Fjord1, which operates the MF Norangsfjord, has ordered three fully electric ferries that are scheduled to enter active service on some of its routes in January 2018. Multi Maritime, which designed the ferries, welcomes the growth in demand. ""Several years of investment in sustainable technologies have resulted in us having more than 10 fully electric and plug-in hybrid ferries under construction by several yards,"" says Gjermund Johannessen, managing director. Multi Maritime has designed three electric ferries for Fjord1 In addition to new-builds, the marine division of Siemens, which developed the technology for Ampere, believes 84 ferries are ripe for conversion to electric power. And 43 ferries on longer routes would benefit from conversion to hybrids that use diesel engines to charge their batteries. If this were done, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions would be cut by 8,000 tonnes per year and CO2 emissions by 300,000 tonnes per year, equivalent to the annual emissions from 150,000 cars, according to a report penned jointly by Siemens and the environmental campaign group, Bellona. Click here for more Technology of Business features,external Long-distance ferries are not well suited to electrification, but about 70% of Norway's ferries cover relatively short crossings, so switching to electric power would pay for itself in a few years, according to the report. Each ferry would save about a million litres of diesel per year, helping to reduce energy costs by 60% or more, says Odd Moen, head of sales at Siemens' marine division. ""The electricity to power Ampere, with its 360 passengers and 120 cars, across a six kilometre-wide fjord costs about 50 kroner (Â£4.65; $5.80),"" he says. ""In Norway, that won't even pay for a cup of coffee and a waffle."" Norway's older ferries are also being converted from diesel to electric Ampere's electric powertrain, which was designed by Fjellstrand shipyard using Siemens technology, includes an 800kWh battery pack weighing in at a hefty 11 tonnes, which powers two electric motors, one either side of the vessel. The batteries are fully charged overnight, but as each of the 34 daily 20-minute crossings of the Sognefjorden requires 150kWh, the battery must be topped up during loading and unloading as well. During initial trials, the fast charging placed excessive strain on the local grid, designed as it was to service a relatively small population. To lighten the load, high-capacity batteries were put on constant charge on either side of the fjord, ready to transfer the electricity quickly to the ferry's batteries whilst docked. The charging added an extra burden to the Ampere crew's busy schedules. But this challenge is being dealt with by the latest electric ferry designs, which incorporate fully automatic charging systems. Emissions from diesel-powered ferries have always been a problem. ""When they're docked, their engines are idling - that's when you see those black fumes coming out of their chimneys - and then they're accelerating hard away from land, so their engines are never operating with maximum efficiency,"" explains Mr Moen. Ferry pollution is an issue for most busy city ports; Hong Kong is no exception Mr Moen says he has registered much interest in the technology from overseas, and urges other governments to require and support a switch from diesel to electric ferries where appropriate. Indeed, emissions from ferries is a problem not just in Norway, but in coastal communities and cities all over the world. This is why Scotland has been moving to lower-carbon hybrid ferries - combining diesel and lithium-ion batteries - with three ferries now in operation. In Hong Kong, the Environmental Protection Department has long been waging a war on emissions from ferries that are responsible for much of Victoria Harbour's poor air quality. Similarly, in New Zealand a single ferry visit to Wellington used to pollute the air as much as all Wellington's cars did in a month, according to National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research figures. Back in rural Sykkylven, where the air is relatively fresh, NOx emissions pose less of a problem than in a congested city. But CO2 emissions from ferries should be curbed nevertheless to help combat climate change, Mr Bonesmo says, as he steers his electric car off the ferry. By 2020, an all-electric solution will have replaced the current diesel-electric ferry on the Magerholm-Sykkylven crossing. ""And then my entire commute will be emissions free,"" Mr Bonesmo grins.

"She made her name as the youngest member of girl band The Saturdays - but Vanessa White has ditched the squeaky clean pop of All Fired Up and What About Us for an altogether more intriguing foray into sultry and infectious R&B. It's two o'clock on a crisp November day and Vanessa White saunters up to the gates of Ealing Studios in west London. The film studio has played host to Shaun of the Dead, Bridget Jones and the entire ""downstairs"" set of Downton Abbey - but she's not here to film a cameo (""Can you imagine?"" she giggles). Instead, the 27-year-old climbs the fire escape of a dilapidated high-rise building, enters a propped-open door and navigates the corridors to a small back room that's been converted into a recording studio. Like all such facilities, it's painted black and littered with empty liquor bottles. The walls are haphazardly decorated with polaroids of previous occupants - including US hitmakers The Chainsmokers - and, in the corner, there's a tiny figurine of Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Inside, Vanessa's producer SwiftKnight is ready and waiting, sorting through various tracks he's hoping she might choose for her forthcoming EP. But first, the singer has a confession: ""I've got a sore throat and I'm a bit hung over."" It doesn't seem to matter. If anything, the consensus is that a husky voice is better for the material - a sultry and sumptuous serving of downtempo R&B; all heavy breathing and soaring harmonies. Staving off the hangover with a ""nourishing"" lunch box, Vanessa explains her musical state of mind to the team. ""Everything I'm doing now is so dark,"" she says, cueing up a song on her phone. ""Not like I-want-to-kill-myself dark, but it's quite angry."" One of the tracks - tentatively called Trust - is seething with vitriol. ""I won't stroke your ego,"" she spits. ""I'm onto you, I'm onto you. Don't underestimate my intelligence."" The song was inspired by encounters with ""snaky people"" in the music industry, she explains: Specifically, a toxic situation that developed around her and ended up ""with the lawyers"" last year. She can't discuss the details, but says her solo career was significantly delayed as a result. The EP she's working on today was originally due last summer. ""There were certain songs I loved that I couldn't use any more,"" she explains. ""So I've basically had to start again, which is why it's taken this long. ""The silver lining is it's given me something to write about. I'm in a much better position now, mentally. ""I used to get so scared of going in the studio with people I didn't know but now, you could put me anywhere and I'd be fine."" Vanessa certainly takes charge in the studio. Having brought the producers up to speed, she sits cross-legged on a sofa as they scroll through a few skeleton songs, looking for ""an uptempo track with a dark heart"". One by one, Vanessa dismisses them. ""That's too light,"" she says of one.  ""I'm not instantly drawn to it,"" is her verdict on the next. After half a dozen tracks are waved off, engineerDay Decosta,externalbrings up a simple loop built around a gooey, pulsing bass groove. Vanessa instantly sits up, alert. ""Oh, I like this."" She starts ad-libbing vocal riffs over the top, trading ideas with co-writer Celetia Martin, a former vocalist for Groove Armada whose credits include Skepta, Conor Maynard and, yes, The Saturdays. Within minutes, she heads to the vocal booth. ""I don't really know what I'm doing right now,"" she laughs. ""I'm just going to sing loads of random nonsense."" Slowly, painstakingly, the song takes shape. Some of the improvisations stick and are pieced together into a coherent melody. Every so often, Vanessa emerges from the booth to kneel on the floor with Celetia, and the pair go back and forth over lyrics and harmonies. When inspiration dries up, they scroll through Instagram, gossip about TV box sets, and goof off doing theMannequin Challenge,externalfor Vanessa's Instagram page. Conversation eventually turns to the singer's upcoming holiday, a ""juice retreat"" in Portugal, where solid food is forbidden for an entire week. It sounds awful (althoughphotos from the journey,externalsuggest otherwise) - but it's apparently the standard sort of torture female pop stars endure before the promotional round of video and photo shoots begin. ""It sounds worse than what it was,"" laughs the singer when we catch up four months later. ""Honestly, if you were hungry it wasn't like they starved you. They added more to the smoothies or they'd give you a piece of fruit. It was actually fine. ""I feel like I need another one  now, that's the problem!"" In any case, the 27-year-old counts dressing up and being photographed as a perk of her job... although it wasn't always that way. ""When I was in The Sats, it actually got a bit boring having to be made up every single day,"" she says. ""I stopped appreciating it. ""Now I can come to the studio looking likethisand it's fine. Dressing up has become more of a treat again."" Back at Ealing Studios, work continues late into the night - long after the BBC has left the building, having contributed precisely zero to the writing process. The song is ultimately destined for the scrapheap, but Trust (completely overhauled and re-titled Trust Me) makes it onto Vanessa'sChapter Two EP,external, which was released last Friday. As she predicted, it set the tone for a collection of brooding neo-soul that's surprisingly candid about anger, lust and sexuality. Fans of The Saturdays' chirrupy chart fodder are in for quite a surprise. ""I guess people are going to question it,"" she admits of her new direction. ""But I feel pop is not very me at the moment. ""It took a bit of time to find a sound thatwascompletely right for me. Now I feel like I've really nailed it, and it's obvious it's coming from me. Once people believe that, you're half-way there."" Born in 1989, the star was just 17 when The Saturdays formed Certainly, the sophisticated harmonies and complex ad-libs reflect the US singers she grew up idolising - Janet, Alliyah, Brandy and Mariah - without sounding like a cheap, plastic counterfeit. ""We've had a problem with that in the UK in the past,"" she acknowledges. ""I don't know why we haven't really got the sounds right before - but this is what I listened to for years and years, so I guess that's where it's come from."" The EP has been well-reviewed on the sort of music sites that would have given The Saturdays a wide berth. But it's hard to see where the music fits in the current charts, crammed full of Ed Sheeran's acoustic pop and The Chainsmokers' emo EDM. ""To be honest with you, I'm not even thinking about that,"" says the singer. ""With everything that's happened this year, including the label stuff, I've ended up doing this on my own - and at this point I'm preferring it, to be honest. ""I feel like I have to run with this. I'm not going to be hard on myself and expect it to be [huge] at this point. ""Whatever happens will happen."" Vanessa White's Chapter Two EP is out now on Salute the Sun Records.

"Mrs May has defended Britain's ties with the Saudi regime Prime Minister Theresa May flies into Saudi Arabia on Tuesday for a two-day visit to Britain's biggest trading partner in the Arab world. For the British, the visit has a straightforward agenda; in a world overshadowed by the uncertainties of Brexit this trip is primarily about trade and investment - Saudi investment that is - into the UK. British goods and services exported to Saudi Arabia totalled Â£6.6bn ($8.25bn) in 2015. For the Saudi rulers - one of the few remaining absolute monarchies in the world - it is also about something else. The Saudis are feeling increasingly surrounded and threatened by their regional rival Iran and its proxy militias. Theresa May defends UK ties with Saudi Arabia May seeks 'new chapter' in Gulf relations ahead of Bahrain visit Lyse Doucet: Is Saudi Arabia on the cusp of change? When they look at the map of the region they see Iran effectively controlling five Middle Eastern capitals now: Tehran, Baghdad, Damascus, Beirut and Sana'a, and spreading its influence among the Shia populations in Bahrain and along Saudi Arabia's Gulf coast. So the Saudis want to know that their defence alliance with the UK, as well as the US, is rock solid. But left out of the picture are the human rights organisations and campaign groups that want Mrs May to use this visit to pressure the Saudis to both end their military campaign in neighbouring Yemen and to release three young prisoners held on death row. The death toll is mounting from the war in Yemen, at least 7,700 civilians killed according to the UN, most by Saudi-led air strikes, and millions at risk of malnutrition or even starvation. More than 60% of civilian deaths in Yemen are due to Saudi-led air strikes, the UN says In Yemen, the Saudis and their allies the UAE are determined to reverse what they see as an Iranian-backed coup by minority Houthi rebels who have illegally taken over half the country, including the capital, and carried out numerous human rights abuses since seizing power in 2014. But the Saudis have got themselves bogged down in an unwinnable war and paying the price are Yemen's civilians; schools, hospitals, markets and a funeral have all been hit by clumsy targeting from the air. This has prompted calls for the UK and the US to stop supplying planes, weapons and intelligence to the Saudis, at the very time that the UK is seeking ever closer ties with the Gulf Arab states. Mrs May has defended the UK's ties with the Saudis by pointing out that they have provided vital intelligence that has saved British lives. This is true. In 2010 a Saudi human informant inside al-Qaeda in Yemen tipped off MI6 that a bomb was hidden in cargo on a plane heading for Britain. It was. The printer ink toner cartridges, packed with PETN explosive, got as far as East Midlands Airport before the police finally discovered them after the agent gave them the serial numbers. Campaigners want the UK government to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and to call for the release of blogger Raif Badawi, sentenced to 10 years and 1,000 lashes for ""insulting Islam"" But Saudi Arabia's human rights record still makes the country a controversial ally for the UK which purports to have an ethical foreign policy. Commenting on Mrs May's Saudi visit, human rights pressure group Reprieve said: ""As the prime minister makes ever greater overtures towards the Saudi government, the kingdom continues to carry out appalling abuses, including torture, forced 'confessions' and death sentences for juveniles. ""Theresa May's desire for closer relations with the Gulf must not cloud Britain's commitment to human rights."" So for Theresa May the coming two days will require something of a balancing act - pushing for much-needed trade, more investment and closer ties with Riyadh and yet at the same time expressing just enough concern at humanitarian issues to avoid excessive criticism at home. May defends UK ties with Saudi Arabia UK sending military trainers to Jordan Time for change in Saudi Arabia?

"Marilyn Shankle-Grant on a recent visit with her son, Paul Storey For the families of men facing the death penalty, money can be a barrier to seeing a loved one before the end. Marilyn Shankle-Grant's son, Paul Storey, has been fighting his death sentence for almost 10 years. All his legal efforts so far have fallen short, and in autumn, a judge set his execution date for 12 April, 2017. Storey was convicted in the 2006 shooting death of 28-year-old Jonas Cherry during an armed robbery. Storey's accomplice - the gunman - pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. Storey went forward with a jury trial and received the death penalty in 2008. Since he was sent to death row, Shankle-Grant has been able to see her son about once a month, making the four-hour drive from her home in Fort Worth, Texas, to the state prison in Livingston, Texas. But recently things have got more difficult for the 57-year-old hospitality worker. The stress and depression over her son's impending execution was affecting her work performance, and she lost a job she had held for 30 years. She tried to pick up temporary work, and even started her own business, Marilyn's Old-Fashioned Tea Cakes, baking flat, buttery rounds from her grandmother's recipe, wrapping them up in cellophane and selling them at local events. But even that small income stream has dried up - she stopped making tea cakes not long after her son's execution date was announced. ""When I do them, I do it with lots of love,"" she explains. ""Right now that's just not in me."" The situation has become dire - her Forth Worth home entered foreclosure this week. She needs $8,000 (about Â£6,400) to save it. The prison in Livingston, Texas, where Paul Storey and other death row inmates are held Her financial difficulty - not to mention her broken car - have made the trips to Livingston a real financial strain, at the same time that the approaching execution date makes them more important than ever. She estimates each trip costs roughly $350. With just six weeks left to visit before her son is executed, Shankle-Grant posted a weary status to her Facebook page, lamenting the short amount of time she has left with her son and the financial struggle she faces just to see him. It caught the eye of Abraham J Bonowitz, co-director of Death Penalty Action, an anti-death penalty charity. He had met Shankle-Grant many times over the years at death penalty abolition events. Bonowitz reached out to Shankle-Grant to ask her permission to set up an online fundraiser on her behalf. He created a page on the crowdfunding site You Caring, which included a note from Shankle-Grant. The death chamber in Huntsville, Texas ""My love and devotion to my son are not matched by the resources needed to make the trip as often as I am allowed to visit him,"" she wrote. ""With a heavy heart I turn to my fellow human light to ask you to help me help my son face the darkness as his destruction approaches."" The donations began streaming in. One anonymous donor contributed $1,000. ""My father was executed in Texas 13 years ago, and while the situation is still painful, I'm thankful for our last few visits, and I know he was as well,"" wrote one contributor. ""Nobody's going to be able to take away the pain that Marilyn has, but we can take away some of the anxiety,"" says Bonowitz, who is considering making these fundraisers a permanent part of his work. So far, he has raised nearly $6,000. The money allows Shankle-Grant to rent a car each weekend, stay for two nights in a nearby hotel, as well as pay for meals and gas. Thanks to the funds, Shankle-Grant has been able to visit her son every weekend since. She says she is incredibly grateful for the help. ""None of this would be able to be happening if it weren't for that You Caring page,"" she says. ""I'm able to talk to him. When he's down and out and depressed, we can talk about it and talk him through it. It gives me comfort, too."" Abraham Bonowitz at an anti-death penalty rally he hosts in front of the US Supreme Court each year Shankle-Grant's situation illustrates the hidden impact on the families of the condemned, who often come from low-income backgrounds and can live far away from the prison in which their loved one is housed. After 30 years of death penalty abolition work, Bonowitz has seen the situation many times before. Often a church or a non-profit will step in to help defray the cost of visiting a family member before an execution. ""None of these families have any money,"" he says. ""Marilyn never did anything wrong and yet she is made to suffer. It's her son's fault, yes, but that doesn't mean the love for her child stops."" The success of the fundraiser caught the attention of advocates in Arkansas, which ispoised to execute eight inmates over the course of 10 days, due to the fact that the state's supply of an execution drug called midazolam is about to expire. Deborah Robinson, a freelance journalist who is writing a book about the eight men, says she has heard from three of them, asking for help so that their families can see them before the execution dates in late April. ""I have a 21-year-old daughter whom I haven't seen in 17 years, along with a 3-year-old granddaughter,"" wrote inmate Kenneth Williams, who is scheduled to die on 27 April, in a message to Robinson. ""The financial costs have prevented her from coming. If I am going to be executed, I would love to see her before I go one last time and to see my grandchild for the first time."" Lynn Scott with her brother Jack Jones, Jr, who has been in prison since 1995 Lynn Scott, the sister of death row inmate Jack Jones, Jr, lives in North Carolina. She runs her own business as a wedding planner, but she and her husband lost nearly everything after the 2008 recession - their house, their 401k, they sold off most of their possessions. After Scott's husband suffered a massive heart attack in 2015, they found themselves financially devastated. ""We live paycheck to paycheck,"" she says. Arkansas is scheduled to execute her brother on 24 April. With airfare, hotel, car rental and meals - plus cremation and burial expenses - she expects that she will need about $5,000. ""It's very difficult,"" says Scott. ""What I want people to know is - whatever the inmates did, we didn't do that. I didn't do that to those people, but I'm still losing someone."" Modelling a crowdfunding page after the one in Texas, Robinson isnow raising funds for all three Arkansas families,externalto help defray some of those costs. Shankle-Grant and Storey on a visit in 2014 If Shankle-Grant's You Caring page raises more money than she can use to see her son, she says she wants the excess funds to go to the families in Arkansas. Her son, Storey, still has a lawyer fighting for a stay of execution, in part based on the fact thathis victim's parents are opposed to the death penalty,externaland do not want him to be executed. Glenn and Judy Cherry have written letters to Texas Governor Greg Abbott and other state officials asking for mercy. Shankle-Grant still holds out hope that her son's execution will be halted, and the portion of the fundraiser money that is designated for her son's burial can be sent to the other families. She is askingsupporters to write letters,externalto the Texas Department of Corrections, asking that Storey's life be spared. In the meantime, because of a court hearing Storey has been moved to a county jail that allows him to use the phone for the first time in years (phone calls are not allowed for death row inmates in his prison). Shankle-Grant says he has been able to talk to his elderly grandparents, who can't travel to see him, and thanks to the fundraiser, she was easily able to pay the hefty $300 phone bill. She is also able to talk to him, sometimes as often as four times a day. It's a small comfort as the execution date creeps closer and closer. ""He'll hang up and call back, hang up and call back,"" she says. ""I don't know after [nine] days if I'm ever going to hear his voice again. For me, it's very important.""

"Rory McIlroy heads to Augusta National second in the world rankings - behind America's Dustin Johnson The Masters, Augusta, 6-9 April Coverage:Watch highlights of the first two days before live and uninterrupted coverage of the weekend's action on BBC Two and up to four live streams available online. Listen on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Radio 5 live sports extra. Read live text commentary, analysis and social media on the BBC Sport website and the sport app.Full details here. Whenever Rory McIlroy's status as the world's most naturally gifted golfer is questioned, there is usually a swift reaction to remind us of his immense talent. The ingredients are there for something similar to happen at this week's Masters but the challenge is formidable with so many big names demonstrating top form so far this year. In 2011, McIlroywon the US Openby eight strokes in his first major sinceblowing that season's Masters. A year later, he suffered a string of missed cuts before winning his second major at the US PGA Championship. And in 2014 he had slipped out of the world's top 10 before embarking on a run that brought him the BMW PGA title at Wentworth and a high summer stretch that yielded the Open, Bridgestone Invitational and PGA crowns in consecutive weeks. Now he heads into the Masters having suffered an injury-blighted start to 2017 while Dustin Johnson has surged to thetop of the world rankings. This video can not be played Masters 2016: Louis Oosthuizen's 'unbelievable' hole-in-one Driving to Masters: The champions dinner No longer is McIlroy unanimously regarded as golf's biggest talent. Johnson shows no weakness; he is powerful, long and straight and supplements those qualities with unerring deftness on and around the greens. Having lifted his first major titleat last year's US Open,the tall American appears unflappable and is playing with a maturity that many thought was beyond him. In short, he looks the perfect golfer and having won his last three tournaments, the strongest events of the year to date, Johnson is the undisputed favourite for victory here at Augusta. But this is the sort of scenario that inspires the best in McIlroy, especially as he seeks the title he craves more than any other. A Masters Green Jacket would complete his set of major prizes. He says he would not be able to feel proper fulfilment if he never wins one. It is a lot of self-imposed pressure and explains ruinous nine-hole spells that have peppered and scarred so many of his Augusta attempts. And McIlroy accepts that each year that passes without landing the Masters makes the next attempt more difficult. He is only 27 but there is a raging impatience. This video can not be played Danny Willett's best shots as he won the Masters Many observers have long held the belief that he is destined to win multiple Green Jackets. But the same was said of the likes of Ernie Els and Greg Norman, and both are still waiting. Norman was fourth on his debut in 1981, runner-up three times and third on three occasions. Listening to him speaking to BBC World Television recently, it was clear that he likes the Northern Irishman's chances of becoming only the sixth player to complete the career grand slam. ""I'm a bit of a McIlroy fan. I like his moxie on the golf course - I like his style,"" said the 62-year-old Australian. And Norman is not concerned that McIlroy's season to date has been heavily disrupted by thefractured ribhe suffered at the start of the year. After finishing second at the South African Open he did not return to action until coming seventh at last month's WGC Mexico Championship. Norman believes that was a tellingly impressive comeback because it was at altitude which makes distance control difficult. ""To step away from the game as long as he did, to step back into the game and compete the way he did tells me he's got really good control of his golf swing,"" Norman said. McIlroy followed up with a fourth place at the Arnold Palmer Invitational before playing only two matches of the group stages of the WGC Matchplay, a tournament that yieldedJohnson's third straight winof the year. And while Norman agrees the big hitter from South Carolina is the front-runner at the 2017 Masters, he also suggests Johnson might prove vulnerable on Augusta's slick greens. ""I do see one little glaring fault that happens under pressure with him,"" Norman said. ""His putting stroke is excellent but at times it does have a tendency of breaking down just a little bit."" The two-time Open winner refused to go into detail but revealed that he tries to help Johnson through the world number one's friendship with his son Gregory. ""What pains me is when I see something on TV and I go, 'Oh my gosh, it's so glaringly obvious why he's missing those short putts',"" Norman revealed. ""So I'll text my son and I'll say 'next time you talk to DJ, just tell him to do this and give him that one piece of information'. If he does it, he does it - I don't know."" McIlroy and Johnson locked horns at the WGC Mexico Championship in March But there is no doubting Norman's admiration for the overall Johnson package. ""I'm really, really impressed with him,"" he said. ""A combination of power, finesse, calmness beyond calm. Nothing seems to faze him. ""He has been consistent for over a decade now, he's won a golf tournament every year for over a decade."" To date, though, none of those have included the Masters where he has been sixth and fourth in the past two years. Johnson's preferred ball flight is a left-to-right fade whereas the popular belief is that players are better shaping it in the opposite direction at Augusta. ""Because he can power the ball, he can play the Masters left to right rather than right to left,"" Norman said. ""Jack Nicklaus used to play left to right and he'd got more Green Jackets than anyone else."" Six-time winner Nicklaus is the ultimate Masters golfer but Jordan Spieth may, one day, prove a rival for that tag. The 2015 champion has played the event three times and has yet to finish outside the top two. Still only 23, he has banked $3.472m (Â£2.79m) from the Masters alone, although you would guess he would have traded most of that for a ""mulligan"" on the 12th tee last year. Dumping two balls into Rae's Creek on the shortest hole on the course led to a quadruple-bogey seven that put paid to what had been a five-stroke advantage on the front nine of his final round. Britain's Danny Willett then seized the moment to claim his first major title. More golf from the BBC: Watch: 'When Danny Won The Masters' on BBC iPlayer Listen: 'McIlroy was right to play round with Trump' 'If you designed the perfect golfer, it would be Dustin Johnson' Masters 2017 on the BBC - coverage details Spieth returned to Augusta last December, played the hole twice and birdied it on each occasion - the second time from tap-in range. But the ghosts will take longer to be exorcised. ""It's not as if it's going to be the last year he gets questions about it,"" McIlroy said. ""I still get questioned about the back nine at Augusta in 2011,"" added McIlroy who came home in 43 in a round of 80 that ruined his four-stroke 54-hole lead. He is a far more experienced figure these days and spearheads a formidable UK contingent that includes 11 Englishmen, Scotland's Russell Knox and veteran former champions Sandy Lyle and Ian Woosnam. Victory brings a return ticket for life.

"Marilyn Shankle-Grant on a recent visit with her son, Paul Storey For the families of men facing the death penalty, money can be a barrier to seeing a loved one before the end. Marilyn Shankle-Grant's son, Paul Storey, has been fighting his death sentence for almost 10 years. All his legal efforts so far have fallen short, and in autumn, a judge set his execution date for 12 April, 2017. Storey was convicted in the 2006 shooting death of 28-year-old Jonas Cherry during an armed robbery. Storey's accomplice - the gunman - pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. Storey went forward with a jury trial and received the death penalty in 2008. Since he was sent to death row, Shankle-Grant has been able to see her son about once a month, making the four-hour drive from her home in Fort Worth, Texas, to the state prison in Livingston, Texas. But recently things have got more difficult for the 57-year-old hospitality worker. The stress and depression over her son's impending execution was affecting her work performance, and she lost a job she had held for 30 years. She tried to pick up temporary work, and even started her own business, Marilyn's Old-Fashioned Tea Cakes, baking flat, buttery rounds from her grandmother's recipe, wrapping them up in cellophane and selling them at local events. But even that small income stream has dried up - she stopped making tea cakes not long after her son's execution date was announced. ""When I do them, I do it with lots of love,"" she explains. ""Right now that's just not in me."" The situation has become dire - her Forth Worth home entered foreclosure this week. She needs $8,000 (about Â£6,400) to save it. The prison in Livingston, Texas, where Paul Storey and other death row inmates are held Her financial difficulty - not to mention her broken car - have made the trips to Livingston a real financial strain, at the same time that the approaching execution date makes them more important than ever. She estimates each trip costs roughly $350. With just six weeks left to visit before her son is executed, Shankle-Grant posted a weary status to her Facebook page, lamenting the short amount of time she has left with her son and the financial struggle she faces just to see him. It caught the eye of Abraham J Bonowitz, co-director of Death Penalty Action, an anti-death penalty charity. He had met Shankle-Grant many times over the years at death penalty abolition events. Bonowitz reached out to Shankle-Grant to ask her permission to set up an online fundraiser on her behalf. He created a page on the crowdfunding site You Caring, which included a note from Shankle-Grant. The death chamber in Huntsville, Texas ""My love and devotion to my son are not matched by the resources needed to make the trip as often as I am allowed to visit him,"" she wrote. ""With a heavy heart I turn to my fellow human light to ask you to help me help my son face the darkness as his destruction approaches."" The donations began streaming in. One anonymous donor contributed $1,000. ""My father was executed in Texas 13 years ago, and while the situation is still painful, I'm thankful for our last few visits, and I know he was as well,"" wrote one contributor. ""Nobody's going to be able to take away the pain that Marilyn has, but we can take away some of the anxiety,"" says Bonowitz, who is considering making these fundraisers a permanent part of his work. So far, he has raised nearly $6,000. The money allows Shankle-Grant to rent a car each weekend, stay for two nights in a nearby hotel, as well as pay for meals and gas. Thanks to the funds, Shankle-Grant has been able to visit her son every weekend since. She says she is incredibly grateful for the help. ""None of this would be able to be happening if it weren't for that You Caring page,"" she says. ""I'm able to talk to him. When he's down and out and depressed, we can talk about it and talk him through it. It gives me comfort, too."" Abraham Bonowitz at an anti-death penalty rally he hosts in front of the US Supreme Court each year Shankle-Grant's situation illustrates the hidden impact on the families of the condemned, who often come from low-income backgrounds and can live far away from the prison in which their loved one is housed. After 30 years of death penalty abolition work, Bonowitz has seen the situation many times before. Often a church or a non-profit will step in to help defray the cost of visiting a family member before an execution. ""None of these families have any money,"" he says. ""Marilyn never did anything wrong and yet she is made to suffer. It's her son's fault, yes, but that doesn't mean the love for her child stops."" The success of the fundraiser caught the attention of advocates in Arkansas, which ispoised to execute eight inmates over the course of 10 days, due to the fact that the state's supply of an execution drug called midazolam is about to expire. Deborah Robinson, a freelance journalist who is writing a book about the eight men, says she has heard from three of them, asking for help so that their families can see them before the execution dates in late April. ""I have a 21-year-old daughter whom I haven't seen in 17 years, along with a 3-year-old granddaughter,"" wrote inmate Kenneth Williams, who is scheduled to die on 27 April, in a message to Robinson. ""The financial costs have prevented her from coming. If I am going to be executed, I would love to see her before I go one last time and to see my grandchild for the first time."" Lynn Scott with her brother Jack Jones, Jr, who has been in prison since 1995 Lynn Scott, the sister of death row inmate Jack Jones, Jr, lives in North Carolina. She runs her own business as a wedding planner, but she and her husband lost nearly everything after the 2008 recession - their house, their 401k, they sold off most of their possessions. After Scott's husband suffered a massive heart attack in 2015, they found themselves financially devastated. ""We live paycheck to paycheck,"" she says. Arkansas is scheduled to execute her brother on 24 April. With airfare, hotel, car rental and meals - plus cremation and burial expenses - she expects that she will need about $5,000. ""It's very difficult,"" says Scott. ""What I want people to know is - whatever the inmates did, we didn't do that. I didn't do that to those people, but I'm still losing someone."" Modelling a crowdfunding page after the one in Texas, Robinson isnow raising funds for all three Arkansas families,externalto help defray some of those costs. Shankle-Grant and Storey on a visit in 2014 If Shankle-Grant's You Caring page raises more money than she can use to see her son, she says she wants the excess funds to go to the families in Arkansas. Her son, Storey, still has a lawyer fighting for a stay of execution, in part based on the fact thathis victim's parents are opposed to the death penalty,externaland do not want him to be executed. Glenn and Judy Cherry have written letters to Texas Governor Greg Abbott and other state officials asking for mercy. Shankle-Grant still holds out hope that her son's execution will be halted, and the portion of the fundraiser money that is designated for her son's burial can be sent to the other families. She is askingsupporters to write letters,externalto the Texas Department of Corrections, asking that Storey's life be spared. In the meantime, because of a court hearing Storey has been moved to a county jail that allows him to use the phone for the first time in years (phone calls are not allowed for death row inmates in his prison). Shankle-Grant says he has been able to talk to his elderly grandparents, who can't travel to see him, and thanks to the fundraiser, she was easily able to pay the hefty $300 phone bill. She is also able to talk to him, sometimes as often as four times a day. It's a small comfort as the execution date creeps closer and closer. ""He'll hang up and call back, hang up and call back,"" she says. ""I don't know after [nine] days if I'm ever going to hear his voice again. For me, it's very important.""

"Trond Bonesmo welcomes Norway's new low-carbon electric ferries It might be slow, but the romance of commuting by ferry is not lost on Trond Bonesmo as he boards MF Norangsfjord for the crossing from Magerholm to Sykkylven. ""It's a welcome break, and the view isn't too bad either,"" he says as he looks across the sea towards the Sunnmoere Alps' snow-covered peaks. ""A bridge across the fjord would obviously make the crossing faster, but Storfjorden is two or three kilometres wide and 700 metres deep, which makes it very expensive to build one,"" says Mr Bonesmo, IT and operations manager for a consumer goods company. Many Norwegian fjords present similar difficulties to bridge builders, so instead the country's coastal population relies on ferries that link their often remote communities. Each year, some 20 million cars, vans and trucks cross the country's many fjords on roughly 130 ferry routes. Most of Norway's ferries run on diesel, spewing out noxious fumes and CO2. But this is about to change. Building bridges across Norway's mountain-flanked fjords would be difficult and costly Following two years of trials of the world's first electric car ferry, named Ampere, ferry operators are busy making the transition from diesel to comply with new government requirements for all new ferry licensees to deliver zero- or low-emission alternatives. ""We continue the work with low-emission ferries because we believe it will benefit the climate, Norwegian industry and Norwegian jobs,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg said in a speech in April 2016, in which she vowed to help fund required quayside infrastructure. Ferry company Fjord1, which operates the MF Norangsfjord, has ordered three fully electric ferries that are scheduled to enter active service on some of its routes in January 2018. Multi Maritime, which designed the ferries, welcomes the growth in demand. ""Several years of investment in sustainable technologies have resulted in us having more than 10 fully electric and plug-in hybrid ferries under construction by several yards,"" says Gjermund Johannessen, managing director. Multi Maritime has designed three electric ferries for Fjord1 In addition to new-builds, the marine division of Siemens, which developed the technology for Ampere, believes 84 ferries are ripe for conversion to electric power. And 43 ferries on longer routes would benefit from conversion to hybrids that use diesel engines to charge their batteries. If this were done, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions would be cut by 8,000 tonnes per year and CO2 emissions by 300,000 tonnes per year, equivalent to the annual emissions from 150,000 cars, according to a report penned jointly by Siemens and the environmental campaign group, Bellona. Click here for more Technology of Business features,external Long-distance ferries are not well suited to electrification, but about 70% of Norway's ferries cover relatively short crossings, so switching to electric power would pay for itself in a few years, according to the report. Each ferry would save about a million litres of diesel per year, helping to reduce energy costs by 60% or more, says Odd Moen, head of sales at Siemens' marine division. ""The electricity to power Ampere, with its 360 passengers and 120 cars, across a six kilometre-wide fjord costs about 50 kroner (Â£4.65; $5.80),"" he says. ""In Norway, that won't even pay for a cup of coffee and a waffle."" Norway's older ferries are also being converted from diesel to electric Ampere's electric powertrain, which was designed by Fjellstrand shipyard using Siemens technology, includes an 800kWh battery pack weighing in at a hefty 11 tonnes, which powers two electric motors, one either side of the vessel. The batteries are fully charged overnight, but as each of the 34 daily 20-minute crossings of the Sognefjorden requires 150kWh, the battery must be topped up during loading and unloading as well. During initial trials, the fast charging placed excessive strain on the local grid, designed as it was to service a relatively small population. To lighten the load, high-capacity batteries were put on constant charge on either side of the fjord, ready to transfer the electricity quickly to the ferry's batteries whilst docked. The charging added an extra burden to the Ampere crew's busy schedules. But this challenge is being dealt with by the latest electric ferry designs, which incorporate fully automatic charging systems. Emissions from diesel-powered ferries have always been a problem. ""When they're docked, their engines are idling - that's when you see those black fumes coming out of their chimneys - and then they're accelerating hard away from land, so their engines are never operating with maximum efficiency,"" explains Mr Moen. Ferry pollution is an issue for most busy city ports; Hong Kong is no exception Mr Moen says he has registered much interest in the technology from overseas, and urges other governments to require and support a switch from diesel to electric ferries where appropriate. Indeed, emissions from ferries is a problem not just in Norway, but in coastal communities and cities all over the world. This is why Scotland has been moving to lower-carbon hybrid ferries - combining diesel and lithium-ion batteries - with three ferries now in operation. In Hong Kong, the Environmental Protection Department has long been waging a war on emissions from ferries that are responsible for much of Victoria Harbour's poor air quality. Similarly, in New Zealand a single ferry visit to Wellington used to pollute the air as much as all Wellington's cars did in a month, according to National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research figures. Back in rural Sykkylven, where the air is relatively fresh, NOx emissions pose less of a problem than in a congested city. But CO2 emissions from ferries should be curbed nevertheless to help combat climate change, Mr Bonesmo says, as he steers his electric car off the ferry. By 2020, an all-electric solution will have replaced the current diesel-electric ferry on the Magerholm-Sykkylven crossing. ""And then my entire commute will be emissions free,"" Mr Bonesmo grins.

"Anna says she would have been in hospital for longer if it wasn't for the system On a hospital ward in Leeds, parents of premature babies are encouraged to help care for their newborns - from taking temperatures to the delicate task of inserting feeding tubes. So how does the approach benefit families? ""It is just nice to feel like a mum, rather than just somebody watching,"" Anna Cox tells theVictoria Derbyshire programme, as she takes the temperature of her baby. Lola was born at just 23 weeks. She had a twin brother who sadly did not survive and she was given little hope of survival. ""During labour, one of the neo-natal consultants came to see us and painted a really bad picture that she could have all sorts of problems,"" Anna says. Lola was cared for at St James's University Hospital in Leeds -the first in the UK to implement a family integrated care system. It put parents - not nurses - in charge of everything other than the most complicated medical treatments for their premature babies while they were in hospital. ""One of the jobs we have to do is take her temperature, maybe every three or four hours,"" Anna says. ""It is a pretty simple procedure really."" However, parents also perform more complicated tasks, including inserting a tube into their baby's nose to allow them to feed. ""There are certain things they [nurses] obviously watch over you quite a bit to begin with because it needs to be done right,"" she says. ""They do like to make sure you know what you're doing, they wouldn't just leave you to it."" This video can not be played Lola was born at just 23 weeks Katie Crossley's daughter, Molly, was born eight weeks early and had breathing difficulties. ""While I'm here, I pretty much do everything that a normal mum would do,"" she says. ""Everything, from feeding to medicine, cleaning, bathing."" She has also been taught how to insert a tube up Molly's nose and into her stomach allowing her to be fed. ""Being around it and watching it has made me more confident when I've come to actually doing it,"" she says. In the past, caring for premature babies usually meant keeping parents at arm's length. As recently as 20 years ago, the closest parents of premature babies could get to their newborns was looking at them through a glass window. It meant the bond between parent and child was harder to establish and breastfeeding rates were often lower. But the idea of putting parents in charge of neonatal care is not a new one. In the 1970s in Tallinn, Estonia - then part of the Soviet Union - the head of the local hospital faced a problem. The hospital had too many premature babies to look after and not enough nurses. However, they soon noticed the system was helping babies. Under his system, mothers had more regular ""skin to skin"" contact with premature babies. It resulted in better breastfeeding rates and shorter hospital stays. It took 30 years for other hospitals to copy the system, but now the system has been introduced in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and now Leeds. Katie Crossley says she is now confident inserting a tube to feed her baby Dr Liz McKechnie, consultant neonatologist at St James's, says the family integrated care scheme aims to put the parent at ""the very centre of the team caring for the baby"". ""It is not rocket science, it is such a straightforward thing to do, to allow parents to look after their babies,"" she says. She is adamant the move was not down to cost-cutting and that nursing levels on the unit have not dropped. ""In the past, care has been very much the nurse leading it, so they're saying 'right, it's feed time, it's bath time'. Whereas now, it is very much the parents who are leading that. ""They are feeding the baby when the baby needs feeding, rather than when the clock says it is feed time - and that's much better for the baby."" She says the new system was a ""major cultural change"" and caused anxiety among nurses on the neonatal unit when it was introduced 18 months ago. Nurses on the ward say training parents to care for their babies takes as long - if not longer - than doing the procedures themselves. But they say families are getting home sooner, the long-term development of babies is improving and breastfeeding rates have increased. The system is about to be trialled in the intensive care unit in St James's sister hospital. Parents are encouraged to take the temperature of their babies As for Lola, she was allowed home just before she was 14 weeks old. ""Without the family integrated care we would've been in a lot longer,"" says her mother, Anna. ""Lola is still on oxygen and [otherwise] they wouldn't have allowed us to come home with that. ""I feel really confident in everything they taught us."" Dr McKechnie adds: ""The fact is that families are going home more confident and more able to care for their babies, and that means a lot. ""Nobody wants to stop it, it is definitely here to stay, everybody can see the benefits of it.""

"Followingthe recent attack in Westminster,the temptation to increase tensions between Christianity and Islam was rejected almost immediately. It began with a vigil outside Westminster Abbey, only two days after Khalid Masood's murderous attack that took the lives of four people, including PC Keith Palmer, and injured more than 35 others. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, the Chief Rabbi and two British imams gathered on Westminster's North Green, embodying interfaith unity in the shadow of a horrifying attack. ""We are each drawn from the historic Abrahamic faiths,"" said Archbishop Justin Welby, ""faiths that teach the primacy of love and compassion over antagonism. We have come together to push for a more peaceful future."" It was an immediate effort to reject the narrative that Khalid Masood was an agent of Islam at war with the Christian West. Women, many of them Muslim, gathered on Westminster Bridge to show solidarity with the victims of the London attack Two days later, a line of almost 100 Muslim women held hands on Westminster Bridge, bowing their covered heads in silence as Big Ben struck 16:00 BST on the first Sunday following the attack. Again, the message they sought to convey was one of unity, as opposed to enmity, between religious traditions. But last Saturday, around 300 people gathered under a different banner.

"Marilyn Shankle-Grant on a recent visit with her son, Paul Storey For the families of men facing the death penalty, money can be a barrier to seeing a loved one before the end. Marilyn Shankle-Grant's son, Paul Storey, has been fighting his death sentence for almost 10 years. All his legal efforts so far have fallen short, and in autumn, a judge set his execution date for 12 April, 2017. Storey was convicted in the 2006 shooting death of 28-year-old Jonas Cherry during an armed robbery. Storey's accomplice - the gunman - pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. Storey went forward with a jury trial and received the death penalty in 2008. Since he was sent to death row, Shankle-Grant has been able to see her son about once a month, making the four-hour drive from her home in Fort Worth, Texas, to the state prison in Livingston, Texas. But recently things have got more difficult for the 57-year-old hospitality worker. The stress and depression over her son's impending execution was affecting her work performance, and she lost a job she had held for 30 years. She tried to pick up temporary work, and even started her own business, Marilyn's Old-Fashioned Tea Cakes, baking flat, buttery rounds from her grandmother's recipe, wrapping them up in cellophane and selling them at local events. But even that small income stream has dried up - she stopped making tea cakes not long after her son's execution date was announced. ""When I do them, I do it with lots of love,"" she explains. ""Right now that's just not in me."" The situation has become dire - her Forth Worth home entered foreclosure this week. She needs $8,000 (about Â£6,400) to save it. The prison in Livingston, Texas, where Paul Storey and other death row inmates are held Her financial difficulty - not to mention her broken car - have made the trips to Livingston a real financial strain, at the same time that the approaching execution date makes them more important than ever. She estimates each trip costs roughly $350. With just six weeks left to visit before her son is executed, Shankle-Grant posted a weary status to her Facebook page, lamenting the short amount of time she has left with her son and the financial struggle she faces just to see him. It caught the eye of Abraham J Bonowitz, co-director of Death Penalty Action, an anti-death penalty charity. He had met Shankle-Grant many times over the years at death penalty abolition events. Bonowitz reached out to Shankle-Grant to ask her permission to set up an online fundraiser on her behalf. He created a page on the crowdfunding site You Caring, which included a note from Shankle-Grant. The death chamber in Huntsville, Texas ""My love and devotion to my son are not matched by the resources needed to make the trip as often as I am allowed to visit him,"" she wrote. ""With a heavy heart I turn to my fellow human light to ask you to help me help my son face the darkness as his destruction approaches."" The donations began streaming in. One anonymous donor contributed $1,000. ""My father was executed in Texas 13 years ago, and while the situation is still painful, I'm thankful for our last few visits, and I know he was as well,"" wrote one contributor. ""Nobody's going to be able to take away the pain that Marilyn has, but we can take away some of the anxiety,"" says Bonowitz, who is considering making these fundraisers a permanent part of his work. So far, he has raised nearly $6,000. The money allows Shankle-Grant to rent a car each weekend, stay for two nights in a nearby hotel, as well as pay for meals and gas. Thanks to the funds, Shankle-Grant has been able to visit her son every weekend since. She says she is incredibly grateful for the help. ""None of this would be able to be happening if it weren't for that You Caring page,"" she says. ""I'm able to talk to him. When he's down and out and depressed, we can talk about it and talk him through it. It gives me comfort, too."" Abraham Bonowitz at an anti-death penalty rally he hosts in front of the US Supreme Court each year Shankle-Grant's situation illustrates the hidden impact on the families of the condemned, who often come from low-income backgrounds and can live far away from the prison in which their loved one is housed. After 30 years of death penalty abolition work, Bonowitz has seen the situation many times before. Often a church or a non-profit will step in to help defray the cost of visiting a family member before an execution. ""None of these families have any money,"" he says. ""Marilyn never did anything wrong and yet she is made to suffer. It's her son's fault, yes, but that doesn't mean the love for her child stops."" The success of the fundraiser caught the attention of advocates in Arkansas, which ispoised to execute eight inmates over the course of 10 days, due to the fact that the state's supply of an execution drug called midazolam is about to expire. Deborah Robinson, a freelance journalist who is writing a book about the eight men, says she has heard from three of them, asking for help so that their families can see them before the execution dates in late April. ""I have a 21-year-old daughter whom I haven't seen in 17 years, along with a 3-year-old granddaughter,"" wrote inmate Kenneth Williams, who is scheduled to die on 27 April, in a message to Robinson. ""The financial costs have prevented her from coming. If I am going to be executed, I would love to see her before I go one last time and to see my grandchild for the first time."" Lynn Scott with her brother Jack Jones, Jr, who has been in prison since 1995 Lynn Scott, the sister of death row inmate Jack Jones, Jr, lives in North Carolina. She runs her own business as a wedding planner, but she and her husband lost nearly everything after the 2008 recession - their house, their 401k, they sold off most of their possessions. After Scott's husband suffered a massive heart attack in 2015, they found themselves financially devastated. ""We live paycheck to paycheck,"" she says. Arkansas is scheduled to execute her brother on 24 April. With airfare, hotel, car rental and meals - plus cremation and burial expenses - she expects that she will need about $5,000. ""It's very difficult,"" says Scott. ""What I want people to know is - whatever the inmates did, we didn't do that. I didn't do that to those people, but I'm still losing someone."" Modelling a crowdfunding page after the one in Texas, Robinson isnow raising funds for all three Arkansas families,externalto help defray some of those costs. Shankle-Grant and Storey on a visit in 2014 If Shankle-Grant's You Caring page raises more money than she can use to see her son, she says she wants the excess funds to go to the families in Arkansas. Her son, Storey, still has a lawyer fighting for a stay of execution, in part based on the fact thathis victim's parents are opposed to the death penalty,externaland do not want him to be executed. Glenn and Judy Cherry have written letters to Texas Governor Greg Abbott and other state officials asking for mercy. Shankle-Grant still holds out hope that her son's execution will be halted, and the portion of the fundraiser money that is designated for her son's burial can be sent to the other families. She is askingsupporters to write letters,externalto the Texas Department of Corrections, asking that Storey's life be spared. In the meantime, because of a court hearing Storey has been moved to a county jail that allows him to use the phone for the first time in years (phone calls are not allowed for death row inmates in his prison). Shankle-Grant says he has been able to talk to his elderly grandparents, who can't travel to see him, and thanks to the fundraiser, she was easily able to pay the hefty $300 phone bill. She is also able to talk to him, sometimes as often as four times a day. It's a small comfort as the execution date creeps closer and closer. ""He'll hang up and call back, hang up and call back,"" she says. ""I don't know after [nine] days if I'm ever going to hear his voice again. For me, it's very important.""

" In Sarah Pinborough’s fantastically unsettling novelBehind Her Eyes, we hear from both Adele and Louise, two women intimately involved with the same man. But can they be believed? As the twisted plot unravels, we realise that all these voices could be lying to us for their own personal gain. The unreliable narrator has been used again and again in fiction to pull the rug from beneath unsuspecting readers and inject some inciting uncertainty into a plot. Here are some of the more notable fictional fibbers, frauds and fantasists… It’s not a mental unbalance that can establish the unreliability of a novel’s voice. In Rebecca, the second Mrs de Winter simply has no idea what is going on around her as the sinister Mrs Danvers and her suspicious new husband drip feed her information about her mysterious predecessor and her untimely death. The reader is continually tripped up alongside her. There should be warning bells immediately sounding when the unnamed protagonist of this macabre tale is at pains to convince the reader that he is definitely not insane. Though this lack of madness is not exactly reinforced by the recent murder he’s just committed for no discernible reason. His mental disturbance, erratic behaviour and insistence on hearing a beating heart beneath his feet make us question his sanity and his credibility. The exploits of Randall McMurphy within an Oregon psychiatric hospital are recounted by Chief Bromden, a schizophrenic who thinks a shadowy conglomerate called ‘The Combine’ is controlling society. He also pretends to be deaf and mute and so is privy to the hospital’s more intriguing secrets, while undergoing the occasional hallucination. Thompson’s hard-boiled, pulpy, often bafflingly surreal stories tend to involve characters so depraved and deranged that you can’t believe a single thing they tell you. In Killer Inside Me, the mild-mannered deputy sheriff, Lou Ford, appears to be a charming good old boy, but he slowly reveals himself to be a vicious, manipulative psychopath without a shred of decency. In attempting to justify his predilection for young girls, Nabokov’s slippery Humbert Humbert cajoles, coerces and confounds the reader in an attempt to garner some sympathy. So effective was this technique that many critics felt the writer himself was attempting to confess his own unnatural desires, an accusation he had to continually refute. How much can we trust Lockwood, who is jotting down the tale of Wuthering Heights in his diary as told to him by a servant, Nelly? As the facts are already once removed and Nelly seems prone to exaggeration and embellishment, is Lockwood also adding his own spin on the story of the Earnshaw and Linton families? There’s almost too much perspective offered. Alex, the ultra-violent ‘Droog' from Burgess’ dystopian classic is an unmitigated narcissist, completely enveloped in his own desires and personality. Every element of the tale is recounted from his particularly damaged point of view, interspersed with drug taking, drunkenness and a liberal smattering of a fairly impenetrable slang, called Nadsat, that only Alex appears to speak. Hard to provide all the details of ‘Jack’s’ unreliability in Palahniuk’s beloved modern fable without dispensing a whole range of spoilers, but once you reach the reveal concerning the identity of Tyler Durden, the reader feels entirely taken in by the storyteller. Not only two enormously unreliable narrators, but also two pretty despicable ones. Suspicion and recrimination swings between Nick and Amy as we watch their marriage disintegrate but then slowly learn that they are both openly lying to the reader as layer upon layer of mistruth is added. Holden Caulfield happily admits to being a liar at the opening of his story and proceeds to wage war against phonies and the tyranny of adulthood. But his increasing distress and instability make the reader start to question his motives and his mental state. If you dare delve into the world of Patrick Bateman, then you can expect a lot of drugs, Fleetwood Mac and hard to stomach brutality. But is all this stuff the idle thoughts of an investment banker with an over active imagination or a deranged serial killer? Or both? Psychological thriller by Sarah Pinborough. Exceptional readings and dramas from Radio 4. Books worth reading. Readings of some of the most fascinating non-fiction out there.",Negative,0.00045697822
