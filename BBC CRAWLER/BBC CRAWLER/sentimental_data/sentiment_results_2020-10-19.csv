"This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said without acting now the NHS would not be able to look after the increasing number of seriously ill people Wales will go into a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown from Friday until 9 November. People will be told to stay at home and pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops must shut. Primary schools will reopen after the half-term break, but only Years 7 and 8 in secondary schools can return at that time under new ""firebreak"" rules. Gatherings indoors and outdoors with people not in your household will also be banned. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the ""time-limited firebreak"" would be ""a short, sharp, shock to turn back the clock, slow down the virus and buy us more time"". Without action the NHS would not be able to cope, Mr Drakeford told a press conference. But a UK government schemethat will cover 67% of the wages of workers at firms forced to close, due to start on 1 November, will not be brought forward to cover the Welsh lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that was because of ""limitations in HMRC delivery timescales"", in a letter to the first minister. Some employees may be able to be re-furloughed, however. Under the lockdown leisure businesses, community centres, libraries and recycling centres will shut. Places of worship will be closed for normal services, except for funerals and weddings. The announcement follows rising case numbers in Wales and increasing hospital admissions and replaces the 17 local lockdowns that had been in place. Figures now stand at 128.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over seven days - there were 4,043 cases recorded between 10 and 16 October. Also of concern is the proportion of positive tests - just under 12% in Wales and nearly 19% in Cardiff, which also has the highest case rate over the past week, 226.6 cases per 100,000. What difference could a circuit-breaker make? Q&A: What can you do in Wales-wide lockdown? Welsh pro sport to continue in 'firebreak' Halloween and Bonfire Night gatherings will not be allowed under the restrictions which begin at 18:00 BST on Friday, the start of the half-term holiday. But there will be an exception for small Remembrance Sunday commemoration services on 8 November. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 Non-essential cross border travel in and out of Wales ""will have to end"" during the firebreak period, Mr Drakeford said. Universities in Wales will continue to provide ""a blend of in-person and online learning"". If students have reading weeks or half-term they will also need to stay at home in their university accommodation, the first minister said. The Welsh Government has provided a package of almost Â£300m to support businesses. Non-essential retail will be told to close for 17 days from Friday The rules will be similar to the lockdown in March: People will have to stay at home except for very limited reasons, such as exercise People must work from home where they can People must not visit other households or meet other people they do not live with either indoors and outdoors All non-food retail will shut, and cafes, restaurants and pubs will close unless they provide delivery or takeaways Hotels, hairdressers and beauticians will have to shut People breaching the rules could be fined, with fixed penalty notices starting at Â£60. Adults living alone or single parents will be able to join with one other household from anywhere in Wales for support. Existing rules on face masks - requiring them to be worn in public places indoors - will stay in place. The previous lockdown continued for months past its initial three weeks, but Mr Drakeford said the firebreak would end on 9 November. ""I've heard some people say, 'oh, the figures won't be down by the 9 of November, so the period will have to continue' - that is not the test to set,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said a national lockdown was needed ""partly because the gap between those parts of Wales where we have not needed local lockdowns, and local lockdown areas have been narrowing"". ""We all want to see an end to this pandemic and our lives returned to us. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a vaccine, which will allow us to do that. ""So this is our best chance of regaining control of the virus and avoiding a much-longer - and damaging - national lockdown."" The two weeks will be used ""very purposefully"", the first minister said, allowing for more staff to be recruited for contact tracing and allow others to ""catch up on the huge volume of contacts that have to be contacted and traced"" from recent weeks. He told BBC Wales the speed of the upsurge in cases had ""come earlier than the models suggested"". Local restrictions had worked, he said, but added: ""We have to go beyond them, not because they have failed, but because they haven't been able to succeed enough. TheTechnical Advisory Cell,external, which gives advice to the Welsh Government, recommended a two or three week ""hard firebreak"" to bring thereproduction numberbelow 1. The R number is the rate at which the virus is increasing - it currently stands between 1.1 and 1.4. Without a massive reduction in transmission, the scientific advisory body concludes the impact on the hospitals and intensive care units would be ""too high for the NHS to sustain"". Pubs and restaurants will have to shut, unless they offer takeaways A new Â£300m fund for firms affected will open next week. The Welsh Government said every firm covered by small business rates relief would receive a Â£1,000 payment. Small and medium-sized retail, leisure and hospitality firms that have to close will get a one-off payment of up to Â£5,000. There will be additional discretionary grants and support for smaller firms that are struggling, the government said. It added that firms would be able to access the support available under the new UK government Job Support Scheme,which will cover 67% of workers pay at businesses forced to shut, but that does not begin until 1 November. Mr Sunak, in a letter to Mr Drakeford, said he would be unable to bring the claims date forward for the JSS to 23 October. He said the previous Job Retention Scheme was in place until 31 October and employees previously furloughed for three weeks can be re-furloughed. Conservative Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said people would lose their jobs ""as a result of the first minister's decision"" and claimed there had been a discussion with the Treasury ""a while ago"". He added: ""Asking the Treasury to suddenly bring forward the scheme, the first minister knows full well that wasn't possible - because he was told by the chancellor several days ago. ""That strikes me as being very, very unfair on the people who will be caught by the time gap between the Welsh Government scheme and the Treasury scheme kicking in."" The Welsh Government said ministers had offered to pay the extra costs associated with early access to the Jobs Support Scheme. A spokesman said it meant firms would ""now have to access both the Job Retention Scheme and the Job Support Scheme at different points during the fire-break period"". ""It is absolutely crucial the UK government ensures this process is as smooth as possible and that all affected Welsh businesses and employees benefit from these schemes during this difficult time."" The union Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru said the Welsh Government's decision that primary school children and secondary school children in Years 7and 8 should return after half-term was ""a sensible balance in these circumstances"". A retail lobbyist said she was not aware of ""any evidence"" that justified the closure of non-essential shops. ""Retailers are now gearing up for the vital festive trading period when a fifth of goods are bought. If shops can't trade in the run-up to Christmas that will be a catastrophe,"" said Sara Jones of the Welsh Retail Consortium. This video can not be played What do businesses think of the lockdown in Wales? Janine Brown, who owns of Crundles gift shop in Swansea, said: ""I'm obviously disappointedâ¦ I've just ordered all my Christmas stock in and I've got to pay for it this week and we're going to be shut down for another two weeks. ""We're all fed up of it, we're all really upset about it. What do we do as small businesses?"" The British Beer and Pub Association said the firebreak would ""destroy many pubs, brewers and their supply chains in the country unless the financial support package is available to all businesses hit by the forced closure of all pubs"". ""The financial support package announced today leaves many businesses impacted by this forced closure with no additional help,"" said chief executive Emma McClarkin. In August, the Welsh Government launched its 'Coronavirus Control Plan for Wales' outlining a strategy to ""avoid returning to a national lockdown"". So, two months later, as we prepare for another lockdown, has that plan and those lines of defence failed? The first minister talked in his press conference about using the two week firebreak ""very purposefully"" to strengthen the contact tracing system and accelerating the establishment of field hospitals. He also said they will be looking at the system of fines. Could we see people receiving fixed penalty notices for not self-isolating? There was no direct answer today. The speed at which tests are being processed is still a major issue. But most of Wales' tests and most of the problems are in the UK government's lighthouse labs so out of their control. But Mr Drakeford said it is ""quite likely"" that one crucial aspect is unlikely to have improved by the end of the firebreak period - the number of Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations. Regardless, he ruled out an extension beyond 9 November but at the same time he did not rule out another firebreak lockdown in a few months' time. TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? THREE TIERS:How will the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said a firebreak was a ""last resort"" and should only be used in an emergency. ""We are now in an emergency,"" he said. ""The time the firebreak buys us must be used to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system in Wales, which means we can prevent being in the position we're currently in."" Paul Davies, Welsh Conservative leader, accused the first minister of ""failing to be open and transparent about the evidence"". He added: ""The main concern is that this national lockdown is not proportionate. ""The impact on businesses in areas such as Powys, Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, who have the lowest rate of Covid-19 cases in Wales, will be severe at a time when they are desperately struggling to recover from the pandemic so far this year.""

"Greater Manchester is currently in tier two, or ""high alert"" level Greater Manchester leaders have been given a deadline of midday to reach a deal with the government over moving to tier three Covid restrictions. If a deal is not reached, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the PM would decide on the next steps. In this situation, the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the ""implication"" was the top tier of rules would be imposed. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the region was seeking a ""fair figure"" of support from the government. Mr Burnham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would be meeting with local leaders this morning and would advise them to set out the request in a letter to the government. The government and local leaders - including mayors and MPs - have been embroiled in 10 days of talks over moving Greater Manchester's 2.8m population from tier two to the highest restrictions. Greater Manchester has been under local restrictions since July. The ""very high"" alert level - also known as tier three - would mean closing pubs and bars which do not serve meals, and additional restrictions on households mixing. Mr Jenrick said local leaders had been ""so far unwilling to take the action that is required to get this situation under control"". It come as the number of weekly registered coronavirus deaths in England and Wales rose by 438 and increased by a third in the space of seven days, according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle What is a circuit-breaker? Who is Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham? Speaking to Today, Mr Burnham described the government's ""late-night ultimatum briefed to the media"" as a ""slightly provocative move"", but he said he was going to ""try and find a way forward"". He said local leaders had never been given a figure for additional financial support in return for further restrictions. As well as setting out what a ""fair figure"" of support was, Mr Burnham said he wanted ""full flexibility"" to support people who will be affected by restrictions. He said: ""I think it is fair to recognise that if you put a place under restrictions for as long as we've been under restrictions it grinds people down. It pushes businesses closer to the brink."" Mr Burnham has previously called for the government to reintroduce the 80% furlough scheme used during the UK's first lockdown, instead ofthe new Job Support Schemewhich covers 67% of the wages (covered by employers and the government) of people affected by tier three closures. Business minister Nadhim Zahawi told Today Â£22m had been offered to Greater Manchester - equivalent to Â£8 per person - and there would be ""additional support commensurate with what we have done in Liverpool City Region and in Lancashire"". Mr Burnham said he would not ""break the law"" if no agreement was reached between both sides and the government imposed tier three measures on Greater Manchester. ""It's their prerogative to do what they think is needed,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""But I would say to them that I don't think it will help us bring people with what they want to do to control this virus. I think it would be better to come to an agreement."" Mr Burnham also said he thought the shielding of elderly and vulnerable people in Greater Manchester needed to be ""looked at seriously"" and suggested it was ""part of the solution"". Sir Richard Leese, the Labour leader of Manchester City Council, told BBC Newsnight he hoped a deal could still be made, but added: ""If government imposes tier three - and I hope that won't happen - we will clearly need to comply with that."" On Monday, Mr Burnham and Sir Richardaccused the government,externalof using ""selective statistics"" on hospital occupancy rates to bolster the case for tougher rules. On Monday evening, the two sides couldn't even agree on what they actually discussed earlier. Believe the local leaders and on Monday morning there seemed to be hope in the air. Officials from central government had mooted the possibility of a hardship fund to help support low-paid workers who stand to lose out if businesses close their doors under tighter restrictions. The message local leaders took from their meeting was that, while the Treasury is adamant they are not going to extend their national furlough scheme - nor increase the level of cash available from its replacement, the Job Support Scheme - Westminster might sign off extra money that could be spent that way, if local politicians saw fit. There was no concrete agreement on the numbers, but sources in Greater Manchester suggest the cost of supporting those who need the extra help comes in at around Â£15m a month. After that call, the consensus among North West leaders was moving in the direction of signing on the dotted line, with another call planned with Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick for the afternoon. But rather than ushering in a new spirit of co-operation, that meeting went south. Read more from Laura. A three-tier system of alerts was announced a week ago in an attempt to control rising coronavirus cases without a UK-wide lockdown. So far, only theLiverpool City RegionandLancashirehave been moved into tier three. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons on Monday that discussions are planned for South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside also moving into the top tier. Speaking ahead of those discussions with government, Nottingham City Council leader David Mellen said he would make clear ""that we want a package that properly protects local people, businesses, jobs and education, whether it's for tier two or tier three"". Elsewhere in the UK, in Wales people will be told from Friday to stay at home, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. Atwo-week school closure has begun in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions. In Scotland, the tightest restrictions are in place in the central belt, and there are plans for athree-tier framework of measures, similar to England's. On Monday,government figures,externalshowed the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths.

"This video can not be played Marwa and Safa's mother is optimistic about their future as they return to Pakistan Twin girls who were born joined at the head, and separated last year by a team at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, have returned home to Pakistan. Safa and Marwa Bibi underwent three major operations, spending more than 50 hours in theatre. Their mother, Zainab Bibi, told the BBC she was delighted to be taking them back to the rest of their family. ""The girls are doing very well. Marwa has made good progress and only needs a little support,"" she said. ""We will keep an eye on Safa and take good care of her. God willing, both will start walking."" Conjoined twins are rare, and of these only one set in 20 are born joined at the head, with a fused skull - what's known as craniopagus twins. The vast majority do not survive beyond childhood. A team of 100 people at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) was involved in their care. This video can not be played How doctors separated twins joined at the head The twins were separated in February 2019, and since then have been living with their mother and uncle in London. All their medical and other costs - more than Â£1 million - were paid for by a private donor, Pakistani businessman Murtaza Lakhani. The battle to separate Safa and Marwa The girls, now aged three and a half, have had regular physical therapy, to try to help them with their mobility. Both have learning difficulties. Their mother regards the surgical team as heroes and says her seven other children back in Pakistan are eager to help care for Safa and Marwa. The lead surgeon Owase Jeelani said he and the team were ""very pleased"" for the family. Safa and Marwa have returned with their mother to live with the rest of the family in Pakistan But he told the BBC he still had some misgivings about the outcome. ""I feel Marwa has done really well and carries on making great progress. When I look at the whole family, yes, it was probably the right thing to do, but for Safa as an individual I'm not so sure."" Mr Jeelani, a hugely experienced neurosurgeon, is still troubled by the near-impossible choice he and his team had to make in theatre. The twins had a labyrinth of shared blood vessels which nourished both their brains. Only one twin could receive some of the key blood vessels. These were given to Marwa, who was the weaker twin. But as a result, Safa had a stroke. She now has permanent damage to her brain and may never walk. Mr Jeelani said he would probably always be troubled by this: ""It's a decision that I made as a surgeon. It's one that we made as a team. It's a decision we have to live with."" He believes the outcome for Safa and Marwa would probably have been better had they been separated earlier. It took several months to raise the funds needed to pay for the surgical and other costs. This prompted Mr Jeelani and fellow surgeon Prof David Dunaway to set up a charityGemini Untwined,external, to try to raise awareness and funds to cover the costs of separating craniopagus twins. In January 2020, the same surgical team at GOSH successfully separated twin boys from Turkey who were joined at the head.

"Belgium currently has the third highest incidence of coronavirus per 100,000 people in the world Belgium could soon be overwhelmed by new coronavirus infections, the health minister has warned, amid soaring case numbers across the country. Frank Vandenbroucke said new cases were close to a ""tsunami"" where authorities ""no longer control what is happening"". New measures to try to halt the spread came into force on Monday. All bars and restaurants are closed for four weeks. Infection numbers are climbing throughout Europe, prompting new restrictions across the continent. Italy announced a raft of measures on Sundayafter recording its highest daily infection rate, while nine major French cities have been placed under curfew. The Czech Republic - which has the highest infection rate on the continent - is considering a full national lockdown. And the Republic of Ireland is to move intothe highest level of coronavirus restrictionsfrom midnight on Wednesday for six weeks. Belgium was one of the worst-hit countries during Europe's first wave of coronavirus earlier this year. Overall it has the third-highest number of Covid-related deaths per 100,000 people globally, behind only Peru and San Marino, according to Johns Hopkins University data. From Monday, under new government restrictions designed to tackle the fresh outbreak, residents will only be allowed to see one other person from outside their household and should work from home if possible. A curfew is in place from midnight until 05:00 for the next month and alcohol sales are banned from 20:00. How new lockdowns are changing life across Europe Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? Mr Vandenbroucke described the situation in the capital Brussels and in the south of the country as ""the most dangerous in all of Europe"". The government ""has only one message to the public: protect yourself, protect your loved ones, so as not to be contaminated"", he told broadcaster RTL. Frank Vandenbroucke warned the country could be overwhelmed According tothe Belgian health institute Sciensano,external, Belgium has recorded an average of 7,876 new daily infections over the last seven days, a 79% rise on the previous week. Last Tuesday the country reported 12,051 cases in 24 hours, its highest daily figure since the pandemic began. Hospitalisations have also risen, with 2,485 people in hospital with Covid-19 on Monday. Officials warn that if cases continue to rise at the same rate, Belgium will fill its capacity of 2,000 intensive care beds by mid-November. ""The situation is serious,"" Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told RTL. ""It is worse than on March 18 when the lockdown was decided."" Poland- which was praised for successfully controlling the virus in March and April - saw new infections rise to nearly 10,000 a day last week. On Monday the government announced it was opening a field hospital at the national stadium in Warsaw and said the armed forces would be deployed to man drive-through testing facilities. Europe experiencing 'Covid fatigue' Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said that other major cities were also working to set up new hospitals. The country was preparing ""for the worst-case scenarios - such as 15,000 or even 20,000 new infections"" each day, he said. Government officials have urged people to stay at home, ordered restaurants to reduce opening hours and told universities and secondary schools to teach online. The head of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, went into self-isolation on Monday after coming into contact with an infected person. This video can not be played Some people, including scientists, believe the hard anti-pandemic measures can be confusing TheCzech Republicis also battling soaring case numbers. On Friday the country reported a record 11,100 new cases in the past 24 hours, andthe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,externalsays the country has the highest 14-day cumulative number of Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people across the continent. More people have reportedly died with the virus since the start of October than throughout the past eight months combined. This week restaurants and bars have been ordered to shut except for takeaway, schools have switched to remote learning and theatres, sports clubs and cinemas have been closed. Jubilant Czechs hold 'farewell coronavirus' party Deputy Prime Minister Karel Havlicek said on Sunday the government would wait until restrictions show an impact before considering a full lockdown. ""We have clearly said we will wait [until November] for results,"" he said. In Prague about 2,000 football fans - including militant supporters known as ultras - clashed with police on Sunday during demonstrations against the restrictions.

But as a result, Safa had a stroke. She now has permanent damage to her brain and may never walk. Mr Jeelani said he would probably always be troubled by this: ""It's a decision that I made as a surgeon. It's one that we made as a team. It's a decision we have to live with."" He believes the outcome for Safa and Marwa would probably have been better had they been separated earlier. It took several months to raise the funds needed to pay for the surgical and other costs. This prompted Mr Jeelani and fellow surgeon Prof David Dunaway to set up a charityGemini Untwined,external, to try to raise awareness and funds to cover the costs of separating craniopagus twins. In January 2020, the same surgical team at GOSH successfully separated twin boys from Turkey who were joined at the head. This video can not be played Ritaj and Rital were born joined at the head, and were successfully separated Yigit and Derman Evrensel also underwent three operations, but the process was much faster than with Safa and Marwa. The twins returned home to Turkey before their second birthday, and the surgeons believe they will make rapid progress. Follow@BBCFergusWalsh,externalon Twitter Separated twins return home.

"A hacking group is donating stolen money to charity in what is seen as a mysterious first for cyber-crime that's puzzling experts. Darkside hackers claim to have extorted millions of dollars from companies, but say they now want to ""make the world a better place"". In a post on the dark web, the gang posted receipts for $10,000 in Bitcoin donations to two charities. One of them, Children International, says it will not be keeping the money. The move is being seen as a strange and troubling development, both morally and legally. The hackers posted their tax receipt for the $10,000 donation In the blog post on 13 October, the hackers claim they only target large profitable companies with their ransomware attacks. The attacks hold organisations' IT systems hostage until a ransom is paid. They wrote: ""We think that it's fair that some of the money the companies have paid will go to charity. ""No matter how bad you think our work is, we are pleased to know that we helped changed someone's life. Today we sended (sic) the first donations."" The cyber-criminals posted the donation along with tax receipts they received in exchange for the 0.88 Bitcoin they had sent to two charities, The Water Project and Children International. Children International supports children, families and communities in India, the Philippines, Colombia, Ecuador, Zambia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and the United States. A Children International spokesperson told the BBC: ""If the donation is linked to a hacker, we have no intention of keeping it"". The Water Project, which works to improve access to clean water in sub-Saharan Africa, has not responded to requests for comment. Another receipt was posted on the dark web blog showing a $10,000 donation Brett Callow, Threat Analyst at cyber-security company Emsisoft, said: ""What the criminals hope to achieve by making these donations is not at all clear. Perhaps it helps assuage their guilt? Or perhaps for egotistical reasons they want to be perceived as Robin Hood-like characters rather than conscienceless extortionists. ""Whatever their motivations, it's certainly a very unusual step and is, as far as I know, the first time a ransomware group has donated a portion of their profits to charity."" The Darkside hacker group is relatively new on the scene, but analysis of the crypto-currency market confirms they are actively extorting funds from victims. There is also evidence they may have links to other cyber-criminal groups responsible for high-profile attacks on companies including Travelex, which was crippled by ransomware in January. The way the hackers paid the charities is also a possible cause for concern for law enforcement. The cyber-criminals used a US-based service called The Giving Block, which is used by 67 different non-profits from around the world including Save The Children, Rainforest Foundation and She's The First. The now-deleted tweet celebrating the donation from the hackers The Giving Block describes itself online as ""the only non-profit specific solution for accepting crypto-currency donations"". The company was set up in 2018 to offer cryptocurrency 'millionaires' the ability to take advantage of the ""huge tax incentive to donate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly to non-profits"". The Giving Block told the BBC it was not aware these donations were made by cyber-criminals. It said: ""We are still working to determine if these funds were actually stolen. ""If it turns out these donations were made using stolen funds, we will of course begin the work of returning them to the rightful owner."" The company did not clarify if this means returning the stolen money to the criminals, or attempting to work out which of the criminal victims it intended to reimburse and how. The Giving Block, which is also an advocate for crypto-currencies, added: ""The fact they used crypto will make it easier, not harder, to catch them."" However, The Giving Block has not given details on what information they collect on their donors. Most services that buy and sell digital coins like Bitcoin require users to verify their identity, but it's not clear whether this has been done here. 67 charities use The Giving Block to accept crypto-currency As an experiment, the BBC attempted to donate anonymously through The Giving Block's online system, and was not asked any identity verification questions. Experts say the case highlights the complexity and dangers of anonymous donations. Crypto-currency investigator Philip Gradwell from Chainalysis said: ""If you walked into a charity shop with an anonymous mask on and donated Â£10,000 in cash, then asked for a taxable receipt, questions should probably be asked - and it's no different. ""It's right to say that researchers and law enforcement have become adept at tracing crypto-currency funds as they are moved around from wallet to wallet. But finding who actually owns each wallet is far more complicated. ""By allowing anonymous donations from potentially illicit sources, it opens up the danger of money laundering. ""All crypto-currency businesses need a full range of Anti-Money Laundering measures including a Know Your Customer (KYC) program of basic background checks, so that they can understand who is behind the transactions their business facilitates."" The BBC has spoken with other charities which accept donations via The Giving Project. Save the Children told the BBC it would ""never knowingly take money obtained through crime"". She's the First, a charity for girls' education around the world, said it would not be comfortable accepting money from anonymous, possibly criminal, sources and said: ""It's a shame that bad actors would exploit the opportunity to donate crypto-currency for personal gain, and we hope that even anonymous donors share our community's values.""

"Geek Retreat recently opened new stores in Northwich and Chelmsford From online fashion to grocery, only a handful of sectors have bucked the coronavirus downturn, and now it seems comics and gaming have joined the list. Geek Retreat - which specialises in ""all things geeky"" including comics, memorabilia and table top games - says it will open another 100 stores over the next two years, at a time when the UK High Street is under pressure. The Scottish firm currently has 14 UK sites, which combine retail space with cafes and areas to play games and hold events. It said its Covid-safe plan would create around 600 new jobs. ""During the pandemic, while our gaming events have had to stop and the hospitality side of our business is more difficult, our stores still have loyal communities who support our retail side,"" Geek Retreat boss Peter Dobson told the BBC. ""We have made sure all of our stores are welcoming and accessible to gamers whatever their interests, providing a place for our loyal customers to get out of the house and play safely post-lockdown."" Geek Retreat boss Peter Dobson says the games and hobby sector is expanding Countless High Street businesses had to close temporarily during lockdown, and many remain under pressure as shoppers minimise social contact. However, Mr Dobson said Geek Retreat was benefitting from the growth of the wider games and hobby sector which isvalued at Â£8bn a year in the UK,externaland predicted to expand by 3% in 2020. Earlier this year, miniature wargames manufacturer Games Workshop - which is best known for its Warhammer products -announced record sales and profits, and its shares were promoted to London's FTSE 250 index. Have you got a Pokemon card worth a fortune? What it's like playing FIFA online as a pro footballer Geek Retreat - founded in Glasgow in 2017 - stocks merchandise such as comics, posters, clothing, figures and memorabilia as well as games and trading cards. It also specialises in various cult brands such as Dungeons & Dragons, Star Wars and Harry Potter, while selling graphic novels and gaming accessories such as dice. The retailer said it expected to open sites in Bournemouth, Northampton and Liverpool in coming months, followed by Southampton, Dumfries, Cardiff and Sutton in London. The chain, which operates as a franchise, aims to open five stores per month from the beginning of 2021, but points out that with the Covid-19 virus those plans are subject to change. Mr Dobson said all his outlets were Covid secure, with only limited numbers allowed in at one time. Customers also have to book events in advance, submit their details for track and trace and follow social distancing rules.

"Passengers flying from Heathrow to Hong Kong on Tuesday will be the first to have the option of paying for a rapid Covid test before checking in. The test will cost Â£80 and the result is guaranteed within an hour. The aim is to help people travelling to destinations where proof of a negative result is required on arrival. Collinson, the company behind the initiative had hoped the test could be used to enter Italy, but talks with the Italian government are continuing. A growing number of countries have classified the UK as being ""at risk"", meaning travellers from the UK face more restrictions. The authorities in Hong Kong now require people to show they have a negative test result, taken within 72 hours of a flight from London. The rapid saliva swab, which is now available at Heathrow Terminals 2 and 5, is known as a Lamp (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification) test. Which countries can I visit without quarantining? Airlines and airports in fresh aid package plea British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and Cathay Pacific will now offer it to customers. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of the aviation trade body Airlines UK, said he would like the cost of the test to be lower. ""For business passengers Â£80 is probably quite competitive but we've certainly said to the government in terms of introducing a test on arrival in the UK anything from Â£50-Â£60 would be better,"" he said. A Lamp test is quicker than the PCR test, which is widely used in the NHS, because the sample does not need to be sent to a laboratory. Collinson, the company behind the initiative at Heathrow, admitted that the Lamp test is ""slightly less sensitive"" than the PCR test. However, the Lamp test is considered to be much better than another rapid option - the antigen test. Collinson's chief executive David Evans told the BBC that ""health screening"" was quickly becoming another stage of the airport experience. He said passengers would only have to turn up at the airport an hour earlier. And he maintained testing would help give people confidence to travel, because flights would be ""Covid-secure"". ""It starts to make travel easier again,"" he said. Collinson, which partners with Swissport, hopes testing will help open up routes between the UK and other countries. People arriving in Italy from the UK must now either prove they had a negative coronavirus test before departure, or take a test on arrival at an airport in Italy. However, the type of test offered at Heathrow is not sufficient for people travelling to some destinations, such as Cyprus, the Bahamas and Bermuda. All those places currently require proof of a negative PCR test, which requires analysis in a laboratory. The hope is that more countries will change their rules and allow for other types of test, which could be administered on the spot at Heathrow. It is important to note that the new testing facility at Heathrow is not for passengers flying into the airport. That means it will not have any immediate impact on the UK's two-week travel quarantine for people arriving from ""at risk"" countries. Collinson set up a separate testing facility in arrivals at Heathrow over the summer. However, that facility has not been used by passengers, because the government has not given its backing to testing people on arrival. Ministers have promised that next month, they will give their formal approval to the idea of people paying for a test after a week of quarantine, to avoid the full two weeks. On Monday, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the government was in talks with the US Department of Homeland Security about a different type of system, possibly involving ""multiple tests"". The government is looking at another system, under which people could take one test two or three days before they fly into the UK, and then another test when they arrive. That could make it possible for someone arriving in the UK from an ""at risk"" country to avoid quarantine altogether. However, Mr Shapps said he could not say when that type of system would be up and running, because it required international co-operation. How are travel rules being relaxed?

"On a call with campaign staff, President Trump dismissed Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, as a ""disaster"" Early voting for the US election kicked off in the battleground state of Florida Donald Trump hit the campaign trail hard at the weekend, and is now in Arizona Joe Biden - who has a significant lead in most national polls - is prepping for the last presidential debate on Thursday A record 29m nationwide ballots have been cast ahead of election day on 3 November, as the US remains gripped by Covid-19 Today - in between the news and views - we focused on Explaining the Election Edited by Boer Deng Most polls have closed on a busy first day of early voting in Florida, and our live page will do the same. With just two weeks left until the 3 November 2020 US presidential election, candidates are scrambling to deliver their final pitches to voters - and are making plenty of news on the campaign trail as they do. Here are some of the key events from Monday:  We'll be back tomorrow with the latest campaign news and analysis. Monday's live page was brought to you by Matthew Davis, Boer Deng, Sophie Williams, Max Matza, Ritu Prasad and Holly Honderich. Their man may be behind in the national polls, but Republicans see hope in rising voter registrations in three key states that could yet yield the re-election of President Trump come November. Though registered Democrats still outnumber registered Republicans in Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, data has shown that the gap has narrowed since 2016. The Democratic advantage in Florida and Pennsylvania has shrunk by about 200,000 voters and in North Carolina by more than 230,000 voters. US presidential elections are not won by overall popularity but by having the right number of votes in the right places. Trump won all three states in 2016 in part because voters turned out for him and not for his rival. If registration is a measure of enthusiasm, Republicans may yet have reason to believe voters will turn out for Trump again. For this history-making election, Americans are going to the polls in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic's impact on the economy has hit young people disproportionately hard - a strain that is expected to leave a mark on their politics, possibly widening the gap with older, more conservative Americans. Research has found that people hit by economic downturns during their formative years are more likely to favour redistributive policies and attribute success to luck rather than hard work - and that will influence how they vote. Read the stories of the young Americans struggling in the 2020 economy. Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington DC Democratic candidate Joe Biden seems to have cornered at least one constituency - celebrities. Taylor Swift, Madonna, Cardi B, Tom Hanks and George Clooney have all thrown their support behind the Democratic ticket. In an editorial for V magazine, Taylor Swift urged fans to vote for Mr Biden and Ms Harris, and promptly shared the endorsement with her 140 million Instagram followers. And Dwayne Johnson - a self-described independent and now the most-followed American man on Instagram - made his first-ever endorsement, saying in a video that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are ""the best choice to lead our country"". This summer's Democratic National Convention, too, featured a parade of Oscar winners, musicians and professional athletes - an apparent contrast to the Republican convention the following week. There, the president himself was the biggest celebrity in attendance. But does all this matter?Read the full story here. While on the campaign trail this morning, Trump spoke to reporters about his recent brush with Covid-19, which landed the president in hospital for several days at the beginning of the month. Asked whether he would authorise his doctors to release information on when his most recent negative test was, he had this to say: This video can not be played Donald Trump: 'I'm immune, they say' Postal votes! Swing states! The Electoral College! There sure is alot of jargon associated with US elections - and details of how things work that even many American voters are unclear about. If you need a refresher,here's our really simple guide. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris turned up at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville this afternoon to kick off early voting in the state, which began today. ""The voters of Florida, you guys are going to determine the outcome of this election,"" the California senator said. ""You [all] are going to have an impact on people you'll never meet"" Harris brought out familiar lines of attack against President Trump - saying he failed to act even when he knew of the severity of the coronavirus outbreak - and touted her running mate, who is preparing for Thursday night's debate, leaving the campaigning up to her. ""This is the difference between a Donald Trump and Joe Biden,"" she said. ""We know that the strength of our democracy is the strength within our people."" Harris has returned to the campaign trail following a brief pause after two aides tested positive for coronavirus last week.  Ritu PrasadBBC News writer The US Supreme Court is in the spotlight for voters this year for many reasons. One of the top issues is healthcare. On 10 November, the court will consider a case on a popular Obama-era public healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. Out of the 23 million Americans who are currently insured by the ACA or Medicaid, another public health option, 21 million could lose their insurance if the law is overturned. Down the road, more could drop their plans if a lack of federal subsidies sends insurance prices sky-high. As one young voter told me: ""They can debate and turn this into a political issue all they want, but it's not political when you see your mom in a hospital bed."" And the backdrop to all this - a global pandemic that's affected more than 7.5 million Americans. Read the stories of four US patients whose lives could change if the ACA is overturned here.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing some gaming to get out the vote. The lawmaker has asked her Twitter followers if they wanted to join her for an online session of Among Us - a murder mystery style game - on Twitch, the video games-streaming platform. The digital invite from 'AOC', a 31-year-old millennial, is among a growing number of attempts to reach young voters on social platforms. Instagram has been flooded in recent days with celebrities posting their ""I Voted"" selfies, and stars of TikTok - which launched an in-app voting guide - are also making their political inclinations known. It remains to be seen whether these new get out the vote strategies will work. Young people have a historically bad track record for turning out on election day. If Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree on anything, it's that this year's election is an important one. It's also happening under unprecedented circumstances. Americans will cast their ballots as the country struggles against the coronavirus outbreak. As a result, more Americans are voting by post than ever before. An estimated80 million ballotswill be cast by mail this year as states aim to prevent gatherings to limit the spread of coronavirus. That means delays. Postal ballots need extra time to be delivered, and they also take longer to count once they have arrived. So though we'll see votes returned on election day - 3 November - don't expect final results until days after. Read more about what a delayed result could look like. With the coronavirus pandemic, the political theatre looks a little different this year. At rallies for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, supporters maintain a social distance, and drive through in their cars. And at Trump events, where masks are less common, supporters undergo temperature checks before entry. A government watchdog will investigate alleged ""political interference"" from the White House at the Centers for Disease Control and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at the behest of several Democratic lawmakers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) said on Monday it would look into whether the administration ""violated the agencies' scientific integrity and communication policies"". The inquiry was requested by Senators Elizabeth Warren, Patty Murray and Gary Peters. There have been reports of administration officials trying to pressure the agencies into changing guidance to match the president's assessment that the US has beaten Covid-19. Trump has often dismissed health officials (most recently Dr Fauci) and their recommendations as overly cautious. He insisted that the FDA authorisethe drug hydroxychloroquineto treat Covid-19, despite divided evidence on efficacy. The GAO is an independent agency that takes on such inquiries for Congress. More than 245 million Americans are eligible to vote this year, But only a small percentage of them will actually determine who the next president is. So who are they and where do they live? This video can not be played Who really decides the US election? After criticising the country's top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci this morning, President Trump doubled down on the denunciation at a campaign rally this afternoon in Arizona. The president then turned to his rival, Joe Biden, saying that the Democrat ""wants to listen to Dr Fauci"". Fauci has served as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, and has become one of the most visible figures in the governmentâs coronavirus response. But Biden doesn't seem to mind the association with Dr Fauci. He retweeted the president's remarks with a simple ""yes"". Fauci has served under six US presidents - both Democrats and Republicans - and he knows a bit about the rough and tumble politics of Washington. Over his five decades as a medical researcher, he has seen his effigy burnt, heard the cries of protesters calling him a ""murderer"", and had smoke bombs thrown outside his office window.

Melania Trump rarely campaigns First Lady Melania Trump is expected to join her husband at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night. It's not rare for a political spouse to make campaign stops, but it is rare for Melania - this will mark her first in-person campaign appearance in more than a year, aside from the Republican National Convention in August. She was also ill with Covid-19 earlier this month. As far as campaign events go, she'll have some stiff competition. Also tomorrow, the Democratic vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris will be joined by some Marvel superheroes. The California Senator will be flanked by some of the actors who play members of the Avengers squad: Chris Evans, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Rudd, Mark Ruffalo and Zoe Saldana. The Hulk turns up to campaign Today is the first day of early voting in Florida, a crucial swing state, and those turning up are trending younger, according to preliminary data from liberal analyst group Catalist. Of course, especially in Florida, which is known for its elderly population, younger means under-65. So far, the under-65s account for around half of the cast ballots - a 12 point rise from 2016, CNN reports. As early voting kicked off today, some 2.5m residents of the Sunshine State had already sent in their votes by mail. According to the Tampa Bay Times, that's close to the total number cast in the 2018 midterm election. During the August primary elections, Floridians overwhelmingly opted to vote by mail. But so far, there's been a lot of enthusiasm at the polls. Check out a timelapse below, captured by a CBS News reporter in Miami earlier this morning, of voter lines at the public library despite the soggy morning. Allow Twitter content?

With just over two weeks left until election day - and a record 29m votes already cast nationwide, the candidates are scrambling to make their last pitches to voters across the country. Who is ahead in the polls - and does it matter? Here, we break down all the most recent key data. Abdul âRabâ Razzak is a palliative care specialist born in Bangladesh and raised in New Jersey. He enthusiastically supports Joe Biden. ""Biden and Harris have shown they will listen and allow experts to speak freely about the reality of Covid-19 and climate change, as well as other issues. They show integrity and humility. They demonstrate what true servant leadership is - helping lift people that they serve."" Rab is a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: President Donald Trump is in Prescott, Arizona, for the first of two rallies in the state today. Trump won Arizona in 2016, but is trailing behind his rival Joe Biden in recent polls. ""How can you be three points up when we have crowds like this?"" Trump says, addressing Biden's poll lead. Attacking his rival, Trump tells supporters they have ""a choice between the American dream and a socialist nightmare"". Biden, he says, will ""massively"" raise taxes, and impose costly regulation. At points, the crowd responds with chants of ""lock him up!"". Trump also laments his loss in support from suburban women. ""I like women, I like women,"" he says. Joe Bidenâs campaign has accused Trump of âreckless
and negligent leadership âfollowing his
attacks on scientists and medical experts in recent days. In a campaign conference call on Monday, Trump branded Dr
Anthony Fauci âa disasterâ and suggested that other top infectious disease scientists were âidiotsâ. Trump also mocked Biden for
following the science during a rally on Sunday. âScience [is] the best tool we have to keep
Americans safe, while Trumpâs reckless and negligent leadership threatens to
put more lives at risk,"" the Biden campaign said. The former vice-president later added that the line dismissing his focus on science was not an attack but a 'badge of honour'. Â© 2025 BBC.

Monday's live page was brought to you by Matthew Davis, Boer Deng, Sophie Williams, Max Matza, Ritu Prasad and Holly Honderich. Their man may be behind in the national polls, but Republicans see hope in rising voter registrations in three key states that could yet yield the re-election of President Trump come November. Though registered Democrats still outnumber registered Republicans in Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, data has shown that the gap has narrowed since 2016. The Democratic advantage in Florida and Pennsylvania has shrunk by about 200,000 voters and in North Carolina by more than 230,000 voters. US presidential elections are not won by overall popularity but by having the right number of votes in the right places. Trump won all three states in 2016 in part because voters turned out for him and not for his rival. If registration is a measure of enthusiasm, Republicans may yet have reason to believe voters will turn out for Trump again. For this history-making election, Americans are going to the polls in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic's impact on the economy has hit young people disproportionately hard - a strain that is expected to leave a mark on their politics, possibly widening the gap with older, more conservative Americans. Research has found that people hit by economic downturns during their formative years are more likely to favour redistributive policies and attribute success to luck rather than hard work - and that will influence how they vote. Read the stories of the young Americans struggling in the 2020 economy. Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington DC Democratic candidate Joe Biden seems to have cornered at least one constituency - celebrities. Taylor Swift, Madonna, Cardi B, Tom Hanks and George Clooney have all thrown their support behind the Democratic ticket. In an editorial for V magazine, Taylor Swift urged fans to vote for Mr Biden and Ms Harris, and promptly shared the endorsement with her 140 million Instagram followers. And Dwayne Johnson - a self-described independent and now the most-followed American man on Instagram - made his first-ever endorsement, saying in a video that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are ""the best choice to lead our country"". This summer's Democratic National Convention, too, featured a parade of Oscar winners, musicians and professional athletes - an apparent contrast to the Republican convention the following week. There, the president himself was the biggest celebrity in attendance. But does all this matter?Read the full story here. While on the campaign trail this morning, Trump spoke to reporters about his recent brush with Covid-19, which landed the president in hospital for several days at the beginning of the month. Asked whether he would authorise his doctors to release information on when his most recent negative test was, he had this to say: This video can not be played Donald Trump: 'I'm immune, they say' Postal votes! Swing states! The Electoral College! There sure is alot of jargon associated with US elections - and details of how things work that even many American voters are unclear about. If you need a refresher,here's our really simple guide. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris turned up at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville this afternoon to kick off early voting in the state, which began today. ""The voters of Florida, you guys are going to determine the outcome of this election,"" the California senator said. ""You [all] are going to have an impact on people you'll never meet"" Harris brought out familiar lines of attack against President Trump - saying he failed to act even when he knew of the severity of the coronavirus outbreak - and touted her running mate, who is preparing for Thursday night's debate, leaving the campaigning up to her. ""This is the difference between a Donald Trump and Joe Biden,"" she said. ""We know that the strength of our democracy is the strength within our people."" Harris has returned to the campaign trail following a brief pause after two aides tested positive for coronavirus last week.  Ritu PrasadBBC News writer The US Supreme Court is in the spotlight for voters this year for many reasons. One of the top issues is healthcare. On 10 November, the court will consider a case on a popular Obama-era public healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. Out of the 23 million Americans who are currently insured by the ACA or Medicaid, another public health option, 21 million could lose their insurance if the law is overturned. Down the road, more could drop their plans if a lack of federal subsidies sends insurance prices sky-high. As one young voter told me: ""They can debate and turn this into a political issue all they want, but it's not political when you see your mom in a hospital bed."" And the backdrop to all this - a global pandemic that's affected more than 7.5 million Americans. Read the stories of four US patients whose lives could change if the ACA is overturned here.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing some gaming to get out the vote. The lawmaker has asked her Twitter followers if they wanted to join her for an online session of Among Us - a murder mystery style game - on Twitch, the video games-streaming platform. The digital invite from 'AOC', a 31-year-old millennial, is among a growing number of attempts to reach young voters on social platforms. Instagram has been flooded in recent days with celebrities posting their ""I Voted"" selfies, and stars of TikTok - which launched an in-app voting guide - are also making their political inclinations known. It remains to be seen whether these new get out the vote strategies will work. Young people have a historically bad track record for turning out on election day. If Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree on anything, it's that this year's election is an important one. It's also happening under unprecedented circumstances. Americans will cast their ballots as the country struggles against the coronavirus outbreak. As a result, more Americans are voting by post than ever before. An estimated80 million ballotswill be cast by mail this year as states aim to prevent gatherings to limit the spread of coronavirus. That means delays. Postal ballots need extra time to be delivered, and they also take longer to count once they have arrived. So though we'll see votes returned on election day - 3 November - don't expect final results until days after. Read more about what a delayed result could look like. With the coronavirus pandemic, the political theatre looks a little different this year. At rallies for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, supporters maintain a social distance, and drive through in their cars. And at Trump events, where masks are less common, supporters undergo temperature checks before entry. A government watchdog will investigate alleged ""political interference"" from the White House at the Centers for Disease Control and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at the behest of several Democratic lawmakers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) said on Monday it would look into whether the administration ""violated the agencies' scientific integrity and communication policies"". The inquiry was requested by Senators Elizabeth Warren, Patty Murray and Gary Peters. There have been reports of administration officials trying to pressure the agencies into changing guidance to match the president's assessment that the US has beaten Covid-19. Trump has often dismissed health officials (most recently Dr Fauci) and their recommendations as overly cautious. He insisted that the FDA authorisethe drug hydroxychloroquineto treat Covid-19, despite divided evidence on efficacy. The GAO is an independent agency that takes on such inquiries for Congress. More than 245 million Americans are eligible to vote this year, But only a small percentage of them will actually determine who the next president is. So who are they and where do they live? This video can not be played Who really decides the US election? After criticising the country's top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci this morning, President Trump doubled down on the denunciation at a campaign rally this afternoon in Arizona. The president then turned to his rival, Joe Biden, saying that the Democrat ""wants to listen to Dr Fauci"". Fauci has served as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, and has become one of the most visible figures in the governmentâs coronavirus response. But Biden doesn't seem to mind the association with Dr Fauci. He retweeted the president's remarks with a simple ""yes"". Fauci has served under six US presidents - both Democrats and Republicans - and he knows a bit about the rough and tumble politics of Washington. Over his five decades as a medical researcher, he has seen his effigy burnt, heard the cries of protesters calling him a ""murderer"", and had smoke bombs thrown outside his office window.

Melania Trump rarely campaigns First Lady Melania Trump is expected to join her husband at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night. It's not rare for a political spouse to make campaign stops, but it is rare for Melania - this will mark her first in-person campaign appearance in more than a year, aside from the Republican National Convention in August. She was also ill with Covid-19 earlier this month. As far as campaign events go, she'll have some stiff competition. Also tomorrow, the Democratic vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris will be joined by some Marvel superheroes. The California Senator will be flanked by some of the actors who play members of the Avengers squad: Chris Evans, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Rudd, Mark Ruffalo and Zoe Saldana. The Hulk turns up to campaign Today is the first day of early voting in Florida, a crucial swing state, and those turning up are trending younger, according to preliminary data from liberal analyst group Catalist. Of course, especially in Florida, which is known for its elderly population, younger means under-65. So far, the under-65s account for around half of the cast ballots - a 12 point rise from 2016, CNN reports. As early voting kicked off today, some 2.5m residents of the Sunshine State had already sent in their votes by mail. According to the Tampa Bay Times, that's close to the total number cast in the 2018 midterm election. During the August primary elections, Floridians overwhelmingly opted to vote by mail. But so far, there's been a lot of enthusiasm at the polls. Check out a timelapse below, captured by a CBS News reporter in Miami earlier this morning, of voter lines at the public library despite the soggy morning. Allow Twitter content?

With just over two weeks left until election day - and a record 29m votes already cast nationwide, the candidates are scrambling to make their last pitches to voters across the country. Who is ahead in the polls - and does it matter? Here, we break down all the most recent key data. Abdul âRabâ Razzak is a palliative care specialist born in Bangladesh and raised in New Jersey. He enthusiastically supports Joe Biden. ""Biden and Harris have shown they will listen and allow experts to speak freely about the reality of Covid-19 and climate change, as well as other issues. They show integrity and humility. They demonstrate what true servant leadership is - helping lift people that they serve."" Rab is a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: President Donald Trump is in Prescott, Arizona, for the first of two rallies in the state today. Trump won Arizona in 2016, but is trailing behind his rival Joe Biden in recent polls. ""How can you be three points up when we have crowds like this?"" Trump says, addressing Biden's poll lead. Attacking his rival, Trump tells supporters they have ""a choice between the American dream and a socialist nightmare"". Biden, he says, will ""massively"" raise taxes, and impose costly regulation. At points, the crowd responds with chants of ""lock him up!"". Trump also laments his loss in support from suburban women. ""I like women, I like women,"" he says. Joe Bidenâs campaign has accused Trump of âreckless
and negligent leadership âfollowing his
attacks on scientists and medical experts in recent days. In a campaign conference call on Monday, Trump branded Dr
Anthony Fauci âa disasterâ and suggested that other top infectious disease scientists were âidiotsâ. Trump also mocked Biden for
following the science during a rally on Sunday. âScience [is] the best tool we have to keep
Americans safe, while Trumpâs reckless and negligent leadership threatens to
put more lives at risk,"" the Biden campaign said. The former vice-president later added that the line dismissing his focus on science was not an attack but a 'badge of honour'. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The name change comes after years of debate in the Quebec town The small Canadian town of Asbestos that decided it needed a rebrand has done away with the name derived from its mining heritage. The Quebec town, home to some 7,000 people, voted for ""Val-des-Sources"" as its new moniker. The town was once the location of the world's largest asbestos mine. It was given the English name for the mineral - rather than the Frenchamiante- in the late 19th Century. But the town's council said the connotation hindered its ability to attract foreign investment, and announced last November that the hunt was on for a new name. The town, about 150 km (95 miles) east of Montreal, finally announced the winning title with some fanfare on Monday evening. It was picked after a lengthy consultation and a vote by town residents, including those as young as 14. About half the town residents eligible to cast ballots did so. Val-des-Sources won with just over 51% of the vote in the third round of voting. The name is ""above all, inspiring for the future"", Mayor Hugues Grimard said. Why the Canadian town of Asbestos wants a new name Other possibilities on the shortlist were L'Azur-des-Cantons, Jeffrey-sur-le-Lac, Larochelle, PhÃ©nix and Trois-Lacs, which came in second place. Asbestos won't be changing its town signs immediately, said Mr Grimard, who suggested it could be the end of the year before the formal, legal switch. ""It'll be a nice Christmas present,"" he said. The town of Asbestos thrived for over a century on the chrysotile asbestos manufactured at its open-pit mine. The mine suspended operations in 2011. Once considered a miracle mineral, asbestos was used in construction industries for strengthening cement, in insulation, roofing, fireproofing and sound absorption. But by the mid-20th Century, concerns about its use were growing as more and more studies linked asbestos to deadly illnesses. Breathing in asbestos fibres has been linked to cancer and other diseases. Global demand plummeted as countries around the world began banning asbestos. Canada was a latecomer, only banning its manufacture, import, use and export in 2018.

"This video can not be played Taoiseach (prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin gave a televised address The Irish government is to move the country to the highest level of coronavirus restrictions, broadly similar to the spring lockdown. Cabinet ministers have agreed to level five restrictions from midnight on Wednesday in a bid to combat the rise in cases. The restrictions are to last for six weeks but will be reviewed after four. Under the rules, people will only be able to exercise within 5km (3 miles) of their home. The government has confirmed there will be a penalty for travel beyond that distance, with exemptions for essential work and essential purposes. However, schools and creches will remain open and elite sport and construction will continue. People are being asked to stay at home. Those who can work from home must do so People will be able to meet up outdoors with one other household away from their home for the likes of exercise, within the 5km limit No social or family gatherings are allowed in homes or gardens, but visits on compassionate grounds and for caring purposes can continue Those living alone or parenting alone will be able to pair with another household as part of a ""support bubble"". Many non-essential shops and hairdressers will have to close Bars and restaurants will only be able to provide a takeaway service The number of wedding guests permitted will remain at 25 until the end of the year Up to 10 mourners can attend a funeral Elite sporting events can take place Most manufacturing will remain open Full list of restrictions in level five,external In a televised address on Monday evening, Taoiseach (prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said that despite having introduced what was probably ""Europe's strictest regime"", the current restrictions on their own had not been enough to significantly reduce levels of infection. ""2020 has been a hard year and we are not through it yet; families, individuals and front-line families have sacrificed so much,"" he said. However, he added that many people had done all that had been asked of them but some had not. People will only be able to exercise within 5km (3 miles) of their homes He said schools would remain open because ""we cannot and will not allow our children and young people's futures to be another victim of this disease"". ""I understand, and I feel very personally and profoundly, the sense of disappointment, the feelings of loneliness, perhaps even the despair that this announcement will bring for many,"" he said. ""The days are getting shorter and colder but I ask you to remember this: even as the winter comes in, there is hope. And there is light."" Mr Martin added that if everyone pulled together, the country would be able to celebrate Christmas ""in a meaningful way"". Analysis by Chris Page, BBC News Ireland correspondent Although Ireland has recorded its record highest number of daily cases over the last few weeks, it's still lower than many countries in Europe. Hospitalisations have been rising, but they're not at the level seen earlier in the year and again while deaths are slowly rising, they're nowhere near what they were at the peak. The government is trying to stave off a worsening situation. The thinking is - put in place these measures now until the end of November and then the reward that's being held up is that if people stick to the restrictions, then maybe they can have a more normal Christmas than would previously have been possible. The government thinks there could be more than 200,000 job losses as a result of these restrictions - that's a lot in a country of close to five million people. But they think if they can get the country opened up in December, that will make a major difference in terms of getting the country back on its feet again economically. The taoiseach said there would be advanced financial measures supporting businesses and individuals, as well as measures to support mental health. The top rate of â¬350 (Â£318) a week for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will be restored, with a sliding scale of payments depending on a person's pre-pandemic income. On Monday, the Irish Department of Health reported no further coronavirus-related deaths, with the total remaining at 1,852. The total number of positive cases stands at 50,993, after a further 1,031 were recorded. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospitals has risen to 298 in the last 24 hours. The move to level five follows a recommendation from the country's Public Health Emergency Team. Garda (Irish police) checkpoints were set up when level three travel restrictions were imposed in early October Ministersrejected a similar recommendationless than a fortnight ago. The Irish government published itsfive-stage plan for ""living with Covid-19"",externalin mid-September, which ranges from relaxed measures at level one to the most severe restrictions at level five. At the time, the government said it was moving from a short-term emergency response to the pandemic to a medium-term approach which involved ""managing risk"" posed by the disease and repairing the damage it had inflicted on society. Currently, most of the country is at the mid-way point on level three. However, people in the border counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan have been living with level four restrictions since Thursday. This included closing gyms, pools and leisure centres, and non-essential retail and limiting weddings to six. Northern Irelandbrought in tighter restrictions, lasting for four weeks, from Friday 16 October. School are closed for the next two weeks, effectively an extra week at half term. Pubs, restaurants and cafes have closed their doors to sit-in customers, while hair and beauty salons have also had to shut, gyms face additional measures and driving instructors have been taken off the road.

"A meeting between ministers and local leaders about Greater Manchester's Covid restrictions has ended without agreement. Local leaders want better financial support for workers before any move to the top tier of rules, which would force some businesses to close. The communities secretary has said local leaders have a deadline of noon on Tuesday to reach a deal. It comes as the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths. Following the meeting, Greater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC: ""The government could have a deal if it better protects low-paid people. It is choosing not to do that."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday thathe might ""need to intervene""if local leaders did not accept a move to tier three - the highest level of England's coronavirus restrictions. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons further discussions were planned with leaders in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside about restrictions in these areas. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle What is a circuit-breaker? There are conflicting reports about Monday afternoon's meeting between Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick and local leaders in Greater Manchester, which one source on the call said ended ""abruptly"". In a joint statement, Mr Burnham and the Labour leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese said: ""We had been encouraged by earlier discussions at an official level where the idea of a hardship fund, to top up furlough payments and support the self-employed, had been tabled by the government. ""It was both surprising and disappointing when this idea was taken off the table by the secretary of state."" But a spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said that while it was ""disappointing"" no agreement had been reached, Mr Burnham was ""incorrect in claiming that officials made this proposal today"". A key sticking point of the dispute is that Mr Burnham wants the government to reintroduce the 80% furlough scheme used during the UK's first lockdown, instead ofthe new Job Support Schemewhich covers 67% of the wages of people affected by tier three closures. This evening, the two sides can't even agree on what they actually discussed earlier. Believe the local leaders and this morning there seemed to be hope in the air. Officials from central government had mooted the possibility of a hardship fund to help support low-paid workers who stand to lose out if businesses close their doors under tighter restrictions. The message local leaders took from their meeting was that, while the Treasury is adamant they are not going to extend their national furlough scheme that has supported millions of wages any further - nor increase the level of cash available from its replacement, the Job Support Scheme - Westminster might sign off extra money that could be spent that way, if local politicians saw fit. There was no concrete agreement on the numbers, but sources in Greater Manchester suggest the cost of supporting those who need the extra help comes in at around Â£15m a month. After that call, the consensus among North West leaders was moving in the direction of signing on the dotted line, with another call planned with Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick for the afternoon. But rather than ushering in a new spirit of co-operation, that meeting went south. Read more from Laura. Meanwhile, people in Wales will be told from Friday to stay at home, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. It comes asa two-week school closure begins in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions. Scotland continues to draw up plans for a three-tier framework of measures, similar to England's. The prime minister's official spokesman said that in Greater Manchester the number of new cases in people over the age of 60 had tripled in the most recent 15 days of full data - from 89 cases per 100,000 on 27 September to 282 per 100,000 on 12 October. He said government projections suggested coronavirus patients would take up the entire current intensive care capacity in Greater Manchester by 8 November, not including capacity in Nightingale hospitals. However, Prof Jane Eddleston, the region's medical lead for the coronavirus response, said Greater Manchester's intensive care capacity was not at risk of being overwhelmed. Prof Eddleston said the situation was ""serious"" but despite the ""stark"" figures on hospital admissions and cases, extra capacity would be available. In their joint statement, Mr Burnham and Sir Richard said Greater Manchester's intensive care unit occupancy rate was ""not abnormal for this time of year"" and it was ""essential... public fears are not raised unnecessarily"". There is a blizzard of numbers flying around about Greater Manchester, and the North West more widely, as national and local politicians argue about whether to introduce local restrictions. But a curious element that seems to have been missed is that the rise in cases may have already stalled. The last few days show no rise in the average number of new infections across the North West, while Manchester itself may actually be seeing cases fall after peaking at more than 500 a day on average at the end of September. This will take some time to filter through into hospital cases as the people who are ill enough to be admitted to hospital have been infected a few weeks before. But already there are signs the rises in hospital admissions are slowing. That's not to say hospitals and intensive care in particular is not busy. The pressures are akin to what the NHS would normally see in the peak of winter and, of course, it's only October. But talk of units becoming overwhelmed when they have not even really dipped into their ""surge capacity"", transforming other parts of the hospital into temporary intensive care wards, seems somewhat premature. What happens in the coming weeks though will be crucial. Earlier, Mr Jenrick indicated that Greater Manchester could be offered a financial package similar to the ""tens of millions"" of pounds of support agreed forLancashireandthe Liverpool City Region,external- the two parts of England already in tier three. Nottingham's Labour council leader David Mellenhas also called for more support for businesses in the city if it is moved to tier three.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: Not reaching a trade deal with the EU is an âoutcome for which we are increasingly well preparedâ. The EU has said it is willing to ""intensify"" talks on a trade deal with the UK this week to try to break the impasse between the two sides. Its negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc was prepared to discuss all areas of disagreement, including fishing and competition, based on legal texts. Michael Gove said he welcomed the bloc's latest ""constructive"" step. Later, No 10 said there was ""no basis to resume talks"" unless there was a ""fundamental change"" from the EU. The UK has accused the EU of dragging its feet and failing to respect its sovereignty in the negotiations. In a Commons statement, Cabinet Office Minister Mr Gove said his ""door was not closed"" to further talks but the EU needed to change its position for the process to continue. After a call between Mr Barnier and the UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, Downing Street released a statement saying the EU needed to try to find an agreement ""between sovereign equals"". Anglican leaders issue Brexit bill warning Firms urged to get ready for new EU relationship On Friday, No 10 suggested formal negotiations were ""over"" as the EU was not serious about discussing the details of a free trade agreement similar to the one it has with Canada - the UK's preferred outcome. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK should ""get ready"" to trade with the EU from 1 January, when it leaves the single market and customs union, without a specific agreement. But following a video call with his UK counterpart Lord Frost on Monday, Mr Barnier said he was willing to accelerate the process in the coming days to try to bridge the gap between the two sides.

Mr Barnier suggested all subjects would be on the table and the discussions would be based on specific legal texts, which the UK has accused the EU of refusing to consider in recent weeks. In response, Lord Frost tweeted that the proposal to intensify work had been noted, and added: ""But the EU still needs to make a fundamental change in approach to the talks and make clear it has done so.""

Updating MPs on the state of the talks, Mr Gove said the EU's latest move was a positive one and suggested the UK would respond in kind. He said: ""Even while I have been at the despatch box, it has been reported that there has been a constructive move on the part of the EU and I welcome that. ""We need to make sure we work on the basis of the intensification they propose and I prefer to look forward in optimism rather than look back in anger."" He added: ""If there has been movement, and there seems to be movement, then no-one would welcome it more than me but what we can't have from the EU is the illusion of engagement without the reality of compromise."" Some senior Conservatives have urged the government to walk away from the talks, suggesting the EU is no longer negotiating in ""good faith"". Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the EU's ""refusal"" to engage in meaningful talks on trade in financial services and agricultural products was a breach of the terms of the withdrawal agreement governing the UK's exit. The government has said the UK will prosper whatever the outcome of the negotiations, as it will be able to exercise freedoms not available while being an EU member. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves calls on the government to be âhonestâ about the effect of the UK not reaching a trade deal with the EU. But business groups have warned the UK's fallback option of a so-called ""Australian-style"" arrangement - where UK-EU trade will default to World Trade Organization rules - would be disastrous as it would see tariffs on goods moving across the channel. With less than 75 days to go before the transition period ends on 31 December, the government has urgedbusiness to step up its preparationsfor the looming changes to trading rules. The PM will hold a meeting with industry groups on Tuesday to emphasise the need for action. Labour has said the government only has itself to blame for the current uncertainty, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves calling on ministers to be ""honest"" about the effect on the UK of not agreeing a trade deal. And former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May suggested the implications of failing to agree a future partnership would also be highly damaging for the UK's security. This video can not be played Brexit: Theresa May seems unimpressed with Michael Gove's plan Mrs May, who quit last year after Parliament rejected her withdrawal agreement three times, said the UK ""should not be resigned"" to the prospect of failing to agree a deal over law enforcement and information sharing. She warned that ""if the UK walks away with no deal, then our police and law enforcement agencies will no longer have the necessary access to databases in order to be able to continue to identify and catch criminals and potential terrorists in order to keep us safe"". In response, Mr Gove said ""significant progress"" had been made in terms of security co-operation but the EU could not make access to databases conditional on the UK accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.

"On a call with campaign staff, President Trump dismissed Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, as a ""disaster"" Early voting for the US election kicked off in the battleground state of Florida Donald Trump hit the campaign trail hard at the weekend, and is now in Arizona Joe Biden - who has a significant lead in most national polls - is prepping for the last presidential debate on Thursday A record 29m nationwide ballots have been cast ahead of election day on 3 November, as the US remains gripped by Covid-19 Today - in between the news and views - we focused on Explaining the Election Edited by Boer Deng Most polls have closed on a busy first day of early voting in Florida, and our live page will do the same. With just two weeks left until the 3 November 2020 US presidential election, candidates are scrambling to deliver their final pitches to voters - and are making plenty of news on the campaign trail as they do. Here are some of the key events from Monday:  We'll be back tomorrow with the latest campaign news and analysis. Monday's live page was brought to you by Matthew Davis, Boer Deng, Sophie Williams, Max Matza, Ritu Prasad and Holly Honderich. Their man may be behind in the national polls, but Republicans see hope in rising voter registrations in three key states that could yet yield the re-election of President Trump come November. Though registered Democrats still outnumber registered Republicans in Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, data has shown that the gap has narrowed since 2016. The Democratic advantage in Florida and Pennsylvania has shrunk by about 200,000 voters and in North Carolina by more than 230,000 voters. US presidential elections are not won by overall popularity but by having the right number of votes in the right places. Trump won all three states in 2016 in part because voters turned out for him and not for his rival. If registration is a measure of enthusiasm, Republicans may yet have reason to believe voters will turn out for Trump again. For this history-making election, Americans are going to the polls in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic's impact on the economy has hit young people disproportionately hard - a strain that is expected to leave a mark on their politics, possibly widening the gap with older, more conservative Americans. Research has found that people hit by economic downturns during their formative years are more likely to favour redistributive policies and attribute success to luck rather than hard work - and that will influence how they vote. Read the stories of the young Americans struggling in the 2020 economy. Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington DC Democratic candidate Joe Biden seems to have cornered at least one constituency - celebrities. Taylor Swift, Madonna, Cardi B, Tom Hanks and George Clooney have all thrown their support behind the Democratic ticket. In an editorial for V magazine, Taylor Swift urged fans to vote for Mr Biden and Ms Harris, and promptly shared the endorsement with her 140 million Instagram followers. And Dwayne Johnson - a self-described independent and now the most-followed American man on Instagram - made his first-ever endorsement, saying in a video that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are ""the best choice to lead our country"". This summer's Democratic National Convention, too, featured a parade of Oscar winners, musicians and professional athletes - an apparent contrast to the Republican convention the following week. There, the president himself was the biggest celebrity in attendance. But does all this matter?Read the full story here. While on the campaign trail this morning, Trump spoke to reporters about his recent brush with Covid-19, which landed the president in hospital for several days at the beginning of the month. Asked whether he would authorise his doctors to release information on when his most recent negative test was, he had this to say: This video can not be played Donald Trump: 'I'm immune, they say' Postal votes! Swing states! The Electoral College! There sure is alot of jargon associated with US elections - and details of how things work that even many American voters are unclear about. If you need a refresher,here's our really simple guide. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris turned up at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville this afternoon to kick off early voting in the state, which began today. ""The voters of Florida, you guys are going to determine the outcome of this election,"" the California senator said. ""You [all] are going to have an impact on people you'll never meet"" Harris brought out familiar lines of attack against President Trump - saying he failed to act even when he knew of the severity of the coronavirus outbreak - and touted her running mate, who is preparing for Thursday night's debate, leaving the campaigning up to her. ""This is the difference between a Donald Trump and Joe Biden,"" she said. ""We know that the strength of our democracy is the strength within our people."" Harris has returned to the campaign trail following a brief pause after two aides tested positive for coronavirus last week.  Ritu PrasadBBC News writer The US Supreme Court is in the spotlight for voters this year for many reasons. One of the top issues is healthcare. On 10 November, the court will consider a case on a popular Obama-era public healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. Out of the 23 million Americans who are currently insured by the ACA or Medicaid, another public health option, 21 million could lose their insurance if the law is overturned. Down the road, more could drop their plans if a lack of federal subsidies sends insurance prices sky-high. As one young voter told me: ""They can debate and turn this into a political issue all they want, but it's not political when you see your mom in a hospital bed."" And the backdrop to all this - a global pandemic that's affected more than 7.5 million Americans. Read the stories of four US patients whose lives could change if the ACA is overturned here.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing some gaming to get out the vote. The lawmaker has asked her Twitter followers if they wanted to join her for an online session of Among Us - a murder mystery style game - on Twitch, the video games-streaming platform. The digital invite from 'AOC', a 31-year-old millennial, is among a growing number of attempts to reach young voters on social platforms. Instagram has been flooded in recent days with celebrities posting their ""I Voted"" selfies, and stars of TikTok - which launched an in-app voting guide - are also making their political inclinations known. It remains to be seen whether these new get out the vote strategies will work. Young people have a historically bad track record for turning out on election day. If Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree on anything, it's that this year's election is an important one. It's also happening under unprecedented circumstances. Americans will cast their ballots as the country struggles against the coronavirus outbreak. As a result, more Americans are voting by post than ever before. An estimated80 million ballotswill be cast by mail this year as states aim to prevent gatherings to limit the spread of coronavirus. That means delays. Postal ballots need extra time to be delivered, and they also take longer to count once they have arrived. So though we'll see votes returned on election day - 3 November - don't expect final results until days after. Read more about what a delayed result could look like. With the coronavirus pandemic, the political theatre looks a little different this year. At rallies for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, supporters maintain a social distance, and drive through in their cars. And at Trump events, where masks are less common, supporters undergo temperature checks before entry. A government watchdog will investigate alleged ""political interference"" from the White House at the Centers for Disease Control and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at the behest of several Democratic lawmakers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) said on Monday it would look into whether the administration ""violated the agencies' scientific integrity and communication policies"". The inquiry was requested by Senators Elizabeth Warren, Patty Murray and Gary Peters. There have been reports of administration officials trying to pressure the agencies into changing guidance to match the president's assessment that the US has beaten Covid-19. Trump has often dismissed health officials (most recently Dr Fauci) and their recommendations as overly cautious. He insisted that the FDA authorisethe drug hydroxychloroquineto treat Covid-19, despite divided evidence on efficacy. The GAO is an independent agency that takes on such inquiries for Congress. More than 245 million Americans are eligible to vote this year, But only a small percentage of them will actually determine who the next president is. So who are they and where do they live? This video can not be played Who really decides the US election? After criticising the country's top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci this morning, President Trump doubled down on the denunciation at a campaign rally this afternoon in Arizona. The president then turned to his rival, Joe Biden, saying that the Democrat ""wants to listen to Dr Fauci"". Fauci has served as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, and has become one of the most visible figures in the governmentâs coronavirus response. But Biden doesn't seem to mind the association with Dr Fauci. He retweeted the president's remarks with a simple ""yes"". Fauci has served under six US presidents - both Democrats and Republicans - and he knows a bit about the rough and tumble politics of Washington. Over his five decades as a medical researcher, he has seen his effigy burnt, heard the cries of protesters calling him a ""murderer"", and had smoke bombs thrown outside his office window.

Melania Trump rarely campaigns First Lady Melania Trump is expected to join her husband at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night. It's not rare for a political spouse to make campaign stops, but it is rare for Melania - this will mark her first in-person campaign appearance in more than a year, aside from the Republican National Convention in August. She was also ill with Covid-19 earlier this month. As far as campaign events go, she'll have some stiff competition. Also tomorrow, the Democratic vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris will be joined by some Marvel superheroes. The California Senator will be flanked by some of the actors who play members of the Avengers squad: Chris Evans, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Rudd, Mark Ruffalo and Zoe Saldana. The Hulk turns up to campaign Today is the first day of early voting in Florida, a crucial swing state, and those turning up are trending younger, according to preliminary data from liberal analyst group Catalist. Of course, especially in Florida, which is known for its elderly population, younger means under-65. So far, the under-65s account for around half of the cast ballots - a 12 point rise from 2016, CNN reports. As early voting kicked off today, some 2.5m residents of the Sunshine State had already sent in their votes by mail. According to the Tampa Bay Times, that's close to the total number cast in the 2018 midterm election. During the August primary elections, Floridians overwhelmingly opted to vote by mail. But so far, there's been a lot of enthusiasm at the polls. Check out a timelapse below, captured by a CBS News reporter in Miami earlier this morning, of voter lines at the public library despite the soggy morning. Allow Twitter content?

With just over two weeks left until election day - and a record 29m votes already cast nationwide, the candidates are scrambling to make their last pitches to voters across the country. Who is ahead in the polls - and does it matter? Here, we break down all the most recent key data. Abdul âRabâ Razzak is a palliative care specialist born in Bangladesh and raised in New Jersey. He enthusiastically supports Joe Biden. ""Biden and Harris have shown they will listen and allow experts to speak freely about the reality of Covid-19 and climate change, as well as other issues. They show integrity and humility. They demonstrate what true servant leadership is - helping lift people that they serve."" Rab is a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: President Donald Trump is in Prescott, Arizona, for the first of two rallies in the state today. Trump won Arizona in 2016, but is trailing behind his rival Joe Biden in recent polls. ""How can you be three points up when we have crowds like this?"" Trump says, addressing Biden's poll lead. Attacking his rival, Trump tells supporters they have ""a choice between the American dream and a socialist nightmare"". Biden, he says, will ""massively"" raise taxes, and impose costly regulation. At points, the crowd responds with chants of ""lock him up!"". Trump also laments his loss in support from suburban women. ""I like women, I like women,"" he says. Joe Bidenâs campaign has accused Trump of âreckless
and negligent leadership âfollowing his
attacks on scientists and medical experts in recent days. In a campaign conference call on Monday, Trump branded Dr
Anthony Fauci âa disasterâ and suggested that other top infectious disease scientists were âidiotsâ. Trump also mocked Biden for
following the science during a rally on Sunday. âScience [is] the best tool we have to keep
Americans safe, while Trumpâs reckless and negligent leadership threatens to
put more lives at risk,"" the Biden campaign said. The former vice-president later added that the line dismissing his focus on science was not an attack but a 'badge of honour'. Â© 2025 BBC.

Though registered Democrats still outnumber registered Republicans in Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, data has shown that the gap has narrowed since 2016. The Democratic advantage in Florida and Pennsylvania has shrunk by about 200,000 voters and in North Carolina by more than 230,000 voters. US presidential elections are not won by overall popularity but by having the right number of votes in the right places. Trump won all three states in 2016 in part because voters turned out for him and not for his rival. If registration is a measure of enthusiasm, Republicans may yet have reason to believe voters will turn out for Trump again. For this history-making election, Americans are going to the polls in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic's impact on the economy has hit young people disproportionately hard - a strain that is expected to leave a mark on their politics, possibly widening the gap with older, more conservative Americans. Research has found that people hit by economic downturns during their formative years are more likely to favour redistributive policies and attribute success to luck rather than hard work - and that will influence how they vote. Read the stories of the young Americans struggling in the 2020 economy. Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington DC Democratic candidate Joe Biden seems to have cornered at least one constituency - celebrities. Taylor Swift, Madonna, Cardi B, Tom Hanks and George Clooney have all thrown their support behind the Democratic ticket. In an editorial for V magazine, Taylor Swift urged fans to vote for Mr Biden and Ms Harris, and promptly shared the endorsement with her 140 million Instagram followers. And Dwayne Johnson - a self-described independent and now the most-followed American man on Instagram - made his first-ever endorsement, saying in a video that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are ""the best choice to lead our country"". This summer's Democratic National Convention, too, featured a parade of Oscar winners, musicians and professional athletes - an apparent contrast to the Republican convention the following week. There, the president himself was the biggest celebrity in attendance. But does all this matter?Read the full story here. While on the campaign trail this morning, Trump spoke to reporters about his recent brush with Covid-19, which landed the president in hospital for several days at the beginning of the month. Asked whether he would authorise his doctors to release information on when his most recent negative test was, he had this to say: This video can not be played Donald Trump: 'I'm immune, they say' Postal votes! Swing states! The Electoral College! There sure is alot of jargon associated with US elections - and details of how things work that even many American voters are unclear about. If you need a refresher,here's our really simple guide. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris turned up at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville this afternoon to kick off early voting in the state, which began today. ""The voters of Florida, you guys are going to determine the outcome of this election,"" the California senator said. ""You [all] are going to have an impact on people you'll never meet"" Harris brought out familiar lines of attack against President Trump - saying he failed to act even when he knew of the severity of the coronavirus outbreak - and touted her running mate, who is preparing for Thursday night's debate, leaving the campaigning up to her. ""This is the difference between a Donald Trump and Joe Biden,"" she said. ""We know that the strength of our democracy is the strength within our people."" Harris has returned to the campaign trail following a brief pause after two aides tested positive for coronavirus last week.  Ritu PrasadBBC News writer The US Supreme Court is in the spotlight for voters this year for many reasons. One of the top issues is healthcare. On 10 November, the court will consider a case on a popular Obama-era public healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. Out of the 23 million Americans who are currently insured by the ACA or Medicaid, another public health option, 21 million could lose their insurance if the law is overturned. Down the road, more could drop their plans if a lack of federal subsidies sends insurance prices sky-high. As one young voter told me: ""They can debate and turn this into a political issue all they want, but it's not political when you see your mom in a hospital bed."" And the backdrop to all this - a global pandemic that's affected more than 7.5 million Americans. Read the stories of four US patients whose lives could change if the ACA is overturned here.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing some gaming to get out the vote. The lawmaker has asked her Twitter followers if they wanted to join her for an online session of Among Us - a murder mystery style game - on Twitch, the video games-streaming platform. The digital invite from 'AOC', a 31-year-old millennial, is among a growing number of attempts to reach young voters on social platforms. Instagram has been flooded in recent days with celebrities posting their ""I Voted"" selfies, and stars of TikTok - which launched an in-app voting guide - are also making their political inclinations known. It remains to be seen whether these new get out the vote strategies will work. Young people have a historically bad track record for turning out on election day. If Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree on anything, it's that this year's election is an important one. It's also happening under unprecedented circumstances. Americans will cast their ballots as the country struggles against the coronavirus outbreak. As a result, more Americans are voting by post than ever before. An estimated80 million ballotswill be cast by mail this year as states aim to prevent gatherings to limit the spread of coronavirus. That means delays. Postal ballots need extra time to be delivered, and they also take longer to count once they have arrived. So though we'll see votes returned on election day - 3 November - don't expect final results until days after. Read more about what a delayed result could look like. With the coronavirus pandemic, the political theatre looks a little different this year. At rallies for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, supporters maintain a social distance, and drive through in their cars. And at Trump events, where masks are less common, supporters undergo temperature checks before entry. A government watchdog will investigate alleged ""political interference"" from the White House at the Centers for Disease Control and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at the behest of several Democratic lawmakers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) said on Monday it would look into whether the administration ""violated the agencies' scientific integrity and communication policies"". The inquiry was requested by Senators Elizabeth Warren, Patty Murray and Gary Peters. There have been reports of administration officials trying to pressure the agencies into changing guidance to match the president's assessment that the US has beaten Covid-19. Trump has often dismissed health officials (most recently Dr Fauci) and their recommendations as overly cautious. He insisted that the FDA authorisethe drug hydroxychloroquineto treat Covid-19, despite divided evidence on efficacy. The GAO is an independent agency that takes on such inquiries for Congress. More than 245 million Americans are eligible to vote this year, But only a small percentage of them will actually determine who the next president is. So who are they and where do they live? This video can not be played Who really decides the US election? After criticising the country's top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci this morning, President Trump doubled down on the denunciation at a campaign rally this afternoon in Arizona. The president then turned to his rival, Joe Biden, saying that the Democrat ""wants to listen to Dr Fauci"". Fauci has served as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, and has become one of the most visible figures in the governmentâs coronavirus response. But Biden doesn't seem to mind the association with Dr Fauci. He retweeted the president's remarks with a simple ""yes"". Fauci has served under six US presidents - both Democrats and Republicans - and he knows a bit about the rough and tumble politics of Washington. Over his five decades as a medical researcher, he has seen his effigy burnt, heard the cries of protesters calling him a ""murderer"", and had smoke bombs thrown outside his office window.

Melania Trump rarely campaigns First Lady Melania Trump is expected to join her husband at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night. It's not rare for a political spouse to make campaign stops, but it is rare for Melania - this will mark her first in-person campaign appearance in more than a year, aside from the Republican National Convention in August. She was also ill with Covid-19 earlier this month. As far as campaign events go, she'll have some stiff competition. Also tomorrow, the Democratic vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris will be joined by some Marvel superheroes. The California Senator will be flanked by some of the actors who play members of the Avengers squad: Chris Evans, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Rudd, Mark Ruffalo and Zoe Saldana. The Hulk turns up to campaign Today is the first day of early voting in Florida, a crucial swing state, and those turning up are trending younger, according to preliminary data from liberal analyst group Catalist. Of course, especially in Florida, which is known for its elderly population, younger means under-65. So far, the under-65s account for around half of the cast ballots - a 12 point rise from 2016, CNN reports. As early voting kicked off today, some 2.5m residents of the Sunshine State had already sent in their votes by mail. According to the Tampa Bay Times, that's close to the total number cast in the 2018 midterm election. During the August primary elections, Floridians overwhelmingly opted to vote by mail. But so far, there's been a lot of enthusiasm at the polls. Check out a timelapse below, captured by a CBS News reporter in Miami earlier this morning, of voter lines at the public library despite the soggy morning. Allow Twitter content?

He enthusiastically supports Joe Biden. ""Biden and Harris have shown they will listen and allow experts to speak freely about the reality of Covid-19 and climate change, as well as other issues. They show integrity and humility. They demonstrate what true servant leadership is - helping lift people that they serve."" Rab is a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: President Donald Trump is in Prescott, Arizona, for the first of two rallies in the state today. Trump won Arizona in 2016, but is trailing behind his rival Joe Biden in recent polls. ""How can you be three points up when we have crowds like this?"" Trump says, addressing Biden's poll lead. Attacking his rival, Trump tells supporters they have ""a choice between the American dream and a socialist nightmare"". Biden, he says, will ""massively"" raise taxes, and impose costly regulation. At points, the crowd responds with chants of ""lock him up!"". Trump also laments his loss in support from suburban women. ""I like women, I like women,"" he says. Joe Bidenâs campaign has accused Trump of âreckless
and negligent leadership âfollowing his
attacks on scientists and medical experts in recent days. In a campaign conference call on Monday, Trump branded Dr
Anthony Fauci âa disasterâ and suggested that other top infectious disease scientists were âidiotsâ. Trump also mocked Biden for
following the science during a rally on Sunday. âScience [is] the best tool we have to keep
Americans safe, while Trumpâs reckless and negligent leadership threatens to
put more lives at risk,"" the Biden campaign said. The former vice-president later added that the line dismissing his focus on science was not an attack but a 'badge of honour'. Â© 2025 BBC.

And the Republic of Ireland is to move intothe highest level of coronavirus restrictionsfrom midnight on Wednesday for six weeks. Belgium was one of the worst-hit countries during Europe's first wave of coronavirus earlier this year. Overall it has the third-highest number of Covid-related deaths per 100,000 people globally, behind only Peru and San Marino, according to Johns Hopkins University data. From Monday, under new government restrictions designed to tackle the fresh outbreak, residents will only be allowed to see one other person from outside their household and should work from home if possible. A curfew is in place from midnight until 05:00 for the next month and alcohol sales are banned from 20:00.

On Monday the government announced it was opening a field hospital at the national stadium in Warsaw and said the armed forces would be deployed to man drive-through testing facilities. Europe experiencing 'Covid fatigue' Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said that other major cities were also working to set up new hospitals. The country was preparing ""for the worst-case scenarios - such as 15,000 or even 20,000 new infections"" each day, he said. Government officials have urged people to stay at home, ordered restaurants to reduce opening hours and told universities and secondary schools to teach online.

"This video can not be played Taoiseach (prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin gave a televised address The Irish government is to move the country to the highest level of coronavirus restrictions, broadly similar to the spring lockdown. Cabinet ministers have agreed to level five restrictions from midnight on Wednesday in a bid to combat the rise in cases. The restrictions are to last for six weeks but will be reviewed after four. Under the rules, people will only be able to exercise within 5km (3 miles) of their home.

However, schools and creches will remain open and elite sport and construction will continue. People are being asked to stay at home. Those who can work from home must do so People will be able to meet up outdoors with one other household away from their home for the likes of exercise, within the 5km limit No social or family gatherings are allowed in homes or gardens, but visits on compassionate grounds and for caring purposes can continue Those living alone or parenting alone will be able to pair with another household as part of a ""support bubble"".

""2020 has been a hard year and we are not through it yet; families, individuals and front-line families have sacrificed so much,"" he said. However, he added that many people had done all that had been asked of them but some had not. People will only be able to exercise within 5km (3 miles) of their homes He said schools would remain open because ""we cannot and will not allow our children and young people's futures to be another victim of this disease"". ""I understand, and I feel very personally and profoundly, the sense of disappointment, the feelings of loneliness, perhaps even the despair that this announcement will bring for many,"" he said. ""The days are getting shorter and colder but I ask you to remember this: even as the winter comes in, there is hope. And there is light."" Mr Martin added that if everyone pulled together, the country would be able to celebrate Christmas ""in a meaningful way"". Analysis by Chris Page, BBC News Ireland correspondent Although Ireland has recorded its record highest number of daily cases over the last few weeks, it's still lower than many countries in Europe. Hospitalisations have been rising, but they're not at the level seen earlier in the year and again while deaths are slowly rising, they're nowhere near what they were at the peak. The government is trying to stave off a worsening situation. The thinking is - put in place these measures now until the end of November and then the reward that's being held up is that if people stick to the restrictions, then maybe they can have a more normal Christmas than would previously have been possible. The government thinks there could be more than 200,000 job losses as a result of these restrictions - that's a lot in a country of close to five million people. But they think if they can get the country opened up in December, that will make a major difference in terms of getting the country back on its feet again economically. The taoiseach said there would be advanced financial measures supporting businesses and individuals, as well as measures to support mental health. The top rate of â¬350 (Â£318) a week for the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will be restored, with a sliding scale of payments depending on a person's pre-pandemic income. On Monday, the Irish Department of Health reported no further coronavirus-related deaths, with the total remaining at 1,852. The total number of positive cases stands at 50,993, after a further 1,031 were recorded. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospitals has risen to 298 in the last 24 hours. The move to level five follows a recommendation from the country's Public Health Emergency Team. Garda (Irish police) checkpoints were set up when level three travel restrictions were imposed in early October Ministersrejected a similar recommendationless than a fortnight ago. The Irish government published itsfive-stage plan for ""living with Covid-19"",externalin mid-September, which ranges from relaxed measures at level one to the most severe restrictions at level five. At the time, the government said it was moving from a short-term emergency response to the pandemic to a medium-term approach which involved ""managing risk"" posed by the disease and repairing the damage it had inflicted on society. Currently, most of the country is at the mid-way point on level three. However, people in the border counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan have been living with level four restrictions since Thursday. This included closing gyms, pools and leisure centres, and non-essential retail and limiting weddings to six. Northern Irelandbrought in tighter restrictions, lasting for four weeks, from Friday 16 October. School are closed for the next two weeks, effectively an extra week at half term. Pubs, restaurants and cafes have closed their doors to sit-in customers, while hair and beauty salons have also had to shut, gyms face additional measures and driving instructors have been taken off the road.

"There will be a pause on giving the flu vaccine to people under 65 in Northern Ireland until more stock is received, the Public Health Agency has said. It said that following ""phenomenal"" demand, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK was ""now reaching full uptake of the allocated stock"". The agency added that there was a ""worldwide issue"" with supply. It advised patients that it will take ""a number of weeks"" for more vaccine doses to be delivered and distributed. Dr Gerry Waldron from the Public Health Agency (PHA) acknowledged the temporary restriction on supply ""will cause some concern"" for patients who are awaiting vaccination. However he added he ""would like to provide reassurance that  people will still get the vaccine well in time before we anticipate that flu will be circulating widely in the community"". Vulnerable patients had been advised thatgetting vaccinated against seasonal flu was more important than ever this year, to avoid putting more pressure on health services during the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Waldron said more than 500,000 doses of flu vaccine have already been distributed in Northern Ireland which he described as ""an unprecedented number at this stage of a seasonal flu vaccination programme"". ""Indeed, we have distributed more vaccines in the past few weeks than the entirety of previous flu seasons,"" he added. ""It is great to see people getting the vaccine in such high numbers, but it does create the unusual situation of pausing some aspects until further supplies become available,"" Dr Waldron explained. ""As this is a worldwide issue, it will take a number of weeks for the vaccine to be delivered and distributed, with a plan to reopen ordering in mid-November,"" he said. A PHA spokeswoman also confirmed that the flu vaccination programme in schools is separate from the adult programme and it is not affected by the supply issue. Until more adult vaccine stocks are received, GP surgeries and health trusts are being advised to use their existing supplies and to notify the PHA of unused vaccine so it can be redistributed to other practices that may need it. The PHA has also asked for frontline health workers to be given priority for vaccination across the health and social care sector.

"This video can not be played Marwa and Safa's mother is optimistic about their future as they return to Pakistan Twin girls who were born joined at the head, and separated last year by a team at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, have returned home to Pakistan. Safa and Marwa Bibi underwent three major operations, spending more than 50 hours in theatre. Their mother, Zainab Bibi, told the BBC she was delighted to be taking them back to the rest of their family. ""The girls are doing very well. Marwa has made good progress and only needs a little support,"" she said. ""We will keep an eye on Safa and take good care of her. God willing, both will start walking."" Conjoined twins are rare, and of these only one set in 20 are born joined at the head, with a fused skull - what's known as craniopagus twins. The vast majority do not survive beyond childhood. A team of 100 people at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) was involved in their care. This video can not be played How doctors separated twins joined at the head The twins were separated in February 2019, and since then have been living with their mother and uncle in London. All their medical and other costs - more than Â£1 million - were paid for by a private donor, Pakistani businessman Murtaza Lakhani. The battle to separate Safa and Marwa The girls, now aged three and a half, have had regular physical therapy, to try to help them with their mobility. Both have learning difficulties. Their mother regards the surgical team as heroes and says her seven other children back in Pakistan are eager to help care for Safa and Marwa. The lead surgeon Owase Jeelani said he and the team were ""very pleased"" for the family. Safa and Marwa have returned with their mother to live with the rest of the family in Pakistan But he told the BBC he still had some misgivings about the outcome. ""I feel Marwa has done really well and carries on making great progress. When I look at the whole family, yes, it was probably the right thing to do, but for Safa as an individual I'm not so sure."" Mr Jeelani, a hugely experienced neurosurgeon, is still troubled by the near-impossible choice he and his team had to make in theatre. The twins had a labyrinth of shared blood vessels which nourished both their brains. Only one twin could receive some of the key blood vessels. These were given to Marwa, who was the weaker twin. But as a result, Safa had a stroke. She now has permanent damage to her brain and may never walk. Mr Jeelani said he would probably always be troubled by this: ""It's a decision that I made as a surgeon. It's one that we made as a team. It's a decision we have to live with."" He believes the outcome for Safa and Marwa would probably have been better had they been separated earlier. It took several months to raise the funds needed to pay for the surgical and other costs. This prompted Mr Jeelani and fellow surgeon Prof David Dunaway to set up a charityGemini Untwined,external, to try to raise awareness and funds to cover the costs of separating craniopagus twins. In January 2020, the same surgical team at GOSH successfully separated twin boys from Turkey who were joined at the head. This video can not be played Ritaj and Rital were born joined at the head, and were successfully separated Yigit and Derman Evrensel also underwent three operations, but the process was much faster than with Safa and Marwa.

"Geek Retreat recently opened new stores in Northwich and Chelmsford From online fashion to grocery, only a handful of sectors have bucked the coronavirus downturn, and now it seems comics and gaming have joined the list. Geek Retreat - which specialises in ""all things geeky"" including comics, memorabilia and table top games - says it will open another 100 stores over the next two years, at a time when the UK High Street is under pressure. The Scottish firm currently has 14 UK sites, which combine retail space with cafes and areas to play games and hold events. It said its Covid-safe plan would create around 600 new jobs. ""During the pandemic, while our gaming events have had to stop and the hospitality side of our business is more difficult, our stores still have loyal communities who support our retail side,"" Geek Retreat boss Peter Dobson told the BBC. ""We have made sure all of our stores are welcoming and accessible to gamers whatever their interests, providing a place for our loyal customers to get out of the house and play safely post-lockdown."" Geek Retreat boss Peter Dobson says the games and hobby sector is expanding Countless High Street businesses had to close temporarily during lockdown, and many remain under pressure as shoppers minimise social contact. However, Mr Dobson said Geek Retreat was benefitting from the growth of the wider games and hobby sector which isvalued at Â£8bn a year in the UK,externaland predicted to expand by 3% in 2020.

The 17-day lockdown - beginning on Friday at 18:00 BST - was announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford earlier today. Responding to the announcement, Mr Price said: ""A firebreak is a last resort and should only be used in an emergency. We are now in an emergency. ""The time the firebreak buys us must be used to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system in Wales, which means we can prevent being in the position we're currently in where the case numbers have risen to the point where they can overwhelm an already exhausted NHS. ""We also need to ensure the safeguarding of workplaces, and that sufficient financial support is available for businesses and their employees who will be directly impacted by this firebreak."" Poland has begun constructing a field hospital at a football stadium in the capital, Warsaw. Works at the PGE Narodowy stadium began on Saturday, the prime minister's office announced in a tweet on Monday morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said the field hospital would have a capacity of 500 beds. Other temporary facilities are being built elsewhere in the country. The announcement came as the number of daily cases in Poland reached a record high on Saturday, with 9,622 infections.The country has recorded more than 180,000 cases and 3,614 deaths since the pandemic began. âIf the number of cases increases at this pace, you must be aware that next week we can have 15,000 to 20,000 infections a day,â the health minister told a news conference. If you're just joining our coverage, here's a reminder of today's top US coronavirus stories: Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been seen travelling in his chauffeur-driven car without wearing a mask - against the advice of No 10. Members of the public face fines of Â£200 if they fail to wear a covering in taxis or private hire cars. There is an exemption for chauffeur-driven cars, but Downing Street said it had advised all its ministers to wear coverings. A No 10 spokesman said there were masks available in all ministerial cars. The BBC has contacted Mr Hancock's office for comment. Read the full story here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock insists the government is delivering ""more testing capacity"". He tells Jonathan Ashworth that ""batch testing"" is currently being trialled, and says funds have been given to local authorities to fund local contact tracing ""everywhere"". The health secretary also says the government is delivering ""more economic support"" and ""working with local authorities to deliver the local approach that is needed"". He urges the shadow health secretary to ""acknowledge and support"" the government's work. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asks Matt Hancock whether it is still the plan for there to be millions of tests a day. ""Results still aren't turned around in 24 hours,"" he says. ""When will they be turned around in 24 hours?"" ""The country is facing further restrictions because test and trace failed,"" he adds. Local health teams should be funded to do contact tracing, he says. Mr Ashworth calls for a short period of national lockdown - a so-called circuit-breaker - and asks whether it has been completely ruled out. ""The cost of delay could be a deeper, longer, fuller lockdown,"" he says. The health secretary then gives 

update on testing. He says the UK is now doing more than 300,000 tests a day, and that the government has now opened more than 500 tests sites, including new walk-in centres in Edinburgh, Dundee and Newcastle. Matt Hancock also talks about new technologies, including tests that can produce results as ""quickly as in 15 minutes"". He says they will be made available locally - starting with very high alert level regions. ""These tests have shown real promise and we are both buying them now and ramping up our ability to produce them in the UK,"" he says. Finally, the health secretary notes that ministers have ""laid regulations to support our roll out for both the flu and any Covid vaccination"". ""While no vaccine technology is certain we must be prepared to deploy a vaccine as soon as one is safely available,"" he says. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'We must have resolve' Quoting the WHO, Mr Hancock says it is ""unethical"" to let the virus grow. He says infection rates in Lancashire are ""among the highest in the country"" and continuing to rise, with hospital admissions doubling almost every fortnight. That is why, he adds, Lancashire has been moved to the highest tier of Covid restrictions.  This video can not be played Hancock: 'Lancashire cases doubling every fortnight' Mr Hancock explains why ""rapid action"" was taken in Lancashire, which has moved into the highest tier - tier three. ""I'm sure that the willingness to put politics aside in the national interest... will save lives and protect livelihoods."" He says ""talks are continuing this afternoon"" with Greater Manchester and this week further discussions are planned with other areas including South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Teesside. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There is frustration on the Greater Manchester side after the meeting with Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick today. Greater Manchester side says there were discussions about a hardship fund this morning that could have been used to support low-paid staff out of work because of Tier 3 restrictions - by this afternoon, that offer seemed to have gone. Greater Manchester and the Treasury had been talking about how cash could stack up for that kind of scheme - ministers determined not to open up national furlough, but extra cash, perhaps Â£15m, could have been used locally on the ground. At this afternoon's meeting, Greater Manchester sources say it felt like ministers ended conversations abruptly and just weren't interested in trying to get agreement. Sources said ""it was surreal"". Meeting ended with no conclusion and ministers saying they'd have to go back to No 10. Suspicion on Greater Manchester side now that government intent on imposing restrictions - will be interesting to see what Westminster side has to say in next few hours about progress - or lack of. The UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has started speaking in the House of Commons. He's making a statement to MPs about coronavirus. He says deaths have tragically doubled in the last 12 days. The situation remains perilous, he says. Cases continue to rise among the over 60s, he says. ""I'm very worried that the cases per 100,000 among the over 60s is 401 in the Liverpool City Region"" - and in Greater Manchester is now 283. He says the government has agreed cross-party measures in Liverpool and Lancashire and ""is still working hard"" to agree in Manchester. ""I know that this is difficult and I know that this is relentless but we must have resolve,"" he says. Your Questions Answered We've been answering more of your questions about what new regulations in place across the UK mean for you. They include one from a reader who lives in a tier two area who wants to know if they can have dinner with their sister at a tier one restaurant, indoors. The answer is no, as you can't mix with anyone indoors if you live in a tier two area, as it's under high alert. You can meet outside though, as long as there aren't more than six of you. There are also questions on whether you can stay at a partner's house if you live in areas under different regulations (in short - it depends where you live, whether you have formed a bubble and whether there's childcare to take into consideration), and on the job support scheme.

The German government is investing â¬500m (Â£452m; $488m) in improving ventilation systems in public buildings to help stop the spread of coronavirus. The grants will go to improve the air circulation in public offices, museums, theatres, universities and schools. Private firms are not yet eligible. Viruses spread on tiny droplets called aerosols, exhaled by infected people - especially when they sneeze or cough. Studies suggest they can remain in a room's air for at least eight minutes. Colder weather puts more people at risk because they spend more time indoors. The aim is mainly to upgrade existing air conditioning systems, rather than install new ones, which would cost more. The infection rate has risen across Germany in recent weeks, but the surge is less marked than in some neighbouring countries, notably the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and France. Find out more about the scheme here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give a statement relating to Covid-19 in the House of Commons shortly. It is not known what will be announced, but it comes amid ongoing negotiations between Greater Manchester and central government over moving the region to the highest tier of restrictions. A further 18,804 confirmed cases of the virushave been announced by the UK government.,externalIt brings the total number of cases in the UK to 741,212. There have also been 80 new deaths, the government said. Of those deaths, 72 were in England, six in Northern Ireland, one in Wales and one in Scotland.

"This video can not be played Michael Gove: Not reaching a trade deal with the EU is an âoutcome for which we are increasingly well preparedâ. The EU has said it is willing to ""intensify"" talks on a trade deal with the UK this week to try to break the impasse between the two sides. Its negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc was prepared to discuss all areas of disagreement, including fishing and competition, based on legal texts. Michael Gove said he welcomed the bloc's latest ""constructive"" step. Later, No 10 said there was ""no basis to resume talks"" unless there was a ""fundamental change"" from the EU. The UK has accused the EU of dragging its feet and failing to respect its sovereignty in the negotiations. In a Commons statement, Cabinet Office Minister Mr Gove said his ""door was not closed"" to further talks but the EU needed to change its position for the process to continue. After a call between Mr Barnier and the UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, Downing Street released a statement saying the EU needed to try to find an agreement ""between sovereign equals"". Anglican leaders issue Brexit bill warning Firms urged to get ready for new EU relationship On Friday, No 10 suggested formal negotiations were ""over"" as the EU was not serious about discussing the details of a free trade agreement similar to the one it has with Canada - the UK's preferred outcome. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK should ""get ready"" to trade with the EU from 1 January, when it leaves the single market and customs union, without a specific agreement. But following a video call with his UK counterpart Lord Frost on Monday, Mr Barnier said he was willing to accelerate the process in the coming days to try to bridge the gap between the two sides.

Mr Barnier suggested all subjects would be on the table and the discussions would be based on specific legal texts, which the UK has accused the EU of refusing to consider in recent weeks. In response, Lord Frost tweeted that the proposal to intensify work had been noted, and added: ""But the EU still needs to make a fundamental change in approach to the talks and make clear it has done so.""

Updating MPs on the state of the talks, Mr Gove said the EU's latest move was a positive one and suggested the UK would respond in kind. He said: ""Even while I have been at the despatch box, it has been reported that there has been a constructive move on the part of the EU and I welcome that. ""We need to make sure we work on the basis of the intensification they propose and I prefer to look forward in optimism rather than look back in anger."" He added: ""If there has been movement, and there seems to be movement, then no-one would welcome it more than me but what we can't have from the EU is the illusion of engagement without the reality of compromise."" Some senior Conservatives have urged the government to walk away from the talks, suggesting the EU is no longer negotiating in ""good faith"". Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the EU's ""refusal"" to engage in meaningful talks on trade in financial services and agricultural products was a breach of the terms of the withdrawal agreement governing the UK's exit. The government has said the UK will prosper whatever the outcome of the negotiations, as it will be able to exercise freedoms not available while being an EU member. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves calls on the government to be âhonestâ about the effect of the UK not reaching a trade deal with the EU. But business groups have warned the UK's fallback option of a so-called ""Australian-style"" arrangement - where UK-EU trade will default to World Trade Organization rules - would be disastrous as it would see tariffs on goods moving across the channel. With less than 75 days to go before the transition period ends on 31 December, the government has urgedbusiness to step up its preparationsfor the looming changes to trading rules. The PM will hold a meeting with industry groups on Tuesday to emphasise the need for action. Labour has said the government only has itself to blame for the current uncertainty, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves calling on ministers to be ""honest"" about the effect on the UK of not agreeing a trade deal. And former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May suggested the implications of failing to agree a future partnership would also be highly damaging for the UK's security. This video can not be played Brexit: Theresa May seems unimpressed with Michael Gove's plan Mrs May, who quit last year after Parliament rejected her withdrawal agreement three times, said the UK ""should not be resigned"" to the prospect of failing to agree a deal over law enforcement and information sharing. She warned that ""if the UK walks away with no deal, then our police and law enforcement agencies will no longer have the necessary access to databases in order to be able to continue to identify and catch criminals and potential terrorists in order to keep us safe"". In response, Mr Gove said ""significant progress"" had been made in terms of security co-operation but the EU could not make access to databases conditional on the UK accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.

"On a call with campaign staff, President Trump dismissed Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, as a ""disaster"" Early voting for the US election kicked off in the battleground state of Florida Donald Trump hit the campaign trail hard at the weekend, and is now in Arizona Joe Biden - who has a significant lead in most national polls - is prepping for the last presidential debate on Thursday A record 29m nationwide ballots have been cast ahead of election day on 3 November, as the US remains gripped by Covid-19 Today - in between the news and views - we focused on Explaining the Election Edited by Boer Deng Most polls have closed on a busy first day of early voting in Florida, and our live page will do the same. With just two weeks left until the 3 November 2020 US presidential election, candidates are scrambling to deliver their final pitches to voters - and are making plenty of news on the campaign trail as they do. Here are some of the key events from Monday:  We'll be back tomorrow with the latest campaign news and analysis. Monday's live page was brought to you by Matthew Davis, Boer Deng, Sophie Williams, Max Matza, Ritu Prasad and Holly Honderich. Their man may be behind in the national polls, but Republicans see hope in rising voter registrations in three key states that could yet yield the re-election of President Trump come November. Though registered Democrats still outnumber registered Republicans in Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, data has shown that the gap has narrowed since 2016. The Democratic advantage in Florida and Pennsylvania has shrunk by about 200,000 voters and in North Carolina by more than 230,000 voters. US presidential elections are not won by overall popularity but by having the right number of votes in the right places. Trump won all three states in 2016 in part because voters turned out for him and not for his rival. If registration is a measure of enthusiasm, Republicans may yet have reason to believe voters will turn out for Trump again. For this history-making election, Americans are going to the polls in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. The pandemic's impact on the economy has hit young people disproportionately hard - a strain that is expected to leave a mark on their politics, possibly widening the gap with older, more conservative Americans. Research has found that people hit by economic downturns during their formative years are more likely to favour redistributive policies and attribute success to luck rather than hard work - and that will influence how they vote. Read the stories of the young Americans struggling in the 2020 economy. Holly HonderichBBC News, Washington DC Democratic candidate Joe Biden seems to have cornered at least one constituency - celebrities. Taylor Swift, Madonna, Cardi B, Tom Hanks and George Clooney have all thrown their support behind the Democratic ticket. In an editorial for V magazine, Taylor Swift urged fans to vote for Mr Biden and Ms Harris, and promptly shared the endorsement with her 140 million Instagram followers. And Dwayne Johnson - a self-described independent and now the most-followed American man on Instagram - made his first-ever endorsement, saying in a video that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are ""the best choice to lead our country"". This summer's Democratic National Convention, too, featured a parade of Oscar winners, musicians and professional athletes - an apparent contrast to the Republican convention the following week. There, the president himself was the biggest celebrity in attendance. But does all this matter?Read the full story here. While on the campaign trail this morning, Trump spoke to reporters about his recent brush with Covid-19, which landed the president in hospital for several days at the beginning of the month. Asked whether he would authorise his doctors to release information on when his most recent negative test was, he had this to say: This video can not be played Donald Trump: 'I'm immune, they say' Postal votes! Swing states! The Electoral College! There sure is alot of jargon associated with US elections - and details of how things work that even many American voters are unclear about. If you need a refresher,here's our really simple guide. Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris turned up at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville this afternoon to kick off early voting in the state, which began today. ""The voters of Florida, you guys are going to determine the outcome of this election,"" the California senator said. ""You [all] are going to have an impact on people you'll never meet"" Harris brought out familiar lines of attack against President Trump - saying he failed to act even when he knew of the severity of the coronavirus outbreak - and touted her running mate, who is preparing for Thursday night's debate, leaving the campaigning up to her. ""This is the difference between a Donald Trump and Joe Biden,"" she said. ""We know that the strength of our democracy is the strength within our people."" Harris has returned to the campaign trail following a brief pause after two aides tested positive for coronavirus last week.  Ritu PrasadBBC News writer The US Supreme Court is in the spotlight for voters this year for many reasons. One of the top issues is healthcare. On 10 November, the court will consider a case on a popular Obama-era public healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. Out of the 23 million Americans who are currently insured by the ACA or Medicaid, another public health option, 21 million could lose their insurance if the law is overturned. Down the road, more could drop their plans if a lack of federal subsidies sends insurance prices sky-high. As one young voter told me: ""They can debate and turn this into a political issue all they want, but it's not political when you see your mom in a hospital bed."" And the backdrop to all this - a global pandemic that's affected more than 7.5 million Americans. Read the stories of four US patients whose lives could change if the ACA is overturned here.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doing some gaming to get out the vote. The lawmaker has asked her Twitter followers if they wanted to join her for an online session of Among Us - a murder mystery style game - on Twitch, the video games-streaming platform. The digital invite from 'AOC', a 31-year-old millennial, is among a growing number of attempts to reach young voters on social platforms. Instagram has been flooded in recent days with celebrities posting their ""I Voted"" selfies, and stars of TikTok - which launched an in-app voting guide - are also making their political inclinations known. It remains to be seen whether these new get out the vote strategies will work. Young people have a historically bad track record for turning out on election day. If Joe Biden and Donald Trump agree on anything, it's that this year's election is an important one. It's also happening under unprecedented circumstances. Americans will cast their ballots as the country struggles against the coronavirus outbreak. As a result, more Americans are voting by post than ever before. An estimated80 million ballotswill be cast by mail this year as states aim to prevent gatherings to limit the spread of coronavirus. That means delays. Postal ballots need extra time to be delivered, and they also take longer to count once they have arrived. So though we'll see votes returned on election day - 3 November - don't expect final results until days after. Read more about what a delayed result could look like. With the coronavirus pandemic, the political theatre looks a little different this year. At rallies for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, supporters maintain a social distance, and drive through in their cars. And at Trump events, where masks are less common, supporters undergo temperature checks before entry. A government watchdog will investigate alleged ""political interference"" from the White House at the Centers for Disease Control and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at the behest of several Democratic lawmakers. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) said on Monday it would look into whether the administration ""violated the agencies' scientific integrity and communication policies"". The inquiry was requested by Senators Elizabeth Warren, Patty Murray and Gary Peters. There have been reports of administration officials trying to pressure the agencies into changing guidance to match the president's assessment that the US has beaten Covid-19. Trump has often dismissed health officials (most recently Dr Fauci) and their recommendations as overly cautious. He insisted that the FDA authorisethe drug hydroxychloroquineto treat Covid-19, despite divided evidence on efficacy. The GAO is an independent agency that takes on such inquiries for Congress. More than 245 million Americans are eligible to vote this year, But only a small percentage of them will actually determine who the next president is. So who are they and where do they live? This video can not be played Who really decides the US election? After criticising the country's top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci this morning, President Trump doubled down on the denunciation at a campaign rally this afternoon in Arizona. The president then turned to his rival, Joe Biden, saying that the Democrat ""wants to listen to Dr Fauci"". Fauci has served as the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, and has become one of the most visible figures in the governmentâs coronavirus response. But Biden doesn't seem to mind the association with Dr Fauci. He retweeted the president's remarks with a simple ""yes"". Fauci has served under six US presidents - both Democrats and Republicans - and he knows a bit about the rough and tumble politics of Washington. Over his five decades as a medical researcher, he has seen his effigy burnt, heard the cries of protesters calling him a ""murderer"", and had smoke bombs thrown outside his office window.

Melania Trump rarely campaigns First Lady Melania Trump is expected to join her husband at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night. It's not rare for a political spouse to make campaign stops, but it is rare for Melania - this will mark her first in-person campaign appearance in more than a year, aside from the Republican National Convention in August. She was also ill with Covid-19 earlier this month. As far as campaign events go, she'll have some stiff competition. Also tomorrow, the Democratic vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris will be joined by some Marvel superheroes. The California Senator will be flanked by some of the actors who play members of the Avengers squad: Chris Evans, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Rudd, Mark Ruffalo and Zoe Saldana. The Hulk turns up to campaign Today is the first day of early voting in Florida, a crucial swing state, and those turning up are trending younger, according to preliminary data from liberal analyst group Catalist. Of course, especially in Florida, which is known for its elderly population, younger means under-65. So far, the under-65s account for around half of the cast ballots - a 12 point rise from 2016, CNN reports. As early voting kicked off today, some 2.5m residents of the Sunshine State had already sent in their votes by mail. According to the Tampa Bay Times, that's close to the total number cast in the 2018 midterm election. During the August primary elections, Floridians overwhelmingly opted to vote by mail. But so far, there's been a lot of enthusiasm at the polls. Check out a timelapse below, captured by a CBS News reporter in Miami earlier this morning, of voter lines at the public library despite the soggy morning. Allow Twitter content?

With just over two weeks left until election day - and a record 29m votes already cast nationwide, the candidates are scrambling to make their last pitches to voters across the country. Who is ahead in the polls - and does it matter? Here, we break down all the most recent key data. Abdul âRabâ Razzak is a palliative care specialist born in Bangladesh and raised in New Jersey. He enthusiastically supports Joe Biden. ""Biden and Harris have shown they will listen and allow experts to speak freely about the reality of Covid-19 and climate change, as well as other issues. They show integrity and humility. They demonstrate what true servant leadership is - helping lift people that they serve."" Rab is a member of our US election voter panel. You'll hear more from him, and many of our other voters, throughout the week. Join the conversation: President Donald Trump is in Prescott, Arizona, for the first of two rallies in the state today. Trump won Arizona in 2016, but is trailing behind his rival Joe Biden in recent polls. ""How can you be three points up when we have crowds like this?"" Trump says, addressing Biden's poll lead. Attacking his rival, Trump tells supporters they have ""a choice between the American dream and a socialist nightmare"". Biden, he says, will ""massively"" raise taxes, and impose costly regulation. At points, the crowd responds with chants of ""lock him up!"". Trump also laments his loss in support from suburban women. ""I like women, I like women,"" he says. Joe Bidenâs campaign has accused Trump of âreckless
and negligent leadership âfollowing his
attacks on scientists and medical experts in recent days. In a campaign conference call on Monday, Trump branded Dr
Anthony Fauci âa disasterâ and suggested that other top infectious disease scientists were âidiotsâ. Trump also mocked Biden for
following the science during a rally on Sunday. âScience [is] the best tool we have to keep
Americans safe, while Trumpâs reckless and negligent leadership threatens to
put more lives at risk,"" the Biden campaign said. The former vice-president later added that the line dismissing his focus on science was not an attack but a 'badge of honour'. Â© 2025 BBC.

Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said the field hospital would have a capacity of 500 beds. Other temporary facilities are being built elsewhere in the country. The announcement came as the number of daily cases in Poland reached a record high on Saturday, with 9,622 infections.The country has recorded more than 180,000 cases and 3,614 deaths since the pandemic began. âIf the number of cases increases at this pace, you must be aware that next week we can have 15,000 to 20,000 infections a day,â the health minister told a news conference. If you're just joining our coverage, here's a reminder of today's top US coronavirus stories: Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been seen travelling in his chauffeur-driven car without wearing a mask - against the advice of No 10. Members of the public face fines of Â£200 if they fail to wear a covering in taxis or private hire cars. There is an exemption for chauffeur-driven cars, but Downing Street said it had advised all its ministers to wear coverings. A No 10 spokesman said there were masks available in all ministerial cars. The BBC has contacted Mr Hancock's office for comment. Read the full story here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock insists the government is delivering ""more testing capacity"". He tells Jonathan Ashworth that ""batch testing"" is currently being trialled, and says funds have been given to local authorities to fund local contact tracing ""everywhere"". The health secretary also says the government is delivering ""more economic support"" and ""working with local authorities to deliver the local approach that is needed"". He urges the shadow health secretary to ""acknowledge and support"" the government's work. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asks Matt Hancock whether it is still the plan for there to be millions of tests a day. ""Results still aren't turned around in 24 hours,"" he says. ""When will they be turned around in 24 hours?"" ""The country is facing further restrictions because test and trace failed,"" he adds. Local health teams should be funded to do contact tracing, he says. Mr Ashworth calls for a short period of national lockdown - a so-called circuit-breaker - and asks whether it has been completely ruled out. ""The cost of delay could be a deeper, longer, fuller lockdown,"" he says. The health secretary then gives 

update on testing. He says the UK is now doing more than 300,000 tests a day, and that the government has now opened more than 500 tests sites, including new walk-in centres in Edinburgh, Dundee and Newcastle. Matt Hancock also talks about new technologies, including tests that can produce results as ""quickly as in 15 minutes"". He says they will be made available locally - starting with very high alert level regions. ""These tests have shown real promise and we are both buying them now and ramping up our ability to produce them in the UK,"" he says. Finally, the health secretary notes that ministers have ""laid regulations to support our roll out for both the flu and any Covid vaccination"". ""While no vaccine technology is certain we must be prepared to deploy a vaccine as soon as one is safely available,"" he says. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'We must have resolve' Quoting the WHO, Mr Hancock says it is ""unethical"" to let the virus grow. He says infection rates in Lancashire are ""among the highest in the country"" and continuing to rise, with hospital admissions doubling almost every fortnight. That is why, he adds, Lancashire has been moved to the highest tier of Covid restrictions.  This video can not be played Hancock: 'Lancashire cases doubling every fortnight' Mr Hancock explains why ""rapid action"" was taken in Lancashire, which has moved into the highest tier - tier three. ""I'm sure that the willingness to put politics aside in the national interest... will save lives and protect livelihoods."" He says ""talks are continuing this afternoon"" with Greater Manchester and this week further discussions are planned with other areas including South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Teesside. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There is frustration on the Greater Manchester side after the meeting with Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick today. Greater Manchester side says there were discussions about a hardship fund this morning that could have been used to support low-paid staff out of work because of Tier 3 restrictions - by this afternoon, that offer seemed to have gone. Greater Manchester and the Treasury had been talking about how cash could stack up for that kind of scheme - ministers determined not to open up national furlough, but extra cash, perhaps Â£15m, could have been used locally on the ground. At this afternoon's meeting, Greater Manchester sources say it felt like ministers ended conversations abruptly and just weren't interested in trying to get agreement. Sources said ""it was surreal"". Meeting ended with no conclusion and ministers saying they'd have to go back to No 10. Suspicion on Greater Manchester side now that government intent on imposing restrictions - will be interesting to see what Westminster side has to say in next few hours about progress - or lack of. The UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has started speaking in the House of Commons. He's making a statement to MPs about coronavirus. He says deaths have tragically doubled in the last 12 days. The situation remains perilous, he says. Cases continue to rise among the over 60s, he says. ""I'm very worried that the cases per 100,000 among the over 60s is 401 in the Liverpool City Region"" - and in Greater Manchester is now 283. He says the government has agreed cross-party measures in Liverpool and Lancashire and ""is still working hard"" to agree in Manchester. ""I know that this is difficult and I know that this is relentless but we must have resolve,"" he says. Your Questions Answered We've been answering more of your questions about what new regulations in place across the UK mean for you. They include one from a reader who lives in a tier two area who wants to know if they can have dinner with their sister at a tier one restaurant, indoors. The answer is no, as you can't mix with anyone indoors if you live in a tier two area, as it's under high alert. You can meet outside though, as long as there aren't more than six of you. There are also questions on whether you can stay at a partner's house if you live in areas under different regulations (in short - it depends where you live, whether you have formed a bubble and whether there's childcare to take into consideration), and on the job support scheme.

The German government is investing â¬500m (Â£452m; $488m) in improving ventilation systems in public buildings to help stop the spread of coronavirus. The grants will go to improve the air circulation in public offices, museums, theatres, universities and schools. Private firms are not yet eligible. Viruses spread on tiny droplets called aerosols, exhaled by infected people - especially when they sneeze or cough. Studies suggest they can remain in a room's air for at least eight minutes. Colder weather puts more people at risk because they spend more time indoors. The aim is mainly to upgrade existing air conditioning systems, rather than install new ones, which would cost more. The infection rate has risen across Germany in recent weeks, but the surge is less marked than in some neighbouring countries, notably the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and France. Find out more about the scheme here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give a statement relating to Covid-19 in the House of Commons shortly. It is not known what will be announced, but it comes amid ongoing negotiations between Greater Manchester and central government over moving the region to the highest tier of restrictions. A further 18,804 confirmed cases of the virushave been announced by the UK government.,externalIt brings the total number of cases in the UK to 741,212. There have also been 80 new deaths, the government said. Of those deaths, 72 were in England, six in Northern Ireland, one in Wales and one in Scotland.

"A meeting between ministers and local leaders about Greater Manchester's Covid restrictions has ended without agreement. Local leaders want better financial support for workers before any move to the top tier of rules, which would force some businesses to close. The communities secretary has said local leaders have a deadline of noon on Tuesday to reach a deal. It comes as the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths. Following the meeting, Greater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC: ""The government could have a deal if it better protects low-paid people. It is choosing not to do that."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday thathe might ""need to intervene""if local leaders did not accept a move to tier three - the highest level of England's coronavirus restrictions. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons further discussions were planned with leaders in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside about restrictions in these areas. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle What is a circuit-breaker? There are conflicting reports about Monday afternoon's meeting between Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick and local leaders in Greater Manchester, which one source on the call said ended ""abruptly"". In a joint statement, Mr Burnham and the Labour leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese said: ""We had been encouraged by earlier discussions at an official level where the idea of a hardship fund, to top up furlough payments and support the self-employed, had been tabled by the government. ""It was both surprising and disappointing when this idea was taken off the table by the secretary of state."" But a spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said that while it was ""disappointing"" no agreement had been reached, Mr Burnham was ""incorrect in claiming that officials made this proposal today"". A key sticking point of the dispute is that Mr Burnham wants the government to reintroduce the 80% furlough scheme used during the UK's first lockdown, instead ofthe new Job Support Schemewhich covers 67% of the wages of people affected by tier three closures. This evening, the two sides can't even agree on what they actually discussed earlier. Believe the local leaders and this morning there seemed to be hope in the air. Officials from central government had mooted the possibility of a hardship fund to help support low-paid workers who stand to lose out if businesses close their doors under tighter restrictions. The message local leaders took from their meeting was that, while the Treasury is adamant they are not going to extend their national furlough scheme that has supported millions of wages any further - nor increase the level of cash available from its replacement, the Job Support Scheme - Westminster might sign off extra money that could be spent that way, if local politicians saw fit. There was no concrete agreement on the numbers, but sources in Greater Manchester suggest the cost of supporting those who need the extra help comes in at around Â£15m a month. After that call, the consensus among North West leaders was moving in the direction of signing on the dotted line, with another call planned with Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick for the afternoon. But rather than ushering in a new spirit of co-operation, that meeting went south. Read more from Laura. Meanwhile, people in Wales will be told from Friday to stay at home, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. It comes asa two-week school closure begins in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions. Scotland continues to draw up plans for a three-tier framework of measures, similar to England's. The prime minister's official spokesman said that in Greater Manchester the number of new cases in people over the age of 60 had tripled in the most recent 15 days of full data - from 89 cases per 100,000 on 27 September to 282 per 100,000 on 12 October. He said government projections suggested coronavirus patients would take up the entire current intensive care capacity in Greater Manchester by 8 November, not including capacity in Nightingale hospitals. However, Prof Jane Eddleston, the region's medical lead for the coronavirus response, said Greater Manchester's intensive care capacity was not at risk of being overwhelmed. Prof Eddleston said the situation was ""serious"" but despite the ""stark"" figures on hospital admissions and cases, extra capacity would be available. In their joint statement, Mr Burnham and Sir Richard said Greater Manchester's intensive care unit occupancy rate was ""not abnormal for this time of year"" and it was ""essential... public fears are not raised unnecessarily"". There is a blizzard of numbers flying around about Greater Manchester, and the North West more widely, as national and local politicians argue about whether to introduce local restrictions. But a curious element that seems to have been missed is that the rise in cases may have already stalled. The last few days show no rise in the average number of new infections across the North West, while Manchester itself may actually be seeing cases fall after peaking at more than 500 a day on average at the end of September. This will take some time to filter through into hospital cases as the people who are ill enough to be admitted to hospital have been infected a few weeks before. But already there are signs the rises in hospital admissions are slowing. That's not to say hospitals and intensive care in particular is not busy. The pressures are akin to what the NHS would normally see in the peak of winter and, of course, it's only October. But talk of units becoming overwhelmed when they have not even really dipped into their ""surge capacity"", transforming other parts of the hospital into temporary intensive care wards, seems somewhat premature. What happens in the coming weeks though will be crucial. Earlier, Mr Jenrick indicated that Greater Manchester could be offered a financial package similar to the ""tens of millions"" of pounds of support agreed forLancashireandthe Liverpool City Region,external- the two parts of England already in tier three. Nottingham's Labour council leader David Mellenhas also called for more support for businesses in the city if it is moved to tier three.

"The Transport Secretary says he is ""very hopeful"" a new testing regime for travellers to the UK can be in place by 1 December, reducing the amount of time people need to spend in quarantine. Grant Shapps said it could happen as long as there was enough testing capacity to support the plan. The government has been consulting on a system where passengers would be tested after just a week of isolation. But BA's new boss wants testing before departure, not quarantine on arrival. Addressing an online aviation conference, Mr Shapps said the government was looking at introducing a virus test alongside a shortened quarantine period by early December. ""My ministerial colleagues and I have agreed a regime, based on a single test provided by the private sector and at the cost to the passenger, after a period of self-isolation,"" he said. ""It will mean a single test for international arrivals, a week after arrival."" 'Hundreds of thousands' of airline jobs at risk Virgin Atlantic to cut 1,150 more jobs The government's travel taskforce, which is working on the plans, will put its recommendations before the prime minister in November, Mr Shapps said. The idea is to reduce the amount of time travellers coming into the UK have to spend self-isolating - currently 14 days for those arriving from areas not included on the government's list of ""travel corridors"". The government's approach may be designed to protect public health, but is unlikely to win it many friends in the aviation industry. Just before Grant Shapps spoke, and at the same event, British Airways' new boss Sean Doyle used his first major public appearance since his appointment to argue for a ""fundamental rethink"" of the UK's approach to flying during the pandemic. It was time, he said, to replace the current quarantine regime with a ""reliable and affordable"" test taken before flying. People within the sector blame the current restrictions for killing off hopes of a strong revival in the sector, after the lockdown earlier this year. The prospect of spending two weeks in isolation, they say, is simply deterring people from travelling. Ryanair plans to operate at 40% of its normal capacity this winter, while Easyjet will have just 25% capacity. Mr Doyle suggested that even a reduction in the quarantine period to seven days would not be enough to change matters. But Mr Shapps made it clear the government will press on with its own plans. Speaking at the same conference, British Airways' new boss Sean Doyle emphasised his objections to the current system. ""We need to get the economy moving again and this just isn't possible when you're asking people to quarantine for 14 days,"" said Mr Doyle, a week after he replaced Alex Cruz as chief executive of the airline. However, he said that even if quarantine was reduced to seven days, demand for travel would remain low, and called for tests before departure. ""People won't travel here and the UK will get left behind,"" Mr Doyle said. Mr Shapps said the government was in talks with the US about trialling pre-departure tests, but no agreement has been reached yet. British Airways is currently slashing thousands of jobs amid a slump in demand for air travel - a pattern seen at other carriers. Some warn there could be hundreds of thousands more cuts unless the sector gets additional government support. The International Air Transport Association has downgraded its 2020 traffic forecasts, after ""a dismal end to the summer travel season"". The association, which represents 290 airlines, estimates that it will be at least 2024 before air traffic reaches pre-pandemic levels.

"Local leaders say more financial support is needed for Greater Manchester's businesses if tighter restrictions are to be imposed Further delays to a decision on Greater Manchester's Covid restrictions will ""put people's lives at risk"", the communities secretary has said. Robert Jenrick said he hoped he could reach an agreement with the region's MPs ""in the next day or two"". Local leaders want better financial support before agreeing to a move to the top tier of rules, which would force some businesses to close. Talks are continuing after a weekend of discussions. Mr Jenrick indicated that Greater Manchester could be offered a financial package similar to the ""tens of millions"" of pounds of support agreed for Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - the two parts of England already in tier three. A key sticking point of the dispute is that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham wants the government to reintroduce the 80% furlough scheme used during the UK's first lockdown, instead ofthe new Job Support Schemewhich covers 67% of the wages of people affected by tier three closures. Mr Burnham said businesses that would be closed under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions - including pubs, bookmakers and gyms - ""are places where people are on low wages"" and that two-thirds pay is not enough. But Mr Jenrick told BBC Breakfast the Manchester talks had gone on ""too long"" as coronavirus case numbers remain ""seriously high"". ""Delay I'm afraid will only make the situation worse, will only put people's lives at risk, and will only make the economic fallout for the city worse in the long term,"" he added. ""We do now need to take action. I hope that we can reach agreement but one way or another, we need to draw this to a conclusion."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday thathe might ""need to intervene""if local leaders did not accept a move to tier three. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle What is a circuit-breaker? Meanwhile, people in Wales will be told from Friday to stay at home, and pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. It comes asa two-week school closure begins in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. Scotland continues to draw up plans for a three-tier framework of restrictions, similar to England's, to account for regional differences in Covid rates and isolate areas of higher prevalence. On Monday the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. BBC deputy political editor Vicki Young said Treasury sources insisted Greater Manchester would not get a more generous offer on wages than the Job Support Scheme provides, but pointed to other financial support packages agreed with tier three areas. On Sunday, Liverpool City Region's metro mayor Steve Rotheram saidhis area would receive an additional Â£44m,externaland a similar package worth Â£42mwas given to local leaders in Lancashirelast week. Mr Burnhamsaid he had a ""constructive call""with the PM's team on Sunday, but on Monday morning he told Sky News: ""I'm not going to roll over at the sight of a cheque."" Nottingham's Labour council leader David Mellenhas also called for more support for businesses in the city if it is moved to tier three. However, the Labour leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, said the row was not just about money and questioned the effectiveness of ""blanket"" business closures, instead suggesting a shielding programme for those most at risk from Covid-19. And mayors and council leaders in the Liverpool City Region have written to the prime minister asking for an ""immediate review"" of the decision to close gyms and leisure centres in the area as part of tier three measures, pointing out that in Lancashire, which is also in tier three, they have not been required to close. They are calling on the government to provide the scientific evidence supporting the move and if they are unable to do so, allow them to reopen. How are tiers decided for different areas? When an area goes in to tier three - the ""very high alert"" category - this unlocks enhanced financial support from the government. In the Liverpool City Region, some of the funds will be used both to bolster contact tracing, to enhance compliance, and to support people who are clinically extremely vulnerable. This is worth Â£14m - and a similar package in Lancashire is worth Â£12m. But following negotiations, both areas have also been given a further Â£30m in ""business support"". Whitehall sources have told the BBC that Greater Manchester would be offered no less generous terms than Lancashire or Liverpool. On a per capita basis, that could mean potentially Â£70-80m being made available from central government, in return for enhanced restrictions. Talks are also under way between the government and local authority leaders in South Yorkshire. Council leaders want a package of support to include more resources for the NHS in the area - and are clear they won't be ""bounced"" into accepting a move to tier three. Dr Indeewar Kapila, an intensive care consultant in Greater Manchester, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that critical care units have capacity at the moment but Manchester's rate - which was 431 cases per 100,000 in the week to 13 October - was ""extremely high"". The prime minister's official spokesman said in Greater Manchester the number of new cases in people over the age of 60 had tripled in the most recent 15 days of full data - from 89 cases per 100,000 on 27 September to 282 per 100,000 on 12 October. The spokesman said all free intensive care capacity could be used by 28 October and could pass the peak seen in the first wave by 2 November, according to the government's pandemic modelling group, SPI-M. This is based on a ""best-case"" assumption that the number of intensive care patients would take 14 days to double. The projections suggest coronavirus patients would take up the entire current intensive care capacity by 8 November and the entire surge capacity by 12 November. It comes as Greater Manchester MP Yasmin Qureshi, who represents Bolton South East,said she is in hospital with pneumonia two weeks after testing positive for Covid-19. Hospitals in the North West are incredibly busy, but talk of them being overwhelmed with Covid patients is somewhat premature. In the spring the number of admissions across the region went from under 100 a day to over 400 in the space of a week. Cases have been rising much more gradually in recent weeks. In fact there are signs they may have started levelling off at around 200 cases a day. The hospitals in and around Manchester and Liverpool have borne the brunt of the pressures. Particular concern has been expressed about intensive care,with reports that more than 80% of beds in Manchester are occupied,external. That is not unusual - last winter similar occupancy rates were seen. In fact, this is one of the difficulties the NHS faces with Covid - it works so close to capacity in normal times that an extra pressure causes real problems. But again the local NHS is not yet in the position it was in the spring when it had to take emergency measures to open up extra intensive care beds by cancelling non-Covid work.

"A meeting between ministers and local leaders about Greater Manchester's Covid restrictions has ended without agreement. Local leaders want better financial support for workers before any move to the top tier of rules, which would force some businesses to close. The communities secretary has said local leaders have a deadline of noon on Tuesday to reach a deal. It comes as the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths. Following the meeting, Greater Manchester's Labour Mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC: ""The government could have a deal if it better protects low-paid people. It is choosing not to do that."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday thathe might ""need to intervene""if local leaders did not accept a move to tier three - the highest level of England's coronavirus restrictions. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the Commons further discussions were planned with leaders in South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, north-east England and Teesside about restrictions in these areas. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle What is a circuit-breaker? There are conflicting reports about Monday afternoon's meeting between Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick and local leaders in Greater Manchester, which one source on the call said ended ""abruptly"". In a joint statement, Mr Burnham and the Labour leader of Manchester City Council Sir Richard Leese said: ""We had been encouraged by earlier discussions at an official level where the idea of a hardship fund, to top up furlough payments and support the self-employed, had been tabled by the government. ""It was both surprising and disappointing when this idea was taken off the table by the secretary of state."" But a spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said that while it was ""disappointing"" no agreement had been reached, Mr Burnham was ""incorrect in claiming that officials made this proposal today"". A key sticking point of the dispute is that Mr Burnham wants the government to reintroduce the 80% furlough scheme used during the UK's first lockdown, instead ofthe new Job Support Schemewhich covers 67% of the wages of people affected by tier three closures. This evening, the two sides can't even agree on what they actually discussed earlier. Believe the local leaders and this morning there seemed to be hope in the air. Officials from central government had mooted the possibility of a hardship fund to help support low-paid workers who stand to lose out if businesses close their doors under tighter restrictions. The message local leaders took from their meeting was that, while the Treasury is adamant they are not going to extend their national furlough scheme that has supported millions of wages any further - nor increase the level of cash available from its replacement, the Job Support Scheme - Westminster might sign off extra money that could be spent that way, if local politicians saw fit. There was no concrete agreement on the numbers, but sources in Greater Manchester suggest the cost of supporting those who need the extra help comes in at around Â£15m a month. After that call, the consensus among North West leaders was moving in the direction of signing on the dotted line, with another call planned with Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick for the afternoon. But rather than ushering in a new spirit of co-operation, that meeting went south. Read more from Laura. Meanwhile, people in Wales will be told from Friday to stay at home, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. It comes asa two-week school closure begins in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions. Scotland continues to draw up plans for a three-tier framework of measures, similar to England's. The prime minister's official spokesman said that in Greater Manchester the number of new cases in people over the age of 60 had tripled in the most recent 15 days of full data - from 89 cases per 100,000 on 27 September to 282 per 100,000 on 12 October. He said government projections suggested coronavirus patients would take up the entire current intensive care capacity in Greater Manchester by 8 November, not including capacity in Nightingale hospitals. However, Prof Jane Eddleston, the region's medical lead for the coronavirus response, said Greater Manchester's intensive care capacity was not at risk of being overwhelmed. Prof Eddleston said the situation was ""serious"" but despite the ""stark"" figures on hospital admissions and cases, extra capacity would be available. In their joint statement, Mr Burnham and Sir Richard said Greater Manchester's intensive care unit occupancy rate was ""not abnormal for this time of year"" and it was ""essential... public fears are not raised unnecessarily"". There is a blizzard of numbers flying around about Greater Manchester, and the North West more widely, as national and local politicians argue about whether to introduce local restrictions. But a curious element that seems to have been missed is that the rise in cases may have already stalled. The last few days show no rise in the average number of new infections across the North West, while Manchester itself may actually be seeing cases fall after peaking at more than 500 a day on average at the end of September. This will take some time to filter through into hospital cases as the people who are ill enough to be admitted to hospital have been infected a few weeks before. But already there are signs the rises in hospital admissions are slowing. That's not to say hospitals and intensive care in particular is not busy. The pressures are akin to what the NHS would normally see in the peak of winter and, of course, it's only October. But talk of units becoming overwhelmed when they have not even really dipped into their ""surge capacity"", transforming other parts of the hospital into temporary intensive care wards, seems somewhat premature. What happens in the coming weeks though will be crucial. Earlier, Mr Jenrick indicated that Greater Manchester could be offered a financial package similar to the ""tens of millions"" of pounds of support agreed forLancashireandthe Liverpool City Region,external- the two parts of England already in tier three. Nottingham's Labour council leader David Mellenhas also called for more support for businesses in the city if it is moved to tier three.

"The Transport Secretary says he is ""very hopeful"" a new testing regime for travellers to the UK can be in place by 1 December, reducing the amount of time people need to spend in quarantine. Grant Shapps said it could happen as long as there was enough testing capacity to support the plan. The government has been consulting on a system where passengers would be tested after just a week of isolation. But BA's new boss wants testing before departure, not quarantine on arrival. Addressing an online aviation conference, Mr Shapps said the government was looking at introducing a virus test alongside a shortened quarantine period by early December. ""My ministerial colleagues and I have agreed a regime, based on a single test provided by the private sector and at the cost to the passenger, after a period of self-isolation,"" he said. ""It will mean a single test for international arrivals, a week after arrival."" 'Hundreds of thousands' of airline jobs at risk Virgin Atlantic to cut 1,150 more jobs The government's travel taskforce, which is working on the plans, will put its recommendations before the prime minister in November, Mr Shapps said. The idea is to reduce the amount of time travellers coming into the UK have to spend self-isolating - currently 14 days for those arriving from areas not included on the government's list of ""travel corridors"". The government's approach may be designed to protect public health, but is unlikely to win it many friends in the aviation industry. Just before Grant Shapps spoke, and at the same event, British Airways' new boss Sean Doyle used his first major public appearance since his appointment to argue for a ""fundamental rethink"" of the UK's approach to flying during the pandemic. It was time, he said, to replace the current quarantine regime with a ""reliable and affordable"" test taken before flying. People within the sector blame the current restrictions for killing off hopes of a strong revival in the sector, after the lockdown earlier this year. The prospect of spending two weeks in isolation, they say, is simply deterring people from travelling. Ryanair plans to operate at 40% of its normal capacity this winter, while Easyjet will have just 25% capacity. Mr Doyle suggested that even a reduction in the quarantine period to seven days would not be enough to change matters. But Mr Shapps made it clear the government will press on with its own plans. Speaking at the same conference, British Airways' new boss Sean Doyle emphasised his objections to the current system. ""We need to get the economy moving again and this just isn't possible when you're asking people to quarantine for 14 days,"" said Mr Doyle, a week after he replaced Alex Cruz as chief executive of the airline. However, he said that even if quarantine was reduced to seven days, demand for travel would remain low, and called for tests before departure. ""People won't travel here and the UK will get left behind,"" Mr Doyle said. Mr Shapps said the government was in talks with the US about trialling pre-departure tests, but no agreement has been reached yet. British Airways is currently slashing thousands of jobs amid a slump in demand for air travel - a pattern seen at other carriers. Some warn there could be hundreds of thousands more cuts unless the sector gets additional government support. The International Air Transport Association has downgraded its 2020 traffic forecasts, after ""a dismal end to the summer travel season"". The association, which represents 290 airlines, estimates that it will be at least 2024 before air traffic reaches pre-pandemic levels.

"This video can not be played Covid: What is it like to self-isolate in student halls? Some of Scotland's biggest universities did not reduce the capacity of their student halls despite the need for physical distancing, the BBC has found. A Disclosure investigationfound many student halls were 100% full despite the risks of spreading Covid. It also found that guidance on offering remote teaching was changed at the last minute, pressuring students to attend. Prof Stephen Reicher, who advises both UK and Scottish governments, said it was an ""accident waiting to happen"". He said the risks were ""pretty clear"" and that he and others spoke publicly about the need for widespread Covid testing when students returned but this was never done. Prof Reicher said it was pretty clear what the risks were Scotland's students began to return to university in mid-September. As they packed into student halls, hundreds tested positive for the virus and thousands more were told to self-isolate. St Andrews University, which had ""strongly recommended"" students return to the town, recorded three cases imported from outside Fife in mid-September. Subsequently,it asked all students to observe a ""voluntary lockdown"". There was confusion across the country about whether students in university accommodation were able to go back to their family home. BBC Scotland's Disclosure programmefound that there have so far been 1,500 positive tests among students in halls, 10% of all cases in Scotland since 19 September. The programme found some universities cut the number of students in halls of residence by as much as half but St Andrews University, the University of Edinburgh and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, in Glasgow, were at full capacity. The Royal Conservatoire said it did not own or operate student accommodation but had an arrangement with a private company. A spokesperson said: ""We have a lease agreement with a purpose-built student accommodation provider for 164 ensuite rooms in a recently opened facility. To-date we have received no reported cases of Covid in our leased accommodation."" Eight other universities would not tell the BBC whether or not they cut numbers to allow physical distancing. The return of students appears to have eased some of the financial pressures on higher education. In May, at the height of the pandemic, the Scottish Funding Council predicted losses of up to Â£500m for the sector but universities are thought to have performed much better due to a higher than expected numbers of students. The Disclosure programme heard that, as late as 31 August, draft government guidance for Scottish universities said ""work and study that can be done remotely must be done so"". This would have meant that many students did not have to travel to university to take part in their course, The University and Colleges Union (Scotland) said this was changed to instead focus on ""blended"" or ""hybrid learning"" and asked institutions to make ""reasonable efforts"" to facilitate remote working. The UCU said the guidance was changed overnight and published on 1 September without its knowledge. It believes the change was made to allow universities to market more face-to-face teaching and bring students back to campus. Carlo Morelli, from UCU Scotland, said: ""If you're telling students they have to come to campus, then they're going to have to take up the accommodation that's offered to them. So the push was from the universities to get students to come and take up their place in accommodation."" The Disclosure investigation also found that some universities are subject to ""nomination agreements"" with private accommodation providers. This is where universities enter deals with private developers to provide modern attractive accommodation. These deals may include guarantees from universities that a certain percentage of the rooms will be filled each year. For instance, the University of Edinburgh has eight nomination agreements in place, with a fifth of its students living in accommodation rented from private providers. Financial analyst Louise Cooper told the programme that there had been an explosion of student numbers in recent years and universities had turned over their property portfolios to private developers. But she said the ""risk"" of the properties being empty was generally being borne by the universities. ""The underlying model requires high occupancy, students in there, paying their weekly, monthly rents,"" she said. ""As ever, you need to follow the money."" The University of Edinburgh said: ""Throughout the pandemic our prime concern has been, and remains, the health, safety and general well-being of our students and staff. This will always come before any financial considerations."" Three normal capacity responses: University of St Andrews said their halls of residences were full The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland said they were at normal, 100% capacity Edinburgh confirmed in an interview there were no plans for reduced capacity Eight universities did not answer: Aberdeen said the information was commercially sensitive Glasgow did not answer Dundee did not answer Heriot-Watt did not answer Strathclyde did not answer Stirling said the information was commercially sensitive) Edinburgh Napier did not answer Glasgow School of Art did not answer Seven universities reduced capacity: The University of the West of Scotland (was at 62% capacity) The University of the Highlands and Island (at 41%) Glasgow Caledonian University (at 50%) Abertay (at 90%) Scotland's Rural College (at 40%) Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen (at 83%) Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh said 765 out of 800 rooms were filled. Edinburgh University's Prof Peter Mathieson said the decision was not financial Edinburgh University vice-chancellor, Prof Peter Mathieson, said the decision to bring students back was driven by ""a belief that we want to provide the best possible student experience that we can"". He said the university had focused on making the teaching environment safe for students and staff. Alastair Sim, from Universities Scotland, also said universities were ""prioritising learning"". Prof Reicher, a professor of social psychology at St Andrews, said that when experts looked at the US data it was ""pretty clear that going back to university was a real risk"". He said everyone should have been tested when they arrived and they should not have been allowed to mix together until later. Universities minister Richard Lochhead said there were no ""hidden agendas"" over blended learning Higher Education minister Richard Lochhead said the advice was that testing capacity should be focused on students who had symptoms of Covid. He said that having identified positive cases, the Test and Protect regime and self-isolation was the best way to prevent the transmission of the virus. ""In terms of asymptomatic testing, we are currently looking at whether there is more we can do that as a government, and that may well involve student populations going forward, because it's a developing science and the tests are also improving,"" he said. Mr Lochhead said there was no ""hidden agendas"" that led to the blended learning guidance. He said it came after the back and forth of debate and the aim was to strike a balance between face-to-face teaching and online learning. The minister said students' leaders had told him of concerns about purpose-built accommodation in Scotland and he had already given a commitment to carry out a review. Mr Lochhead said: ""We've done our best. I accept we'll look back on this and think we've made mistakes, because we're all dealing with a very difficult situation, where there are no easy options.""

"The developers of the Covid-19 contact-tracing app for England and Wales have stressed that none of the data it uses will be shared with the police. It followed news that the contact details of people told to self-isolate by the NHS Test and Trace scheme in England would be shared with the police ""on a case-by-case basis"". However, the app operates independently of this system. It has been downloaded more than 18m times since it launched in September. The news from NHS Test and Trace on Sunday led to worried app users taking to social media to say they would delete it over privacy concerns. The Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC that neither the police nor the government received any data from the app. In a tweet, the official account for the NHS Covid-19 app said ""The app cannot be used to track your location, for law enforcement, or to monitor self-isolation and social distancing.""

Recommendations to self-isolate which come via the app are not legally enforceable - unlike an instruction by phone call from NHS Test and Trace. The app has been built so that not only is all the data it collects anonymised, but it also only exists on individual handsets. ""By its very design the app's data can't be shared, it's held locally on the phone,"" commented Prof Alan Woodward, a computer scientist from Surrey University. ""Even if the police did get hold of it, it's all anonymised so it wouldn't mean anything to them."" By Alistair Coleman, BBC Anti-disinformation Unit Since its launch, there's been a stream of disinformation about the NHS Test and Trace app, the most common accusation being that it is run by private company Serco. There have been calls on social media to boycott the app because some people think their personal data is in the hands of a private company. The BBC spoke to both the Department of Health and Social Care and Serco, and both tell us that the app was made by a partnership led by the NHS involving Accenture, Alan Turing Institute, Oxford University, VMWare Pivotal Lab and Zuhlke Engineering. Serco has no connection with either the making or the running of the app. Additionally, Serco has told the BBC that it does not run the physical NHS Test and Trace scheme. That, too, is run by the NHS, with Serco providing about 50% of the phone operations staff for tier 3 contact tracing.

"This video can not be played Pupils and staff at Belfast Model School for Girls react to school closures Almost 1,500 positive cases of coronavirus have been recorded in Northern Ireland schools since their August reopening, Peter Weir has said. The education minister revealed the figure on the same day that schools began a two-week closure, aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19. Mr Weir said the figure of 1,491 cases was ""the overall school population"" - taking in teachers, staff and students. It is a cumulative figure from 24 August to 13 October, he added. The minister said there are about 333,000 students at schools in Northern Ireland and about 19,000 staff. He said the number of positive tests worked out at around 0.4% of the school population, which also means about one in every 250 pupils and staff members. The education minister said schools had mostly had cases of single individuals testing positive. In early September a Department of Education official told Stormont's education committee there had been 88 Covid-19 cases in 64 schools duringthe first two weeks of term. The education minister has now told assembly members there were 1,491 positive cases of individuals within schools during roughly the first seven weeks of term. But that statistic still leaves a lot of questions unanswered. How many individual schools have been affected and how many of those cases are pupils and how many are staff? How many schools have had to send pupils home to self-isolate for 14 days as a result of a positive case and how many pupils in total have been out of school for two weeks as a result? The latest attendance rate for pupils is 93.7% but those at home self-isolating are still marked as present if they're receiving work, so the rate tells us little about the level of disruption Covid-19 is causing in schools. ""I hope the Public Health Agency will be in a position fairly soon to give a more detailed figure,"" he told assembly members on Monday. The two-week closure of Northern Ireland's schools, which includes the half-term holiday, is set to be reviewed on 2 November. Restrictions imposed on businesses in Northern Ireland by the executivecame in at 18:00 BST on Friday.,external Restaurants and cafes are now limited to takeaway and delivery services for four weeks. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's new restrictions - in 60 seconds Restrictions have also been imposed on hotels, the beauty industry and on indoor and contact sport. A further six Covid-19 related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland by the Department of Health, bringing its total to 621. The department also reported an additional 820 positive cases of the virus, meaning there have been 28,040. There were 3,869 individuals tested in the previous 24 hours. Restaurants and cafes closed their doors to sit-in customers from 18:00 BST on Friday in NI Mr Weir has vowed to oppose any move to extend the school closures in Northern Ireland beyond two weeks. The minister said there had been little evidence that schools were significantly contributing to rising Covid-19 numbers. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said his party would have been prepared to back a longer closure, but they were ""content"" with the decision.

A fund to help businesses forced to shut due to increased coronavirus restrictions is due to open for applications on Monday. The Department of Finance expects the scheme to cost Â£35m pounds over four weeks. The fund is only available to businesses forced to close or where the use of premises is restricted and is an extension of the help already in place for businesses in the Derry City and Strabane council area. Policemade a number of arrests and handed out fixed penalty noticesat a protest against the restrictions at Stormont on Sunday. As well as the closure of the hospitality sector (apart from deliveries and takeaways), off-licences and supermarkets are not to sell alcohol after 20:00 and fast-food and takeaway premises are to close at 23:00. Driving instructors must stop offering lessons and as a result, the Department of Infrastructure has also decided to suspend driving tests. Other restrictions laid out in the guidance are: No indoor sport or organised contact sport involving mixing of households, other than at elite level No mass events involving more than 15 people (except for allowed outdoor sporting events where the relevant number for that will continue to apply) Close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians to close - apart from those relating to the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics Mobile hairdressers and make-up artists - also classed as close-contact services - prohibited from working in homes Gyms to remain open for individual training but no classes permitted Places of worship to remain open but face coverings mandatory when entering and exiting Wedding ceremonies and civil partnerships to be limited to 25 people with no receptions.

"File photo of a bear A Chinese animal park has promised to improve safety after one of its workers was fatally attacked by bears in front of a tourist bus. The accident at the Shanghai Wildlife Park took place on Saturday in the zoo's ""wild beast area"". Video reportedly of the incident, which was shared on social media, shows a group of tourists yelling as they watch the bears from inside a bus. The park has expressed its condolences to the worker's family. Bear bites man in China wildlife park Chinese woman sues over fatal tiger attack In a statement on its website, the Shanghai Wildlife Park said it was ""extremely distressed that such a tragedy occurred"", adding that it also ""apologised to tourists for any inconvenience caused"". The park says it is currently looking into the incident, would improve its safety management and ""do our best to handle the aftermath of the incident"". It has since temporarily closed the wild beast area, refunded tickets for visitors and ""strengthened its safety operations"". The video, circulating on China's Weibo, shows tourists yelling as they sit inside a bus, while several bears can be seen gathered outside, crowded in one spot. The area is only accessible to visitors by bus, with footage on social media site Weibo showing how animals are allowed to roam freely. In the video, a man can be heard exclaiming ""there's someone [there]"", while someone else is heard asking ""what's going on?"". The video quickly went viral and stirred debate about the existence of zoos. Some argued that the bears were only acting as any wild animal would, proposing the only solution to eradicate such accidents was to ""just close zoos... let animals be free"". Others condemned the zoo's lack of safety measures, and expressed sympathy for the tourists that witnessed the accident, saying they would be ""deeply traumatised"". It is rare for zoo workers in China to be mauled to death by animals, but attacks are not entirely uncommon - although in most of these cases, these accidents are allegedly brought on by the visitors themselves. In 2017, a man was bitten by a bear in a drive-through wildlife park in China after he ignored park warnings and rolled down his window to feed the bear.

Bolton MP Yasmin Qureshi has been hospitalised with Covid-19 The number of confirmed cases around the world has passed 40 million All bars and restaurants in Belgium closed for a month and a night-time curfew imposed amid ""tsunami"" of cases Italy has announced a new raft of measures to tighten restrictions amid a surge in cases Edited by Martha Buckley Thanks for joining our live coverage. We will be back with more coronavirus updates tomorrow morning. Your writers today have been Hamish Mackay, Francesca Gillett, Victoria Bisset, Lauren Turner, and Ella Wills. It's been another busy day for coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. French first lady Brigitte Macron is to self-isolate for seven days after coming into contact with someone who has been diagnosed with Covid-19. ""Brigitte Macron was in contact on Thursday 15 October with aperson who has been tested positive for Covid-19 this Monday, 19 October,"" French president Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement. ""In accordance with health authorities' recommendations, shewill self-isolate for seven days. Brigitte Macron has nosymptoms of the disease at this stage."" The government has issued a statement following talks this afternoon with local leaders in Manchester. No 10 wants Greater Manchester to move to the highest level of restrictions - tier three - butlocal leaders want better financial support before agreeing. ""A meeting between government and local leaders in Greater Manchester has concluded this afternoon following discussions throughout last week, over the weekend and this morning on measures necessary to protect the public,"" a government spokesman said. ""Disappointingly, we have still not been able to reach an agreement. ""This is particularly concerning against the backdrop of rising cases and hospitalisations in Greater Manchester. ""We are carefully considering next steps."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown should be used to build a ""resilient"" test and trace system. The 17-day lockdown - beginning on Friday at 18:00 BST - was announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford earlier today. Responding to the announcement, Mr Price said: ""A firebreak is a last resort and should only be used in an emergency. We are now in an emergency. ""The time the firebreak buys us must be used to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system in Wales, which means we can prevent being in the position we're currently in where the case numbers have risen to the point where they can overwhelm an already exhausted NHS. ""We also need to ensure the safeguarding of workplaces, and that sufficient financial support is available for businesses and their employees who will be directly impacted by this firebreak.""

Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said the field hospital would have a capacity of 500 beds. Other temporary facilities are being built elsewhere in the country. The announcement came as the number of daily cases in Poland reached a record high on Saturday, with 9,622 infections.The country has recorded more than 180,000 cases and 3,614 deaths since the pandemic began. âIf the number of cases increases at this pace, you must be aware that next week we can have 15,000 to 20,000 infections a day,â the health minister told a news conference. If you're just joining our coverage, here's a reminder of today's top US coronavirus stories: Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been seen travelling in his chauffeur-driven car without wearing a mask - against the advice of No 10. Members of the public face fines of Â£200 if they fail to wear a covering in taxis or private hire cars. There is an exemption for chauffeur-driven cars, but Downing Street said it had advised all its ministers to wear coverings. A No 10 spokesman said there were masks available in all ministerial cars. The BBC has contacted Mr Hancock's office for comment. Read the full story here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock insists the government is delivering ""more testing capacity"". He tells Jonathan Ashworth that ""batch testing"" is currently being trialled, and says funds have been given to local authorities to fund local contact tracing ""everywhere"". The health secretary also says the government is delivering ""more economic support"" and ""working with local authorities to deliver the local approach that is needed"". He urges the shadow health secretary to ""acknowledge and support"" the government's work. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asks Matt Hancock whether it is still the plan for there to be millions of tests a day. ""Results still aren't turned around in 24 hours,"" he says. ""When will they be turned around in 24 hours?"" ""The country is facing further restrictions because test and trace failed,"" he adds. Local health teams should be funded to do contact tracing, he says. Mr Ashworth calls for a short period of national lockdown - a so-called circuit-breaker - and asks whether it has been completely ruled out. ""The cost of delay could be a deeper, longer, fuller lockdown,"" he says. The health secretary then gives 

update on testing. He says the UK is now doing more than 300,000 tests a day, and that the government has now opened more than 500 tests sites, including new walk-in centres in Edinburgh, Dundee and Newcastle. Matt Hancock also talks about new technologies, including tests that can produce results as ""quickly as in 15 minutes"". He says they will be made available locally - starting with very high alert level regions. ""These tests have shown real promise and we are both buying them now and ramping up our ability to produce them in the UK,"" he says. Finally, the health secretary notes that ministers have ""laid regulations to support our roll out for both the flu and any Covid vaccination"". ""While no vaccine technology is certain we must be prepared to deploy a vaccine as soon as one is safely available,"" he says. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'We must have resolve' Quoting the WHO, Mr Hancock says it is ""unethical"" to let the virus grow. He says infection rates in Lancashire are ""among the highest in the country"" and continuing to rise, with hospital admissions doubling almost every fortnight. That is why, he adds, Lancashire has been moved to the highest tier of Covid restrictions.  This video can not be played Hancock: 'Lancashire cases doubling every fortnight' Mr Hancock explains why ""rapid action"" was taken in Lancashire, which has moved into the highest tier - tier three. ""I'm sure that the willingness to put politics aside in the national interest... will save lives and protect livelihoods."" He says ""talks are continuing this afternoon"" with Greater Manchester and this week further discussions are planned with other areas including South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Teesside. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There is frustration on the Greater Manchester side after the meeting with Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick today. Greater Manchester side says there were discussions about a hardship fund this morning that could have been used to support low-paid staff out of work because of Tier 3 restrictions - by this afternoon, that offer seemed to have gone. Greater Manchester and the Treasury had been talking about how cash could stack up for that kind of scheme - ministers determined not to open up national furlough, but extra cash, perhaps Â£15m, could have been used locally on the ground. At this afternoon's meeting, Greater Manchester sources say it felt like ministers ended conversations abruptly and just weren't interested in trying to get agreement. Sources said ""it was surreal"". Meeting ended with no conclusion and ministers saying they'd have to go back to No 10. Suspicion on Greater Manchester side now that government intent on imposing restrictions - will be interesting to see what Westminster side has to say in next few hours about progress - or lack of. The UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has started speaking in the House of Commons. He's making a statement to MPs about coronavirus. He says deaths have tragically doubled in the last 12 days. The situation remains perilous, he says. Cases continue to rise among the over 60s, he says. ""I'm very worried that the cases per 100,000 among the over 60s is 401 in the Liverpool City Region"" - and in Greater Manchester is now 283. He says the government has agreed cross-party measures in Liverpool and Lancashire and ""is still working hard"" to agree in Manchester. ""I know that this is difficult and I know that this is relentless but we must have resolve,"" he says. Your Questions Answered We've been answering more of your questions about what new regulations in place across the UK mean for you. They include one from a reader who lives in a tier two area who wants to know if they can have dinner with their sister at a tier one restaurant, indoors. The answer is no, as you can't mix with anyone indoors if you live in a tier two area, as it's under high alert. You can meet outside though, as long as there aren't more than six of you. There are also questions on whether you can stay at a partner's house if you live in areas under different regulations (in short - it depends where you live, whether you have formed a bubble and whether there's childcare to take into consideration), and on the job support scheme.

The German government is investing â¬500m (Â£452m; $488m) in improving ventilation systems in public buildings to help stop the spread of coronavirus. The grants will go to improve the air circulation in public offices, museums, theatres, universities and schools. Private firms are not yet eligible. Viruses spread on tiny droplets called aerosols, exhaled by infected people - especially when they sneeze or cough. Studies suggest they can remain in a room's air for at least eight minutes. Colder weather puts more people at risk because they spend more time indoors. The aim is mainly to upgrade existing air conditioning systems, rather than install new ones, which would cost more. The infection rate has risen across Germany in recent weeks, but the surge is less marked than in some neighbouring countries, notably the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and France. Find out more about the scheme here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give a statement relating to Covid-19 in the House of Commons shortly. It is not known what will be announced, but it comes amid ongoing negotiations between Greater Manchester and central government over moving the region to the highest tier of restrictions. A further 18,804 confirmed cases of the virushave been announced by the UK government.,externalIt brings the total number of cases in the UK to 741,212. There have also been 80 new deaths, the government said. Of those deaths, 72 were in England, six in Northern Ireland, one in Wales and one in Scotland.

Here's a recap:  You can read the full storyhere And there's more informationin this Q&A A UK government schemeto cover most of the wages of workers in businesses forced to close, due to start on 1 November, will not be brought forward to cover the Welsh lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that was because of ""limitations in HMRC delivery timescales"", in a letter to the first minister. Some employees may be able to be re-furloughed, however. Cardiff still has the highest case rate in Wales - 266.6 per 100,000 up to 16 October - involving 869 cases. This includesmore than 330 cases among Cardiff University students in this period,,externalalthough it is not the only factor. Local health officials have said the virus is prevalent across the city and ""we are seeing cases of coronavirus across all age groups and all areas of Cardiff"". Its rate of positive test results has also grown to 18.9%, the highest in Wales. Health officials become concerned when the figure rises above 4 to 5%. The most recent analysis of UK-wide figures by the BBC places Cardiff as the 53rd hardest-hit area for cases per 100,000 people. The highest rates are in areas in Northern Ireland, north-west England and  the East Midlands. Merthyr Tydfil is next in Wales on 203.9 per 100,000, with 123 cases over the past week. Along with Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taf, these areas also have high proportions of positive tests. Rhondda Cynon Taf has concerns linked to an outbreak of infections at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital. Blaenau Gwent has fallen from a peak rate of 246.2 per 100,000 and is now relatively steady at 161.7 per 100,000. As Wales prepares for a ""short, sharp"" return to lockdown on Friday, some countries in Europe have already brought in tough measures to counter a rise in cases. You can read about what they're doinghere Will children taking exams get fair treatment this year, the commissioner is asking Sally Holland, childrenâs commissioner for Wales, has criticised the decision to keep some secondary school year groups at home during the ""firebreak"" lockdown. She said: âOur consultation of nearly 24,000 children and young people during the first national lockdown highlighted that school closures disadvantaged some children and young people more than others. She welcomed the news that primary, special schools and Years 7 and 8 would stay in education but added: ""I think it places unreasonable pressure on children and education establishments to ensure sufficient plans are in place for those whoâll be restricted from returning after half term, in just four working days. ""Theyâve all faced tremendous pressure over recent months and without having seen clear public health evidence for not allowing all year groups to return, and details of how every child across Wales will have access to an equitable education offer during the weekâs closure, I cannot defend this decision. âYoung people in years 9 and over, who may already have faced significant disruptions this term due to the need to self-isolate, must receive clarity from the Welsh Government with urgency about why this decision has been taken and how their right to education will be upheld. ""Those in exam years will also need urgent reassurance that despite the ongoing disruptions, they will receive fair treatment when being assessed this year.â The Welsh Government has published the scientific advice of its Technical Advisory Cell on a ""firebreak"" lockdown. The paper recommends ""a two-three week hard fire break"" should be introduced in Wales ""to bring the R [reproductive rate of the virus] below one in order to both lessen the impact and slow the growth of the epidemic in Wales"". Without a massive reduction in transmission the scientific advisory body concludes the impact on the hospitals and intensive care units would be unsustainable. ""Without intervention, continued increase of cases of Covid-19 in Wales, in hospitals and in ICU will be too high for the NHS to sustain,"" it said. ""In order to balance the four harms effectively, TAC recommends urgent consideration and execution of a hard national fire break to massively reduce transmission for a period of weeks, reduce the number of cases to a sustainable level and then a set of sustainable, national interventions to keep R around one while maximising social, economic and health benefits."" It said two of the three community indicators which would prompt the government to act had been breached. These were having 40 cases per 100,000 population, which was breached on 17 September, and having a positivity rate in coronavirus tests above 5%, which was breached since 27 September. The third - having an R rate of 1.5 or over - has not yet happened. One of its three hospital indicators has also been breached. This was having more than occupancy of critical care beds above 150 - it currently stands at 153. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says he is ""very hopeful"" a new testing regime for travellers coming into the UK can be in place by early December. He added this could happen as long as there was sufficient testing capability available in the private sector. The UK government's travel taskforce has been working on plans for a new system, where passengers receive a single test after a period of self-isolation. But British Airways' new boss wants testing before departure, not quarantine on arrival. ""We need to get the economy moving again and this just isn't possible when you're asking people to quarantine for 14 days,"" Sean Doyle said. First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced a ""firebreak"" lockdown, which has also been called a circuit-breaker. The national lockdown will start at 18:00 on Friday. But what exactly is a Covid circuit-breaker? This video can not be played The firebreak lockdown is a ""severe setback"" to
the already hard hit hospitality, leisure and tourism
sectors, according to industry leaders. âBusinesses are fully aware that public health must come
first and have been doing everything they can to keep staff and customers safe,""
said CBI Wales director Ian Price. âThe UK and Welsh governments have worked extremely hard
and already taken decisive steps to support jobs and companiesâ cashflow over
the past few months, and further ring-fenced business support for our hardest hit
sectors is welcome as we enter the crucial winter period. ""Transparency and clarity of messaging are key and businesses remain keen to better understand the strategy for living with Covid-19 through the autumn and winter."" The firebreak and its effects on education is an ""inevitable consequence of the decision to abandon social distancing in schools"", claims a leading teaching union. The NASUWT said it warned in August that the Welsh Government ""should not bow to pressure"" for a full return to schooling. âSchool leaders and teachers
have done their best, but it is an impossible task,"" said the union's Wales national officer Neil Butler. âSchools are regularly sending
home whole year groups for two-week periods, while some schools have
lost many of their permanent teachers. ""The Welsh
Government needs to draw up a new plan, not based on opening schools no
matter what, but based on keeping schools open in a sustainable and safe
manner which controls the spread of the infection.â First Minister Mark Drakeford said children were the Welsh Governmentâsâtop priority if further restrictions are needed and that education must continueâ. This video can not be played Covid-19: Children 'top priority' in Wales firebreak First Minister Mark Drakeford said children would be the top priority in the ""short, sharp"" lockdown in Wales. Wales will go into a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown from Friday, 23 October until Monday, 9 November. People will be told to stay at home, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut. Primary schools will reopen after the half-term break, but only Years 7 and 8 in secondary schools will return at that time. Public support is needed to beat the virus and relieve pressure on the NHS, health bosses have said. The number of people being taken to hospitals with coronavirus symptoms ""continues to rise"" along with the number of deaths, according to the Welsh NHS Confederation. Director Darren Hughes said: ""It is clear robust action needs to be taken now to protect people who may be susceptible to the virus and to protect the NHS in Wales to ensure that it does not become overwhelmed. ""Providing other services becomes increasingly difficult as cases of coronavirus rise in hospitals because we need to plan for more patients coming in with the virus. ""We want everyone in Wales to know we understand their frustrations and we know this is difficult for everyone, but we cannot beat this virus without the support of the public.""   Non essential businesses have to close from 18:00 Friday The firebreak will ""destroy
many pubs"" without further financial support, according to trade group the
British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA). ""A forced full closure will leave many of them
fighting for their very survival,"" said chief executive Emma McClarkin. âWe need the cash grants to fully cover lost revenue and
high fixed costs for all pubs, including those with a rateable value above Â£50k."" As part of the firebreak, the Welsh Government will give small and
medium-sized retail, leisure and hospitality firms that have to close a one-off
payment of up to Â£5,000. There will be additional discretionary grants and support for smaller firms that are struggling, the government said. Tory politician Andrew RT Davies has criticised the firebreak planned from Friday. TheMember of the Seneddtweeted to say it would be ""devastating"" for the economy and could lead to further lockdowns. The first minister has said a firebreak was the""best chance""of regaining control of the virus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Following on from his comments about holidaymakers from England, Mark Drakeford said all non-essential cross border travel in and out of Wales ""will have to end"" during the firebreak period. The first minister said travel between England and Wales would now be ""even stricter"" than it has been since the introduction of specific travel restrictions on Covid hotpots across the UK last Friday. ""During the two weeks of the firebreak period, cross-border travel will be even stricter than it has been in recent days,"" he said. ""Essential travel will still be possible, but non-essential travel within Wales and across the border will have to end for the period of the firebreak."" The lockdown could be a ""disaster"" for high streets, the WRC says The Welsh Retail Consortium has expressed ""disappointment"" that non-essential shops will be forced to close during the firebreak lockdown announced earlier. WRC head Sara Jones said the move had not been supported by Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) advice and a recent Sage paper had assessed it would have a low impact on Covid transmission. ""We are not aware of
any evidence that justifies closing non-essential retail,"" she said. ""Retailers are now
gearing up for the vital festive trading period when a fifth of goods are
bought. ""If shops canât trade in the run-up to Christmas that will be a
catastrophe. ""This revenue-crushing firebreaker alone will put thousands of
jobs and hundreds of shops at risk â but if it extends into November it could
be a disaster for high streets across Wales."" Cardiff now has one of the fastest rising case rates in the UK â and itâs up to 53rd in the UK. It now stands at 266 cases per 100,000 people, the highest in Wales, ahead of Merthyr Tydfil county borough on 203. Derry City and Strabane in Northern Ireland remain highest in the UK with 939 per 100,000 population. Cases in Nottingham, on 655, appear to be falling and slight falls have been detected in Liverpool and Knowsley too, according to the BBC statistics team. Knowsley, at 654 per 100,000 population, and Liverpool, at 579, are both in the highestTier 3 restriction areasof England. While nowhere near the numbers seen at the previous peak of the epidemic in April, the number of deaths has been following an upward trend since September. During the press briefing earlier, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the number of people in hospital was growing every day, with critical care beds already full. He added: ""If we do not act, the NHS will not be able to look after
the increasing number of people who will fall seriously ill in the coming
weeks, even with the extra 5,000 beds we have available. ""And even
more people will die."" More than 1,600 extra deaths have occurred in people's own homes in Wales so far this year than average, according to analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Deaths from heart disease amongst men in their own homes were 22.7% higher compared with the five-year average - while there were more than 29% fewer deaths through this cause in hospital. Deaths for women from dementia in their own homes almost doubled in Wales, while in hospitals they fell by 25.5%. âWhile deaths in hospitals and care homes have dropped below the five-year average since the initial peak of the coronavirus pandemic, weâve consistently seen deaths in private homes remain well above the five-year average,"" said ONS analyst Sarah Caul. Unlike the high numbers of deaths involving Covid-19 in hospitals and care homes, the majority of deaths in private homes are unrelated to the virus. Up to 11 September, there have been 7,440 deaths in people's homes in Wales, with 134 of these involving Covid-19. This was 1,624 deaths more than the five-year average for the same period. Nearly two-thirds of these excess deaths came in the 70 to 89 years age group. One expert has suggested these deaths would normally have occurred in hospital. People may have been reluctant to go, discouraged from attending, or the services have been disrupted, Sir David Spiegelhalter of the Cambridge University said. The Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board covering north Wales continues to have the highest number of reported deaths from coronavirus, at 433. But an increase in deaths in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg area of south Wales, following a number of hospital-related cases, has pushed its figures to 404. The one further death reported on Monday was in the Aneurin Bevan health board area of south-east Wales. Â© 2025 BBC.

"NHS Blood and Transplant is boosting stocks of blood plasma for very ill coronavirus patients ahead of winter. It wants more people who have recovered from Covid-19 to become donors.

Fourteen new donation centres will open in November and December, to bring the total in England to 42. The blood plasma will be used to treat patients in Covid trials.

"Scaffolding has been erected after faulty cavity barriers were found Hundreds of residents at a housing complex in west London are having to move out while fire safety and structural problems are investigated. People living in the Paragon complex in Brentford are being evacuated after faulty cavity barriers, which prevent flames spreading, were found. Every occupant of the 1,059 high-rise homes will be moved out this week. Housing association Notting Hill Genesis (NHG) said it was ""working to uncover the full extent of the issues"". One resident told the BBC it was ""sickening"" they had been allowed to move into an ""unsafe building"". Laura Howes, 19, was placed in the building by the University of West London (UWL), where she is student. Ms Howes said the university owed her ""a massive apology"". ""We should be getting the rent back for the months we've been staying in an unsound building,"" she said. UWL said in a statement: ""Alternative accommodation has been secured for all those affected. ""Extensive support plans are in place to facilitate the smoothest possible transition to the new accommodation."" Many residents at Paragon are students at the University of West London Some residents are currently self-isolating with positive coronavirus cases, one resident told the BBC. Sam Wilkins, 19, said covid-positive residents were about to be taken out of isolation and moved to different flats. ""It doesn't make much sense to me. It feels like NHG are panicking,"" he said. NHG said all residents had found alternative accommodation, including in hotels, and it was providing financial support. Since the Grenfell Tower fire the building has had a ""waking watch"" to ensure residents are alerted in the event of a  blaze. But technical consultants have advised they could not guarantee the safety of residents and so an evacuation was required. Kate Davies, NHG's group chief executive, said: ""I understand that Paragon residents may feel angry or alarmed by this news, as they have every right to be. ""This is a very distressing time and we are genuinely sorry for the huge amount of disruption and uncertainty that this situation will cause. ""This is a complex situation and we don't yet have all the answers. We are working to uncover the full extent of the issues at Paragon so that we can provide residents with clarity about timescales, next steps and options as quickly as possible.""

"The leaders of the UK's Anglican Churches have warned the government that its new Brexit bill could set a ""disastrous precedent"". The Internal Market Bill could damage the relationship between the UK's four nations, say the archbishops of York and Canterbury and the heads of the Church in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. It comes as peers have their first say on the legislation. The bill would allow aspects of the EU Withdrawal Agreement to be superseded. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told MPs the bill could ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"". MPs overwhelmingly backed the Internal Market Billlast month but resistance is expected in the Lords, where Boris Johnson does not have a majority. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, Archbishop of Wales John Davies, Archbishop of Armagh John McDowell and the Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church Mark Strange havewritten a rare joint letter in the Financial Times,external. The religious leaders raised concerns about the potential impact the legislation could have on the Good Friday Agreement ""on which peace and stability within and between the UK and Ireland depends"". The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses The archbishops add: ""The bill is, of course, not just concerned with domestic law. It currently asks the country's highest law-making body to equip a government minister to break international law. ""This has enormous moral, as well as political and legal, consequences. We believe this would create a disastrous precedent."" A number of Tory MPs have criticised the intervention but Archbishop McDowell told BBC Radio 4's Today church leaders had a role to play in maintaining the ""civic dialogue"" that was an essential part of a healthy democracy. ""Pretty much every political act, and every piece of legislation or social policy, has an ethical element to it,"" he said. The EU has warned the UK it will face legal action if the clauses in the bill relating to checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and subsidies to Northern Irish businesses are not removed. This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""We hope the EU will change their position"" The government has said it is a necessary ""safety net"" to protect the UK's internal market in case differences over the Northern Ireland protocol cannot be resolved through the formal resolution process established by the two sides, known as the Joint Committee. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has held talks with EU commissioner Maros Sefcovic to discuss how the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement - which set out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU earlier this year - is being implemented in relation to Northern Ireland and citizen's rights. He will make a statement to MPs later about the meeting and the chances of the two sides agreeing a trade deal before the UK leaves the single market and customs union on 31 December, when the transition period ends. The UK and EU are at loggerheads over the terms of their future economic partnership - with talks effectively stalled amid disagreements over fishing access and competition issues. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday,Mr Gove said the door was ""still ajar""for a deal but only if the EU moved ground in key areas. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart David Frost are due to speak by video link shortly. Mr Sefcovic told reporters the EU would work ""until the last minute"" to nail down an agreement but it had to be fair for both sides. He also said he hoped to resolve all outstanding issues relating to the Withdrawal Agreement in the coming weeks but the time left to do so was ""really very, very short"". What do UK and EU want? All you need to know about Brexit? About 110 peers have signed up to speak during the Second Reading debate of the Internal Market Bill, the first parliamentary hurdle for the legislation during its passage through the Lords. It is likely to face fierce opposition from Labour, Liberal Democrat and cross-bench peers while several senior Tories, including ex-leader Lord Howard, have said they are unconvinced by the government's promise of a further, specific vote in Parliament before the powers in question can be used. Lord Judge, the former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, has tabled what is called a ""motion of regret"" which cannot stop the bill but, if passed, would show the level of opposition within the chamber. Meanwhile, in other related developments, companieshave been told to step up preparationsso they are not ""caught out"" by new post-Brexit trade rules. And International Trade Secretary Liz Truss has chaired the first meeting of a revamped Board of Trade with a panel of advisers including the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott.

"Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly returned as hosts of Strictly this year, but stayed 2m apart The launch episode of this year's Strictly Come Dancing was watched by an average of 8.6 million viewers, according to overnight ratings. That's an increase on last year's opening show audience, which attracted 7.8 million. Saturday night's episode achieved a 42.2% audience share and had a peak of nine million viewers, a spokesman for the programme said. There were several big changes to the format due to coronavirus restrictions. Each couple has formed a bubble to limit contact with other people, and in the studio celebrities and their partners performed in front of a socially distanced audience. Strictly judges Craig Revel Horwood, Shirley Ballas and Motsi Mabuse The judges sat at their own mini-podiums althoughBruno Tonioli was missingas he is also a judge on US show Dancing with the Stars. He usually flies back and forth to appear on both shows but that isn't possible this year due to self-isolation rules when travelling between the US and the UK. First same-sex pair revealed as Strictly begins 12 things you need to know about Strictly's stars Strictly's HRVY tests negative for coronavirus Bruno will, however, appear remotely on the Sunday results show and will appear in the studio later in the series once Dancing in the Stars has wrapped up. There will be no Halloween or Blackpool specials either. But what did the critics make of the new-look format? Has the magic gone or is this just the glut of glitter we need to see us through a tough winter? The Telegraph's Ed Power,externalwas pleased to have the show back, giving it four stars out of five and declaring that, ""Strictly, for all its concessions to Covid, felt reassuringly unchanged"". He added: ""With the New Normal becoming increasingly abnormal, this was comfort TV of the first rank."" ""While Coronavirus has obviously brought complications to Strictly 2020 it hasn't, on the evidence of a reliably glittery launch episode, sapped the heel-clicking juggernaut of any of its strut."" Jan Moir, writing in the Daily Mail,external, was also pleased to have Strictly back. ""Strictly Come Dancing returned on Saturday night, providing a joyous burst of fun for viewers starved of sparkle and gagging for glitter,"" she wrote. But she wasn't impressed with the show's regular references to how they've adapted to the Covid-19 guidelines. Saturday's episode saw Nicola Adams paired with Katya Jones ""Claudia and Tess spend far too much time patiently explaining the show's Covid rules - we get it! - although the admirable ingenuity, planning skills and can-do determination to make the show happen are nothing short of miraculous."" Moir was confident the show could still thrive without Bruno's enthusiastic presence. ""Bruno Tonioli is absent this year, but I fear he won't be missed much in the shortened format; no Blackpool, no Clauditorium, fewer episodes,"" she wrote. Olympic boxing champion Nicola Adams made history by becoming the first celebrity to dance in a same sex pair, partnering up with Katya Jones. Moir wrote: ""Strictly's first same-sex partnership has garnered much attention, but what is the fuss about?"" Caroline Quentin with Johannes Radebe The Independent's Emma Bullimore,externalgave the show a maximum five stars, noting: ""Another fab-u-lous surprise awaits this year, as the pairings take place out and about across the country, captured in pre-recorded films. ""It's much more natural, less prolonged, and quite frankly a relief for everyone involved."" How do you film Strictly 2020 during a pandemic? BBC defends Strictly Come Dancing same-sex pairing She added: ""It's not a perfect show. Anton du Beke insists on singing (to the delight of nobody). And every member of the (much smaller) audience is wearing a mandatory plain black face mask, which feels stingy - could the budget not have stretched to a few sequins for the fans? ""But coming in from a grey day to glitterballs, glamour and smiles is a long-awaited injection of pure joy."" The Guardian's Heidi Stephens wrote a live blog,externalon Saturday night, declaring it was ""so good to be back"". She found the studio a little quiet though. ""Ah, we're in the studio and it's gone disco. It seems strange without an audience, but on the upside, no out-of-time clapping. ""Usually I'd bitch about how this show takes 90 minutes to do a pairing job that should take about ten, but I'm so Strictly-starved I'm prepared to go with it. Embrace the endless filler, everyone."" Viewers, including artist Grayson Perry, were also pleased to have Strictly to look forward to. Allow Twitter content?

"Major restrictions to people's lives have been introduced after Wales entered a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown. Until Monday 9 November people living in Walesare being told to stay at home. Pubs, bars and restaurants, gyms, and all non-essential shops have been made to close. But what does it mean, and what can you do from 23 October to 9 November without breaking the law? Similar to during the first lockdown in March, people are being told to stay at home in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus in Wales. You are only allowed to leave your house to go to the shops to buy essential food and medication, get health care and treatment, to provide care, or to take exercise. You should also work from home unless it is not possible. All but essential shops had been told to close from 18:00 BST on Friday. While people are not limited to their local authority, they are being told to shop as close to home as possible and not travel long distances. Supermarkets, pharmacies, post offices and banks remain open, but are being told not to sell non-essential items, such as clothing, toys and homeware. No. Under the new rules people cannot mix with others they do not live with. From Friday you are not meant to meet others indoors, or socialise outdoors, such as in parks or people's gardens. People living alone can meet another household indoors, under the rules During local lockdowns people living alone were allowed to meet one other household indoors from their local areas, after concerns about isolation. This has not changed, with those who live alone or in a single parent households being the only ones able to meet a household they do not live with. This has to be the same one every time. But they can live anywhere, due to this being a national lockdown, however, the Welsh Government has urged people to form an extended household as ""locally as possible"". Over the coming days, expect to see a return to the days of Zoom chats, virtual parties, people waving at each other from the end of drives, and people leaving shopping on door steps. Primary and special schools will re-open as normal on 2 November after the half-term break - there is no extra time off. In secondary schools only pupils in Years 7 and 8 will go back to class. Pupils sitting exams will be able to go in to take them but all other pupils will continue their learning from home for an extra week. Breakfast clubs and after school care is ""essential"" for many families Childcare facilities are staying open during the 17 days in a bid to keep schools open. Grandparents and other relatives can still care for children, but only if no other methods of childcare are available. Where parents live apart, children will be allowed to continue to stay with both parents, with arrangements continuing as normal. No - from 18:00 BST on Friday pubs, bars, restaurants and hotels closed for 17 days. This is similar to the first Wales-wide lockdown back in March. Beer gardens will be shut, and people are being warned not to drink in their friends' homes or gardens, or to gather in parks. Pubs and food establishments are able to operate as takeaways. Hotels and businesses in the tourism sector will not reopen until 9 November. It is illegal to go on holiday in Wales or to travel abroad during lockdown No, travelling to go on holiday in Wales, or outside Wales, including abroad, is not classed as ""essential"" travel during lockdown. If you have pre-booked and paid for a holiday, the Welsh Government is advising people to contact their travel company to discuss the situation. If you live outside of Wales or within Wales, travelling to stay, visit or check on your second home is illegal. You can travel to provide care or to help someone in need - such as an older person, a child or a vulnerable adult - even if they are not part of your household. You can travel to visit someone on ""compassionate grounds"". This may apply if you are worried someone is struggling with being isolated due to the restrictions, is having issues with their mental or physical health, has recently lost a loved one, or you are concerned about their wellbeing or welfare. Travel across the border is now limited to ""essential travel"". This includes providing care, or if you need to visit on compassionate grounds. If you live in a single person or single parent household you can travel across the border to visit your extended household. People who live in Wales but work over the border are able to travel, if they cannot work from home. Care home visits have to be prearranged Indoor visits to care homes may be allowed but only in ""exceptional circumstances"", such as for end-of-life visits. But this is up to local councils and individual homes to decide if it can be done safely, and must be prearranged. Similar rules apply to hospital and children's home visits. Swimming pools and gyms had only recently reopened No - gyms, pools and leisure centres are now closed for the 17 days. However local parks, playgrounds and outdoor gyms remain open. Yes - under the new national lockdown you can leave your house for exercise. Unlike back in March, there is no limit to how many times you can leave the house to exercise or how far you can run, cycle, walk or jog, or to where - as local lockdown boundaries have now ended. But exercising with others, such as running and cycling clubs, is not allowed, and you should start your exercise from home. People are being asked not to drive anywhere to do sport as exercise, unless they have specific health reasons, and people are banned from driving ""significant distances"" to get to mountains, beaches and beauty spots. The government is also asking people to avoid activities which involve a ""significant degree of risk"", such as open water swimming and water sports. Golf and tennis clubs are required to close during the period of the lockdown. The Welsh Government has confirmed that community support groups, who meet on non NHS premises, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, will have to temporarily stop. This is due to gathering restrictions, and rules meaning you are not allowed to meet others from outside your own household. A spokesman said they would be able to meet online. This video can not be played Wales lockdown: sport 'starting to hit thin ice' The autumn Internationals and professional football are allowed to continue behind closed doors, and be broadcast into people's homes. Sportspeople who work and earn a living through sport are allowed to continue working, and like everyone else they can leave home to do so if they cannot work from home. However,elite athletes in sports such as boxing, gymnastics, judo, swimming and athletics who live and train in Wales have seen programmes suspended. All community, amateur sport and training is suspended during the 17 day period. People living in houses of multiple occupation (HMOs) who are single are able to ""bubble up"" with another household in Wales. This also applies to students living in HMOs and to people in supported living arrangements with individual tenancies. You can travel, but only for a ""reasonable"" cause. These include trips to buy essential items - such as food and medication - to seek medical help, get a coronavirus test, or to deliver care. You can also travel to work, but only if you are a critical worker, or you do a job where you cannot work from home. Travelling to go on holiday is against the law. Also, people from outside Wales cannot visit on holiday. Yes, but with reduced services. Economy Minister Ken Skates said he had asked train and bus operators to cut down their services, particularly outside peak hours. He said services would be similar to those running in August, and said it was ""imperative"" the remaining spaces were available for key workers and essential journeys. Taxis are allowed to run if they have measures to cut the risk of transmitting the virus in the car. But they should only be used for essential journeys. Cases have been confirmed at university halls of residence, with thousands of students self-isolating on campuses across Wales. During the 17 days students have been told not to head home, but to stay where they are.First Minister Mark Drakeford added: ""In the same way we are asking everyone to stay at home, if students have reading weeks or half-term they will also need to stay at home in their university accommodation."" During the last lockdown thousands of vulnerable people with medical conditions and the elderly where told to stay in the house and shield, due to being high-risk from the virus. However, the Welsh Government has not re-introduced shielding for such people. The first minister said this was because if everyone stuck strictly to the rules the risk of exposure would be reduced. People are being advised to shop at quieter times of the day if they are high risk. The Welsh Government has stressed that people should still seek medical help. Dentists, opticians, audiology services, chiropody, chiropractors, osteopaths, and counselling and mental health services will remain open.

This video can not be played This couple were due to celebrate tying the knot in front of 300 guests During this 17-day lockdown places of worship are closed to congregations, apart from the holding of weddings, civil partnerships and funerals. Numbers allowed at ceremonies will depend on how many people can fit in the venue, with social distancing in place. Receptions are banned once again. Funerals can go ahead, with social distancing in place, and numbers depending on the venue size. You will not be allowed to host a wake or any gathering following the funeral. House viewings have been suspended from Friday Yes, you can move house, if you cannot delay the moving date until after the short lockdown period is over. However, property viewings cannot take place during the circuit-breaker period and high street estate agencies are required to close. Work can be carried out in people's homes, for example by tradespeople, as long as it is managed in a safe way and both the worker and household members have no symptoms of coronavirus. But the Welsh Government is recommending people consider if the work can be safely deferred until after the lockdown. No work should be carried out in any home where someone is isolating, unless it is to repair a fault which poses a direct risk to people's safety. If the MoT on your vehicle is due, you should still take it to the garage. Driving lessons are banned, and driving tests are not going ahead. This will be an autumn like no other. With people banned from meeting outdoors, trick-or-treating and fireworks are both off. The ban will be ""self-policing"", says First Minister Mark Drakeford. However, planned Remembrance Day events on Sunday 8 November - just hours before the new lockdown ends - will be allowed to go ahead. You may be told to go home or removed from where you are and returned home. You could have to pay a fixed penalty notice of Â£60. This will rise to Â£120 for the second breach. Or you could have criminal proceedings brought against you and, if found guilty, you will have to pay a fine. The first minister has suggested there will not be a return to local lockdown measures in Wales once the 17 days are over. Instead of different communities having different rules, Mr Drakeford has stressed the need for national rules, which will apply in all parts of Wales, so that people will know who they can spend time with over the festive period.

"Major restrictions to people's lives have been introduced after Wales entered a 17-day ""firebreak"" lockdown. Until Monday 9 November people living in Walesare being told to stay at home.

"China's economy continues its recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic according to its latest official figures. The world's second-biggest economy saw growth of 4.9% between July and September, compared to the same quarter last year. However, the figure is lower than the 5.2% expected by economists. China is now leading the charge for a global recovery based on its latest gross domestic product (GDP) data. The near-5% growth is a far cry from the slump the Chinese economy suffered at the start of 2020 when the pandemic first emerged. For the first three months of this year Chinaâs economy shrank by 6.8% when it saw nationwide shutdowns of factories and manufacturing plants. It was the first time Chinaâs economy contracted since it started recording quarterly figures back in 1992. Alibaba increases stranglehold on Chinese shoppers Chinese trade grows amid pandemic What to expect as China-US trade talks resume The key economic growth figures released on Monday suggest that Chinaâs recovery is gathering pace, although experts often question the accuracy of its economic data. The quarterly figures are compared to the same quarter of 2019. ""I don't think the headline number is bad,"" said Iris Pang, chief China economist for ING in Hong Kong. ""Job creation in China is quite stable which creates more consumption."" Chinaâs trade figures for September also pointed to a strong recovery, with exports growing by 9.9% and imports growing by 13.2% compared to September last year. Over the previous two decades, China had seen an average economic growth rate of about 9% although the pace has gradually been slowing. While the Covid-19 pandemic has hampered this year's growth targets, China also remains in a trade war with the US which has hurt the economy. Broadening recovery Analysis by Robin Brant, BBC China correspondent China's economy continues to grow at rates unimaginable in other Covid-hit countries. Draconian lockdown measures to control the virus combined with some government stimulus appeared to have worked well. While growth of 4.9% is slightly below some forecasts, industrial output - a good barometer of state controlled activity - came in above expectations. China's communist party rulers wanted to see ramped up supply, but retail sales were slower than predicted. Nonetheless it appears to be a broadening recovery with the all-important services sector rebounding. Domestic tourists and travellers have probably helped the recovery continue by spending their money at home because global restrictions mean they can't - yet - go abroad. Earlier this year China's central bank stepped up support for growth and employment after widespread travel restrictions choked economic activity. But it has more recently held off on further easing. Premier Li Keqiang warned earlier in October that China needs to make arduous efforts to achieve its full-year economic goals. For the second quarter of this year, economic growth in China reached 3.2% as it started its rebound. ""China's economy remains on the recovery path, driven by a rebound in exports,"" said Yoshikiyo Shimamine, chief economist at the Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute in Tokyo. ""But we cannot say it has completely shaken off the drag caused by the coronavirus."" China's economy should also get a boost this year from ""Golden Week"" - an annual holiday in October that sees millions of Chinese travel. Can China's Golden Week still shine brightly? With international travel severely restricted, millions of Chinese have been travelling, and spending, domestically instead. There were 637m trips in China over the eight-day holiday which generated revenue of 466.6bn RMB ($69.6bn, Â£53.8bn), according to data from its Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Duty-free sales in the tropical island province of Hainan more than doubled from last year, soaring by nearly 150% according to the local customs data. Can China's Golden Week still shine brightly?

We will be back with more coronavirus updates tomorrow morning. Your writers today have been Hamish Mackay, Francesca Gillett, Victoria Bisset, Lauren Turner, and Ella Wills. It's been another busy day for coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. French first lady Brigitte Macron is to self-isolate for seven days after coming into contact with someone who has been diagnosed with Covid-19. ""Brigitte Macron was in contact on Thursday 15 October with aperson who has been tested positive for Covid-19 this Monday, 19 October,"" French president Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement. ""In accordance with health authorities' recommendations, shewill self-isolate for seven days. Brigitte Macron has nosymptoms of the disease at this stage."" The government has issued a statement following talks this afternoon with local leaders in Manchester. No 10 wants Greater Manchester to move to the highest level of restrictions - tier three - butlocal leaders want better financial support before agreeing. ""A meeting between government and local leaders in Greater Manchester has concluded this afternoon following discussions throughout last week, over the weekend and this morning on measures necessary to protect the public,"" a government spokesman said. ""Disappointingly, we have still not been able to reach an agreement. ""This is particularly concerning against the backdrop of rising cases and hospitalisations in Greater Manchester. ""We are carefully considering next steps."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown should be used to build a ""resilient"" test and trace system. The 17-day lockdown - beginning on Friday at 18:00 BST - was announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford earlier today. Responding to the announcement, Mr Price said: ""A firebreak is a last resort and should only be used in an emergency. We are now in an emergency. ""The time the firebreak buys us must be used to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system in Wales, which means we can prevent being in the position we're currently in where the case numbers have risen to the point where they can overwhelm an already exhausted NHS. ""We also need to ensure the safeguarding of workplaces, and that sufficient financial support is available for businesses and their employees who will be directly impacted by this firebreak.""

The announcement came as the number of daily cases in Poland reached a record high on Saturday, with 9,622 infections.The country has recorded more than 180,000 cases and 3,614 deaths since the pandemic began. âIf the number of cases increases at this pace, you must be aware that next week we can have 15,000 to 20,000 infections a day,â the health minister told a news conference. If you're just joining our coverage, here's a reminder of today's top US coronavirus stories: Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been seen travelling in his chauffeur-driven car without wearing a mask - against the advice of No 10. Members of the public face fines of Â£200 if they fail to wear a covering in taxis or private hire cars. There is an exemption for chauffeur-driven cars, but Downing Street said it had advised all its ministers to wear coverings. A No 10 spokesman said there were masks available in all ministerial cars. The BBC has contacted Mr Hancock's office for comment. Read the full story here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock insists the government is delivering ""more testing capacity"". He tells Jonathan Ashworth that ""batch testing"" is currently being trialled, and says funds have been given to local authorities to fund local contact tracing ""everywhere"". The health secretary also says the government is delivering ""more economic support"" and ""working with local authorities to deliver the local approach that is needed"". He urges the shadow health secretary to ""acknowledge and support"" the government's work. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asks Matt Hancock whether it is still the plan for there to be millions of tests a day. ""Results still aren't turned around in 24 hours,"" he says. ""When will they be turned around in 24 hours?"" ""The country is facing further restrictions because test and trace failed,"" he adds. Local health teams should be funded to do contact tracing, he says. Mr Ashworth calls for a short period of national lockdown - a so-called circuit-breaker - and asks whether it has been completely ruled out. ""The cost of delay could be a deeper, longer, fuller lockdown,"" he says. The health secretary then gives 

update on testing. He says the UK is now doing more than 300,000 tests a day, and that the government has now opened more than 500 tests sites, including new walk-in centres in Edinburgh, Dundee and Newcastle. Matt Hancock also talks about new technologies, including tests that can produce results as ""quickly as in 15 minutes"". He says they will be made available locally - starting with very high alert level regions. ""These tests have shown real promise and we are both buying them now and ramping up our ability to produce them in the UK,"" he says. Finally, the health secretary notes that ministers have ""laid regulations to support our roll out for both the flu and any Covid vaccination"". ""While no vaccine technology is certain we must be prepared to deploy a vaccine as soon as one is safely available,"" he says. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'We must have resolve' Quoting the WHO, Mr Hancock says it is ""unethical"" to let the virus grow. He says infection rates in Lancashire are ""among the highest in the country"" and continuing to rise, with hospital admissions doubling almost every fortnight. That is why, he adds, Lancashire has been moved to the highest tier of Covid restrictions.  This video can not be played Hancock: 'Lancashire cases doubling every fortnight' Mr Hancock explains why ""rapid action"" was taken in Lancashire, which has moved into the highest tier - tier three. ""I'm sure that the willingness to put politics aside in the national interest... will save lives and protect livelihoods."" He says ""talks are continuing this afternoon"" with Greater Manchester and this week further discussions are planned with other areas including South Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Teesside. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There is frustration on the Greater Manchester side after the meeting with Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick today. Greater Manchester side says there were discussions about a hardship fund this morning that could have been used to support low-paid staff out of work because of Tier 3 restrictions - by this afternoon, that offer seemed to have gone. Greater Manchester and the Treasury had been talking about how cash could stack up for that kind of scheme - ministers determined not to open up national furlough, but extra cash, perhaps Â£15m, could have been used locally on the ground. At this afternoon's meeting, Greater Manchester sources say it felt like ministers ended conversations abruptly and just weren't interested in trying to get agreement. Sources said ""it was surreal"". Meeting ended with no conclusion and ministers saying they'd have to go back to No 10. Suspicion on Greater Manchester side now that government intent on imposing restrictions - will be interesting to see what Westminster side has to say in next few hours about progress - or lack of. The UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has started speaking in the House of Commons. He's making a statement to MPs about coronavirus. He says deaths have tragically doubled in the last 12 days. The situation remains perilous, he says. Cases continue to rise among the over 60s, he says. ""I'm very worried that the cases per 100,000 among the over 60s is 401 in the Liverpool City Region"" - and in Greater Manchester is now 283. He says the government has agreed cross-party measures in Liverpool and Lancashire and ""is still working hard"" to agree in Manchester. ""I know that this is difficult and I know that this is relentless but we must have resolve,"" he says. Your Questions Answered We've been answering more of your questions about what new regulations in place across the UK mean for you. They include one from a reader who lives in a tier two area who wants to know if they can have dinner with their sister at a tier one restaurant, indoors. The answer is no, as you can't mix with anyone indoors if you live in a tier two area, as it's under high alert. You can meet outside though, as long as there aren't more than six of you. There are also questions on whether you can stay at a partner's house if you live in areas under different regulations (in short - it depends where you live, whether you have formed a bubble and whether there's childcare to take into consideration), and on the job support scheme.

The German government is investing â¬500m (Â£452m; $488m) in improving ventilation systems in public buildings to help stop the spread of coronavirus. The grants will go to improve the air circulation in public offices, museums, theatres, universities and schools. Private firms are not yet eligible. Viruses spread on tiny droplets called aerosols, exhaled by infected people - especially when they sneeze or cough. Studies suggest they can remain in a room's air for at least eight minutes. Colder weather puts more people at risk because they spend more time indoors. The aim is mainly to upgrade existing air conditioning systems, rather than install new ones, which would cost more. The infection rate has risen across Germany in recent weeks, but the surge is less marked than in some neighbouring countries, notably the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and France.

The 17-day lockdown - beginning on Friday at 18:00 BST - was announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford earlier today. Responding to the announcement, Mr Price said: ""A firebreak is a last resort and should only be used in an emergency. We are now in an emergency. ""The time the firebreak buys us must be used to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system in Wales, which means we can prevent being in the position we're currently in where the case numbers have risen to the point where they can overwhelm an already exhausted NHS.

"Local leaders say more financial support is needed for Greater Manchester's businesses if tighter restrictions are to be imposed Further delays to a decision on Greater Manchester's Covid restrictions will ""put people's lives at risk"", the communities secretary has said. Robert Jenrick said he hoped he could reach an agreement with the region's MPs ""in the next day or two"". Local leaders want better financial support before agreeing to a move to the top tier of rules, which would force some businesses to close. Talks are continuing after a weekend of discussions. Mr Jenrick indicated that Greater Manchester could be offered a financial package similar to the ""tens of millions"" of pounds of support agreed for Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - the two parts of England already in tier three. A key sticking point of the dispute is that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham wants the government to reintroduce the 80% furlough scheme used during the UK's first lockdown, instead ofthe new Job Support Schemewhich covers 67% of the wages of people affected by tier three closures. Mr Burnham said businesses that would be closed under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions - including pubs, bookmakers and gyms - ""are places where people are on low wages"" and that two-thirds pay is not enough. But Mr Jenrick told BBC Breakfast the Manchester talks had gone on ""too long"" as coronavirus case numbers remain ""seriously high"". ""Delay I'm afraid will only make the situation worse, will only put people's lives at risk, and will only make the economic fallout for the city worse in the long term,"" he added. ""We do now need to take action. I hope that we can reach agreement but one way or another, we need to draw this to a conclusion."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday thathe might ""need to intervene""if local leaders did not accept a move to tier three. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle What is a circuit-breaker? Meanwhile, people in Wales will be told from Friday to stay at home, and pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. It comes asa two-week school closure begins in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. Scotland continues to draw up plans for a three-tier framework of restrictions, similar to England's, to account for regional differences in Covid rates and isolate areas of higher prevalence. On Monday the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. BBC deputy political editor Vicki Young said Treasury sources insisted Greater Manchester would not get a more generous offer on wages than the Job Support Scheme provides, but pointed to other financial support packages agreed with tier three areas. On Sunday, Liverpool City Region's metro mayor Steve Rotheram saidhis area would receive an additional Â£44m,externaland a similar package worth Â£42mwas given to local leaders in Lancashirelast week. Mr Burnhamsaid he had a ""constructive call""with the PM's team on Sunday, but on Monday morning he told Sky News: ""I'm not going to roll over at the sight of a cheque."" Nottingham's Labour council leader David Mellenhas also called for more support for businesses in the city if it is moved to tier three. However, the Labour leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, said the row was not just about money and questioned the effectiveness of ""blanket"" business closures, instead suggesting a shielding programme for those most at risk from Covid-19. And mayors and council leaders in the Liverpool City Region have written to the prime minister asking for an ""immediate review"" of the decision to close gyms and leisure centres in the area as part of tier three measures, pointing out that in Lancashire, which is also in tier three, they have not been required to close. They are calling on the government to provide the scientific evidence supporting the move and if they are unable to do so, allow them to reopen. How are tiers decided for different areas? When an area goes in to tier three - the ""very high alert"" category - this unlocks enhanced financial support from the government. In the Liverpool City Region, some of the funds will be used both to bolster contact tracing, to enhance compliance, and to support people who are clinically extremely vulnerable. This is worth Â£14m - and a similar package in Lancashire is worth Â£12m. But following negotiations, both areas have also been given a further Â£30m in ""business support"". Whitehall sources have told the BBC that Greater Manchester would be offered no less generous terms than Lancashire or Liverpool. On a per capita basis, that could mean potentially Â£70-80m being made available from central government, in return for enhanced restrictions. Talks are also under way between the government and local authority leaders in South Yorkshire. Council leaders want a package of support to include more resources for the NHS in the area - and are clear they won't be ""bounced"" into accepting a move to tier three. Dr Indeewar Kapila, an intensive care consultant in Greater Manchester, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that critical care units have capacity at the moment but Manchester's rate - which was 431 cases per 100,000 in the week to 13 October - was ""extremely high"". The prime minister's official spokesman said in Greater Manchester the number of new cases in people over the age of 60 had tripled in the most recent 15 days of full data - from 89 cases per 100,000 on 27 September to 282 per 100,000 on 12 October. The spokesman said all free intensive care capacity could be used by 28 October and could pass the peak seen in the first wave by 2 November, according to the government's pandemic modelling group, SPI-M. This is based on a ""best-case"" assumption that the number of intensive care patients would take 14 days to double. The projections suggest coronavirus patients would take up the entire current intensive care capacity by 8 November and the entire surge capacity by 12 November. It comes as Greater Manchester MP Yasmin Qureshi, who represents Bolton South East,said she is in hospital with pneumonia two weeks after testing positive for Covid-19. Hospitals in the North West are incredibly busy, but talk of them being overwhelmed with Covid patients is somewhat premature. In the spring the number of admissions across the region went from under 100 a day to over 400 in the space of a week. Cases have been rising much more gradually in recent weeks. In fact there are signs they may have started levelling off at around 200 cases a day. The hospitals in and around Manchester and Liverpool have borne the brunt of the pressures. Particular concern has been expressed about intensive care,with reports that more than 80% of beds in Manchester are occupied,external. That is not unusual - last winter similar occupancy rates were seen. In fact, this is one of the difficulties the NHS faces with Covid - it works so close to capacity in normal times that an extra pressure causes real problems. But again the local NHS is not yet in the position it was in the spring when it had to take emergency measures to open up extra intensive care beds by cancelling non-Covid work.

"A ""firebreak"" lockdown will begin across the whole of Wales from 18:00 BST on Friday It will end on Monday 9 November, First Minister Mark Drakeford says Non-essential shops, restaurants, cafes, hairdressers and beauty salons will have to close No meetings between people from different households will be allowed, either indoors or outdoors There will continue to be an exception for people who live alone Halloween and Bonfire Night gatherings will be banned, but Remembrance Day events will go ahead There will be Â£300m of support for industry, up to Â£5,000 per business One more death with coronavirus has been reported by Public Health Wales, with another 626 cases Natalie Grice and Richard Porter Thank you for following our live updates on today's announcement of a ""firebreak"" lockdown. Here's a recap:  You can read the full storyhere And there's more informationin this Q&A A UK government schemeto cover most of the wages of workers in businesses forced to close, due to start on 1 November, will not be brought forward to cover the Welsh lockdown. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that was because of ""limitations in HMRC delivery timescales"", in a letter to the first minister. Some employees may be able to be re-furloughed, however. Cardiff still has the highest case rate in Wales - 266.6 per 100,000 up to 16 October - involving 869 cases. This includesmore than 330 cases among Cardiff University students in this period,,externalalthough it is not the only factor. Local health officials have said the virus is prevalent across the city and ""we are seeing cases of coronavirus across all age groups and all areas of Cardiff"". Its rate of positive test results has also grown to 18.9%, the highest in Wales. Health officials become concerned when the figure rises above 4 to 5%. The most recent analysis of UK-wide figures by the BBC places Cardiff as the 53rd hardest-hit area for cases per 100,000 people. The highest rates are in areas in Northern Ireland, north-west England and  the East Midlands. Merthyr Tydfil is next in Wales on 203.9 per 100,000, with 123 cases over the past week. Along with Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taf, these areas also have high proportions of positive tests. Rhondda Cynon Taf has concerns linked to an outbreak of infections at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital. Blaenau Gwent has fallen from a peak rate of 246.2 per 100,000 and is now relatively steady at 161.7 per 100,000. As Wales prepares for a ""short, sharp"" return to lockdown on Friday, some countries in Europe have already brought in tough measures to counter a rise in cases. You can read about what they're doinghere Will children taking exams get fair treatment this year, the commissioner is asking Sally Holland, childrenâs commissioner for Wales, has criticised the decision to keep some secondary school year groups at home during the ""firebreak"" lockdown. She said: âOur consultation of nearly 24,000 children and young people during the first national lockdown highlighted that school closures disadvantaged some children and young people more than others. She welcomed the news that primary, special schools and Years 7 and 8 would stay in education but added: ""I think it places unreasonable pressure on children and education establishments to ensure sufficient plans are in place for those whoâll be restricted from returning after half term, in just four working days. ""Theyâve all faced tremendous pressure over recent months and without having seen clear public health evidence for not allowing all year groups to return, and details of how every child across Wales will have access to an equitable education offer during the weekâs closure, I cannot defend this decision. âYoung people in years 9 and over, who may already have faced significant disruptions this term due to the need to self-isolate, must receive clarity from the Welsh Government with urgency about why this decision has been taken and how their right to education will be upheld. ""Those in exam years will also need urgent reassurance that despite the ongoing disruptions, they will receive fair treatment when being assessed this year.â The Welsh Government has published the scientific advice of its Technical Advisory Cell on a ""firebreak"" lockdown. The paper recommends ""a two-three week hard fire break"" should be introduced in Wales ""to bring the R [reproductive rate of the virus] below one in order to both lessen the impact and slow the growth of the epidemic in Wales"". Without a massive reduction in transmission the scientific advisory body concludes the impact on the hospitals and intensive care units would be unsustainable. ""Without intervention, continued increase of cases of Covid-19 in Wales, in hospitals and in ICU will be too high for the NHS to sustain,"" it said. ""In order to balance the four harms effectively, TAC recommends urgent consideration and execution of a hard national fire break to massively reduce transmission for a period of weeks, reduce the number of cases to a sustainable level and then a set of sustainable, national interventions to keep R around one while maximising social, economic and health benefits."" It said two of the three community indicators which would prompt the government to act had been breached. These were having 40 cases per 100,000 population, which was breached on 17 September, and having a positivity rate in coronavirus tests above 5%, which was breached since 27 September. The third - having an R rate of 1.5 or over - has not yet happened. One of its three hospital indicators has also been breached. This was having more than occupancy of critical care beds above 150 - it currently stands at 153. UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says he is ""very hopeful"" a new testing regime for travellers coming into the UK can be in place by early December. He added this could happen as long as there was sufficient testing capability available in the private sector. The UK government's travel taskforce has been working on plans for a new system, where passengers receive a single test after a period of self-isolation. But British Airways' new boss wants testing before departure, not quarantine on arrival. ""We need to get the economy moving again and this just isn't possible when you're asking people to quarantine for 14 days,"" Sean Doyle said. First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced a ""firebreak"" lockdown, which has also been called a circuit-breaker. The national lockdown will start at 18:00 on Friday. But what exactly is a Covid circuit-breaker? This video can not be played The firebreak lockdown is a ""severe setback"" to
the already hard hit hospitality, leisure and tourism
sectors, according to industry leaders. âBusinesses are fully aware that public health must come
first and have been doing everything they can to keep staff and customers safe,""
said CBI Wales director Ian Price. âThe UK and Welsh governments have worked extremely hard
and already taken decisive steps to support jobs and companiesâ cashflow over
the past few months, and further ring-fenced business support for our hardest hit
sectors is welcome as we enter the crucial winter period. ""Transparency and clarity of messaging are key and businesses remain keen to better understand the strategy for living with Covid-19 through the autumn and winter."" The firebreak and its effects on education is an ""inevitable consequence of the decision to abandon social distancing in schools"", claims a leading teaching union. The NASUWT said it warned in August that the Welsh Government ""should not bow to pressure"" for a full return to schooling. âSchool leaders and teachers
have done their best, but it is an impossible task,"" said the union's Wales national officer Neil Butler. âSchools are regularly sending
home whole year groups for two-week periods, while some schools have
lost many of their permanent teachers. ""The Welsh
Government needs to draw up a new plan, not based on opening schools no
matter what, but based on keeping schools open in a sustainable and safe
manner which controls the spread of the infection.â First Minister Mark Drakeford said children were the Welsh Governmentâsâtop priority if further restrictions are needed and that education must continueâ. This video can not be played Covid-19: Children 'top priority' in Wales firebreak First Minister Mark Drakeford said children would be the top priority in the ""short, sharp"" lockdown in Wales. Wales will go into a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown from Friday, 23 October until Monday, 9 November. People will be told to stay at home, while pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut. Primary schools will reopen after the half-term break, but only Years 7 and 8 in secondary schools will return at that time. Public support is needed to beat the virus and relieve pressure on the NHS, health bosses have said. The number of people being taken to hospitals with coronavirus symptoms ""continues to rise"" along with the number of deaths, according to the Welsh NHS Confederation. Director Darren Hughes said: ""It is clear robust action needs to be taken now to protect people who may be susceptible to the virus and to protect the NHS in Wales to ensure that it does not become overwhelmed. ""Providing other services becomes increasingly difficult as cases of coronavirus rise in hospitals because we need to plan for more patients coming in with the virus. ""We want everyone in Wales to know we understand their frustrations and we know this is difficult for everyone, but we cannot beat this virus without the support of the public.""   Non essential businesses have to close from 18:00 Friday The firebreak will ""destroy
many pubs"" without further financial support, according to trade group the
British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA). ""A forced full closure will leave many of them
fighting for their very survival,"" said chief executive Emma McClarkin. âWe need the cash grants to fully cover lost revenue and
high fixed costs for all pubs, including those with a rateable value above Â£50k."" As part of the firebreak, the Welsh Government will give small and
medium-sized retail, leisure and hospitality firms that have to close a one-off
payment of up to Â£5,000. There will be additional discretionary grants and support for smaller firms that are struggling, the government said. Tory politician Andrew RT Davies has criticised the firebreak planned from Friday. TheMember of the Seneddtweeted to say it would be ""devastating"" for the economy and could lead to further lockdowns. The first minister has said a firebreak was the""best chance""of regaining control of the virus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Following on from his comments about holidaymakers from England, Mark Drakeford said all non-essential cross border travel in and out of Wales ""will have to end"" during the firebreak period. The first minister said travel between England and Wales would now be ""even stricter"" than it has been since the introduction of specific travel restrictions on Covid hotpots across the UK last Friday. ""During the two weeks of the firebreak period, cross-border travel will be even stricter than it has been in recent days,"" he said. ""Essential travel will still be possible, but non-essential travel within Wales and across the border will have to end for the period of the firebreak."" The lockdown could be a ""disaster"" for high streets, the WRC says The Welsh Retail Consortium has expressed ""disappointment"" that non-essential shops will be forced to close during the firebreak lockdown announced earlier. WRC head Sara Jones said the move had not been supported by Sage (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) advice and a recent Sage paper had assessed it would have a low impact on Covid transmission. ""We are not aware of
any evidence that justifies closing non-essential retail,"" she said. ""Retailers are now
gearing up for the vital festive trading period when a fifth of goods are
bought. ""If shops canât trade in the run-up to Christmas that will be a
catastrophe. ""This revenue-crushing firebreaker alone will put thousands of
jobs and hundreds of shops at risk â but if it extends into November it could
be a disaster for high streets across Wales."" Cardiff now has one of the fastest rising case rates in the UK â and itâs up to 53rd in the UK. It now stands at 266 cases per 100,000 people, the highest in Wales, ahead of Merthyr Tydfil county borough on 203. Derry City and Strabane in Northern Ireland remain highest in the UK with 939 per 100,000 population. Cases in Nottingham, on 655, appear to be falling and slight falls have been detected in Liverpool and Knowsley too, according to the BBC statistics team. Knowsley, at 654 per 100,000 population, and Liverpool, at 579, are both in the highestTier 3 restriction areasof England. While nowhere near the numbers seen at the previous peak of the epidemic in April, the number of deaths has been following an upward trend since September. During the press briefing earlier, First Minister Mark Drakeford said the number of people in hospital was growing every day, with critical care beds already full. He added: ""If we do not act, the NHS will not be able to look after
the increasing number of people who will fall seriously ill in the coming
weeks, even with the extra 5,000 beds we have available. ""And even
more people will die."" More than 1,600 extra deaths have occurred in people's own homes in Wales so far this year than average, according to analysis by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Deaths from heart disease amongst men in their own homes were 22.7% higher compared with the five-year average - while there were more than 29% fewer deaths through this cause in hospital. Deaths for women from dementia in their own homes almost doubled in Wales, while in hospitals they fell by 25.5%. âWhile deaths in hospitals and care homes have dropped below the five-year average since the initial peak of the coronavirus pandemic, weâve consistently seen deaths in private homes remain well above the five-year average,"" said ONS analyst Sarah Caul. Unlike the high numbers of deaths involving Covid-19 in hospitals and care homes, the majority of deaths in private homes are unrelated to the virus. Up to 11 September, there have been 7,440 deaths in people's homes in Wales, with 134 of these involving Covid-19. This was 1,624 deaths more than the five-year average for the same period. Nearly two-thirds of these excess deaths came in the 70 to 89 years age group. One expert has suggested these deaths would normally have occurred in hospital. People may have been reluctant to go, discouraged from attending, or the services have been disrupted, Sir David Spiegelhalter of the Cambridge University said. The Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board covering north Wales continues to have the highest number of reported deaths from coronavirus, at 433. But an increase in deaths in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg area of south Wales, following a number of hospital-related cases, has pushed its figures to 404. The one further death reported on Monday was in the Aneurin Bevan health board area of south-east Wales. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Bank of England (BoE) boss Andrew Bailey has said the UK faces ""an unprecedented level of economic uncertainty."" Britain's economy shrank by 20% in the three months to June as it battled with the coronavirus pandemic, the biggest fall of any large advanced economy. His remarks come as tighter coronavirus restrictions are imposed across the UK. Mr Bailey warned that there is significant risk of economic growth continuing to be lower than expected. The governor told an online event on Sunday that he expected output at the end of the third quarter to be 10% lower than the end of 2019. ""Of course, that is heightened now by the return of Covid... the risks remain very heavily skewed towards the downside,"" he said during the video conference for central banks, which was hosted by the Group of Thirty, a panel of economic policymakers and senior bankers. IMF upgrades 2020 economic forecast but warns of a slower 2021 Bank deputy governor warns against negative interest rates UK economic growth slows despite restaurant boost Mr Bailey said that it was best for policymakers to act aggressively, rather than cautiously, in the face of uncertainty, He also touched on the ongoing debate over setting negative interest rates, which would bring the cost of borrowing below zero. ""Our assessment of negative interest rates, from the experience elsewhere, is that they probably appear to work better in a more wholesale financial market context, and probably better in a nascent economic upturn,"" he said. If interest rates are negative, the BoE charges for any deposits it holds on behalf of the banks. That encourages banks to lend the money to business rather than deposit it. But with interest rates already low, it is not clear how much negative rates would help spur new activity. During the same event on Sunday, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spoke about growing concerns over sharp increases in debt levels in poorer countries. IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva says suspending debt payments is only a temporary measure In April, officials from the ""Group of 20"" (G20) countries with the largest and fastest-growing economies agreed to suspend debt repayments and interest payments for the world's poorest countries until the end of the year. The G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative has helped 44 countries defer $5bn (Â£3.8bn) repayments to spend on tackling the coronavirus crisis instead. However, the IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that urgent action was still needed in the form of restructuring debts. ""We are buying some time, but we have to face reality that there are much more decisive actions ahead of us,"" she said. ""Doing too little too late is costly to debtors, costly also to creditors."" She added that global debt levels were predicted to reach 100% of gross domestic product in 2021. In early October,the IMF said the global economy is still in deep recession, despite the fact that it has predicted a global economic contraction of 4.4%, which is more moderate than it envisioned in June. It warned that most economies will suffer lasting damage, and that extreme poverty is likely to rise for the first time in more than 20 years.

The Welsh Government has been urged to consider a four-week shutdown - or even longer - to turn around the surge in coronavirus cases, that has been almost a thousand daily cases for three of the last five days. ""In the first week of a circuit-breaker, you would still see cases probably going up because there would be people who caught it before the measures came in,"" Jamie Jenkins, former head of health analysis at the Office for National Statistics, toldBBC Radio Wales.

""We are seeing cases rising, almost a thousand on Sunday and the impact on the economy is quite substantial right now,"" Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council and the Welsh Local Government Association, toldBBC Radio Wales. This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Foster explains what a circuit breaker is and how it could help tackle Covid-19 ""Not only does every one of those cases have to self-isolate right now but all of their close contacts have to - so every day contact tracers are asking thousands of people to self-isolate. ""Over a 10-day period we are talking tens of thousands of people so if you think there is no harm to the economy right now it is foolhardy - and these numbers will continue to grow."" Mr Morgan, who has been part of talks with government, said financial support to Welsh businesses will be ""fundamental"" to plans of ministers as ""businesses are anxious to know"" the new measures. Mr Drakeford previously said that a ""successful firebreak would re-set the virus at a lower level"". ""Together with a new national set of rules for the whole of Wales after the firebreak period we would have slowed the virus down enough to get us through to Christmas,"" the first minister said. Leaders say financial help to businesses will be ""fundamental"" as Welsh ministers discuss the detail of a Wales-wide lockdown The Welsh Conservatives have called for an emergency Senedd debate as this is ""where major announcements of this kind should be made"" in a ""parliamentary democracy"". ""I think it's unacceptable, I think the first minister needs to make a statement in the Senedd, and that's why we've called for an emergency session,"" said Darren Millar, vice-chair of the Welsh Conservatives and Clwyd West MS. ""If they want growing consensus then they also need to engage with other political parties and they haven't been doing that."" Plaid Cymru said the case for a firebreak was ""now overwhelming"" and urged the Welsh Government ""to address the weaknesses of the test, trace and isolate system"". ""I want as few restrictions as possible to be imposed, but properly enforced, and with clear support for people and businesses affected,"" said Plaid's health spokesperson Rhun ap Iorwerth MS. Plaid's proposals include measures to ""improve our track, trace and isolate system, to safeguard workplaces, and to ensure sufficient financial support for businesses and their employees"".

"Local leaders say more financial support is needed for Greater Manchester's businesses if tighter restrictions are to be imposed Further delays to a decision on Greater Manchester's Covid restrictions will ""put people's lives at risk"", the communities secretary has said. Robert Jenrick said he hoped he could reach an agreement with the region's MPs ""in the next day or two"". Local leaders want better financial support before agreeing to a move to the top tier of rules, which would force some businesses to close. Talks are continuing after a weekend of discussions. Mr Jenrick indicated that Greater Manchester could be offered a financial package similar to the ""tens of millions"" of pounds of support agreed for Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - the two parts of England already in tier three. A key sticking point of the dispute is that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham wants the government to reintroduce the 80% furlough scheme used during the UK's first lockdown, instead ofthe new Job Support Schemewhich covers 67% of the wages of people affected by tier three closures. Mr Burnham said businesses that would be closed under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions - including pubs, bookmakers and gyms - ""are places where people are on low wages"" and that two-thirds pay is not enough. But Mr Jenrick told BBC Breakfast the Manchester talks had gone on ""too long"" as coronavirus case numbers remain ""seriously high"". ""Delay I'm afraid will only make the situation worse, will only put people's lives at risk, and will only make the economic fallout for the city worse in the long term,"" he added. ""We do now need to take action. I hope that we can reach agreement but one way or another, we need to draw this to a conclusion."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday thathe might ""need to intervene""if local leaders did not accept a move to tier three. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle What is a circuit-breaker? Meanwhile, people in Wales will be told from Friday to stay at home, and pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. It comes asa two-week school closure begins in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. Scotland continues to draw up plans for a three-tier framework of restrictions, similar to England's, to account for regional differences in Covid rates and isolate areas of higher prevalence. On Monday the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. BBC deputy political editor Vicki Young said Treasury sources insisted Greater Manchester would not get a more generous offer on wages than the Job Support Scheme provides, but pointed to other financial support packages agreed with tier three areas. On Sunday, Liverpool City Region's metro mayor Steve Rotheram saidhis area would receive an additional Â£44m,externaland a similar package worth Â£42mwas given to local leaders in Lancashirelast week. Mr Burnhamsaid he had a ""constructive call""with the PM's team on Sunday, but on Monday morning he told Sky News: ""I'm not going to roll over at the sight of a cheque."" Nottingham's Labour council leader David Mellenhas also called for more support for businesses in the city if it is moved to tier three. However, the Labour leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, said the row was not just about money and questioned the effectiveness of ""blanket"" business closures, instead suggesting a shielding programme for those most at risk from Covid-19. And mayors and council leaders in the Liverpool City Region have written to the prime minister asking for an ""immediate review"" of the decision to close gyms and leisure centres in the area as part of tier three measures, pointing out that in Lancashire, which is also in tier three, they have not been required to close. They are calling on the government to provide the scientific evidence supporting the move and if they are unable to do so, allow them to reopen. How are tiers decided for different areas? When an area goes in to tier three - the ""very high alert"" category - this unlocks enhanced financial support from the government. In the Liverpool City Region, some of the funds will be used both to bolster contact tracing, to enhance compliance, and to support people who are clinically extremely vulnerable. This is worth Â£14m - and a similar package in Lancashire is worth Â£12m. But following negotiations, both areas have also been given a further Â£30m in ""business support"". Whitehall sources have told the BBC that Greater Manchester would be offered no less generous terms than Lancashire or Liverpool. On a per capita basis, that could mean potentially Â£70-80m being made available from central government, in return for enhanced restrictions. Talks are also under way between the government and local authority leaders in South Yorkshire. Council leaders want a package of support to include more resources for the NHS in the area - and are clear they won't be ""bounced"" into accepting a move to tier three. Dr Indeewar Kapila, an intensive care consultant in Greater Manchester, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that critical care units have capacity at the moment but Manchester's rate - which was 431 cases per 100,000 in the week to 13 October - was ""extremely high"". The prime minister's official spokesman said in Greater Manchester the number of new cases in people over the age of 60 had tripled in the most recent 15 days of full data - from 89 cases per 100,000 on 27 September to 282 per 100,000 on 12 October. The spokesman said all free intensive care capacity could be used by 28 October and could pass the peak seen in the first wave by 2 November, according to the government's pandemic modelling group, SPI-M. This is based on a ""best-case"" assumption that the number of intensive care patients would take 14 days to double. The projections suggest coronavirus patients would take up the entire current intensive care capacity by 8 November and the entire surge capacity by 12 November. It comes as Greater Manchester MP Yasmin Qureshi, who represents Bolton South East,said she is in hospital with pneumonia two weeks after testing positive for Covid-19. Hospitals in the North West are incredibly busy, but talk of them being overwhelmed with Covid patients is somewhat premature. In the spring the number of admissions across the region went from under 100 a day to over 400 in the space of a week. Cases have been rising much more gradually in recent weeks. In fact there are signs they may have started levelling off at around 200 cases a day. The hospitals in and around Manchester and Liverpool have borne the brunt of the pressures. Particular concern has been expressed about intensive care,with reports that more than 80% of beds in Manchester are occupied,external. That is not unusual - last winter similar occupancy rates were seen. In fact, this is one of the difficulties the NHS faces with Covid - it works so close to capacity in normal times that an extra pressure causes real problems. But again the local NHS is not yet in the position it was in the spring when it had to take emergency measures to open up extra intensive care beds by cancelling non-Covid work.

"Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly returned as hosts of Strictly this year, but stayed 2m apart The launch episode of this year's Strictly Come Dancing was watched by an average of 8.6 million viewers, according to overnight ratings. That's an increase on last year's opening show audience, which attracted 7.8 million. Saturday night's episode achieved a 42.2% audience share and had a peak of nine million viewers, a spokesman for the programme said. There were several big changes to the format due to coronavirus restrictions. Each couple has formed a bubble to limit contact with other people, and in the studio celebrities and their partners performed in front of a socially distanced audience. Strictly judges Craig Revel Horwood, Shirley Ballas and Motsi Mabuse The judges sat at their own mini-podiums althoughBruno Tonioli was missingas he is also a judge on US show Dancing with the Stars. He usually flies back and forth to appear on both shows but that isn't possible this year due to self-isolation rules when travelling between the US and the UK. First same-sex pair revealed as Strictly begins 12 things you need to know about Strictly's stars Strictly's HRVY tests negative for coronavirus Bruno will, however, appear remotely on the Sunday results show and will appear in the studio later in the series once Dancing in the Stars has wrapped up. There will be no Halloween or Blackpool specials either. But what did the critics make of the new-look format? Has the magic gone or is this just the glut of glitter we need to see us through a tough winter? The Telegraph's Ed Power,externalwas pleased to have the show back, giving it four stars out of five and declaring that, ""Strictly, for all its concessions to Covid, felt reassuringly unchanged"". He added: ""With the New Normal becoming increasingly abnormal, this was comfort TV of the first rank."" ""While Coronavirus has obviously brought complications to Strictly 2020 it hasn't, on the evidence of a reliably glittery launch episode, sapped the heel-clicking juggernaut of any of its strut."" Jan Moir, writing in the Daily Mail,external, was also pleased to have Strictly back. ""Strictly Come Dancing returned on Saturday night, providing a joyous burst of fun for viewers starved of sparkle and gagging for glitter,"" she wrote. But she wasn't impressed with the show's regular references to how they've adapted to the Covid-19 guidelines. Saturday's episode saw Nicola Adams paired with Katya Jones ""Claudia and Tess spend far too much time patiently explaining the show's Covid rules - we get it! - although the admirable ingenuity, planning skills and can-do determination to make the show happen are nothing short of miraculous."" Moir was confident the show could still thrive without Bruno's enthusiastic presence. ""Bruno Tonioli is absent this year, but I fear he won't be missed much in the shortened format; no Blackpool, no Clauditorium, fewer episodes,"" she wrote. Olympic boxing champion Nicola Adams made history by becoming the first celebrity to dance in a same sex pair, partnering up with Katya Jones. Moir wrote: ""Strictly's first same-sex partnership has garnered much attention, but what is the fuss about?"" Caroline Quentin with Johannes Radebe The Independent's Emma Bullimore,externalgave the show a maximum five stars, noting: ""Another fab-u-lous surprise awaits this year, as the pairings take place out and about across the country, captured in pre-recorded films. ""It's much more natural, less prolonged, and quite frankly a relief for everyone involved."" How do you film Strictly 2020 during a pandemic? BBC defends Strictly Come Dancing same-sex pairing She added: ""It's not a perfect show. Anton du Beke insists on singing (to the delight of nobody). And every member of the (much smaller) audience is wearing a mandatory plain black face mask, which feels stingy - could the budget not have stretched to a few sequins for the fans? ""But coming in from a grey day to glitterballs, glamour and smiles is a long-awaited injection of pure joy."" The Guardian's Heidi Stephens wrote a live blog,externalon Saturday night, declaring it was ""so good to be back"". She found the studio a little quiet though. ""Ah, we're in the studio and it's gone disco. It seems strange without an audience, but on the upside, no out-of-time clapping. ""Usually I'd bitch about how this show takes 90 minutes to do a pairing job that should take about ten, but I'm so Strictly-starved I'm prepared to go with it. Embrace the endless filler, everyone."" Viewers, including artist Grayson Perry, were also pleased to have Strictly to look forward to. Allow Twitter content?

"Instagram is being investigated by Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) over its handling of children's personal data on the platform. The social media app's owner Facebook could face a large fine if Instagram is found to have broken privacy laws. It comes amid reports Instagram failed to protect data, including allowing email addresses and phone numbers of those under 18 to be made public. Facebook said it rejected the claims but was cooperating with the DPC. A number of US tech giants have their European headquarters in Ireland, and the DPC is the lead European Union regulator under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in 2018. The DPC is responsible for protecting individuals' right to online privacy, and has the power to issue large fines. The Irish regulator is investigating whether Facebook has a legal basis for processing children's personal data and if it employs adequate protections and restrictions on Instagram for children. Separately, it is also looking at whether Facebook has adhered with GDPR requirements in relation to Instagram's profile and account settings. It is inquiring into whether Facebook is adequately protecting the data protection rights of children as vulnerable people. The minimum age for having an Instagram account is 13. Instagram targets rule-breaking influencers Facebook bans QAnon conspiracy theory accounts across all platforms Facebook 'Supreme Court' to begin work before US Presidential vote ""Instagram is a social media platform which is used widely by children in Ireland and across Europe,"" said Graham Doyle, a deputy commissioner with DPC. ""The DPC has been actively monitoring complaints received from individuals in this area and has identified potential concerns in relation to the processing of children's personal data on Instagram which require further examination."" According to reports, the investigation stems from a complaint from David Stier, a US-based data scientist who last year analysed profiles of almost 200,000 Instagram users across the world. He estimated that for over a year, at least 60 million users under the age of 18 were given the option to easily change their profiles into business accounts. Instagram business accounts require users to display their phone numbers and email addresses publicly, meaning that personal data belonging to many users is visible to other Instagram users. Data scientist David Stier is concerned that complete strangers can contact children using their emails and mobile numbers on Instagram The same personal information was also contained in the HTML source code of web pages accessed when using Instagram on a computer, meaning that it could be ""scraped"" by hackers. Mr Stier reported his findings to Facebook, buthe wrote in a Medium blog,externalthat Instagram had refused to mask the email addresses and phone numbers for business accounts. However, Facebook did decide to remove the contact information from the source code of Instagram pages. However, on Monday a Facebook spokeswoman told the BBC that Mr Stier's claims were based on a misunderstanding of its systems. ""We've always been clear that when people choose to set up a business account on Instagram, the contact information they shared would be publicly displayed. That's very different to exposing people's information. ""We've also made several updates to business accounts since the time of Mr Stier's mischaracterisation in 2019, and people can now opt out of including their contact information entirely."" Mr Stier has also alleged that hackers might have succeeded in stealing personal information from Instagram's website, after it was revealed in May 2019 thatcontact details relating to 49 million users were stored online in an unguarded databaseowned by a firm in India. ""Do we have a responsibility to keep kids' phone numbers and emails hidden so that strangers can't find them just by clicking a button?"" wrote Mr Stier. ""Speaking as a parent, I want to be assured that the experience Instagram offers to teens is as 'adult-overseen' as possible.""

"Wales is to go into a 17-day ""sharp, deep"" lockdown from Friday All non-essential shops, leisure facilities and places of worship in Wales must close Welsh primary schools and years 7 and 8 will return as usual after half term but older students must study at home All mixing between households in Wales will be banned, whether indoors or outside The 'firebreak' is the Wales's 'best chance' of regaining control of the virus - Mark Drakeford In England, talks have continued over whether Greater Manchester will enter tier 3 - with no agreement yet Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick says lives will be put at risk there if action isn't taken soon. Bolton MP Yasmin Qureshi has been hospitalised with Covid-19 The number of confirmed cases around the world has passed 40 million All bars and restaurants in Belgium closed for a month and a night-time curfew imposed amid ""tsunami"" of cases Italy has announced a new raft of measures to tighten restrictions amid a surge in cases Edited by Martha Buckley Thanks for joining our live coverage. We will be back with more coronavirus updates tomorrow morning. Your writers today have been Hamish Mackay, Francesca Gillett, Victoria Bisset, Lauren Turner, and Ella Wills. It's been another busy day for coronavirus news from the UK and around the world. French first lady Brigitte Macron is to self-isolate for seven days after coming into contact with someone who has been diagnosed with Covid-19. ""Brigitte Macron was in contact on Thursday 15 October with aperson who has been tested positive for Covid-19 this Monday, 19 October,"" French president Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement. ""In accordance with health authorities' recommendations, shewill self-isolate for seven days. Brigitte Macron has nosymptoms of the disease at this stage."" The government has issued a statement following talks this afternoon with local leaders in Manchester. No 10 wants Greater Manchester to move to the highest level of restrictions - tier three - butlocal leaders want better financial support before agreeing. ""A meeting between government and local leaders in Greater Manchester has concluded this afternoon following discussions throughout last week, over the weekend and this morning on measures necessary to protect the public,"" a government spokesman said. ""Disappointingly, we have still not been able to reach an agreement. ""This is particularly concerning against the backdrop of rising cases and hospitalisations in Greater Manchester. ""We are carefully considering next steps."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown should be used to build a ""resilient"" test and trace system. The 17-day lockdown - beginning on Friday at 18:00 BST - was announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford earlier today. Responding to the announcement, Mr Price said: ""A firebreak is a last resort and should only be used in an emergency. We are now in an emergency. ""The time the firebreak buys us must be used to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system in Wales, which means we can prevent being in the position we're currently in where the case numbers have risen to the point where they can overwhelm an already exhausted NHS. ""We also need to ensure the safeguarding of workplaces, and that sufficient financial support is available for businesses and their employees who will be directly impacted by this firebreak."" Poland has begun constructing a field hospital at a football stadium in the capital, Warsaw. Works at the PGE Narodowy stadium began on Saturday, the prime minister's office announced in a tweet on Monday morning. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Health Minister Adam Niedzielski said the field hospital would have a capacity of 500 beds. Other temporary facilities are being built elsewhere in the country. The announcement came as the number of daily cases in Poland reached a record high on Saturday, with 9,622 infections.The country has recorded more than 180,000 cases and 3,614 deaths since the pandemic began. âIf the number of cases increases at this pace, you must be aware that next week we can have 15,000 to 20,000 infections a day,â the health minister told a news conference. If you're just joining our coverage, here's a reminder of today's top US coronavirus stories: Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been seen travelling in his chauffeur-driven car without wearing a mask - against the advice of No 10. Members of the public face fines of Â£200 if they fail to wear a covering in taxis or private hire cars. There is an exemption for chauffeur-driven cars, but Downing Street said it had advised all its ministers to wear coverings. A No 10 spokesman said there were masks available in all ministerial cars. The BBC has contacted Mr Hancock's office for comment. Read the full story here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock insists the government is delivering ""more testing capacity"". He tells Jonathan Ashworth that ""batch testing"" is currently being trialled, and says funds have been given to local authorities to fund local contact tracing ""everywhere"". The health secretary also says the government is delivering ""more economic support"" and ""working with local authorities to deliver the local approach that is needed"". He urges the shadow health secretary to ""acknowledge and support"" the government's work. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asks Matt Hancock whether it is still the plan for there to be millions of tests a day. ""Results still aren't turned around in 24 hours,"" he says. ""When will they be turned around in 24 hours?"" ""The country is facing further restrictions because test and trace failed,"" he adds. Local health teams should be funded to do contact tracing, he says. Mr Ashworth calls for a short period of national lockdown - a so-called circuit-breaker - and asks whether it has been completely ruled out. ""The cost of delay could be a deeper, longer, fuller lockdown,"" he says. The health secretary then gives 

update on testing. He says the UK is now doing more than 300,000 tests a day, and that the government has now opened more than 500 tests sites, including new walk-in centres in Edinburgh, Dundee and Newcastle. Matt Hancock also talks about new technologies, including tests that can produce results as ""quickly as in 15 minutes"". He says they will be made available locally - starting with very high alert level regions. ""These tests have shown real promise and we are both buying them now and ramping up our ability to produce them in the UK,"" he says. Finally, the health secretary notes that ministers have ""laid regulations to support our roll out for both the flu and any Covid vaccination"". ""While no vaccine technology is certain we must be prepared to deploy a vaccine as soon as one is safely available,"" he says. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'We must have resolve' Quoting the WHO, Mr Hancock says it is ""unethical"" to let the virus grow. He says infection rates in Lancashire are ""among the highest in the country"" and continuing to rise, with hospital admissions doubling almost every fortnight. That is why, he adds, Lancashire has been moved to the highest tier of Covid restrictions.

Your Questions Answered We've been answering more of your questions about what new regulations in place across the UK mean for you. They include one from a reader who lives in a tier two area who wants to know if they can have dinner with their sister at a tier one restaurant, indoors. The answer is no, as you can't mix with anyone indoors if you live in a tier two area, as it's under high alert. You can meet outside though, as long as there aren't more than six of you. There are also questions on whether you can stay at a partner's house if you live in areas under different regulations (in short - it depends where you live, whether you have formed a bubble and whether there's childcare to take into consideration), and on the job support scheme.

French first lady Brigitte Macron is to self-isolate for seven days after coming into contact with someone who has been diagnosed with Covid-19. ""Brigitte Macron was in contact on Thursday 15 October with aperson who has been tested positive for Covid-19 this Monday, 19 October,"" French president Emmanuel Macron's office said in a statement. ""In accordance with health authorities' recommendations, shewill self-isolate for seven days. Brigitte Macron has nosymptoms of the disease at this stage."" The government has issued a statement following talks this afternoon with local leaders in Manchester. No 10 wants Greater Manchester to move to the highest level of restrictions - tier three - butlocal leaders want better financial support before agreeing. ""A meeting between government and local leaders in Greater Manchester has concluded this afternoon following discussions throughout last week, over the weekend and this morning on measures necessary to protect the public,"" a government spokesman said. ""Disappointingly, we have still not been able to reach an agreement. ""This is particularly concerning against the backdrop of rising cases and hospitalisations in Greater Manchester. ""We are carefully considering next steps."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price says Wales' ""firebreak"" lockdown should be used to build a ""resilient"" test and trace system. The 17-day lockdown - beginning on Friday at 18:00 BST - was announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford earlier today. Responding to the announcement, Mr Price said: ""A firebreak is a last resort and should only be used in an emergency. We are now in an emergency. ""The time the firebreak buys us must be used to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system in Wales, which means we can prevent being in the position we're currently in where the case numbers have risen to the point where they can overwhelm an already exhausted NHS. ""We also need to ensure the safeguarding of workplaces, and that sufficient financial support is available for businesses and their employees who will be directly impacted by this firebreak.""

The announcement came as the number of daily cases in Poland reached a record high on Saturday, with 9,622 infections.The country has recorded more than 180,000 cases and 3,614 deaths since the pandemic began. âIf the number of cases increases at this pace, you must be aware that next week we can have 15,000 to 20,000 infections a day,â the health minister told a news conference. If you're just joining our coverage, here's a reminder of today's top US coronavirus stories: Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been seen travelling in his chauffeur-driven car without wearing a mask - against the advice of No 10. Members of the public face fines of Â£200 if they fail to wear a covering in taxis or private hire cars. There is an exemption for chauffeur-driven cars, but Downing Street said it had advised all its ministers to wear coverings. A No 10 spokesman said there were masks available in all ministerial cars. The BBC has contacted Mr Hancock's office for comment. Read the full story here. Health Secretary Matt Hancock insists the government is delivering ""more testing capacity"". He tells Jonathan Ashworth that ""batch testing"" is currently being trialled, and says funds have been given to local authorities to fund local contact tracing ""everywhere"". The health secretary also says the government is delivering ""more economic support"" and ""working with local authorities to deliver the local approach that is needed"". He urges the shadow health secretary to ""acknowledge and support"" the government's work. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth asks Matt Hancock whether it is still the plan for there to be millions of tests a day. ""Results still aren't turned around in 24 hours,"" he says. ""When will they be turned around in 24 hours?"" ""The country is facing further restrictions because test and trace failed,"" he adds. Local health teams should be funded to do contact tracing, he says. Mr Ashworth calls for a short period of national lockdown - a so-called circuit-breaker - and asks whether it has been completely ruled out. ""The cost of delay could be a deeper, longer, fuller lockdown,"" he says. The health secretary then gives 

update on testing. He says the UK is now doing more than 300,000 tests a day, and that the government has now opened more than 500 tests sites, including new walk-in centres in Edinburgh, Dundee and Newcastle. Matt Hancock also talks about new technologies, including tests that can produce results as ""quickly as in 15 minutes"". He says they will be made available locally - starting with very high alert level regions. ""These tests have shown real promise and we are both buying them now and ramping up our ability to produce them in the UK,"" he says. Finally, the health secretary notes that ministers have ""laid regulations to support our roll out for both the flu and any Covid vaccination"". ""While no vaccine technology is certain we must be prepared to deploy a vaccine as soon as one is safely available,"" he says. This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'We must have resolve' Quoting the WHO, Mr Hancock says it is ""unethical"" to let the virus grow.

"Local leaders say more financial support is needed for Greater Manchester's businesses if tighter restrictions are to be imposed Further delays to a decision on Greater Manchester's Covid restrictions will ""put people's lives at risk"", the communities secretary has said. Robert Jenrick said he hoped he could reach an agreement with the region's MPs ""in the next day or two"". Local leaders want better financial support before agreeing to a move to the top tier of rules, which would force some businesses to close. Talks are continuing after a weekend of discussions. Mr Jenrick indicated that Greater Manchester could be offered a financial package similar to the ""tens of millions"" of pounds of support agreed for Lancashire and the Liverpool City Region - the two parts of England already in tier three. A key sticking point of the dispute is that Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham wants the government to reintroduce the 80% furlough scheme used during the UK's first lockdown, instead ofthe new Job Support Schemewhich covers 67% of the wages of people affected by tier three closures. Mr Burnham said businesses that would be closed under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions - including pubs, bookmakers and gyms - ""are places where people are on low wages"" and that two-thirds pay is not enough. But Mr Jenrick told BBC Breakfast the Manchester talks had gone on ""too long"" as coronavirus case numbers remain ""seriously high"". ""Delay I'm afraid will only make the situation worse, will only put people's lives at risk, and will only make the economic fallout for the city worse in the long term,"" he added. ""We do now need to take action. I hope that we can reach agreement but one way or another, we need to draw this to a conclusion."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday thathe might ""need to intervene""if local leaders did not accept a move to tier three. What Covid tier is my area in? Tier system: The street split down the middle What is a circuit-breaker? Meanwhile, people in Wales will be told from Friday to stay at home, and pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will shut,as part of a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown until 9 November. It comes asa two-week school closure begins in Northern Irelandas part of a tightening of restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. Scotland continues to draw up plans for a three-tier framework of restrictions, similar to England's, to account for regional differences in Covid rates and isolate areas of higher prevalence. On Monday the UK recorded a further 18,804 coronavirus cases and 80 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. BBC deputy political editor Vicki Young said Treasury sources insisted Greater Manchester would not get a more generous offer on wages than the Job Support Scheme provides, but pointed to other financial support packages agreed with tier three areas. On Sunday, Liverpool City Region's metro mayor Steve Rotheram saidhis area would receive an additional Â£44m,externaland a similar package worth Â£42mwas given to local leaders in Lancashirelast week. Mr Burnhamsaid he had a ""constructive call""with the PM's team on Sunday, but on Monday morning he told Sky News: ""I'm not going to roll over at the sight of a cheque."" Nottingham's Labour council leader David Mellenhas also called for more support for businesses in the city if it is moved to tier three. However, the Labour leader of Manchester City Council, Sir Richard Leese, said the row was not just about money and questioned the effectiveness of ""blanket"" business closures, instead suggesting a shielding programme for those most at risk from Covid-19. And mayors and council leaders in the Liverpool City Region have written to the prime minister asking for an ""immediate review"" of the decision to close gyms and leisure centres in the area as part of tier three measures, pointing out that in Lancashire, which is also in tier three, they have not been required to close. They are calling on the government to provide the scientific evidence supporting the move and if they are unable to do so, allow them to reopen. How are tiers decided for different areas? When an area goes in to tier three - the ""very high alert"" category - this unlocks enhanced financial support from the government. In the Liverpool City Region, some of the funds will be used both to bolster contact tracing, to enhance compliance, and to support people who are clinically extremely vulnerable. This is worth Â£14m - and a similar package in Lancashire is worth Â£12m. But following negotiations, both areas have also been given a further Â£30m in ""business support"". Whitehall sources have told the BBC that Greater Manchester would be offered no less generous terms than Lancashire or Liverpool. On a per capita basis, that could mean potentially Â£70-80m being made available from central government, in return for enhanced restrictions. Talks are also under way between the government and local authority leaders in South Yorkshire. Council leaders want a package of support to include more resources for the NHS in the area - and are clear they won't be ""bounced"" into accepting a move to tier three. Dr Indeewar Kapila, an intensive care consultant in Greater Manchester, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that critical care units have capacity at the moment but Manchester's rate - which was 431 cases per 100,000 in the week to 13 October - was ""extremely high"". The prime minister's official spokesman said in Greater Manchester the number of new cases in people over the age of 60 had tripled in the most recent 15 days of full data - from 89 cases per 100,000 on 27 September to 282 per 100,000 on 12 October. The spokesman said all free intensive care capacity could be used by 28 October and could pass the peak seen in the first wave by 2 November, according to the government's pandemic modelling group, SPI-M. This is based on a ""best-case"" assumption that the number of intensive care patients would take 14 days to double. The projections suggest coronavirus patients would take up the entire current intensive care capacity by 8 November and the entire surge capacity by 12 November. It comes as Greater Manchester MP Yasmin Qureshi, who represents Bolton South East,said she is in hospital with pneumonia two weeks after testing positive for Covid-19. Hospitals in the North West are incredibly busy, but talk of them being overwhelmed with Covid patients is somewhat premature. In the spring the number of admissions across the region went from under 100 a day to over 400 in the space of a week. Cases have been rising much more gradually in recent weeks. In fact there are signs they may have started levelling off at around 200 cases a day. The hospitals in and around Manchester and Liverpool have borne the brunt of the pressures. Particular concern has been expressed about intensive care,with reports that more than 80% of beds in Manchester are occupied,external. That is not unusual - last winter similar occupancy rates were seen. In fact, this is one of the difficulties the NHS faces with Covid - it works so close to capacity in normal times that an extra pressure causes real problems. But again the local NHS is not yet in the position it was in the spring when it had to take emergency measures to open up extra intensive care beds by cancelling non-Covid work.

"This video can not be played Pupils and staff at Belfast Model School for Girls react to school closures Almost 1,500 positive cases of coronavirus have been recorded in Northern Ireland schools since their August reopening, Peter Weir has said. The education minister revealed the figure on the same day that schools began a two-week closure, aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19. Mr Weir said the figure of 1,491 cases was ""the overall school population"" - taking in teachers, staff and students. It is a cumulative figure from 24 August to 13 October, he added. The minister said there are about 333,000 students at schools in Northern Ireland and about 19,000 staff. He said the number of positive tests worked out at around 0.4% of the school population, which also means about one in every 250 pupils and staff members. The education minister said schools had mostly had cases of single individuals testing positive. In early September a Department of Education official told Stormont's education committee there had been 88 Covid-19 cases in 64 schools duringthe first two weeks of term. The education minister has now told assembly members there were 1,491 positive cases of individuals within schools during roughly the first seven weeks of term. But that statistic still leaves a lot of questions unanswered. How many individual schools have been affected and how many of those cases are pupils and how many are staff? How many schools have had to send pupils home to self-isolate for 14 days as a result of a positive case and how many pupils in total have been out of school for two weeks as a result? The latest attendance rate for pupils is 93.7% but those at home self-isolating are still marked as present if they're receiving work, so the rate tells us little about the level of disruption Covid-19 is causing in schools. ""I hope the Public Health Agency will be in a position fairly soon to give a more detailed figure,"" he told assembly members on Monday. The two-week closure of Northern Ireland's schools, which includes the half-term holiday, is set to be reviewed on 2 November. Restrictions imposed on businesses in Northern Ireland by the executivecame in at 18:00 BST on Friday.,external Restaurants and cafes are now limited to takeaway and delivery services for four weeks. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's new restrictions - in 60 seconds Restrictions have also been imposed on hotels, the beauty industry and on indoor and contact sport. A further six Covid-19 related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland by the Department of Health, bringing its total to 621. The department also reported an additional 820 positive cases of the virus, meaning there have been 28,040. There were 3,869 individuals tested in the previous 24 hours. Restaurants and cafes closed their doors to sit-in customers from 18:00 BST on Friday in NI Mr Weir has vowed to oppose any move to extend the school closures in Northern Ireland beyond two weeks. The minister said there had been little evidence that schools were significantly contributing to rising Covid-19 numbers. Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy said his party would have been prepared to back a longer closure, but they were ""content"" with the decision.

A fund to help businesses forced to shut due to increased coronavirus restrictions is due to open for applications on Monday. The Department of Finance expects the scheme to cost Â£35m pounds over four weeks. The fund is only available to businesses forced to close or where the use of premises is restricted and is an extension of the help already in place for businesses in the Derry City and Strabane council area. Policemade a number of arrests and handed out fixed penalty noticesat a protest against the restrictions at Stormont on Sunday. As well as the closure of the hospitality sector (apart from deliveries and takeaways), off-licences and supermarkets are not to sell alcohol after 20:00 and fast-food and takeaway premises are to close at 23:00. Driving instructors must stop offering lessons and as a result, the Department of Infrastructure has also decided to suspend driving tests. Other restrictions laid out in the guidance are: No indoor sport or organised contact sport involving mixing of households, other than at elite level No mass events involving more than 15 people (except for allowed outdoor sporting events where the relevant number for that will continue to apply) Close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians to close - apart from those relating to the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics Mobile hairdressers and make-up artists - also classed as close-contact services - prohibited from working in homes Gyms to remain open for individual training but no classes permitted Places of worship to remain open but face coverings mandatory when entering and exiting Wedding ceremonies and civil partnerships to be limited to 25 people with no receptions.

"Bank of England (BoE) boss Andrew Bailey has said the UK faces ""an unprecedented level of economic uncertainty."" Britain's economy shrank by 20% in the three months to June as it battled with the coronavirus pandemic, the biggest fall of any large advanced economy. His remarks come as tighter coronavirus restrictions are imposed across the UK. Mr Bailey warned that there is significant risk of economic growth continuing to be lower than expected. The governor told an online event on Sunday that he expected output at the end of the third quarter to be 10% lower than the end of 2019. ""Of course, that is heightened now by the return of Covid... the risks remain very heavily skewed towards the downside,"" he said during the video conference for central banks, which was hosted by the Group of Thirty, a panel of economic policymakers and senior bankers. IMF upgrades 2020 economic forecast but warns of a slower 2021 Bank deputy governor warns against negative interest rates UK economic growth slows despite restaurant boost Mr Bailey said that it was best for policymakers to act aggressively, rather than cautiously, in the face of uncertainty, He also touched on the ongoing debate over setting negative interest rates, which would bring the cost of borrowing below zero. ""Our assessment of negative interest rates, from the experience elsewhere, is that they probably appear to work better in a more wholesale financial market context, and probably better in a nascent economic upturn,"" he said. If interest rates are negative, the BoE charges for any deposits it holds on behalf of the banks. That encourages banks to lend the money to business rather than deposit it. But with interest rates already low, it is not clear how much negative rates would help spur new activity. During the same event on Sunday, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spoke about growing concerns over sharp increases in debt levels in poorer countries. IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva says suspending debt payments is only a temporary measure In April, officials from the ""Group of 20"" (G20) countries with the largest and fastest-growing economies agreed to suspend debt repayments and interest payments for the world's poorest countries until the end of the year. The G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative has helped 44 countries defer $5bn (Â£3.8bn) repayments to spend on tackling the coronavirus crisis instead. However, the IMF's managing director Kristalina Georgieva said that urgent action was still needed in the form of restructuring debts. ""We are buying some time, but we have to face reality that there are much more decisive actions ahead of us,"" she said. ""Doing too little too late is costly to debtors, costly also to creditors."" She added that global debt levels were predicted to reach 100% of gross domestic product in 2021. In early October,the IMF said the global economy is still in deep recession, despite the fact that it has predicted a global economic contraction of 4.4%, which is more moderate than it envisioned in June.

"Bank of England (BoE) boss Andrew Bailey has said the UK faces ""an unprecedented level of economic uncertainty."" Britain's economy shrank by 20% in the three months to June as it battled with the coronavirus pandemic, the biggest fall of any large advanced economy. His remarks come as tighter coronavirus restrictions are imposed across the UK. Mr Bailey warned that there is significant risk of economic growth continuing to be lower than expected.

"A decision on further restrictions is due to be announced later A decision on a ""short, sharp"" national lockdown across Wales is due to be announced later. First Minister Mark Drakeford is set to make an announcement about a two or three-week ""firebreak"" around midday. The Welsh Government cabinet is meeting this morning to make a final decision over thecircuit-breaker, after considering advice from experts. But mounting speculation about a two-week lockdown to slow down the virus has beenfuelled by a letter. Wales director of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, John Pockett, wrote to members on Friday, saying a lockdown would start at 18:00 on 23 October and end on 9 November, which would ""take us back to the situation in March"". How many people have died with Covid in Wales?

It comes as half-term is due to start on Monday 26 October, but it is not clear if a lockdown will coincide with that. The Welsh Government has been urged to consider a four-week shutdown - or even longer - to turn around the surge in coronavirus cases, that has been almost a thousand daily cases for three of the last five days. ""In the first week of a circuit-breaker, you would still see cases probably going up because there would be people who caught it before the measures came in,"" Jamie Jenkins, former head of health analysis at the Office for National Statistics, toldBBC Radio Wales. ""You might be looking at at least two and a half weeks before you see any improvement, and then if you're looking a the data, you'll probably want to see the rate coming down to the rate we saw about a month ago. ""You're probably looking at two, three, four weeks - and then having to say we have to go a bit further - that is the difficulty of putting a time limit on a circuit-break when you are trying to assess how long this is going to be."" Seventeen areas in Wales currently have local lockdown rules in place Currently about 2.3 million people in Wales are living in communities underlocal lockdown rules- 15 of Wales' 22 counties plus Bangor and Llanelli - where coronavirus infection rates are at their highest. Restrictions include a ban on travelling outside of those areas without ""reasonable excuse"", the ending of extended households or bubbles and people can only meet other households outdoors. Latest figures showed16,982 people tested positive for the virus in the UKon Sunday, withalmost a thousand in Wales. Businesses across Walessaid they were anxious to find out whether they would be told to close. Welsh hospitality bosses warned a Wales-wide temporary lockdown could put jobs at risk for almost a third of their 140,000-strong workforce, as well as the 40,000 employed in their supply chain. Hospitality bosses says the sector needs government financial support to survive a winter lockdown ""It's going to be a really difficult time and I can see a lot of business going to the wall,"" David Chapman, executive director in Wales of industry body UK Hospitality, toldBBC Radio Wales. ""I can see jobs being shed as furlough is coming to an end. We need full support, if we don't get support now we are going to lose people in large numbers.

Mr Morgan, who has been part of talks with government, said financial support to Welsh businesses will be ""fundamental"" to plans of ministers as ""businesses are anxious to know"" the new measures.

"The leaders of the UK's Anglican Churches have warned the government that its new Brexit bill could set a ""disastrous precedent"". The Internal Market Bill could damage the relationship between the UK's four nations, say the archbishops of York and Canterbury and the heads of the Church in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. It comes as peers have their first say on the legislation. The bill would allow aspects of the EU Withdrawal Agreement to be superseded. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told MPs the bill could ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"". MPs overwhelmingly backed the Internal Market Billlast month but resistance is expected in the Lords, where Boris Johnson does not have a majority. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, Archbishop of Wales John Davies, Archbishop of Armagh John McDowell and the Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church Mark Strange havewritten a rare joint letter in the Financial Times,external. The religious leaders raised concerns about the potential impact the legislation could have on the Good Friday Agreement ""on which peace and stability within and between the UK and Ireland depends"". The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses The archbishops add: ""The bill is, of course, not just concerned with domestic law. It currently asks the country's highest law-making body to equip a government minister to break international law. ""This has enormous moral, as well as political and legal, consequences. We believe this would create a disastrous precedent."" A number of Tory MPs have criticised the intervention but Archbishop McDowell told BBC Radio 4's Today church leaders had a role to play in maintaining the ""civic dialogue"" that was an essential part of a healthy democracy. ""Pretty much every political act, and every piece of legislation or social policy, has an ethical element to it,"" he said. The EU has warned the UK it will face legal action if the clauses in the bill relating to checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain and subsidies to Northern Irish businesses are not removed. This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""We hope the EU will change their position"" The government has said it is a necessary ""safety net"" to protect the UK's internal market in case differences over the Northern Ireland protocol cannot be resolved through the formal resolution process established by the two sides, known as the Joint Committee. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has held talks with EU commissioner Maros Sefcovic to discuss how the legally binding Withdrawal Agreement - which set out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU earlier this year - is being implemented in relation to Northern Ireland and citizen's rights. He will make a statement to MPs later about the meeting and the chances of the two sides agreeing a trade deal before the UK leaves the single market and customs union on 31 December, when the transition period ends. The UK and EU are at loggerheads over the terms of their future economic partnership - with talks effectively stalled amid disagreements over fishing access and competition issues. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday,Mr Gove said the door was ""still ajar""for a deal but only if the EU moved ground in key areas. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart David Frost are due to speak by video link shortly. Mr Sefcovic told reporters the EU would work ""until the last minute"" to nail down an agreement but it had to be fair for both sides. He also said he hoped to resolve all outstanding issues relating to the Withdrawal Agreement in the coming weeks but the time left to do so was ""really very, very short"". What do UK and EU want? All you need to know about Brexit? About 110 peers have signed up to speak during the Second Reading debate of the Internal Market Bill, the first parliamentary hurdle for the legislation during its passage through the Lords. It is likely to face fierce opposition from Labour, Liberal Democrat and cross-bench peers while several senior Tories, including ex-leader Lord Howard, have said they are unconvinced by the government's promise of a further, specific vote in Parliament before the powers in question can be used. Lord Judge, the former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, has tabled what is called a ""motion of regret"" which cannot stop the bill but, if passed, would show the level of opposition within the chamber. Meanwhile, in other related developments, companieshave been told to step up preparationsso they are not ""caught out"" by new post-Brexit trade rules. And International Trade Secretary Liz Truss has chaired the first meeting of a revamped Board of Trade with a panel of advisers including the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott.
