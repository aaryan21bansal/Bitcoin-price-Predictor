"Employers are planning the lowest number of job cuts for over six years, as the economy reopens after the pandemic. Redundancy figures for June from the Insolvency Service saw 15,661 positions put at risk in Great Britain. Last June saw nearly ten times that number, the worst on record. The reduction in expected redundancies comes despite the imminent end of the furlough scheme which was designed to protect jobs during the pandemic. Employers planning 20 or more redundancies have to file a form called HR1 notifying government at the start of the process. This data gives an early indication of moves in the labour market, months before they show up in the official unemployment figures. Proposed redundancies have been on a downward trend since September, despite two lockdowns being imposed across most of the UK during that period. June saw the lowest monthly total since February 2015. Redundancy figures from the Office for National Statistics have shown a similar trend, a few months later. ""The data suggest that there is no spike in redundancies coming in July or August,"" says Xiaowei Xu, senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. ""The labour market is in a much better position than anyone expected at the start of the pandemic, and it shows how well the furlough scheme has worked,"" The latest numbers are the lowest since the Insolvency Service tightened up reporting guidelines, according to Tony Wilson of the Institute for Employment Studies. Before that, it was more common for firms to fail to file the necessary paperwork when planning redundancies, leading to artificially lower figures, he says. The number of HR1 forms filed has also been falling this year, with 179 forms filed by 151 different employers. That's the lowest number of forms since 2014, despite the winding down of the furlough scheme, where the government has supported jobs in the pandemic by paying wages when employers cannot. From July, employers will have to pay 10% of employees' wages, on top of pension contributions and employer's National Insurance. That rises to 20% in August, until the scheme finishes completely at the end of September. ""Anyone who has been on furlough this year has already cost their employers money - so their employers must be keen to keep them on. It's not surprising that they are not being made redundant in large numbers,"" says Ms Xu. A total of 11.6 million jobs have been furloughed during the pandemic, though only 2.4 million were still on furlough at the end of May. The success of the furlough scheme and the vaccine programme have lead many economists to cut their forecasts of how many jobs would be lost in the pandemic. ""By the time the furlough scheme ends on 30 September, the economy is likely to be strong enough to support a level of employment not far off where it is now. In fact, there is evidence that firms are finding it increasingly difficult to hire workers, especially in industries such as transport and manufacturing,"" says Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics. ""I think it's likely that many firms have already made and communicated their plans and that with the easing of restrictions happening on schedule next week, we just won't see any significant increase in redundancy notifications over the next few months,"" says Mr Wilson. This video can not be played As furlough support reduces we hear from a worker who has been in and out of work over 15 months. Until recently, HR1 data were not routinely published, except for in Northern Ireland. Last year the BBC began requesting these figures through the Freedom of Information Act, revealing the extraordinary increase in redundancy plans through thespring and summer of 2020. This year, the Insolvency Service has started to publish these figures every month on its website. The data only covers firms proposing 20 or more job cuts, so smaller firms are not picked up by these figures. Employers sometimes notify more redundancies than they eventually make. The figures are not classified as Official Statistics, which are subject to rigorous quality control procedures. Data for Northern Ireland is published by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency as part of its monthly Labour Market Report.

"Large businesses have said they will maintain a cautious approach to bringing staff back to the office despite the lifting of final Covid restrictions in England on Monday. The government announced yesterday that it will no longer instruct people to work at home from 19 July. But firms spoken to by the BBC said they did not plan to bring all staff back to the office. Many businesses said they will opt for a staggered approach for employees. Deloitte said it will increase the number of staff allowed to work in its offices to 50% capacity from next week. But the accountancy firm expects that level to stay in place until September. NatWest said that it will bring staff back to the office from 19 July but it will only be a small number of ""priority workers"". Covid: Should I be working from home or going back to the office? How do you feel about going back to the office? Insurance group Aviva said it expects ""to see more of our people returning"". But a spokesman said that ""the vast majority of people at Aviva want to work flexibly in future"" and employees will combine going into the office with working from home. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that final restrictions aimed at stopping the spread of Covid will be lifted in England from 19 July, including the guidance on office working. Butthe government said,externalthat it ""would expect and recommend a gradual return"" of workers to offices ""over the summer"". Deloitte currently operates its offices at 30% capacity and employees have to book desks. A spokeswoman for the firm said it had always intended to take a ""gradual approach"" to moving staff back to its sites. Deloitte will allow more people back to its offices from Monday It estimates that it will take between six and eight weeks to prepare its offices to deal with 100% capacity which it expects to reach in September. NatWest said a ""very small number of people"" will be invited back to its offices in England from Monday for roles ""that can't really be done from home"". These include market traders as well as people who work in NatWest's treasury department and roles where employees need to meet clients. It also said ""people who would rather work in the office for wellbeing reasons"" can return to its sites from Monday. Accountancy firm KPMG has allowed people to work from its offices if they made a request to their manager. From next week, they will no longer need permission to do so but the firm has also introduced a ""four-day fortnight"" hybrid model of working. It means that KPMG employees spend four days working in the office and the rest of the fortnight either at home or at client sites. ""It makes sense that the order to work from home if possible is removed at this stage,"" said Confederation of British Industry policy director, Michael Fell. ""The reality is that many firms are well-advanced in their plans and are proceeding with hybrid working models, just as the government advises. Roger Barker, policy director of the Institute of Directors (IoD) industry group, said: ""Businesses across the country will welcome the opportunity to begin to return to relative normality from next week."" However, he criticised the government for failing to provide adequate guidance on areas such as wearing face masks which, from Monday, will cease to be mandatory but will be recommended. Dr Barker said there has been ""real frustration about the mixed messages"" businesses have been receiving from the government. ""The latest guidance has shifted the responsibility from the government to businesses by removing mandatory rules on things like face masks and replacing them with voluntary recommendations,"" he said. ""Whilst it is right that companies should be allowed to take decisions based on their own unique circumstances, it is vital that government provides businesses with best practice in developing their own policies.""

"MPs have approved compulsory vaccinations for care home staff in England, but a number of Conservatives rebels voiced anger at the plans. From October, anyone working in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home in England must have two vaccine doses unless they have a medical exemption. The House of Commons approved the regulations by 319 votes to 246. But Tory MPs criticised the government for not publishing an impact assessment of the policy before the vote. Health minister Helen Whately told MPs the ""impact assessment is being worked on"". Almost30,000 more care home residents in England and Wales died during the coronavirus outbreakthan during the same period in 2019, ONS figures released this month showed. Ministers have previously expressed concern about the low take-up of the vaccine among some care home staff. What did the government do about care homes and coronavirus? How are the care home visiting rules changing? Care homes face staffing exodus over Covid jabs Conservative former minister Mark Harper, who chairs the lockdown sceptic Covid Recovery Group, said: ""If there's uncertainty, share the uncertainty with the House. ""It isn't good enough to expect us to vote on something that is difficult and controversial and complicated, and not share the information with the House that the minister has at her disposal. It is an abuse. It's not good enough."" Conservative MP William Wragg said he was ""in despair"", adding: ""The government is treating this House with utter contempt. Ninety minutes on a statutory instrument to fundamentally change the balance of human rights in this country is nothing short of a disgrace."" Mr Wragg went on to raise the case of a care worker who fears losing her job as a result of the policy, asking: ""Is that what we're prepared to do to our fellow citizens as a Conservative government? Labour's Rachael Maskell added: ""We're having to make a decision in the House this evening on the balance of risk and therefore we haven't been given the data because the impact assessment hasn't come forward."" Deputy Speaker Nigel Evans said it was a ""totally unsatisfactory"" situation and he would raise the issue with the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle. Care minister Ms Whately said guidance would be forthcoming, but suggested managers could discuss the vaccine with staff or look at an alternative role for those who did not want to be vaccinated. But she acknowledged there were not ""that many roles"" that did not involve being in the care home. She said in that situation, if a staff member did not want to be vaccinated, then a notice period could follow with a ""fair process"". Care organisations have previously warned that compulsory vaccinations could cause significant difficulties in a sector that already struggles to recruit enough people. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned compulsion was ""a blunt instrument that carries its own risks"". Governments inScotland, Wales andNorthern Irelandhave said they have no plans to make Covid jabs mandatory for care home staff. The move to mandatory vaccinations for care home staff in England follows a consultation by the Department of Health and Social Care, launched in April, two months after the government said it had met its target of offering all front-line care workers a first dose of a vaccine by mid-February. At the time, it said 47% of English care homes for older people had more than a fifth of staff yet to take up the vaccine, despite staff at all eligible care homes having been offered vaccines, with the vast majority of homes having had repeat visits by vaccine teams. On Tuesday, theUK reported,externala further 36,660 cases and 50 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. Almost 30,000 more care home deaths than last year Care homes face staffing exodus over Covid jabs Jabs to be compulsory for England care home staff Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic NY case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Scotland is to move to level zero of Covid restrictions on 19 July, but mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for ""some time"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the planned easing had to be modified due to the spread of the Delta variant. The move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals. However, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the return of workers to offices is to be delayed. Ms Sturgeon said ""sensible precautions"" had to be maintained while the vaccine programme continues. She said she still hoped Scotland could move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions. Live: Latest from Nicola Sturgeon's Holyrood statement What rules are changing and when? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Ministers also plan to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate - as long as they have had two doses of vaccine - at that point. Ms Sturgeon said a decision would be made before the new academic term on whether or not school pupils who are the close contacts of positive cases will have to self-isolate. And fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as of Monday, as long as they take a test after arrival. However, the first minister told MSPs that mandatory precautions like the mandatory wearing of face coverings and guidance on ventilation and hand hygiene would remain in place ""for some time"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""We must stick to a cautious approach. We are easing restrictions next week, but we are not abandoning them. ""And even when we move beyond level zero, we will continue to require some baseline measures such as face coverings."" Ministers say the success of the vaccine programme makes it possible to ease restrictions Scotland has been hit by a record-breaking third wave of Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, with the faster-spreading Delta variant putting pressure on health services. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs - who were recalled for a virtual session despite Holyrood being in recess - that the spike in infections had ""levelled off"", and that the vaccine programme was weakening the link between case number and severe illnesses. She said ""a gradual approach"" to easing restrictions stood the best chance of being sustainable and of minimising loss of life. Nicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said ""I will always err on the side of going more cautiously"". England is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. But Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasis restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option ""for good headlines"". A statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time. Despite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned. An obvious point of divergence from England is face coverings. While laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (they'll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear they'll stay here ""for as long as necessary"". It feels like they'll be one of the last measures to go. The move to level zero means: Up to eight adults from four households can meet indoors at home, and up to 10 can meet in a pub or restaurant - with no need to pre-book a two-hour slot. Up to 15 people from 15 households can meet outdoors, and up to 200 can attend weddings and funerals. Plans have, however, been modified in light of high case numbers: Hospitality venues will be required to close at midnight. Some physical distancing rules are to be maintained outdoors, with different groups of 15 required to stay at least 1m (3ft 3in) apart in public spaces - meaning there may be limits on some outdoor events. A ""gradual"" return to office working was due to be part of the move to level zero, but this has now been put back to 9 August. Ms Sturgeon said the move was ""not a complete and wholesale lifting of all restrictions"", but it said it ""does restore yet more freedom to all of us"". This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says lifting all restrictions right now would put people at risk Business groups broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers ""moving the goalposts"" at the last minute by altering their plans. The Scottish Retail Consortium said firms ""will be reassured the sense of progress is being maintained, even if the pace has slowed"". The Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant ""should hopefully generate some extra passing trade"", but said there was ""less good news"" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue. And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was ""another encouraging milestone"", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be ""a bitter blow for employees and employers alike"". Some restrictions on outdoor gatherings will continue The virtual session of parliament gave opposition politicians the chance to question the first minister about the plans. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ""we can't continue asking the public to sacrifice so much of their lives"". He said: ""The balance has to tilt further in favour of moving forward - we have to make progress back to normality. The public have done what was expected of them, now it's time for this SNP government to deliver."" Labour's Anas Sarwar said the changes to restrictions were welcome, but said ""inconsistent decision making and communications"" was hitting the response to the pandemic. He said: ""The high rate of cases is a cause for concern and I'm afraid what the first minister has presented today is not a clear strategy to cope with the new phase of the pandemic."" Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater said she had ""concerns about reducing restrictions while case numbers are so high"", voicing fears that it could lead to a vaccine-resistant variant emerging. And outgoing Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said changes to self-isolation rules must be made ""urgently"", with ""thousands of key workers"" having to quarantine despite testing negative.

"Cafes and restaurants are open in Wales but restrictions remain The extent Wales will go to in scrapping coronavirus restrictions will be announced on Wednesday. Ministers are expected to settle on their plans for reducing the legal rules that have governed businesses and social contact during the pandemic. But First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he will not abandon them ""wholesale"". His government has already announced face masks will continue to be required on public transport. It is not expected Mr Drakeford will move as fast as the UK government, with Boris Johnson planning toscrap most rules in Englandon 19 July. The Scottish government is hoping it can lift most legal restrictions on 9 August, but has said it will keeplaws on the use of face masksfor some time. Despite rising cases in Wales, officials believe the vaccination programme has weakened the link between catching Covid, serious illness and death. Wales moving to 'increasing normality' on Covid People will still have to wear face masks in Wales Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Mr Drakeford's cabinet will make the final decision on Wednesday morning, with a statement to the Welsh Parliament expected in the afternoon. He is expected to confirm whether Wales can now move to ""alert level one"" - with the easing of some restrictions that had been delayed because of the Delta variant. They included the reopening of ice rinks and allowing six people from any household to meet in private homes. He is also expected to publish an updated coronavirus control plan which will set out a future alert level zero, with fewer legal restrictions. But this is not expected to be implemented immediately, with the next three-weekly review not due until early August. Taliesin fears his competitors in England are gaining an advantage as rinks remain closed in Wales Thirteen-year-old Taliesin has not been able to train at Ice Arena Wales in Cardiff since the pandemic hit. His parents have been taking him to Coventry or Sheffield to train on weekends, sometimes setting off at 03:00 BST. His mother Ann-Marie said: ""It's been really, really challengingâ¦ it has been a difficult time to keep momentum up and keep trainingâ¦ it's a big commitment financially and in terms of time and pressure."" ""With competitions coming back now we really need the rink in Cardiff opened more than ever because other people are going to start getting an advantage over us being able to train when we can only go up on the weekend,"" Taliesin toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales. Ministers have already announced they willkeep laws requiring face masks on public transportand in health and social care. They are also deciding if they should be mandatory in shops, a move backed by trade unions and Plaid Cymru. Wales' case rate on Tuesday stood at 138.2 per 100,000 people, with the number of positive tests running at an average of 623 a day. That compares with 466 a day the week before, and about 77 a day a month ago. But officials say the link between cases and serious illness and death has been weakened. At the start of July, only 1.1% of Covid cases were admitted to hospital. The Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called for a ""detailed plan for the restoration of freedoms in Wales"". ""Given the data trends, the Welsh Labour government now has the flexibility to provide families, workers and businesses with their plan for restoring all freedoms and releasing restrictions in Wales,"" he said. Plaid Cymru's deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth criticised the Welsh government's plans for a press conference on Wednesday evening, saying it would clash with a debate in the Senedd calling for a Wales-only public inquiry into ministers' handling of the Covid pandemic. ""Throughout the pandemic, we've seen announcement after announcement made by press release, rather than in our Parliament where proper scrutiny can take place. Sadly, here's another example of a government snub,"" he said. The hospitality sector has called for social-distancing rules to be relaxed Although most businesses are now allowed to trade, under current restrictions they must do so under social-distancing laws. These apply to pubs, cafes and restaurants andthe sector has lobbied for them to be scrapped. Nightclubs remain closed in Wales, while organisers of large events are waiting to find out if they can take place. Legal limits on numbers that can meet outdoors remain in Wales, while meetings in private homes are currently restricted to those who are in extended household groups.

"Nearly all remaining Covid restrictions are coming to an end. But with infection rates and hospital admissions already rising sharply, it is a significant gamble. One expert likens what is being done to taking the ""control rods out of a nuclear reactor"". ""This is going to make things worse than they are now and we don't know when it will peak,"" says Loughborough University data analyst Dr Duncan Robertson. And that in many ways goes to the heart of the issue. This is our first ""natural wave"" of Covid - all the others have been brought to an end through lockdown and restrictions. The plan is for this one to exhaust itself. So predicting what will happen is much more difficult. The move has been given the personal backing of chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and a number of the scientists advising him. Infection rates were always going to rise at this stage of the roadmap - more mixing means it is easier for the virus to spread. But with significant levels of immunity from vaccination and natural infection the hope is spread of the virus will be brought under control in the coming weeks. How many people in the UK have been vaccinated so far? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Some have suggested the government should wait longer before taking this step. But infections are already rising so that will not halt the rise. And, according to Prof Whitty, were we to wait any longer, there is a risk the peak of infections this summer wave could be pushed to the autumn, which could make things worse with flu and other viruses circulating. But that does not mean government scientists do not have concerns. Behind the scenes, they have been questioning the policy on face masks, in particular, after ministers made big play of the fact mask-wearing would no longer be legally required. Not because it will dramatically alter the course of rising infections, but because of the message it sent out - that controlling infection no longer mattered. This has led to a definite change of approach with ministers now stressing the need to keep wearing masks in crowded indoor places. How are the rules on masks changing on 19 July? The reason is clear from the results of the latest modelling to be released. It looked at the impact of people returning almost immediately to normal behaviour, and compared it with a gradual resumption over months. The results estimated the gradual approach could halve the summer peak and avoid what is called an overshoot - whereby the surge in cases means greater numbers become infected than need be, before this summer wave peaks. The modelling shows this is much more important in reducing the peak than simply delaying the lifting of restrictions. It is why Prof Whitty has also referred to the importance of the public ""going slowly"" in the way they embrace new freedoms. Prof Matt Keeling, a modeller at the University of Warwick, has gone even further. ""If there is one message - the public is going to control the trajectory we are on,"" he said. But this is just one of many unknowns, which explains the huge range around the central estimate that hospital admissions will peak this summer at 1,000 to 2,000 a day. (The winter wave just gone hit 4,000 in comparison.) And if this does happen, it will come at a significant cost. While the vaccination programme has reduced the number of Covid deaths 10-fold, there could still be 100 to 200 deaths a day. About half of those are expected to be in unvaccinated people. It will also cause major disruption to the NHS. To put those summer figures into context, hospitals would expect to see about 1,000 admissions a day in the depths of winter, for all types of respiratory infections. Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire? ""We would get through it as we have before,"" says Dr Alison Pittard, of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. ""But it would be at the expense of elective care and other treatments."" Another consequence will be more people struggling with long Covid either because it takes them time to recover after being hospitalised or from persistent symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, which for a small minority appear to happen after milder illness. But, in the end, unless restrictions are re-introduced, this wave is only likely to come to an end when the wall of immunity - from vaccination and natural infection - is high enough. And when that happens, England could find itself in the very strong position, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, hinted  last week. He said we were reaching the level of immunity where ""big waves"" may be in the past. This does not mean herd immunity - given how infectious the Delta variant is and the changing nature of the virus, many experts now question whether this will be possible. Covid, they believe, is going to be around forever. Instead, scientists expect some sort of equilibrium will be reached, whereby the R number, the average number of people an infected person passes the virus on to, will fluctuate around one. This will see more manageable waves ebb and flow. And with vaccines offering good protection against serious illness, society will be more willing to tolerate the burden. After all, in the most recent bad winter - 2017-18 -there were 300 to 400 flu deaths a day at the peak,external, more than is being predicted for this summer's Covid peak. Will we get there in the coming months? It is, one of the key government modellers told me, really too close to call.

"This video can not be played The PM says there ""must inevitably be consequences"" for UK spending as it deals with the Covid pandemic. The government has won a Commons vote to lock in cuts to spending on overseas aid, despite a rebellion by Tory MPs. MPs voted by a majority of 35 to keep the budget for international development at 0.5% of national income. But 25 Conservatives joined Labour and other parties in an attempt to reinstate the 0.7% figure, which was in place until earlier this year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the cut was needed to keep public debt down during the pandemic. The government has faced cross-party criticism over the reduction - which amounts to almost Â£4bn - including from all the UK's living former prime ministers. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Syrian children who know war planes but not shops Gates and others to partially cover UK aid cuts Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Many Conservative MPs have spoken out against the move,announced last Novemberdespite a commitment to spending 0.7% in the party's 2019 election manifesto. Meeting the figure was made law in 2015. Charities such as Oxfam and ActionAid have warned thatprojects are being called offas a result of the cuts. But the government won by 333 votes to 298, following a three-hour debate. The Conservative rebels included former Prime Minister Theresa May and ex-cabinet ministers Karen Bradley, Jeremy Hunt, David Davis, Stephen Crabb, Damian Green and Andrew Mitchell. Opening the debate, Boris Johnson said the government had spent Â£407bn during the pandemic to ""shelter our people from an economic hurricane never before experienced in living memory"". He added: ""There must inevitably be consequences."" The prime minister added that the reduction was temporary and that people could ""take pride that the UK will still contribute at least Â£10bn"" to aid. ""This is not an argument about principle,"" he said. ""The only question is when we return to 0.7% and my purpose today is to describe how we propose to achieve this shared goal in an affordable way."" This video can not be played Starmer: ""No one in the House"" is expecting the UK to spend as much on foreign aid as it was spending before Covid But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the cut was ""not in the national interest"", adding: ""Every member here was elected on a manifesto promise to retain the 0.7% target."" He added: ""Cutting aid will increase costs and have a big impact on our economy. Development aid reduces conflict. It reduces disease and people fleeing from their homes. ""It is a false economy to pretend that this is some sort of cut that doesn't have consequences."" Following the result of the vote, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the ""temporary"" cut in aid spending would continue as planned. He added: ""Whilst not every member felt able to vote for the government's compromise, the substantive matter of whether we remain committed to the 0.7% target - not just now, but for decades to come - is clearly a point of significant unity in this House."" But former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major said: ""The government has blatantly broken its word and should be ashamed of its decision. ""It seems that we can afford a 'national yacht' than no-one either wants or needs, while cutting help to some of the most miserable and destitute people in the world."" Oxfam GB chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah described the vote as ""a disaster for the world's poorest people"". And Daniel Willis, of the campaign group Global Justice Now, said: ""When the inevitable death and suffering from aid cuts hits the news, each and every MP who has voted to sever the UK's 0.7% commitment should know that blood is on their hands."" Last month, 30 Conservative MPs supported an amendment to a parliamentary bill, aimed at forcing the government to meet the 0.7% target. Another 14 or so Tories would have had to join them in Tuesday's vote to ensure a government defeat.

"Mask-wearing will remain for ""some time"" after Scotland moves to level zero of restrictions Rules on wearing face coverings in Scotland could remain in place until Christmas, the deputy first minister has said. John Swinney told BBC Scotland it was ""perfectly conceivable"" that masks could still be mandatory in December. On Tuesday, the first minister confirmed mask-wearing would remain for ""some time"" as she announced the move to level zero of Covid restrictions. Nicola Sturgeonmodified planned easingdue to the spread of the Delta variant. Scotland will move to level zero on 19 July which means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals. Restrictions to ease but face masks remain What rules are changing, and when? However, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained and the return of workers to offices will also be delayed. In an interview onBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime, Mr Swinney was asked if he could envisaged face coverings being mandatory until Christmas. John Swinney says that face coverings are especially important to protect people who are clinically vulnerable He said: ""I think that's perfectly conceivable. I think that we should recognise that we have got to take a careful and cautious approach to the suppression of Covid. ""We know the virus is going to be with us for a long time so the more that we can do, a gradual elementary level to provide obstacles and barriers to the circulation of this virus, the more we should do that."" Mr Swinney also revealed Scottish government modelling predicts that Scotland could record between 2,500 and 10,500 new Covid cases on the day restrictions move to level zero. He added: ""I think it is likely to be much closer to that lower end of the spectrum than the higher end."" He said the impact of the virus was ""moving in the right direction - which means that we can afford some of the relaxation"". The wearing face masks in shops and on public transport is to continue for the foreseeable future Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, said she was ""really happy"" to see a continued requirement for face masks. ""I know people say it should be 'my choice', but I don't wear a face mask to protect myself, I wear it to protect others,"" she toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. ""If I'm in a shop there could be someone who is immuno-compromised, who is asthmatic, who is elderly - and they will feel safer in that setting if I wear my mask."" Prof Sridhar said case numbers in Scotland needed to come down from their current high levels before the wearing of face masks could be dropped. ""We're not asking people to wear masks on beaches like in Portugal or outside in parks, like in parts of the United States,"" she told BBC Scotland. ""It's really just in workplaces, indoor settings, transport, shops, and it's seen as proportionate to the risks of transmission in those settings."" It is still hoped that Scotland will move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions. A decision on this will be taken next month. Among other announcements in Ms Sturgeon's statement to Holyrood were plans to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate, as long as they have had two doses of vaccine. In addition, fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as long as they take a test after arrival. Business groups have broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers ""moving the goalposts"" at the last minute by altering plans, such as hospitality venues now being required to close at midnight. Stephen Montgomery, spokesman for the Scottish Hospitality Group, said: ""The midnight curfew is just a made-up time with no evidence to justify it. ""It's like Groundhog Day with our warnings about driving people into house parties and other uncontrolled spaces that lack all the precautions you find in responsible pubs, restaurants and hotels."" Some of the level zero changes expected by the hospitality industry have been modified by the Scottish government The Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant ""should hopefully generate some extra passing trade"", but said there was ""less good news"" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was ""another encouraging milestone"", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be ""a bitter blow for employees and employers alike"". The continued wearing of facemasks won the backing of shop worker union Usdaw. Tracy Gilbert, the union's regional secretary for Scotland, said: ""We ask the public to show their support and respect for shop workers by following the law. ""Wearing a face covering in a shop is an important measure to help protect workers who have no option but to interact with large numbers of people as a part of their job.""

"Scotland is to move to level zero of Covid restrictions on 19 July, but mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for ""some time"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the planned easing had to be modified due to the spread of the Delta variant. The move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals. However, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the return of workers to offices is to be delayed. Ms Sturgeon said ""sensible precautions"" had to be maintained while the vaccine programme continues. She said she still hoped Scotland could move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions. Live: Latest from Nicola Sturgeon's Holyrood statement What rules are changing and when? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Ministers also plan to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate - as long as they have had two doses of vaccine - at that point. Ms Sturgeon said a decision would be made before the new academic term on whether or not school pupils who are the close contacts of positive cases will have to self-isolate. And fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as of Monday, as long as they take a test after arrival. However, the first minister told MSPs that mandatory precautions like the mandatory wearing of face coverings and guidance on ventilation and hand hygiene would remain in place ""for some time"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""We must stick to a cautious approach. We are easing restrictions next week, but we are not abandoning them. ""And even when we move beyond level zero, we will continue to require some baseline measures such as face coverings."" Ministers say the success of the vaccine programme makes it possible to ease restrictions Scotland has been hit by a record-breaking third wave of Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, with the faster-spreading Delta variant putting pressure on health services. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs - who were recalled for a virtual session despite Holyrood being in recess - that the spike in infections had ""levelled off"", and that the vaccine programme was weakening the link between case number and severe illnesses. She said ""a gradual approach"" to easing restrictions stood the best chance of being sustainable and of minimising loss of life. Nicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said ""I will always err on the side of going more cautiously"". England is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. But Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasis restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option ""for good headlines"". A statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time. Despite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned. An obvious point of divergence from England is face coverings. While laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (they'll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear they'll stay here ""for as long as necessary"". It feels like they'll be one of the last measures to go. The move to level zero means: Up to eight adults from four households can meet indoors at home, and up to 10 can meet in a pub or restaurant - with no need to pre-book a two-hour slot. Up to 15 people from 15 households can meet outdoors, and up to 200 can attend weddings and funerals. Plans have, however, been modified in light of high case numbers: Hospitality venues will be required to close at midnight. Some physical distancing rules are to be maintained outdoors, with different groups of 15 required to stay at least 1m (3ft 3in) apart in public spaces - meaning there may be limits on some outdoor events. A ""gradual"" return to office working was due to be part of the move to level zero, but this has now been put back to 9 August. Ms Sturgeon said the move was ""not a complete and wholesale lifting of all restrictions"", but it said it ""does restore yet more freedom to all of us"". This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says lifting all restrictions right now would put people at risk Business groups broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers ""moving the goalposts"" at the last minute by altering their plans. The Scottish Retail Consortium said firms ""will be reassured the sense of progress is being maintained, even if the pace has slowed"". The Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant ""should hopefully generate some extra passing trade"", but said there was ""less good news"" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue. And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was ""another encouraging milestone"", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be ""a bitter blow for employees and employers alike"". Some restrictions on outdoor gatherings will continue The virtual session of parliament gave opposition politicians the chance to question the first minister about the plans. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ""we can't continue asking the public to sacrifice so much of their lives"". He said: ""The balance has to tilt further in favour of moving forward - we have to make progress back to normality. The public have done what was expected of them, now it's time for this SNP government to deliver."" Labour's Anas Sarwar said the changes to restrictions were welcome, but said ""inconsistent decision making and communications"" was hitting the response to the pandemic. He said: ""The high rate of cases is a cause for concern and I'm afraid what the first minister has presented today is not a clear strategy to cope with the new phase of the pandemic."" Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater said she had ""concerns about reducing restrictions while case numbers are so high"", voicing fears that it could lead to a vaccine-resistant variant emerging. And outgoing Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said changes to self-isolation rules must be made ""urgently"", with ""thousands of key workers"" having to quarantine despite testing negative.

"This video can not be played With face mask laws being scrapped in England, shoppers in Wales are divided over Covid measures Covid restrictions will not be abandoned ""wholesale"" when they are next reviewed on Wednesday, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. With cases on the increase, he said he was ""not persuaded that this is a moment for such an approach"". The UK government has faced criticism from some scientists over its plans for a ""freedom day"" on 19 July. However, Mr Drakeford said the four nations were moving in ""broadly"" the same direction. The comments in the Senedd came after Welsh government advisers warned of a risk of a wave of deaths despite vaccines ""holding up"" in the race against the Delta variant. Mr Drakeford's cabinet will make the final decision on Wednesday morning, with a statement to the Welsh Parliament expected that afternoon. Nearly all restrictions in England will be scrapped on 19 July, with no legal requirement for people to wear face masks and with limits on social distancing to end. How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Time to end lockdown in Wales, says virus expert Public Health Wales reported that the case rate stood at 138.2 per 100,000 people on Tuesday, a slight rise. Although cases are still rising, the doubling time is now about 12 days, whereas cases were doubling every seven days towards the end of June. Face masks are expected to be kept in some settings in Wales and in Scotland - where Nicola Sturgeonhas announced an easing of restrictions, with advice on working from home and rules on social distancing while outside staying in place. Mr Drakeford told the Senedd he hoped he would be able to take steps towards moving ""beyond"" the Covid rules. ""What it will not be will be a wholesale abandonment of the collective actions that we have taken during the pandemic, and which continue to keep Wales safe."" ""The mood of Welsh people is not a mood of thirsting for some spurious freedom day,"" he later added. Mark Drakeford will hold a press conference on Wednesday evening The Welsh government has already said face masks would continue to be required by law on public transport and in health and social care settings, but a decision on whether that will be the case in shops - as called for by Plaid Cymru and trade unions - is yet to be made. On Wednesday ministers will announce whether restrictions can be eased to allow more to take place indoors, including whether the rules on social contact in people's private homes may be relaxed. They are also expected to publish plans on how Wales will move to a new ""alert level zero"", where there will be fewer legal restrictions. Following a meeting with officials from the four UK governments, Mr Drakeford said: ""We may be doing it at slightly different speeds or in different ways, but the essential direction of travel is the same between us."" However, he did accuse Boris Johnson of not making it clear enough that his announcement on Monday was only for England: ""It was disappointing again to find that the prime minister finds that such a difficult thing to do, because it would have helped with clarity."" He also said he agreed with the Senedd Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies in being opposed to ""the mandation of vaccine passports"". That was despite comments in March when Mr Drakeford said there were ""prizes to be won through domestic vaccine certification"". Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""Scotland has a plan, England has a plan, and for the sake of Welsh jobs and our economic recovery, it's now time Labour ministers published a detailed plan for the restoration of freedoms in Wales. ""We have to learn to live with the virus and with the summer kicking in, and the school term coming to its conclusion, many families, workers and businesses will be asking if not now, when?"" The Delta variant is now the dominant mutation in Wales Vaccines are ""holding up"" in the race against the Delta variant, which originated in India, but there is still a risk of a wave in hospital admissions and deaths as cases grow rapidly, Welsh government advisers have said. The Technical Advisory Group (TAG) said the ratio of confirmed infections to hospital admissions was falling as fewer people have become seriously ill. TAG said this could be because the Delta variant was spreading among young people, who are less likely to end up in hospital, or it could be a result of the vaccine. Modelling from Swansea University presents a range of scenarios, with the most pessimistic showing a peak in hospital admissions and deaths this summer similar to the second wave of the pandemic. But other scenarios estimate a lower peak and the report suggests they are more likely. New modelling from Warwick University also shows a lower peak, happening around March 2022. The ratio of cases to deaths is falling in all age groups. Among the over-70s it fell from 24% in December to 2% on 1 July. ""This is likely due to the effects of the Covid-19 vaccines,"" the report says. How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? What are the latest Covid rules for Wales?

"Nicola Sturgeon confirms that restrictions will be eased, but face masks will be required ""for some time to come"" The first minister tells a virtual sitting of the Scottish Parliament that caution is still needed with rules easing at a ""responsible pace, not an irresponsible pace"" She confirms that from 19 July wedding and funeral limits move from 100 to 200 people and it will not longer be necessary to book two-hour slots in hospitality In England all legal restrictions, including those associated with face coverings, will be removed from next Monday. However, masks would still be ""expected and recommended"" in crowded indoor areas Ms Sturgeon says she hopes that it will still be possible for most legal restrictions to end on 9 August in Scotland From that date ""blanket"" self-isolation requirements will no longer apply to those who have been double vaccinated and whose tests come back negative Scotland's Conservative and Labour leaders voice criticism of the Scottish government's vaccine rollout programme and test and protect system BBC Scotland News Headlines from Nicola Sturgeon's announcement to the Scottish Parliament The GMB union has issued a warning over the possibility of changes to self-isolation rules, saying ""don't go there"". Senior Organiser for Public Services Drew Duffy says unions were told on Tuesday morning that exemptions were being considered because of understaffing crises in the NHS and social care sector. But he says those problems were ""well understood"" by ministers and employers pre-Covid and
they ""didnât act"". He adds that the move would only anger and concern
staff who were ""already absolutely exhausted and undercut"", while confirming their safety was not a priority for the government. This should act as a final warning about the need for urgent and transformative investment in health and social care, so we can attract and retain the people and skills we so obviously need. That means delivering proper value for workers in their pay and conditions. Drew Duffy, GMB union Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Business will be disappointed that the continued requirement for self isolation for those in proximity to people testing positive for Covid. That is taking a toll on firms currently seeing large numbers of workers required to stay at home, meaning some are having to close temporarily.


That wonât be eased until the next phase rules, scheduled for 9 August. And even then, those without double jags will still have to isolate. They are more likely to be young, and much of hospitality depends on young workers.


They will have to close up at midnight, contrary to expectations of a move to flexible, local licensing rules. This is not just for Cinderella and vampires, but because those still carousing after 12 are less likely to be observing distancing rules. Outdoor gatherings also remain constrained, with a maximum of 15 people. With that limit, little of this summerâs events industry looks salvageable, though itâs over to economy secretary Kate Forbes to negotiate application of the rules for events that are already planned. A mixed response comes from the Scottish Tourism Alliance, who are relieved to move forward, but say it is 'not the level zero' they envisaged. CEO Marc Crothall says the changes will be the closest to normal the industry has experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. He said there was good news for the wedding and events
sector with the removal on outdoor distancing requirements for groups of 15 to
allow guests to mingle, but said he was disappointed this was not brought forward to Friday to allow more freedoms at weddings
this weekend. But he remains concerned about the effects of self-isolation rules.  There are huge concerns across the industry in relation to the self-isolation policy and the impact this is having on businesses to staff.  We are reassured by the Scottish governmentâs commitment to removing the need for people to self-isolate if they are double vaccinated. Marc Crothall, Scottish Tourism Alliance A leading figure in the retail industry says the government's announcement on restrictions will likely ""further push back recovery"" for city centres and high streets. Ewan
MacDonald-Russell, the Scottish Retail Consortium's head of policy, points out that face coverings and physical distancing will still affect staff and customers. He says: ""Whilst
government views rising case numbers as justification for a deceleration on the
path back to normality, that doesnât mean the pressures on businesses arenât
also real. ""The Scottish government needs to be prepared to consider how best to
support struggling retailers if the return back to normal trading continues to
take longer than anticipated."" The announcement that Scotland will move in tandem with England's travel quarantine rules has pleased travel businesses. Passengers returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine on their return if they are fully vaccinated. Jacqueline Dobson, the president of Barrhead Travel said that it was encouraging with a few weeks left of the school holidays. And she expected booking demand would be high over the coming weeks. âTens of thousands of holidaymakers and those travelling to reunite with loved ones will be relieved. The two key areas of concern from those travelling abroad were of quarantine on return and cost of testing. Breaking down the barriers of one of these issues is a step in the right direction. Jacqueline Dobson, Barrhead Travel Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor The words youâre not hearing from Nicola Sturgeon are âFreedom Dayâ. Instead, this is more like Caution Month, to follow 15 others, as the ratchet is gradually eased. For business, this puts on hold, at least until 9 August, the permission to let office workers return to their desks. That is a big loss for city centres, where footfall has taken a big hit from the loss of commuter custom in cafes, bars, restaurants and shops. It also comes at a cost to public transport operators, who will wantcontinued subsidy to plugthe revenue gap. Much more welcome for businesses is an easing of the distance rules indoors, down for everyone for two metres to one, allowing them to re-arrange their space, and accommodate more people. For hospitiality, it no longer requires advance booking to get a table to eat, so there should be more passing trade. And they like clarity. In contrast with the rules announced for England on Monday, shops, hospitality and public transport can be clear that the law still requires face covering. It is not open to individualsâ or staff interpretation. So legal liability for infection is not a private companyâs concern, and the first minister is saying sheâs willing to take any flak thatâs going. Nicola Sturgeon makes the case that gradual easing stands the best chance of being sustainable, and so long-term, that approach is better for the economy. The week before the 9 August changes, expect further caution for the next stage. Question from Jessica from Ingliston The need for young people in school, college or university to self isolate if they are close contacts of positive cases is being reviewed as part of preparations for the new academic term. The first minister tells MSPs the Scottish government has asked its education advisory group for advice on whether the requirement, which causes significant disruption to young people and their families, can be removed. She adds the group's conclusions will be set out ""well in advance of
the new term"". Nicola Sturgeon also confirms she is still waiting on advice from the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as to whether children over 12 should be vaccinated. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce is disappointed in the modified level zero framework. Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron said that the progress on 19 July would be an ""encouraging milestone"" towards the full re-opening of Scotland's economy. However, she said the modified framework deviated away from what businesses
had been preparing for and that moving the goalposts at this late stage would cause
uncertainty, negatively impacting on business confidence and recovery. She said her view was to that we should continue on the path set out towards the lifting of all
restrictions on the 9th of August as planned The postponing of the phased return of offices will be a bitter blow for employees and employers alike, many of which had been getting ready to welcome employees back into offices from next week. This will also sound alarm bells for those town and city centre businesses, reliant on office worker footfall and custom. Dr Liz Cameron, Scottish Chambers of Commerce Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Easing restrictions is likely to lead to a rise in people testing positive for coronavirus. The argument from the first minister is that this is manageable as vaccines are creating a good ring of protection against serious disease and death. But it creates another problem. More positive cases means more of their contacts having to isolate, all with the potential to seriously disrupt key services like schooling or the NHS. The number of NHS staff either sick or isolating due to Covid has doubled over the last month. As the health service deals with an increase in Covid patients alongside higher than usual levels of non-Covid admissions, this becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Senior medical staff wanted a rethink of the rules around self isolation, most have had two jags, they also wear PPE at work and are regularly tested. They will be pleased to hear the plan is to remove them after 9 August provided people are double vaccinated and test negative. The Federation
of Small Businesses (FSB) Scotland has praised the move to level zero with modifications. Policy chair Andrew McRae said it was good news for smaller businesses bound by the 2m social distancing rule but said the announcement did little for the events industry. He also said that the big key date for business would be 9 August. Small businesses do now have some clarity about the conditions in which theyâll be trading. Itâs less good news for  the events sector, trying salvage something of whatâs left of the summer, that weâre not seeing the complete end of social distancing outside. Removing the requirement to pre-book your slot at a hospitality venue should hopefully generate some extra passing trade. Andrew McRae, FSB Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has provided an update
on Covid restrictions: From Monday 19 July, all parts of Scotland will be at level
zero, however, there will be modifications. These include: hospitality venues being required to
close at midnight; physical distancing in indoor public places and postponing
the instruction to return to the office.  Question from Scott in Glasgow UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said masks would still be ""recommended"" on public transportin England, but people without a face covering would no longer be fined after restrictions are eased on 19 July. But in Scotland the first minister has confirmed face coverings will remain mandatory on public transport when the country moves to level zero on Monday. Nicola Sturgeon also tells MSPs it is ""highly likely "" that the mandatory wearing of face coverings will remain the Scottish government's position when all Covid restrictions are lifted on 9 August. She adds: ""I think wearing a face covering is a something that we are likely to be required to do for some time yet."" Ms Sturgeon says face coverings are a ""small price to pay"" to protect those at the highest clinical risk from the virus. And she tells MSPs she does not want Scotland to become a two-tier society where the most vulnerable have to ""shield by default."" The largest hospital in the Highlands is no longer on ""code black"" status. Raigmore Hospital in Invernesshad reached capacity last weekamid increasing Covid cases. All non-urgent elective surgery was cancelled, as was outpatient activity - with the exception of areas including cancer and urgent procedures. However NHS Highland said the situation was no longer considered to be code black, and thanked staff for their efforts. Read more Willie Rennie, in his last question as Lib Dem leader,  brings up hospital ""code blacks"", closed pharmacies and waste unlifted due to high numbers of key workers self-isolating. He asks if there is a plan for a ""test and release"" system so these people can return to work. He also highlights a lack of services during the pandemic for adults with special needs and their families. On this, the first minister says that physical distancing has prevented many services and the reduction to 1m indoors will enable many services to restart. Allow Twitter content?

On hospitals pausing non-Covid treatment, she says this is kept to the shortest time period possible. On self-isolation, she says that she hopes to move away from the blanket requirement for close contacts to isolate for 10 days. Ms Sturgeon is considering ahead of that if that system can be introduced for key groups including health and social care. She says she is discussing this with trade unions but is mindful when speaking of this, those working in those services may see if as giving less protection to them. A decision will be announced in due course. She also pays tribute to Mr Rennie,who announced his resignation yesterday, for ""a good shift"" of ten years. David Wallace LockhartBBC Scotland political reporter Nicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said âI will always err on the side of going more cautiouslyâ. England is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. 

But Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasise restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option âfor good headlinesâ. A statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.

Despite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned. An obvious point of divergence from England â face coverings.

While laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (theyâll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear theyâll stay here âfor as long as necessaryâ. 

It feels like theyâll be one of the last measures to go. Greens co-leader Lorna Slater asks whether it is too early to
restart large indoor events which are largely staffed by young people - and could they
become super spreader events. The FM says the question is ""perfectly sensible"" and that she will always ""err on going more cautiously"". Ms Sturgeon says the government is trying to ensure over-18s are vaccinated as ""quickly as possible"" - a ""key priority"" - and adds that the government is not taking an upper limit off restrictions on large events. Organisers still need to go through an application process if they wish to host numbers above the limit, she explains. And in reference to the UK government's plans for ""freedom day"", she says to ""declare premature victory against the virus is a
foolâs paradise"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says what the FM has announced is not ""a clear strategy"" to cope with the new phase of the pandemic. He says the new phase requires a new approach, he says Test and Protect has not been maximised and says Scotland's vaccine rollout has slowed. He asks Ms Sturgeon to pandemic-proof our workplaces and schools and again brings up a potential move to a four-week gap between vaccine doses. Ms Sturgeon says that Mr Sarwar has just given some ""glib soundbites"" and ""irresponsibility"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She says no devolved government has gone against the JCVI on vaccines and says the dosage interval given by the JCVI remains eight weeks and if advice changes the government position will change. The FM says they want to make schools and workplaces as safe as possible but to underplay the complexities of that does no one any favours. She says that the government is doing more work around ventilation in schools but that it takes time and the best clinical advice. She says advice for schools will be issued in time for the new term. Ms Sturgeon ends by saying that vaccine rollout is not slowing because of anything the Scottish government is doing. The constraining factors are supply and dosage intervals. Question from Thanasis from Edinburgh From Monday self-isolation will no
longer be required for people arriving from countries on the amber list,
provided they are fully vaccinated through a UK vaccination programme. But the first minister confirms travellers must also take PCR test on the second day after arrival. Ms Sturgeon tells MSPs: ""We will continue to take a precautionary approach to
the inclusion of countries on the amber list. ""And, notwithstanding this change, we continue to
advise against non essential overseas travel at this time."" She also confirms that anyone testing positive for, or experiencing symptoms of, Covid will still be required to isolate for ten days. Lucy WhyteBBC Scotland education correspondent It will be frustrating for many families that there was no decision yet on whether children and teenagers will have to isolate in the coming school year. Tens of thousands of pupils were at home at any one time during last term, the vast majority because they were Covid contacts not Covid cases. In England, young people will not have to isolate when they return to school and the first minister's note that they are working on a plan here, is a nod to what she knows is mounting parent pressure  to do the same. Could we be in a position where children will have to face more severe restrictions than their vaccinated parents when it comes to isolation? That would be a hard sell and go against the government's position to make education a priority as we come out of this pandemic. I expect by the time young people are heading back to school, they will be following the same rules as the rest of society. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Several massive goldfish were recently found in a lake in Burnsville, Minnesota Pet owners warned as giant goldfish threaten lake A city in the US state of Minnesota has urged residents not to release their unwanted pet fish into the wild after finding huge goldfish in a lake. The common household pets can grow far bigger in the wild and cause major disruption to ecosystems. The city of Burnsville shared images showing several monster goldfish caught during a survey of Keller Lake. It said goldfish could contribute to poor water quality by disturbing sediment and uprooting plants. ""Please don't release your pet goldfish into ponds and lakes!"" the city wrote in a tweet. In Minnesota, goldfish are a regulated invasive species, which means it is illegal to release them into public waters. With proper care and the right aquarium goldfish can grow up to their full potential of 12 inches. But once they are established in public waters, wildlife officials say, goldfish can grow far larger and be difficult to remove - reproducing rapidly and dominating native species. In its warning, the city of Burnsville advised pet owners to ""please consider other options for finding them a new home"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wildlife officials have been dealing with a similar problem in nearby Carver County, where 50,000 goldfish were removed from a creek in October last year. The removal was part of a three-year plan to study and manage the species, which have caused problems across the US. But the US isn't the only country to suffer from marauding goldfish. In 2017, Munich city council in Germany saidshoals of goldfish were starving out all rivals in local ponds and lakes. The problem got so bad, the council threatened to fine anyone caught releasing their pets into public waters. Large goldfish have been found in the UK's wild waters as well.

"This video can not be played The PM says there ""must inevitably be consequences"" for UK spending as it deals with the Covid pandemic. The government has won a Commons vote to lock in cuts to spending on overseas aid, despite a rebellion by Tory MPs. MPs voted by a majority of 35 to keep the budget for international development at 0.5% of national income. But 25 Conservatives joined Labour and other parties in an attempt to reinstate the 0.7% figure, which was in place until earlier this year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the cut was needed to keep public debt down during the pandemic. The government has faced cross-party criticism over the reduction - which amounts to almost Â£4bn - including from all the UK's living former prime ministers. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Syrian children who know war planes but not shops Gates and others to partially cover UK aid cuts Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Many Conservative MPs have spoken out against the move,announced last Novemberdespite a commitment to spending 0.7% in the party's 2019 election manifesto. Meeting the figure was made law in 2015. Charities such as Oxfam and ActionAid have warned thatprojects are being called offas a result of the cuts. But the government won by 333 votes to 298, following a three-hour debate. The Conservative rebels included former Prime Minister Theresa May and ex-cabinet ministers Karen Bradley, Jeremy Hunt, David Davis, Stephen Crabb, Damian Green and Andrew Mitchell. Opening the debate, Boris Johnson said the government had spent Â£407bn during the pandemic to ""shelter our people from an economic hurricane never before experienced in living memory"". He added: ""There must inevitably be consequences."" The prime minister added that the reduction was temporary and that people could ""take pride that the UK will still contribute at least Â£10bn"" to aid. ""This is not an argument about principle,"" he said. ""The only question is when we return to 0.7% and my purpose today is to describe how we propose to achieve this shared goal in an affordable way."" This video can not be played Starmer: ""No one in the House"" is expecting the UK to spend as much on foreign aid as it was spending before Covid But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the cut was ""not in the national interest"", adding: ""Every member here was elected on a manifesto promise to retain the 0.7% target."" He added: ""Cutting aid will increase costs and have a big impact on our economy. Development aid reduces conflict. It reduces disease and people fleeing from their homes. ""It is a false economy to pretend that this is some sort of cut that doesn't have consequences."" Following the result of the vote, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the ""temporary"" cut in aid spending would continue as planned. He added: ""Whilst not every member felt able to vote for the government's compromise, the substantive matter of whether we remain committed to the 0.7% target - not just now, but for decades to come - is clearly a point of significant unity in this House."" But former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major said: ""The government has blatantly broken its word and should be ashamed of its decision. ""It seems that we can afford a 'national yacht' than no-one either wants or needs, while cutting help to some of the most miserable and destitute people in the world."" Oxfam GB chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah described the vote as ""a disaster for the world's poorest people"". And Daniel Willis, of the campaign group Global Justice Now, said: ""When the inevitable death and suffering from aid cuts hits the news, each and every MP who has voted to sever the UK's 0.7% commitment should know that blood is on their hands."" Last month, 30 Conservative MPs supported an amendment to a parliamentary bill, aimed at forcing the government to meet the 0.7% target. Another 14 or so Tories would have had to join them in Tuesday's vote to ensure a government defeat.

"Government guidance urging nightclubs to make their customers show Covid passports has been branded unfair and unworkable by those running them. Venues have been advised to ask for the NHS Covid pass or a negative test result when they reopen on 19 July. But operators said not making the move mandatory was passing the buck. And the Night Time Industries Association called it ""disingenuous and unclear"", questioning how voluntary it really was. Michael Kill, who runs the association, told the BBC he had received inquiries from members seeking clarification. Mr Kill said that although the policy was not mandatory at present, it could turn out that venues were ""in the hands of local public health directors"" who could force them to comply. The government has also saidit ""reserves the right"" to force venues,externalto require people to show their Covid passport or proof of a negative Covid test in order to be allowed in. Mr Kill said the government seemed to be ""gauging the public narrative"" before deciding how tough to be, adding that this was likely to cause ""some level of chaos"". He accused the government of replacing the old clubland mantra of ""Rave, sleep, repeat"" with ""Leak, listen, then release"". The government declined to comment on Mr Kill's remarks. Nightclubs advised to ask for Covid passes One major nightclub firm, Rekom UK, which owns 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, Eden and Fiction, said on Monday it would not be asking for Covid passports. Its chief executive, Peter Marks, told the Press Association news agency his clubs would be reopening ""at full capacity and without any requirement for a negative Covid test"". However, he declined to comment when contacted by the BBC on Tuesday. Other nightclub operators contacted by the BBC expressed frustration at what they saw as the government making them bear all the responsibility. Tristan Moffat, operations director of the Piano Works, which has two London venues and will not be asking to see Covid passports, said: ""It's like we've been given a rope to hang ourselves with. ""If it all goes wrong, we'll be closed down again and the buck will be passed back to the operators."" The Piano Works' two venues have already reopened on a limited basis Mr Moffat said the change of date for the lifting of restrictions, from 21 June to 19 July, had cost his firm Â£250,000 in lost profit and trading losses incurred, compared with the same four-week period in 2019. He added that 90% of their customers were aged 20 to 35, precisely those who had not had the chance to be fully vaccinated. ""In an already nervous environment, this just adds another layer of fear and nervousness,"" he said. ""It's not fair - the government should either mandate something or not mandate it. ""They've been writing cheques of hope that we can't cash. Confidence is slipping away and we're the ones to suffer."" Another proprietor, pub owner Julie Spensley, whose son Stephen also owns a bar and a nightclub in Middlesbrough, said it would take up to 10 times longer to admit revellers if they had to show Covid passports.

Her son, Stephen Spensley, owns the TS One bar and Spensley's Emporium nightclub, also in Middlesbrough. ""Nightclubs and late bars have queues outside and that's the way they operate,"" she said. Staff already had to check customers' ID to make sure they were old enough to be let in, so imposing further checks would not be practical, she added.

"Police Scotland has launched a formal investigation into the SNP's finances after receiving complaints about how donations to the party were used. Questions had been raised about funds given to the party for use in a fresh independence referendum campaign. Seven people made complaints to the police, which has set up a probe following talks with prosecutors. First minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon had insisted that she was""not concerned"" about the party's finances.

"Several massive goldfish were recently found in a lake in Burnsville, Minnesota Pet owners warned as giant goldfish threaten lake A city in the US state of Minnesota has urged residents not to release their unwanted pet fish into the wild after finding huge goldfish in a lake. The common household pets can grow far bigger in the wild and cause major disruption to ecosystems. The city of Burnsville shared images showing several monster goldfish caught during a survey of Keller Lake. It said goldfish could contribute to poor water quality by disturbing sediment and uprooting plants. ""Please don't release your pet goldfish into ponds and lakes!"" the city wrote in a tweet. In Minnesota, goldfish are a regulated invasive species, which means it is illegal to release them into public waters. With proper care and the right aquarium goldfish can grow up to their full potential of 12 inches. But once they are established in public waters, wildlife officials say, goldfish can grow far larger and be difficult to remove - reproducing rapidly and dominating native species. In its warning, the city of Burnsville advised pet owners to ""please consider other options for finding them a new home"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wildlife officials have been dealing with a similar problem in nearby Carver County, where 50,000 goldfish were removed from a creek in October last year. The removal was part of a three-year plan to study and manage the species, which have caused problems across the US. But the US isn't the only country to suffer from marauding goldfish. In 2017, Munich city council in Germany saidshoals of goldfish were starving out all rivals in local ponds and lakes. The problem got so bad, the council threatened to fine anyone caught releasing their pets into public waters. Large goldfish have been found in the UK's wild waters as well.

"Nearly all remaining Covid restrictions are coming to an end. But with infection rates and hospital admissions already rising sharply, it is a significant gamble. One expert likens what is being done to taking the ""control rods out of a nuclear reactor"". ""This is going to make things worse than they are now and we don't know when it will peak,"" says Loughborough University data analyst Dr Duncan Robertson. And that in many ways goes to the heart of the issue. This is our first ""natural wave"" of Covid - all the others have been brought to an end through lockdown and restrictions. The plan is for this one to exhaust itself. So predicting what will happen is much more difficult. The move has been given the personal backing of chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and a number of the scientists advising him. Infection rates were always going to rise at this stage of the roadmap - more mixing means it is easier for the virus to spread. But with significant levels of immunity from vaccination and natural infection the hope is spread of the virus will be brought under control in the coming weeks. How many people in the UK have been vaccinated so far? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Some have suggested the government should wait longer before taking this step. But infections are already rising so that will not halt the rise. And, according to Prof Whitty, were we to wait any longer, there is a risk the peak of infections this summer wave could be pushed to the autumn, which could make things worse with flu and other viruses circulating. But that does not mean government scientists do not have concerns. Behind the scenes, they have been questioning the policy on face masks, in particular, after ministers made big play of the fact mask-wearing would no longer be legally required. Not because it will dramatically alter the course of rising infections, but because of the message it sent out - that controlling infection no longer mattered. This has led to a definite change of approach with ministers now stressing the need to keep wearing masks in crowded indoor places. How are the rules on masks changing on 19 July? The reason is clear from the results of the latest modelling to be released. It looked at the impact of people returning almost immediately to normal behaviour, and compared it with a gradual resumption over months. The results estimated the gradual approach could halve the summer peak and avoid what is called an overshoot - whereby the surge in cases means greater numbers become infected than need be, before this summer wave peaks. The modelling shows this is much more important in reducing the peak than simply delaying the lifting of restrictions. It is why Prof Whitty has also referred to the importance of the public ""going slowly"" in the way they embrace new freedoms. Prof Matt Keeling, a modeller at the University of Warwick, has gone even further. ""If there is one message - the public is going to control the trajectory we are on,"" he said. But this is just one of many unknowns, which explains the huge range around the central estimate that hospital admissions will peak this summer at 1,000 to 2,000 a day. (The winter wave just gone hit 4,000 in comparison.) And if this does happen, it will come at a significant cost. While the vaccination programme has reduced the number of Covid deaths 10-fold, there could still be 100 to 200 deaths a day. About half of those are expected to be in unvaccinated people. It will also cause major disruption to the NHS. To put those summer figures into context, hospitals would expect to see about 1,000 admissions a day in the depths of winter, for all types of respiratory infections. Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire? ""We would get through it as we have before,"" says Dr Alison Pittard, of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. ""But it would be at the expense of elective care and other treatments."" Another consequence will be more people struggling with long Covid either because it takes them time to recover after being hospitalised or from persistent symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, which for a small minority appear to happen after milder illness. But, in the end, unless restrictions are re-introduced, this wave is only likely to come to an end when the wall of immunity - from vaccination and natural infection - is high enough. And when that happens, England could find itself in the very strong position, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, hinted  last week. He said we were reaching the level of immunity where ""big waves"" may be in the past. This does not mean herd immunity - given how infectious the Delta variant is and the changing nature of the virus, many experts now question whether this will be possible. Covid, they believe, is going to be around forever. Instead, scientists expect some sort of equilibrium will be reached, whereby the R number, the average number of people an infected person passes the virus on to, will fluctuate around one. This will see more manageable waves ebb and flow. And with vaccines offering good protection against serious illness, society will be more willing to tolerate the burden. After all, in the most recent bad winter - 2017-18 -there were 300 to 400 flu deaths a day at the peak,external, more than is being predicted for this summer's Covid peak. Will we get there in the coming months? It is, one of the key government modellers told me, really too close to call.

"Nicola Sturgeon confirms that restrictions will be eased, but face masks will be required ""for some time to come"" The first minister tells a virtual sitting of the Scottish Parliament that caution is still needed with rules easing at a ""responsible pace, not an irresponsible pace"" She confirms that from 19 July wedding and funeral limits move from 100 to 200 people and it will not longer be necessary to book two-hour slots in hospitality In England all legal restrictions, including those associated with face coverings, will be removed from next Monday. However, masks would still be ""expected and recommended"" in crowded indoor areas Ms Sturgeon says she hopes that it will still be possible for most legal restrictions to end on 9 August in Scotland From that date ""blanket"" self-isolation requirements will no longer apply to those who have been double vaccinated and whose tests come back negative Scotland's Conservative and Labour leaders voice criticism of the Scottish government's vaccine rollout programme and test and protect system BBC Scotland News Headlines from Nicola Sturgeon's announcement to the Scottish Parliament The GMB union has issued a warning over the possibility of changes to self-isolation rules, saying ""don't go there"". Senior Organiser for Public Services Drew Duffy says unions were told on Tuesday morning that exemptions were being considered because of understaffing crises in the NHS and social care sector. But he says those problems were ""well understood"" by ministers and employers pre-Covid and
they ""didnât act"". He adds that the move would only anger and concern
staff who were ""already absolutely exhausted and undercut"", while confirming their safety was not a priority for the government. This should act as a final warning about the need for urgent and transformative investment in health and social care, so we can attract and retain the people and skills we so obviously need. That means delivering proper value for workers in their pay and conditions. Drew Duffy, GMB union Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Business will be disappointed that the continued requirement for self isolation for those in proximity to people testing positive for Covid. That is taking a toll on firms currently seeing large numbers of workers required to stay at home, meaning some are having to close temporarily.


That wonât be eased until the next phase rules, scheduled for 9 August. And even then, those without double jags will still have to isolate. They are more likely to be young, and much of hospitality depends on young workers.


They will have to close up at midnight, contrary to expectations of a move to flexible, local licensing rules. This is not just for Cinderella and vampires, but because those still carousing after 12 are less likely to be observing distancing rules. Outdoor gatherings also remain constrained, with a maximum of 15 people. With that limit, little of this summerâs events industry looks salvageable, though itâs over to economy secretary Kate Forbes to negotiate application of the rules for events that are already planned. A mixed response comes from the Scottish Tourism Alliance, who are relieved to move forward, but say it is 'not the level zero' they envisaged. CEO Marc Crothall says the changes will be the closest to normal the industry has experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. He said there was good news for the wedding and events
sector with the removal on outdoor distancing requirements for groups of 15 to
allow guests to mingle, but said he was disappointed this was not brought forward to Friday to allow more freedoms at weddings
this weekend. But he remains concerned about the effects of self-isolation rules.  There are huge concerns across the industry in relation to the self-isolation policy and the impact this is having on businesses to staff.  We are reassured by the Scottish governmentâs commitment to removing the need for people to self-isolate if they are double vaccinated. Marc Crothall, Scottish Tourism Alliance A leading figure in the retail industry says the government's announcement on restrictions will likely ""further push back recovery"" for city centres and high streets. Ewan
MacDonald-Russell, the Scottish Retail Consortium's head of policy, points out that face coverings and physical distancing will still affect staff and customers. He says: ""Whilst
government views rising case numbers as justification for a deceleration on the
path back to normality, that doesnât mean the pressures on businesses arenât
also real. ""The Scottish government needs to be prepared to consider how best to
support struggling retailers if the return back to normal trading continues to
take longer than anticipated."" The announcement that Scotland will move in tandem with England's travel quarantine rules has pleased travel businesses. Passengers returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine on their return if they are fully vaccinated. Jacqueline Dobson, the president of Barrhead Travel said that it was encouraging with a few weeks left of the school holidays. And she expected booking demand would be high over the coming weeks. âTens of thousands of holidaymakers and those travelling to reunite with loved ones will be relieved. The two key areas of concern from those travelling abroad were of quarantine on return and cost of testing. Breaking down the barriers of one of these issues is a step in the right direction. Jacqueline Dobson, Barrhead Travel Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor The words youâre not hearing from Nicola Sturgeon are âFreedom Dayâ. Instead, this is more like Caution Month, to follow 15 others, as the ratchet is gradually eased. For business, this puts on hold, at least until 9 August, the permission to let office workers return to their desks. That is a big loss for city centres, where footfall has taken a big hit from the loss of commuter custom in cafes, bars, restaurants and shops. It also comes at a cost to public transport operators, who will wantcontinued subsidy to plugthe revenue gap. Much more welcome for businesses is an easing of the distance rules indoors, down for everyone for two metres to one, allowing them to re-arrange their space, and accommodate more people. For hospitiality, it no longer requires advance booking to get a table to eat, so there should be more passing trade. And they like clarity. In contrast with the rules announced for England on Monday, shops, hospitality and public transport can be clear that the law still requires face covering. It is not open to individualsâ or staff interpretation. So legal liability for infection is not a private companyâs concern, and the first minister is saying sheâs willing to take any flak thatâs going. Nicola Sturgeon makes the case that gradual easing stands the best chance of being sustainable, and so long-term, that approach is better for the economy. The week before the 9 August changes, expect further caution for the next stage. Question from Jessica from Ingliston The need for young people in school, college or university to self isolate if they are close contacts of positive cases is being reviewed as part of preparations for the new academic term. The first minister tells MSPs the Scottish government has asked its education advisory group for advice on whether the requirement, which causes significant disruption to young people and their families, can be removed. She adds the group's conclusions will be set out ""well in advance of
the new term"". Nicola Sturgeon also confirms she is still waiting on advice from the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as to whether children over 12 should be vaccinated. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce is disappointed in the modified level zero framework. Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron said that the progress on 19 July would be an ""encouraging milestone"" towards the full re-opening of Scotland's economy. However, she said the modified framework deviated away from what businesses
had been preparing for and that moving the goalposts at this late stage would cause
uncertainty, negatively impacting on business confidence and recovery. She said her view was to that we should continue on the path set out towards the lifting of all
restrictions on the 9th of August as planned The postponing of the phased return of offices will be a bitter blow for employees and employers alike, many of which had been getting ready to welcome employees back into offices from next week. This will also sound alarm bells for those town and city centre businesses, reliant on office worker footfall and custom. Dr Liz Cameron, Scottish Chambers of Commerce Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Easing restrictions is likely to lead to a rise in people testing positive for coronavirus. The argument from the first minister is that this is manageable as vaccines are creating a good ring of protection against serious disease and death. But it creates another problem. More positive cases means more of their contacts having to isolate, all with the potential to seriously disrupt key services like schooling or the NHS. The number of NHS staff either sick or isolating due to Covid has doubled over the last month. As the health service deals with an increase in Covid patients alongside higher than usual levels of non-Covid admissions, this becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Senior medical staff wanted a rethink of the rules around self isolation, most have had two jags, they also wear PPE at work and are regularly tested. They will be pleased to hear the plan is to remove them after 9 August provided people are double vaccinated and test negative. The Federation
of Small Businesses (FSB) Scotland has praised the move to level zero with modifications. Policy chair Andrew McRae said it was good news for smaller businesses bound by the 2m social distancing rule but said the announcement did little for the events industry. He also said that the big key date for business would be 9 August. Small businesses do now have some clarity about the conditions in which theyâll be trading. Itâs less good news for  the events sector, trying salvage something of whatâs left of the summer, that weâre not seeing the complete end of social distancing outside. Removing the requirement to pre-book your slot at a hospitality venue should hopefully generate some extra passing trade. Andrew McRae, FSB Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has provided an update
on Covid restrictions: From Monday 19 July, all parts of Scotland will be at level
zero, however, there will be modifications. These include: hospitality venues being required to
close at midnight; physical distancing in indoor public places and postponing
the instruction to return to the office.  Question from Scott in Glasgow UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said masks would still be ""recommended"" on public transportin England, but people without a face covering would no longer be fined after restrictions are eased on 19 July. But in Scotland the first minister has confirmed face coverings will remain mandatory on public transport when the country moves to level zero on Monday. Nicola Sturgeon also tells MSPs it is ""highly likely "" that the mandatory wearing of face coverings will remain the Scottish government's position when all Covid restrictions are lifted on 9 August. She adds: ""I think wearing a face covering is a something that we are likely to be required to do for some time yet."" Ms Sturgeon says face coverings are a ""small price to pay"" to protect those at the highest clinical risk from the virus. And she tells MSPs she does not want Scotland to become a two-tier society where the most vulnerable have to ""shield by default."" The largest hospital in the Highlands is no longer on ""code black"" status. Raigmore Hospital in Invernesshad reached capacity last weekamid increasing Covid cases. All non-urgent elective surgery was cancelled, as was outpatient activity - with the exception of areas including cancer and urgent procedures. However NHS Highland said the situation was no longer considered to be code black, and thanked staff for their efforts. Read more Willie Rennie, in his last question as Lib Dem leader,  brings up hospital ""code blacks"", closed pharmacies and waste unlifted due to high numbers of key workers self-isolating. He asks if there is a plan for a ""test and release"" system so these people can return to work. He also highlights a lack of services during the pandemic for adults with special needs and their families. On this, the first minister says that physical distancing has prevented many services and the reduction to 1m indoors will enable many services to restart. Allow Twitter content?

On hospitals pausing non-Covid treatment, she says this is kept to the shortest time period possible. On self-isolation, she says that she hopes to move away from the blanket requirement for close contacts to isolate for 10 days. Ms Sturgeon is considering ahead of that if that system can be introduced for key groups including health and social care. She says she is discussing this with trade unions but is mindful when speaking of this, those working in those services may see if as giving less protection to them. A decision will be announced in due course. She also pays tribute to Mr Rennie,who announced his resignation yesterday, for ""a good shift"" of ten years. David Wallace LockhartBBC Scotland political reporter Nicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said âI will always err on the side of going more cautiouslyâ. England is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. 

But Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasise restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option âfor good headlinesâ. A statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.

Despite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned. An obvious point of divergence from England â face coverings.

While laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (theyâll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear theyâll stay here âfor as long as necessaryâ. 

It feels like theyâll be one of the last measures to go. Greens co-leader Lorna Slater asks whether it is too early to
restart large indoor events which are largely staffed by young people - and could they
become super spreader events. The FM says the question is ""perfectly sensible"" and that she will always ""err on going more cautiously"". Ms Sturgeon says the government is trying to ensure over-18s are vaccinated as ""quickly as possible"" - a ""key priority"" - and adds that the government is not taking an upper limit off restrictions on large events. Organisers still need to go through an application process if they wish to host numbers above the limit, she explains. And in reference to the UK government's plans for ""freedom day"", she says to ""declare premature victory against the virus is a
foolâs paradise"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says what the FM has announced is not ""a clear strategy"" to cope with the new phase of the pandemic. He says the new phase requires a new approach, he says Test and Protect has not been maximised and says Scotland's vaccine rollout has slowed. He asks Ms Sturgeon to pandemic-proof our workplaces and schools and again brings up a potential move to a four-week gap between vaccine doses. Ms Sturgeon says that Mr Sarwar has just given some ""glib soundbites"" and ""irresponsibility"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She says no devolved government has gone against the JCVI on vaccines and says the dosage interval given by the JCVI remains eight weeks and if advice changes the government position will change. The FM says they want to make schools and workplaces as safe as possible but to underplay the complexities of that does no one any favours. She says that the government is doing more work around ventilation in schools but that it takes time and the best clinical advice. She says advice for schools will be issued in time for the new term. Ms Sturgeon ends by saying that vaccine rollout is not slowing because of anything the Scottish government is doing. The constraining factors are supply and dosage intervals. Question from Thanasis from Edinburgh From Monday self-isolation will no
longer be required for people arriving from countries on the amber list,
provided they are fully vaccinated through a UK vaccination programme. But the first minister confirms travellers must also take PCR test on the second day after arrival. Ms Sturgeon tells MSPs: ""We will continue to take a precautionary approach to
the inclusion of countries on the amber list. ""And, notwithstanding this change, we continue to
advise against non essential overseas travel at this time."" She also confirms that anyone testing positive for, or experiencing symptoms of, Covid will still be required to isolate for ten days. Lucy WhyteBBC Scotland education correspondent It will be frustrating for many families that there was no decision yet on whether children and teenagers will have to isolate in the coming school year. Tens of thousands of pupils were at home at any one time during last term, the vast majority because they were Covid contacts not Covid cases. In England, young people will not have to isolate when they return to school and the first minister's note that they are working on a plan here, is a nod to what she knows is mounting parent pressure  to do the same. Could we be in a position where children will have to face more severe restrictions than their vaccinated parents when it comes to isolation? That would be a hard sell and go against the government's position to make education a priority as we come out of this pandemic. I expect by the time young people are heading back to school, they will be following the same rules as the rest of society. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played The PM says there ""must inevitably be consequences"" for UK spending as it deals with the Covid pandemic. The government has won a Commons vote to lock in cuts to spending on overseas aid, despite a rebellion by Tory MPs. MPs voted by a majority of 35 to keep the budget for international development at 0.5% of national income. But 25 Conservatives joined Labour and other parties in an attempt to reinstate the 0.7% figure, which was in place until earlier this year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the cut was needed to keep public debt down during the pandemic. The government has faced cross-party criticism over the reduction - which amounts to almost Â£4bn - including from all the UK's living former prime ministers. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Syrian children who know war planes but not shops Gates and others to partially cover UK aid cuts Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Many Conservative MPs have spoken out against the move,announced last Novemberdespite a commitment to spending 0.7% in the party's 2019 election manifesto. Meeting the figure was made law in 2015. Charities such as Oxfam and ActionAid have warned thatprojects are being called offas a result of the cuts. But the government won by 333 votes to 298, following a three-hour debate. The Conservative rebels included former Prime Minister Theresa May and ex-cabinet ministers Karen Bradley, Jeremy Hunt, David Davis, Stephen Crabb, Damian Green and Andrew Mitchell. Opening the debate, Boris Johnson said the government had spent Â£407bn during the pandemic to ""shelter our people from an economic hurricane never before experienced in living memory"". He added: ""There must inevitably be consequences."" The prime minister added that the reduction was temporary and that people could ""take pride that the UK will still contribute at least Â£10bn"" to aid. ""This is not an argument about principle,"" he said. ""The only question is when we return to 0.7% and my purpose today is to describe how we propose to achieve this shared goal in an affordable way."" This video can not be played Starmer: ""No one in the House"" is expecting the UK to spend as much on foreign aid as it was spending before Covid But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the cut was ""not in the national interest"", adding: ""Every member here was elected on a manifesto promise to retain the 0.7% target."" He added: ""Cutting aid will increase costs and have a big impact on our economy. Development aid reduces conflict. It reduces disease and people fleeing from their homes. ""It is a false economy to pretend that this is some sort of cut that doesn't have consequences."" Following the result of the vote, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the ""temporary"" cut in aid spending would continue as planned. He added: ""Whilst not every member felt able to vote for the government's compromise, the substantive matter of whether we remain committed to the 0.7% target - not just now, but for decades to come - is clearly a point of significant unity in this House."" But former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major said: ""The government has blatantly broken its word and should be ashamed of its decision. ""It seems that we can afford a 'national yacht' than no-one either wants or needs, while cutting help to some of the most miserable and destitute people in the world."" Oxfam GB chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah described the vote as ""a disaster for the world's poorest people"". And Daniel Willis, of the campaign group Global Justice Now, said: ""When the inevitable death and suffering from aid cuts hits the news, each and every MP who has voted to sever the UK's 0.7% commitment should know that blood is on their hands."" Last month, 30 Conservative MPs supported an amendment to a parliamentary bill, aimed at forcing the government to meet the 0.7% target. Another 14 or so Tories would have had to join them in Tuesday's vote to ensure a government defeat.

"Nicola Sturgeon confirms that restrictions will be eased, but face masks will be required ""for some time to come"" The first minister tells a virtual sitting of the Scottish Parliament that caution is still needed with rules easing at a ""responsible pace, not an irresponsible pace"" She confirms that from 19 July wedding and funeral limits move from 100 to 200 people and it will not longer be necessary to book two-hour slots in hospitality In England all legal restrictions, including those associated with face coverings, will be removed from next Monday. However, masks would still be ""expected and recommended"" in crowded indoor areas Ms Sturgeon says she hopes that it will still be possible for most legal restrictions to end on 9 August in Scotland From that date ""blanket"" self-isolation requirements will no longer apply to those who have been double vaccinated and whose tests come back negative Scotland's Conservative and Labour leaders voice criticism of the Scottish government's vaccine rollout programme and test and protect system BBC Scotland News Headlines from Nicola Sturgeon's announcement to the Scottish Parliament The GMB union has issued a warning over the possibility of changes to self-isolation rules, saying ""don't go there"". Senior Organiser for Public Services Drew Duffy says unions were told on Tuesday morning that exemptions were being considered because of understaffing crises in the NHS and social care sector. But he says those problems were ""well understood"" by ministers and employers pre-Covid and
they ""didnât act"". He adds that the move would only anger and concern
staff who were ""already absolutely exhausted and undercut"", while confirming their safety was not a priority for the government. This should act as a final warning about the need for urgent and transformative investment in health and social care, so we can attract and retain the people and skills we so obviously need. That means delivering proper value for workers in their pay and conditions. Drew Duffy, GMB union Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Business will be disappointed that the continued requirement for self isolation for those in proximity to people testing positive for Covid. That is taking a toll on firms currently seeing large numbers of workers required to stay at home, meaning some are having to close temporarily.


That wonât be eased until the next phase rules, scheduled for 9 August. And even then, those without double jags will still have to isolate. They are more likely to be young, and much of hospitality depends on young workers.


They will have to close up at midnight, contrary to expectations of a move to flexible, local licensing rules. This is not just for Cinderella and vampires, but because those still carousing after 12 are less likely to be observing distancing rules. Outdoor gatherings also remain constrained, with a maximum of 15 people. With that limit, little of this summerâs events industry looks salvageable, though itâs over to economy secretary Kate Forbes to negotiate application of the rules for events that are already planned. A mixed response comes from the Scottish Tourism Alliance, who are relieved to move forward, but say it is 'not the level zero' they envisaged. CEO Marc Crothall says the changes will be the closest to normal the industry has experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. He said there was good news for the wedding and events
sector with the removal on outdoor distancing requirements for groups of 15 to
allow guests to mingle, but said he was disappointed this was not brought forward to Friday to allow more freedoms at weddings
this weekend. But he remains concerned about the effects of self-isolation rules.  There are huge concerns across the industry in relation to the self-isolation policy and the impact this is having on businesses to staff.  We are reassured by the Scottish governmentâs commitment to removing the need for people to self-isolate if they are double vaccinated. Marc Crothall, Scottish Tourism Alliance A leading figure in the retail industry says the government's announcement on restrictions will likely ""further push back recovery"" for city centres and high streets. Ewan
MacDonald-Russell, the Scottish Retail Consortium's head of policy, points out that face coverings and physical distancing will still affect staff and customers. He says: ""Whilst
government views rising case numbers as justification for a deceleration on the
path back to normality, that doesnât mean the pressures on businesses arenât
also real. ""The Scottish government needs to be prepared to consider how best to
support struggling retailers if the return back to normal trading continues to
take longer than anticipated."" The announcement that Scotland will move in tandem with England's travel quarantine rules has pleased travel businesses. Passengers returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine on their return if they are fully vaccinated. Jacqueline Dobson, the president of Barrhead Travel said that it was encouraging with a few weeks left of the school holidays. And she expected booking demand would be high over the coming weeks. âTens of thousands of holidaymakers and those travelling to reunite with loved ones will be relieved. The two key areas of concern from those travelling abroad were of quarantine on return and cost of testing. Breaking down the barriers of one of these issues is a step in the right direction. Jacqueline Dobson, Barrhead Travel Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor The words youâre not hearing from Nicola Sturgeon are âFreedom Dayâ. Instead, this is more like Caution Month, to follow 15 others, as the ratchet is gradually eased. For business, this puts on hold, at least until 9 August, the permission to let office workers return to their desks. That is a big loss for city centres, where footfall has taken a big hit from the loss of commuter custom in cafes, bars, restaurants and shops. It also comes at a cost to public transport operators, who will wantcontinued subsidy to plugthe revenue gap. Much more welcome for businesses is an easing of the distance rules indoors, down for everyone for two metres to one, allowing them to re-arrange their space, and accommodate more people. For hospitiality, it no longer requires advance booking to get a table to eat, so there should be more passing trade. And they like clarity. In contrast with the rules announced for England on Monday, shops, hospitality and public transport can be clear that the law still requires face covering. It is not open to individualsâ or staff interpretation. So legal liability for infection is not a private companyâs concern, and the first minister is saying sheâs willing to take any flak thatâs going. Nicola Sturgeon makes the case that gradual easing stands the best chance of being sustainable, and so long-term, that approach is better for the economy. The week before the 9 August changes, expect further caution for the next stage. Question from Jessica from Ingliston The need for young people in school, college or university to self isolate if they are close contacts of positive cases is being reviewed as part of preparations for the new academic term. The first minister tells MSPs the Scottish government has asked its education advisory group for advice on whether the requirement, which causes significant disruption to young people and their families, can be removed. She adds the group's conclusions will be set out ""well in advance of
the new term"". Nicola Sturgeon also confirms she is still waiting on advice from the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as to whether children over 12 should be vaccinated. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce is disappointed in the modified level zero framework. Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron said that the progress on 19 July would be an ""encouraging milestone"" towards the full re-opening of Scotland's economy. However, she said the modified framework deviated away from what businesses
had been preparing for and that moving the goalposts at this late stage would cause
uncertainty, negatively impacting on business confidence and recovery. She said her view was to that we should continue on the path set out towards the lifting of all
restrictions on the 9th of August as planned The postponing of the phased return of offices will be a bitter blow for employees and employers alike, many of which had been getting ready to welcome employees back into offices from next week. This will also sound alarm bells for those town and city centre businesses, reliant on office worker footfall and custom. Dr Liz Cameron, Scottish Chambers of Commerce Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Easing restrictions is likely to lead to a rise in people testing positive for coronavirus. The argument from the first minister is that this is manageable as vaccines are creating a good ring of protection against serious disease and death. But it creates another problem. More positive cases means more of their contacts having to isolate, all with the potential to seriously disrupt key services like schooling or the NHS. The number of NHS staff either sick or isolating due to Covid has doubled over the last month. As the health service deals with an increase in Covid patients alongside higher than usual levels of non-Covid admissions, this becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Senior medical staff wanted a rethink of the rules around self isolation, most have had two jags, they also wear PPE at work and are regularly tested. They will be pleased to hear the plan is to remove them after 9 August provided people are double vaccinated and test negative. The Federation
of Small Businesses (FSB) Scotland has praised the move to level zero with modifications. Policy chair Andrew McRae said it was good news for smaller businesses bound by the 2m social distancing rule but said the announcement did little for the events industry. He also said that the big key date for business would be 9 August. Small businesses do now have some clarity about the conditions in which theyâll be trading. Itâs less good news for  the events sector, trying salvage something of whatâs left of the summer, that weâre not seeing the complete end of social distancing outside. Removing the requirement to pre-book your slot at a hospitality venue should hopefully generate some extra passing trade. Andrew McRae, FSB Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has provided an update
on Covid restrictions: From Monday 19 July, all parts of Scotland will be at level
zero, however, there will be modifications. These include: hospitality venues being required to
close at midnight; physical distancing in indoor public places and postponing
the instruction to return to the office.  Question from Scott in Glasgow UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said masks would still be ""recommended"" on public transportin England, but people without a face covering would no longer be fined after restrictions are eased on 19 July. But in Scotland the first minister has confirmed face coverings will remain mandatory on public transport when the country moves to level zero on Monday. Nicola Sturgeon also tells MSPs it is ""highly likely "" that the mandatory wearing of face coverings will remain the Scottish government's position when all Covid restrictions are lifted on 9 August. She adds: ""I think wearing a face covering is a something that we are likely to be required to do for some time yet."" Ms Sturgeon says face coverings are a ""small price to pay"" to protect those at the highest clinical risk from the virus. And she tells MSPs she does not want Scotland to become a two-tier society where the most vulnerable have to ""shield by default."" The largest hospital in the Highlands is no longer on ""code black"" status. Raigmore Hospital in Invernesshad reached capacity last weekamid increasing Covid cases. All non-urgent elective surgery was cancelled, as was outpatient activity - with the exception of areas including cancer and urgent procedures. However NHS Highland said the situation was no longer considered to be code black, and thanked staff for their efforts. Read more Willie Rennie, in his last question as Lib Dem leader,  brings up hospital ""code blacks"", closed pharmacies and waste unlifted due to high numbers of key workers self-isolating. He asks if there is a plan for a ""test and release"" system so these people can return to work. He also highlights a lack of services during the pandemic for adults with special needs and their families. On this, the first minister says that physical distancing has prevented many services and the reduction to 1m indoors will enable many services to restart. Allow Twitter content?

On hospitals pausing non-Covid treatment, she says this is kept to the shortest time period possible. On self-isolation, she says that she hopes to move away from the blanket requirement for close contacts to isolate for 10 days. Ms Sturgeon is considering ahead of that if that system can be introduced for key groups including health and social care. She says she is discussing this with trade unions but is mindful when speaking of this, those working in those services may see if as giving less protection to them. A decision will be announced in due course. She also pays tribute to Mr Rennie,who announced his resignation yesterday, for ""a good shift"" of ten years. David Wallace LockhartBBC Scotland political reporter Nicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said âI will always err on the side of going more cautiouslyâ. England is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. 

But Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasise restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option âfor good headlinesâ. A statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.

Despite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned. An obvious point of divergence from England â face coverings.

While laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (theyâll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear theyâll stay here âfor as long as necessaryâ. 

It feels like theyâll be one of the last measures to go. Greens co-leader Lorna Slater asks whether it is too early to
restart large indoor events which are largely staffed by young people - and could they
become super spreader events. The FM says the question is ""perfectly sensible"" and that she will always ""err on going more cautiously"". Ms Sturgeon says the government is trying to ensure over-18s are vaccinated as ""quickly as possible"" - a ""key priority"" - and adds that the government is not taking an upper limit off restrictions on large events. Organisers still need to go through an application process if they wish to host numbers above the limit, she explains. And in reference to the UK government's plans for ""freedom day"", she says to ""declare premature victory against the virus is a
foolâs paradise"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says what the FM has announced is not ""a clear strategy"" to cope with the new phase of the pandemic. He says the new phase requires a new approach, he says Test and Protect has not been maximised and says Scotland's vaccine rollout has slowed. He asks Ms Sturgeon to pandemic-proof our workplaces and schools and again brings up a potential move to a four-week gap between vaccine doses. Ms Sturgeon says that Mr Sarwar has just given some ""glib soundbites"" and ""irresponsibility"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She says no devolved government has gone against the JCVI on vaccines and says the dosage interval given by the JCVI remains eight weeks and if advice changes the government position will change. The FM says they want to make schools and workplaces as safe as possible but to underplay the complexities of that does no one any favours. She says that the government is doing more work around ventilation in schools but that it takes time and the best clinical advice. She says advice for schools will be issued in time for the new term. Ms Sturgeon ends by saying that vaccine rollout is not slowing because of anything the Scottish government is doing. The constraining factors are supply and dosage intervals. Question from Thanasis from Edinburgh From Monday self-isolation will no
longer be required for people arriving from countries on the amber list,
provided they are fully vaccinated through a UK vaccination programme. But the first minister confirms travellers must also take PCR test on the second day after arrival. Ms Sturgeon tells MSPs: ""We will continue to take a precautionary approach to
the inclusion of countries on the amber list. ""And, notwithstanding this change, we continue to
advise against non essential overseas travel at this time."" She also confirms that anyone testing positive for, or experiencing symptoms of, Covid will still be required to isolate for ten days. Lucy WhyteBBC Scotland education correspondent It will be frustrating for many families that there was no decision yet on whether children and teenagers will have to isolate in the coming school year. Tens of thousands of pupils were at home at any one time during last term, the vast majority because they were Covid contacts not Covid cases. In England, young people will not have to isolate when they return to school and the first minister's note that they are working on a plan here, is a nod to what she knows is mounting parent pressure  to do the same. Could we be in a position where children will have to face more severe restrictions than their vaccinated parents when it comes to isolation? That would be a hard sell and go against the government's position to make education a priority as we come out of this pandemic. I expect by the time young people are heading back to school, they will be following the same rules as the rest of society. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Government guidance urging nightclubs to make their customers show Covid passports has been branded unfair and unworkable by those running them. Venues have been advised to ask for the NHS Covid pass or a negative test result when they reopen on 19 July. But operators said not making the move mandatory was passing the buck. And the Night Time Industries Association called it ""disingenuous and unclear"", questioning how voluntary it really was. Michael Kill, who runs the association, told the BBC he had received inquiries from members seeking clarification. Mr Kill said that although the policy was not mandatory at present, it could turn out that venues were ""in the hands of local public health directors"" who could force them to comply. The government has also saidit ""reserves the right"" to force venues,externalto require people to show their Covid passport or proof of a negative Covid test in order to be allowed in. Mr Kill said the government seemed to be ""gauging the public narrative"" before deciding how tough to be, adding that this was likely to cause ""some level of chaos"". He accused the government of replacing the old clubland mantra of ""Rave, sleep, repeat"" with ""Leak, listen, then release"". The government declined to comment on Mr Kill's remarks. Nightclubs advised to ask for Covid passes One major nightclub firm, Rekom UK, which owns 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, Eden and Fiction, said on Monday it would not be asking for Covid passports. Its chief executive, Peter Marks, told the Press Association news agency his clubs would be reopening ""at full capacity and without any requirement for a negative Covid test"". However, he declined to comment when contacted by the BBC on Tuesday. Other nightclub operators contacted by the BBC expressed frustration at what they saw as the government making them bear all the responsibility. Tristan Moffat, operations director of the Piano Works, which has two London venues and will not be asking to see Covid passports, said: ""It's like we've been given a rope to hang ourselves with. ""If it all goes wrong, we'll be closed down again and the buck will be passed back to the operators."" The Piano Works' two venues have already reopened on a limited basis Mr Moffat said the change of date for the lifting of restrictions, from 21 June to 19 July, had cost his firm Â£250,000 in lost profit and trading losses incurred, compared with the same four-week period in 2019. He added that 90% of their customers were aged 20 to 35, precisely those who had not had the chance to be fully vaccinated. ""In an already nervous environment, this just adds another layer of fear and nervousness,"" he said. ""It's not fair - the government should either mandate something or not mandate it. ""They've been writing cheques of hope that we can't cash. Confidence is slipping away and we're the ones to suffer."" Another proprietor, pub owner Julie Spensley, whose son Stephen also owns a bar and a nightclub in Middlesbrough, said it would take up to 10 times longer to admit revellers if they had to show Covid passports. She said: ""Unless it's mandatory, we will not be introducing it."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mrs Spensley, who co-owns the Dickens Inn with her husband Tony, said the advice was ""very unworkable for venues such as late bars and nightclubs"". Her son, Stephen Spensley, owns the TS One bar and Spensley's Emporium nightclub, also in Middlesbrough. ""Nightclubs and late bars have queues outside and that's the way they operate,"" she said. Staff already had to check customers' ID to make sure they were old enough to be let in, so imposing further checks would not be practical, she added. ""We've had it tough for the last 16 months,"" she said. She stressed that she wanted people to stay safe, but questioned the wisdom of tighter restrictions on night-time venues when the government was easing the rules on social distancing and mask-wearing. People in England can do this by requesting an NHS Covid Pass via the NHS website or the NHS app. Once logged in, an NHS Covid Pass can be requested. The system generates a QR code, which lasts for 28 days. An NHS Covid Pass can be obtained two weeks after a second dose of the Covid vaccine, as long as both doses were given in England. A pass can be requested if you've had a negative PCR test or lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, which you have reported on the NHS website. These passes last 48 hours after the test result. Alternatively, a pass can be given following a positive PCR test result within the last six months, and when self-isolating has finished. The pass lasts for 180 days after the test result. People who have had both their jabs can also request an NHS Covid Pass letter by calling 119. This only shows vaccination status and has no expiry date. Click here to read more. Are you a nightclub owner? Are you confused by the guidance?

"The UK gives much of its humanitarian aid to Yemen, with projects similar to this one run by a Kuwaiti charity Boris Johnson has defended the government's decision to cut foreign aid, saying this is needed during the ""economic hurricane"" caused by Covid. MPs are voting on whether to reverse the reduction on development spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income, brought in earlier this year. Opening a Commons debate, the prime minister said this was a temporary cut made to help reduce public borrowing. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""indefinite"". The government has faced cross-party criticism over the reduction, which amounts to almost Â£4bn. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Syrian children who know war planes but not shops Gates and others to partially cover UK aid cuts Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Many Conservative MPs have spoken out against the move,announced last Novemberdespite a commitment to spending 0.7% in the party's 2019 election manifesto. Meeting the 0.7% figure was made law in 2015, and it is an internationally recognised target, and charities such as Oxfam and ActionAid have warned thatprojects are being called offas a result of the cuts. If MPs defeat the government in the vote, spending will revert to 0.7% of national income by January next year. If the government wins, it will happen only when national debt is falling and borrowing is no longer used for day-to-day spending. Last month, 30 Conservative MPs supported an amendment to a parliamentary bill, aimed at forcing the government to meet the 0.7% target. If they oppose the cut again later, another 14 or so Tories would have to join them to ensure a government defeat. Mr Johnson told MPs ministers had spent Â£407bn during the pandemic to ""shelter our people from an economic hurricane never before experienced in living memory"". He added: ""There must inevitably be consequences."" The prime minister said that this year national debt was expected to reach 100% of economic output, ""the highest for nearly six decades"". He added that the reduction was temporary and the UK could ""take pride that the UK will still contribute at least Â£10bn of our GDP"" to aid. ""This is not an argument about principle,"" Mr Johnson said. ""The only question is when we return to 0.7% and my purpose today is to describe how we propose to achieve this shared goal in an affordable way."" Governments only call votes if they think they can win. Ministers will hope the concession of a vote, the offer of clarity about when aid might increase and the lack of time their opponents have had to organise will give them an edge and soften the Tory rebellion. When it comes to whipping, the Treasury also has deep pockets and who knows what goodies might be on offer to dissident rebel MPs in the upcoming Spending Review? If the government wins, there will be consequences. The current status quo is that Downing Street is under political pressure to return aid spending to 0.7% of national income next year. But if the Treasury wins today, that will not happen. Aid spending will be locked in for years. How long will depend not just on the economy, but on Treasury's tax and spend decisions and its interpretation of some rather loose tests. Both sides in this debate accept UK aid cuts have a material impact. It is just a question of priorities - responsible belt-tightening at home or generosity abroad. But if the UK cuts aid by Â£4bn every year, then millions overseas will suffer. But Sir Keir, who confirmed Labour would vote against the government, said the cut was ""not in the national interest"", adding: ""Every member here was elected on a manifesto promise to retain the 0.7% target."" ""Every living prime minister thinks this is wrong,"" he added. ""There is only one prime minister who is prepared to do this and he is sitting there."" He later added: ""Cutting aid will increase costs and have a big impact on our economy. Development aid reduces conflict. It reduces disease and people fleeing from their homes. ""It is a false economy to pretend that this is some sort of cut that doesn't have consequences."" Former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, one of the Conservative MPs who have been highly critical of the cut, said she would also vote against the government, but ""with regret"". ""We made a promise to the poorest people in the world,"" she added. ""The government has broken that promise."" And former Brexit Secretary David Davis called the cut to aid spending ""morally reprehensible"". On Saturday, a group of philanthropists, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,said they would provide Â£93.5m emergency fundingto cover some of the UK's reduction.

"Nicola Sturgeon confirms that restrictions will be eased, but face masks will be required ""for some time to come"" The first minister tells a virtual sitting of the Scottish Parliament that caution is still needed with rules easing at a ""responsible pace, not an irresponsible pace"" She confirms that from 19 July wedding and funeral limits move from 100 to 200 people and it will not longer be necessary to book two-hour slots in hospitality In England all legal restrictions, including those associated with face coverings, will be removed from next Monday. However, masks would still be ""expected and recommended"" in crowded indoor areas Ms Sturgeon says she hopes that it will still be possible for most legal restrictions to end on 9 August in Scotland From that date ""blanket"" self-isolation requirements will no longer apply to those who have been double vaccinated and whose tests come back negative Scotland's Conservative and Labour leaders voice criticism of the Scottish government's vaccine rollout programme and test and protect system BBC Scotland News Headlines from Nicola Sturgeon's announcement to the Scottish Parliament The GMB union has issued a warning over the possibility of changes to self-isolation rules, saying ""don't go there"". Senior Organiser for Public Services Drew Duffy says unions were told on Tuesday morning that exemptions were being considered because of understaffing crises in the NHS and social care sector. But he says those problems were ""well understood"" by ministers and employers pre-Covid and
they ""didnât act"". He adds that the move would only anger and concern
staff who were ""already absolutely exhausted and undercut"", while confirming their safety was not a priority for the government. This should act as a final warning about the need for urgent and transformative investment in health and social care, so we can attract and retain the people and skills we so obviously need. That means delivering proper value for workers in their pay and conditions. Drew Duffy, GMB union Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Business will be disappointed that the continued requirement for self isolation for those in proximity to people testing positive for Covid. That is taking a toll on firms currently seeing large numbers of workers required to stay at home, meaning some are having to close temporarily.


That wonât be eased until the next phase rules, scheduled for 9 August. And even then, those without double jags will still have to isolate. They are more likely to be young, and much of hospitality depends on young workers.


They will have to close up at midnight, contrary to expectations of a move to flexible, local licensing rules. This is not just for Cinderella and vampires, but because those still carousing after 12 are less likely to be observing distancing rules. Outdoor gatherings also remain constrained, with a maximum of 15 people. With that limit, little of this summerâs events industry looks salvageable, though itâs over to economy secretary Kate Forbes to negotiate application of the rules for events that are already planned. A mixed response comes from the Scottish Tourism Alliance, who are relieved to move forward, but say it is 'not the level zero' they envisaged. CEO Marc Crothall says the changes will be the closest to normal the industry has experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. He said there was good news for the wedding and events
sector with the removal on outdoor distancing requirements for groups of 15 to
allow guests to mingle, but said he was disappointed this was not brought forward to Friday to allow more freedoms at weddings
this weekend. But he remains concerned about the effects of self-isolation rules.  There are huge concerns across the industry in relation to the self-isolation policy and the impact this is having on businesses to staff.  We are reassured by the Scottish governmentâs commitment to removing the need for people to self-isolate if they are double vaccinated. Marc Crothall, Scottish Tourism Alliance A leading figure in the retail industry says the government's announcement on restrictions will likely ""further push back recovery"" for city centres and high streets. Ewan
MacDonald-Russell, the Scottish Retail Consortium's head of policy, points out that face coverings and physical distancing will still affect staff and customers. He says: ""Whilst
government views rising case numbers as justification for a deceleration on the
path back to normality, that doesnât mean the pressures on businesses arenât
also real. ""The Scottish government needs to be prepared to consider how best to
support struggling retailers if the return back to normal trading continues to
take longer than anticipated."" The announcement that Scotland will move in tandem with England's travel quarantine rules has pleased travel businesses. Passengers returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine on their return if they are fully vaccinated. Jacqueline Dobson, the president of Barrhead Travel said that it was encouraging with a few weeks left of the school holidays. And she expected booking demand would be high over the coming weeks. âTens of thousands of holidaymakers and those travelling to reunite with loved ones will be relieved. The two key areas of concern from those travelling abroad were of quarantine on return and cost of testing. Breaking down the barriers of one of these issues is a step in the right direction. Jacqueline Dobson, Barrhead Travel Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor The words youâre not hearing from Nicola Sturgeon are âFreedom Dayâ. Instead, this is more like Caution Month, to follow 15 others, as the ratchet is gradually eased. For business, this puts on hold, at least until 9 August, the permission to let office workers return to their desks. That is a big loss for city centres, where footfall has taken a big hit from the loss of commuter custom in cafes, bars, restaurants and shops. It also comes at a cost to public transport operators, who will wantcontinued subsidy to plugthe revenue gap. Much more welcome for businesses is an easing of the distance rules indoors, down for everyone for two metres to one, allowing them to re-arrange their space, and accommodate more people. For hospitiality, it no longer requires advance booking to get a table to eat, so there should be more passing trade. And they like clarity. In contrast with the rules announced for England on Monday, shops, hospitality and public transport can be clear that the law still requires face covering. It is not open to individualsâ or staff interpretation. So legal liability for infection is not a private companyâs concern, and the first minister is saying sheâs willing to take any flak thatâs going. Nicola Sturgeon makes the case that gradual easing stands the best chance of being sustainable, and so long-term, that approach is better for the economy. The week before the 9 August changes, expect further caution for the next stage. Question from Jessica from Ingliston The need for young people in school, college or university to self isolate if they are close contacts of positive cases is being reviewed as part of preparations for the new academic term. The first minister tells MSPs the Scottish government has asked its education advisory group for advice on whether the requirement, which causes significant disruption to young people and their families, can be removed. She adds the group's conclusions will be set out ""well in advance of
the new term"". Nicola Sturgeon also confirms she is still waiting on advice from the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as to whether children over 12 should be vaccinated. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce is disappointed in the modified level zero framework. Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron said that the progress on 19 July would be an ""encouraging milestone"" towards the full re-opening of Scotland's economy. However, she said the modified framework deviated away from what businesses
had been preparing for and that moving the goalposts at this late stage would cause
uncertainty, negatively impacting on business confidence and recovery. She said her view was to that we should continue on the path set out towards the lifting of all
restrictions on the 9th of August as planned The postponing of the phased return of offices will be a bitter blow for employees and employers alike, many of which had been getting ready to welcome employees back into offices from next week. This will also sound alarm bells for those town and city centre businesses, reliant on office worker footfall and custom. Dr Liz Cameron, Scottish Chambers of Commerce Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Easing restrictions is likely to lead to a rise in people testing positive for coronavirus. The argument from the first minister is that this is manageable as vaccines are creating a good ring of protection against serious disease and death. But it creates another problem. More positive cases means more of their contacts having to isolate, all with the potential to seriously disrupt key services like schooling or the NHS. The number of NHS staff either sick or isolating due to Covid has doubled over the last month. As the health service deals with an increase in Covid patients alongside higher than usual levels of non-Covid admissions, this becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Senior medical staff wanted a rethink of the rules around self isolation, most have had two jags, they also wear PPE at work and are regularly tested. They will be pleased to hear the plan is to remove them after 9 August provided people are double vaccinated and test negative. The Federation
of Small Businesses (FSB) Scotland has praised the move to level zero with modifications. Policy chair Andrew McRae said it was good news for smaller businesses bound by the 2m social distancing rule but said the announcement did little for the events industry. He also said that the big key date for business would be 9 August. Small businesses do now have some clarity about the conditions in which theyâll be trading. Itâs less good news for  the events sector, trying salvage something of whatâs left of the summer, that weâre not seeing the complete end of social distancing outside. Removing the requirement to pre-book your slot at a hospitality venue should hopefully generate some extra passing trade. Andrew McRae, FSB Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has provided an update
on Covid restrictions: From Monday 19 July, all parts of Scotland will be at level
zero, however, there will be modifications. These include: hospitality venues being required to
close at midnight; physical distancing in indoor public places and postponing
the instruction to return to the office.  Question from Scott in Glasgow UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said masks would still be ""recommended"" on public transportin England, but people without a face covering would no longer be fined after restrictions are eased on 19 July. But in Scotland the first minister has confirmed face coverings will remain mandatory on public transport when the country moves to level zero on Monday. Nicola Sturgeon also tells MSPs it is ""highly likely "" that the mandatory wearing of face coverings will remain the Scottish government's position when all Covid restrictions are lifted on 9 August. She adds: ""I think wearing a face covering is a something that we are likely to be required to do for some time yet."" Ms Sturgeon says face coverings are a ""small price to pay"" to protect those at the highest clinical risk from the virus. And she tells MSPs she does not want Scotland to become a two-tier society where the most vulnerable have to ""shield by default."" The largest hospital in the Highlands is no longer on ""code black"" status. Raigmore Hospital in Invernesshad reached capacity last weekamid increasing Covid cases. All non-urgent elective surgery was cancelled, as was outpatient activity - with the exception of areas including cancer and urgent procedures. However NHS Highland said the situation was no longer considered to be code black, and thanked staff for their efforts. Read more Willie Rennie, in his last question as Lib Dem leader,  brings up hospital ""code blacks"", closed pharmacies and waste unlifted due to high numbers of key workers self-isolating. He asks if there is a plan for a ""test and release"" system so these people can return to work. He also highlights a lack of services during the pandemic for adults with special needs and their families. On this, the first minister says that physical distancing has prevented many services and the reduction to 1m indoors will enable many services to restart. Allow Twitter content?

On hospitals pausing non-Covid treatment, she says this is kept to the shortest time period possible. On self-isolation, she says that she hopes to move away from the blanket requirement for close contacts to isolate for 10 days. Ms Sturgeon is considering ahead of that if that system can be introduced for key groups including health and social care. She says she is discussing this with trade unions but is mindful when speaking of this, those working in those services may see if as giving less protection to them. A decision will be announced in due course. She also pays tribute to Mr Rennie,who announced his resignation yesterday, for ""a good shift"" of ten years. David Wallace LockhartBBC Scotland political reporter Nicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said âI will always err on the side of going more cautiouslyâ. England is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. 

But Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasise restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option âfor good headlinesâ. A statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.

Despite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned. An obvious point of divergence from England â face coverings.

While laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (theyâll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear theyâll stay here âfor as long as necessaryâ. 

It feels like theyâll be one of the last measures to go. Greens co-leader Lorna Slater asks whether it is too early to
restart large indoor events which are largely staffed by young people - and could they
become super spreader events. The FM says the question is ""perfectly sensible"" and that she will always ""err on going more cautiously"". Ms Sturgeon says the government is trying to ensure over-18s are vaccinated as ""quickly as possible"" - a ""key priority"" - and adds that the government is not taking an upper limit off restrictions on large events. Organisers still need to go through an application process if they wish to host numbers above the limit, she explains. And in reference to the UK government's plans for ""freedom day"", she says to ""declare premature victory against the virus is a
foolâs paradise"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says what the FM has announced is not ""a clear strategy"" to cope with the new phase of the pandemic. He says the new phase requires a new approach, he says Test and Protect has not been maximised and says Scotland's vaccine rollout has slowed. He asks Ms Sturgeon to pandemic-proof our workplaces and schools and again brings up a potential move to a four-week gap between vaccine doses. Ms Sturgeon says that Mr Sarwar has just given some ""glib soundbites"" and ""irresponsibility"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She says no devolved government has gone against the JCVI on vaccines and says the dosage interval given by the JCVI remains eight weeks and if advice changes the government position will change. The FM says they want to make schools and workplaces as safe as possible but to underplay the complexities of that does no one any favours. She says that the government is doing more work around ventilation in schools but that it takes time and the best clinical advice. She says advice for schools will be issued in time for the new term. Ms Sturgeon ends by saying that vaccine rollout is not slowing because of anything the Scottish government is doing. The constraining factors are supply and dosage intervals. Question from Thanasis from Edinburgh From Monday self-isolation will no
longer be required for people arriving from countries on the amber list,
provided they are fully vaccinated through a UK vaccination programme. But the first minister confirms travellers must also take PCR test on the second day after arrival. Ms Sturgeon tells MSPs: ""We will continue to take a precautionary approach to
the inclusion of countries on the amber list. ""And, notwithstanding this change, we continue to
advise against non essential overseas travel at this time."" She also confirms that anyone testing positive for, or experiencing symptoms of, Covid will still be required to isolate for ten days. Lucy WhyteBBC Scotland education correspondent It will be frustrating for many families that there was no decision yet on whether children and teenagers will have to isolate in the coming school year. Tens of thousands of pupils were at home at any one time during last term, the vast majority because they were Covid contacts not Covid cases. In England, young people will not have to isolate when they return to school and the first minister's note that they are working on a plan here, is a nod to what she knows is mounting parent pressure  to do the same. Could we be in a position where children will have to face more severe restrictions than their vaccinated parents when it comes to isolation? That would be a hard sell and go against the government's position to make education a priority as we come out of this pandemic. I expect by the time young people are heading back to school, they will be following the same rules as the rest of society. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played A mother in Durban is forced to throw her baby from a building after it was set on fire The death toll in South Africa has risen to 72 as violence continues across the country following the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma. Crowds looting and setting alight shopping centres clashed with police in several cities on Tuesday. The BBC filmed a baby being thrown from a building in Durban that was on fire after ground-floor shops were looted. A day earlier, 10 people were killed in a stampede during looting at a shopping centre in Soweto. The military have been deployed to help police overstretched since the unrest began last week. South African police said in a statement they had identified 12 people suspected of provoking the riots, and that a total of 1,234 people had been arrested. President Cyril Ramaphosa has called it some of the worst violence witnessed in South Africa since the 1990s, before the end of apartheid, with fires started, highways blocked and businesses and warehouses looted in major cities and small towns in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories from the continent WATCH: Why has the violence broken out? Looting and shooting in South Africa 'war zone' From freedom fighter to president to jail Ministers have warned that if looting continues, there is a risk areas could run out of basic food supplies soon - but have ruled out declaring a state of emergency. The child was caught by a crowd of people who rushed to help those trapped in the apartment block in the central business district of Durban, a coastal city in KwaZulu-Natal, on Tuesday afternoon. Those stealing from shops on the ground floor of Smith Street had started the fire which spread, affecting those living upstairs. The BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Durban says that after catching the baby, the passers-by and neighbours rushed to get ladders to help other residents, including children, escape. The mother was reunited with her baby, but was too emotional to talk. The rescue services arrived after about 20 minutes to help douse the fires. More than 200 shopping malls had been looted by Monday afternoon, Bloomberg news agency quoted the chief executive officer of Business Leadership South Africa, Busisiwe Mavuso, as saying. Several shopping centres in Soweto - South Africa's largest township which was once home to Nelson Mandela - have been completely ransacked, with ATMs broken into, restaurants, stores selling alcohol and clothing shops all left in tatters. Soldiers working with the police managed to catch a few rioters; in total almost 800 have been arrested, but law enforcement remains heavily outnumbered, he reports. In KwaZulu-Natal - where livestock has also been stolen - the unrest continues with ambulances coming under attack by rioters in some areas,South Africa's TimesLive news site reports,external. Video footage shows that a blood bank was looted in Durban as Mr Ramaphosa addressed the nation on Monday night. By Farouk Chothia, BBC News The catalyst was the arrest last week of Zuma, with his supporters blockading major roads - the economic arteries of the nation - as they demanded the release of their political hero. Low income levels and unemployment - standing at a record high of 32.6% among the workforce and even higher at 46.3% among young people - are seen as the ticking bombs that have exploded. Many South Africans have been shaken by the riots that have swept through Zuma's political heartland of KwaZulu-Natal and the economic hub of Gauteng. And many feel that his successor as president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has failed to provide decisive leadership - either to calm anger over Zuma's imprisonment or to reassure South Africans that they will be safe. Mr Ramaphosa was accused of belatedly deploying troops - and only 2,500 of them compared with the 8,000 he deployed to enforce a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 last year (and authorising the use of more than 70,000 members of the defence forces if need be). But there is no agreement over the deployment - the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) opposition party has opposed it, saying the solution lies in ""political intervention and engagement with our people"". Many residents in affected areas have remained at home, and some have formed what local media call ""defence squads"" to protect their neighbourhoods and businesses as looting and burning continues. There is no doubt that the unrest is the biggest security challenge that Mr Ramaphosa has faced since he became president in 2018 after ousting Zuma. It is bound to worsen the economic crisis, already hit by the pandemic, given the scale of destruction. He was convicted of contempt of court last month after failing to attend an inquiry into corruption during his presidency. The 79-year-old, who denies corruption, was given a 15-month prison sentence. He handed himself in to police last Wednesday. He is hoping to get the sentence rescinded or reduced by the country's constitutional court. However, legal experts say his chances of success are slim. People are being investigated for inciting the violence Police Minister Bheki Cele has warned that ""no amount of unhappiness or personal circumstances from our people gives the right to anyone to loot, vandalise and do as they please and break the law"". There has been some concern over fake news online fuelling the unrest, while the governing African National Congress (ANC)had already revealed it was looking into tweets sent by Zuma's daughter, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla,external. State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo said officials were ""busy sorting fact from fiction"" after receiving information that former security agents linked to Zuma had instigated the violence.

"More than 12,500 people have died with coronavirus, since the first reported death in Scotland on 13 March 2020. Here are the stories of some of those who lost their lives. If you would like to pay tribute to a loved one lost to Covid, please use the form below or email newsonline-scotland@bbc.co.uk and ensure you have read ourterms and conditionsandprivacy policy. Jean was born in 1937 Maryhill and spoke often and fondly of her childhood in ""the Butney"". This involved real hardships - including war-time evacuation to Holytown - though Jean's memories were all good and Maryhill became a touchstone when dementia became a factor in recent years. Working at Rolls-Royce Hillington, Jean was transferred to its Derby HQ where, as a young woman, she made small component parts for jet engines. Even in her 80s, Jean could still perform all the machinist actions (with sound effects). She loved to paint landscapes and had a life-long passion for music, especially jazz (with Frankie and Ella being constants). She was a great singer and dancer, always up for fun and laughs, brightening up any party. Her family said Jean was a fabulous mum to two daughters, a brilliant friend, and a warm-hearted women with kindness for everyone and anyone. She died on 27 October 2020. Rashelle Baird's family describe her as ""kind, bubbly, and always the life and soul of the party"". The 27-year-old mother-of-three from Brechin had put off appointments to get the vaccine because she was busy with her children. Her family stressed she was not anti-vaccine. ""She wanted to get her vaccine but she put her kids first,"" her father Stephen said. Rashelle, who had asthma, initially thought she had caught a cold from her children, but her symptoms worsened and she was admitted to hospital. She died in November 2021 after several days in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, having been placed in an induced coma in the intensive care unit. Family's vaccine plea after 27-year-old's Covid death David Trower worked as a clerical officer in the A&E department of University Hospital Monklands in Airdrie before retiring in 2016. But he was committed to the NHS and even in retirement he chose to continue to work shifts, through NHS Lanarkshire's staff bank, right up until February. He died on 9 March 2021, aged 67. His colleagues thought highly of him, saying: ""We have many happy memories of shifts together, laughs, nights out, and listening to all his stories of his many holidays abroad. We will miss him."" Bernadette White, his sister, said he was a caring, gentle and loving man with a wicked sense of humour. She added: ""The last seven years, I would say, is when David started to live his life, doing the things that made him happy without having to worry about anyone else."" Stephen Stewart met his future wife, Heather, at a youth club when he was just 14. They got engaged on his 17th birthday and he had just turned 20 when they married. The couple, who lived in Motherwell, came from ""very different"" backgrounds but they grew up together during their 25-year marriage while raising their only child. Stephen took pride in his work for concrete manufacturer FP McCann, latterly as a lab technician working out what strength the concrete needed to be for certain projects. Outside work, he loved fishing, computer games, gadgets and during the first lockdown he managed to build a hot tub shelter with the help of a series of YouTube videos. He died of Covid pneumonia at University Hospital Wishaw on 19 February 2021, aged 45. Family of 45-year-old Covid victim warn of dangers Nan Douglas worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career. She was already a mother of three when she left her job as a school secretary at West Calder High School to enrol at Moray House in Edinburgh where she qualified as a primary school teacher. After losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. Following a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a ""living wake"" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. She lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020. But she picked up Covid and never left. She died on 19 February 2021, aged 95. Graeme McGrath's greatest passions were rowing and the River Clyde. On the day of his funeral, fellow rowers held oars in a guard of honour at Glasgow Green in a tribute appreciated by his wife Anne and their three sons. For 40 years Graeme volunteered with the Glasgow Humane Society and was often called on to row rescue boats on the Clyde, or to help evacuate families during floods. After undergoing a kidney transplant in his 50s, he was unable to get out on the river as much. He retired from his job as a Thomas Cook travel agent and moved to Prestwick in Ayrshire. But he still felt the pull of the Clyde and regularly returned to the city to meet friends and row safety boats at regattas. He died with Covid on 15 February 2021 at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, aged 66, after being admitted for an infection affecting his heart. Tommy Morrow spent most of his life in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, where he met his partner Jackie and raised their children, Demi and Mark. His family described him as a character and not a day went by without them laughing at his jokes. He loved camping and fishing in places like Stornoway with his friends but the most important people in his life were his family, including grandchildren, Lacey and Louden. During his career he worked in various well-known hotels and restaurants in Glasgow but he had not worked for some years due to poor health, including COPD. He died with Covid on 15 February 2021, aged 53. ""It was so cruel - he was so close to getting the vaccine,"" his family said. Tommy Rooney was a bus driver for 36 years and hugely popular with colleagues at First Bus in Larbert. On the day of his funeral they were among dozens of people who lined the streets and applauded as his cortege passed the depot. First Bus operations managerJason Hackett told the Falkirk Herald that Tommy was the ""heart and soul"",externalof the Larbert station. Married to Margaret, the Bonnybridge man had two daughters and a granddaughter who described him as a ""humble but proud family man who put everyone else's needs before his own"". An avid Celtic fan, he spent much of the pandemic driving key workers to their essential duties. He died on 12 February 2021, aged 57. David Gray's first grandchild - a girl called Islay - was born in July 2020. The proud ""papa"" used to say that she was the love of his life and she gave him a reason to wake up in the morning. Tragically, the 62-year-old only got to spend five months with her before falling ill with Covid. He died on 3 February 2021. David lived in Erskine and worked for BAE Systems for 20 years, first as a mechanical fitter then as records manager dealing with secret files for the Ministry of Defence. His family describe him as ""music daft"" - he played guitar and he was performing a gig with his band in Glasgow when he met his wife, Joyce, 40 years ago. They went on to have two children - Darren and Danielle - as well as his beloved Cocker Spaniels, Buster and Shimmer, who he described as his ""bairns"". Harry Osborne was a Dunkirk veteran whose life was full of adventures - his daughter said he was still able to recall stories until just a few days before he died. Mr Osborne was deployed to France months after joining the Territorial Army in Glasgow, served with the 77th Highland Field Regiment of the Royal Artillery and later became a surveyor. Friends recall how upon joining, he promised his mother he would not swear and instead would say ""cricky jings"", which became his nickname in the forces. He was also known as a keen golfer with a ""wicked sense of humour"". Mr Osborne died from Covid-19 on 25 January, nine months after celebrating his 100th birthday. Connie Simpson's grandchildren say she was more like a pal than a granny - she was full of fun and laughter, and was always the first up to dance at a party. Born in Kinning Park, Glasgow, she moved to the east end after marrying John who she met at the Barrowlands when they were teenagers. While John was away with the Merchant Navy, she brought up their four children in a house ""surrounded by love"", before taking work as a curtain consultant. She was fabulous even in her 80s - she loved getting her hair, eyebrows and manicure done, meeting friends at Mecca Bingo in Parkhead and at a local pensioners' club. Connie died on 23 January 2021 at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow, aged 82. Sheila Gartly was as ""bright as a button"" and the ""heart of our family"", her loved ones said. She was born and brought up in Deskford, Moray, before marrying and moving to Keith in 1954. Widowed in 1975, she remarried but lost her second husband in 2005. During her working life she had jobs in a florist and in a fish shop - both of which she thoroughly enjoyed. She loved to watch the birds in her garden, read her daily newspaper, listen to traditional Scottish music, and the spring and summer when the nights were lighter and flowers bloomed. In 2019 she had surgery on a broken leg but she was recovering well.  She died with Covid on 19 January 2021, aged 86. Alex Goldie was an electrical engineer who latterly worked as a lecturer at Stow College in Glasgow before his retirement. His family said he was a gregarious man, always interested in other people, who took great delight and pride in the antics and education of his two great-grandsons, Charlie and Joe. During his long life he enjoyed skiing, tennis, pottery, sailing, golf, holidays in Europe, Australia and North America, single malts and red wine. He had been well cared for by Randolph Hill nursing home in Dunblane for 19 months after developing dementia. Covid restrictions meant he had not seen his family, other than by Skype, for a year. He is thought to have contracted the virus on a trip to A&E after a fall. He died on 14 January, aged 100. Vincent Logan became one of the youngest bishops in the world when he was ordained Bishop of Dunkeld in 1981, aged 39. He served the Roman Catholic diocese for almost 32 years before his retirement in 2012. The Scottish Catholic Church said he was ""dedicated and energetic"" and had ""an energy and zeal in all he did"". Born in Bathgate in 1941, he was ordained a priest in Edinburgh in 1964. He died on 14 January, aged 79, the day after his friend the Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia. ""Both bishops succumbed to the lethal effects of the coronavirus,"" the current Bishop of Dunkeld, Stephen Robson, added. The Archbishop of Glasgow, the Most Reverend Philip Tartaglia, died suddenly at his home in the city on 13 January - the Feast of St Mungo, the Patron Saint of Glasgow. He had been self-isolating after testing positive for Covid shortly after Christmas. Born in Glasgow in 1951, he was ordained a priest in 1975 and had served as leader of Scotland's largest Catholic community since 2012. Scotland's Catholic bishops described Archbishop Tartaglia as a ""gentle, caring and warm-hearted pastor who combined compassion with a piercing intellect"". Among those who paid tribute were First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken, who described the archbishop as ""a true Glaswegian"". Archbishop of Glasgow dies after contracting Covid Liz Shingleston was a well-known figure in the village of Dunragit and her death on 13 January had a big impact on the small community near Stranraer. ""Her hearse passed the bottom of the village and the amount of people who turned out to pay their respects was overwhelming,"" said her daughter, Lisa. Liz spent her early childhood in New Luce but moved to the railway station cottage in Dunragit where her father worked as a signalman. During a varied working life, Liz left school to work in the laboratory of the nearby Nestle factory and later replaced her own mother as the local school's dinner lady. The 73-year-old was devoted to her grandchildren and great-grandson but she also liked to treat herself to afternoon tea (with Prosecco) at Trump Turnberry. Hugh Polland, who was known as Shug to his friends and family, was born and raised in Glasgow's Easterhouse. He was well known in the area where he ran the Casbah Pub for many years during the 1980s and early 90s. A huge Celtic fan, he loved to play golf and took up photography later in life - becoming ""unofficial photographer"" at many friends' weddings, christening and parties. ""Everyone wanted him at their party not just to take photos but because of his personality,"" said his son, Tony McAllister. ""Everyone loved him because what you seen is what you got."" Shug died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 5 January, aged 70. His sudden death has left his family heartbroken. For more than 75 years George Wight lived on his dairy farm in the village of Drumoak in Aberdeenshire. But he had more than one string to his bow - as well as being a dairy farmer, for 25 years he was also the publican of his local, the Irvine Arms. A loyal Aberdeen FC fan, he was one of the lucky ones - he was in Gothenburg in 1983 to see the his beloved Dons lift the European Cup Winners Cup. He was devoted to his family, including wife Claire and their four children, and despite suffering a series of bereavements and health setbacks, he always bounced back. ""He was an inspiration and a hardy soul who kept going no matter what life threw at him,"" they said. George died at a nursing home on 4 January 2021, aged 85. Hugh Bell loved to dance. As a young man, when he doing his national service with the RAF, he was a regular at the dancing at the YMCA in Paisley. It was there he met the love of his life, Margaret. They were married for 63 years and had two children Alan and Stuart. Margaret passed away in 2013. A keen ballroom dancer, Hugh was often first on the dance floor and in his later years he enjoyed dancing to the entertainment at Southerness caravan park, near Dumfries, where Stuart and his friend had a holiday home. He was a bright, bubbly sociable man who spent a career in logistics before working as a lollipop man in his retirement. Hugh died on 31 December at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, aged 92. David Warnock was a keen sportsman who loved squash, tennis, rugby, football, cycling and climbing munros. In fact, it was on the tennis courts in Aberdeen that he met his teenage sweetheart, Zena. He was 17 and she was 14 - they were married for 62 years. An electrical engineer, he worked for Pye Communications, moving first to Cambridge and then Edinburgh. He was a quiet man who never complained about anything and was happiest around his family - including four children, 11 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. His second great-grandchild was born shortly after he died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 31 December. He was 85. The suburb with Scotland's highest mortality rate Henry Anderson, an SNP councillor on Perth and Kinross Council, died with Covid on 27 December. He had represented the Almond and Earn ward since 2012 and colleagues said he would be ""hugely missed"". Among those who paid tribute to the 68-year-old was Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who described him as ""a good, decent man and a faithful councillor"". Murray Lyle, the leader of Perth and Kinross Council, said Mr Anderson was an excellent advocate for his ward and ""passionate about local issues"". ""I had the pleasure of working with Henry for several years on the Local Review Body and always his enjoyed his company, good humour and sense of fun when we were out visiting planning sites."" Teenage sweethearts Bryson Mitchell and his wife Irene were due to celebrate their diamond wedding anniversary in January, They met when he was an 18-year-old apprentice electrician and was assigned to a contract with the company where Irene, who was 16, was working. After marrying in 1961, Bryson spent his adult life in Paisley and 35 years working as an aircraft electrician with British Airways. The couple had two children and four grandchildren, who described him as a quiet man with a great sense of humour. ""He was kind and generous, very hardworking, and he lived for his family,"" they said. He was in hospital being treated for an acute illness when he contracted Covid. He died on Christmas Eve, aged 82. As a child, Sandy Adam survived pioneering surgery to remove his voice box - an operation that left him unable to speak normally. Instead he learned a different way to communicate - oesophageal speech (swallowing air) - by drinking lots of lemonade. He had a life-long hatred of the fizzy drink after that. After training to be a dentist in Dundee, he returned to his hometown of Aberdeen. In addition to surgeries around the city, at one time he worked at Craiginches Prison one afternoon a week. A father and a grandfather, he loved tinkering with cars, pranking his two children and sitting in the sun with a glass of red wine. The 81-year-old, who had dementia, died on 16 December, shortly after testing positive for Covid. David Barr was born and grew up in Paisley and for more than 40 years he worked in the town's Anchor Mill. As well as being a keen bowler, a church elder, and an active member of Martyrs Church Men's Club, he had a gift for carpentry. The dolls houses and garages that he made for his children and grandchildren were much loved and they are still treasured. His favourite place in the world was the East Neuk of Fife, where he spent many happy holidays. David had an underlying respiratory condition and he was admitted to hospital with shortness of breath in December. He died within days of being diagnosed with Covid on 16 December, aged 86. Ana Lisa Sayson was a nurse who moved from the Philippines to work for the NHS in Scotland. She was a staff nurse at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow before she moved to Glasgow Royal Infirmary during the Covid crisis. The mother-of-two died on 15 December after testing positive for the virus. ""Ana Lisa was a much-loved member of the team and an incredibly compassionate nurse who was devoted to the care of her patients,"" said John Stuart, the chief nurse at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. ""Ana Lisa came to our country from the Philippines to care for our loved ones and my heart goes out to her family and especially her husband and children. ""My thoughts, and the thoughts of all of her NHS family here in Glasgow, are with them at this terribly sad time."" Billy and May Fannin were married for 62 years after meeting at a ballroom in Glasgow in 1955. May was a bookkeeper who gave up her job to look after her grandchildren in the 1980s. ""Her life revolved around her four grandchildren,"" their younger daughter Jennifer told BBC Scotland. Billy was a joiner by trade but his real passion was singing, performing under the name Scott Allan. And as a member of Equity, he also took on work as an extra on TV programmes like Take the High Road and Taggart. He loved being the centre of attention and ""if he was chocolate he would have eaten himself"", Jennifer joked. When the couple from Barrhead caught Covid, their two daughters also fell ill with the virus and had to self-isolate.

Classical music, politics and poetry were his passions - as a teenager he won a major Welsh poetry contest and his daughter, Mhairi Jarvie, treasures a ring-binder full of his poems. She affectionately described her father as a cross between Coronation Street's Ken Barlow and Victor Meldrew - ""intelligent, opinionated, political, but grumpy and a tad anti-social"". Glyn died with Covid on 11 April 2020, aged 76. Maths teacher Gerry McHugh was a ""true gentleman"", able to inspire every single student who walked through his door. His death would have a ""devastating effect"" on the Notre Dame High School community in Greenock, head teacher Katie Couttie said. Unable to attend his funeral due to the lockdown, past and current pupils found a unique way to pay tribute to the 58-year-old. They wore red and posted images on social media in memory of the lifelong Manchester United fan. He died on 11 April. Pupils find safe way to honour much-loved teacher Eileen McCarron died in Glasgow Royal Infirmary less than 24 hours after falling ill. She had no underlying health concerns. A mother of three daughters, she spent 18 years working as a nursery teacher at Save the Children's Charles Street playgroup in Glasgow's Germiston. She gave up the job to look after her only grandson, Patrick. Her husband of more than 35 years, also Patrick, died suddenly in 1997, aged just 57. As well as volunteering at a Barnardo's charity shop, she liked shopping, knitting, going out for coffees and lunches, and holidays with her family. She was 79 when she died on 9 April, leaving her family devastated and unable to comfort each other during lockdown. They had still not been able to hold a memorial service nine months later. Helen McMillan was 10 days short of her 85th birthday when she died at Almond Court care home in Glasgow's Drumchapel on 9 April. She spent most of her life in Summerston, where she widely known as ""Auntie Ellen"" - even to those she wasn't related to. ""Everybody loved my mum,"" her daughter, Jackie Marlow, told BBC Scotland. ""She knew everybody in the community and was the life and soul of the party."" Helen worked in McLellan's rubber factory in Maryhill until she was in her 50s. A grandmother to Hayley and Josh, she developed dementia in later life but she was still ""pretty agile and loving life"", her daughter said. Mary Martin and her husband, Alex, were keen ballroom dancers. Although their roots were firmly in Glasgow, they spent seven years in Dunblane where they were tasked with encouraging people on to the dancefloor at the Dunblane Hydro. Before that, Mrs Martin brought up her family in Mount Vernon, later moving to Bearsden. She had three children, six grandchildren, three great-grandchildren and a great-great grandchild. Her daughter, Sandra O'Neill, told BBC Scotland she was ""just a wonderful person - gentle and kind"". In her later years she had vascular dementia and she lived at the Almond Court care home in Drumchapel. She died there on 8 April, aged 88. Vic and Maureen Sharp, who were both 74, had been together since they were teenagers. Underlying health conditions meant the couple from Oakley in Fife were both asked to shield themselves during lockdown. But their daughter, Yvonne Sharp, believes the letter came too late and they caught the virus during a weekly trip to the supermarket. Maureen died in hospital on 8 April and then, Yvonne said, her father ""just gave up"". He died the following day. Only six members of the family could attend their funeral but a piper led the funeral cortege through Oakley, where locals lined the streets. Lockdown causing 'acute grief' for bereaved When Ann Tonner left the Nazareth House orphanage in Glasgow as teenager, she was one of the few women of colour in the city, according to her son, Tony McCaffery. She was ""exotic-looking and quite glamourous"" and was soon in demand as a model for local shops and boutiques before working as a celebrated hot-dog girl in an Odeon cinema. Her first husband tragically died and her second was largely absent, leaving her to bring up six children and - at times - hold down five jobs at once. She was a ""remarkable, formidable woman with a strong work ethic"", Mr McCaffery told BBC Scotland, but she was also a ""gentle soul with an incredibly child-like sense of humour"". A grandmother and great-grandmother, Mrs Tonner died at a nursing home in Glasgow where she was living with Alzheimer's, on 8 April. She was 84. Mary Nixon was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when she was just 18 but she was determined to never let it hold her back. Born and raised in Greenock, she was a lone parent to four children who described her as a ""strong, independent woman who lived life to the full"". ""My mum made being a single parent look easy"", her daughter Alexis said. ""We were very happy kids growing up. Everyone loved her and always said she was a 'wee gem'."" When she fell seriously ill in 2014, her family was told to prepare for the worst, but their ""invincible"" mum rallied, though she lost her mobility. She died with Covid on 7 April 2020, aged 66. After everything she had been through in life, her family said they felt ""robbed... that this awful virus has taken her from us"". Janice Graham was the first NHS worker to die with coronavirus in Scotland. The health care support worker and district nurse died at Inverclyde Royal Hospital on 6 April. One colleague said she had a ""bright and engaging personality and razor sharp wit"". Another said the 58-year-old was the ""most kind, caring and compassionate HCA I have had the privilege to work with"". Her son, Craig,told STV News,externalhe would miss everything about her. Nurse remembered for her 'kindness and compassion' Newly-wed Andy Wyness developed a high temperature and a cough following a trip to Wales. When his symptoms worsened the 53-year-old drove himself from his Wishaw home to an appointment at an assessment centre. That was the last time his wife, Sandra, saw him. The grandfather, who was a keen bowler, was taken straight to hospital by ambulance. He died on 6 April. ""Even walking out the house that night, although I knew he wasn't well, I never imagined he would never walk back in,"" Sandra said. My husband went to the doctor and never came back Rita Hawthorn spent the first 35 years of her life in Hamilton, where she was born, grew up and had her own family. But when her husband, Robert, lost his job as a miner the couple and their three children re-located from the west of Scotland to the far north in 1973. While Robert took up a new job at the Scottish Instruments Factory in Wick, she worked as a cleaner at a nearby job centre and became secretary of the Highlands and Islands Civil Service Union. She was sadly widowed at 51 but she was ""fiercely independent"" and went on to fulfil her dreams of travelling - a trip up the Nile, a safari in South Africa, and solo bus tours to Austria and Paris. Rita, who was a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, fell ill during the first week of lockdown. She died at Caithness General Hospital on 6 April, aged 82. Bill Paul grew up in Giffnock on the south side of Glasgow and did his national service as a radar operator with the RAF in Malta. In his youth he was an extremely accomplished tennis player and it was through the sport that he met his first wife, Frances, who died in 1984. With his second wife, Liz, he loved to play golf and travel - hobbies that he continued after her death in 2012. An extremely active man, he loved to go on cruises with a group of like-minded friends. However his last cruise to the Caribbean was cut short by the pandemic in March. He returned home to Arran and fell ill with Covid within a week. He died at Lamlash Hospital on 5 April, aged 81. Mofizul Islam was beginning a new life in Scotland after relocating from Bangladesh when he fell ill with coronavirus. His family believe the 49-year-old caught the virus on his daily three-hour journeys between their Edinburgh home and his job at a pizza outlet in Midlothian. He died on 5 April and was buried in the Muslim section of a city cemetery but his wife and children were in isolation and unable to attend. His death has left the family ""completely helpless"", according to a family friend as they have no documents, no bank account and they are struggling for money. ""We are very worried about our future because we don't have our father,"" said Mofizul's 19-year-old son, Azahural. ""He was everything for us. And now we are just hopeless."" Family 'helpless' after father's coronavirus death Catherine Sweeney was a ""wonderful mother, sister and beloved aunty"", her family said after her death on 4 April. Born and raised in Dumbarton, she worked as a home carer for more than 20 years. Her family said she would be sorely missed after a ""lifetime of service"" to the community. And they praised the medics at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley who ""heroically"" looked after her in her final days. Carer was 'dedicated to the most vulnerable' Jimmy Andrews was 17 years old when began his career in Glasgow Corporation's finance department in 1955. By the turn of the century, he had risen to become chief executive of Glasgow City Council and in 2001 he was appointed CBE for services to local government - a ""career highlight"". He was born in Kilsyth but spent much of his life living in Strathblane, Stirlingshire, with his wife of 52 years, Mary. In retirement, he ""enjoyed life to the full"", spending time with his three children and six grandchildren, and visiting horse racing courses throughout the country. A gentle, intelligent man with a great sense of humour, he died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 3 April 2020, aged 81. Lord Gordon of Strathblane was a former political editor of STV and he founded Radio Clyde. He died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 31 March after contracting coronavirus, Radio Clyde reported. He was 83. His family paid tribute to his ""generosity, his kindness and his enthusiasm for life"". Former First Minister Jack McConnell said Lord Gordon had ""an outstanding career in business and public service"". Labour peer dies 'after contracting coronavirus' Ryan Storrie was in Scotland to celebrate his 40th birthday with a trip to a Rangers match when he fell ill. The father-of-two was from Ardrossan but lived in Dubai. When he developed symptoms, the asthmatic isolated in his hotel room and waited for the virus to run its course. His condition deteriorated but he wouldn't let his wife, Hilary, phone 999 as he was convinced he would recover and didn't want to bother the NHS. She found him dead in his room on 31 March. 'Ryan was the last person I expected to die' Mary and Andy Leaman began self-isolating at the end of March after falling ill with flu-like symptoms. Their son, Andy, told theGlasgow Evening Times,externalthe couple were married 50 years and doted on their only granddaughter, nine-year-old Anna. Mrs Leaman died at home in Castlemilk on 30 March - four days after the death of Anna's maternal grandfather, Dougie Chambers. The schoolgirl lost her third grandparent almost three weeks later when Mr Leaman died in hospital on 19 April. Her mother, Lynsey Chalmers, told BBC Scotland: ""For a nine-year-old girl whose three grandparents were her world... why does a wee girl need to get punished like that over and over again?"" Earlier lockdown 'could have stopped 2,000 deaths' Robert Tarbet was ""self-opinionated and witty"", according to his daughter, Paula Karoly, but also ""hardworking, loyal and beautiful"". He spent his working life as a plumber with Glasgow City Council before retiring in the early 2000s. In his spare time, the sociable man was a mason who was a keen follower of Rangers FC. He loved country and western music and watching musicals in the theatre. A father and a grandfather-of-three, he was being treated for cancer when he contracted coronavirus. He died on 29 March at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, aged 76. School janitor Ian Wilson was at home in Coatbridge for two weeks with a high temperature and delirium before being admitted to hospital. Despite his worsening condition, doctors initially told his wife, Sandra, she would not be able to visit the 72-year-old who had a heart condition and diabetes. Staff eventually granted access provided she wore protective equipment - a decision which meant she could be at her husband's side when he died on 29 March. Although nurses were unable to comfort her with a hug due to social distancing protocols, Mrs Wilson is grateful they allowed her to be with her partner at the end. ""I was able to talk to him and just say goodbye. I've got strength from that,"" she said. The impact my husband's death had on NHS staff Dougie Chambers was one of several people who fell ill after the 40th birthday party of his daughter, Wendy, on 7 March. Within days, the 66-year-old, who had an underlying health condition, went into hospital and tested positive for Covid-19. Mr Chambers, who was from Castlemilk in Glasgow, died two weeks later, on 26 March. Two other members of his extended family - Andy and Mary Leaman - also contracted the virus and later died. Wendy said: ""If we knew then what we know now, we wouldn't have had the party. It wouldn't have happened."" Earlier lockdown 'could have stopped 2,000 deaths' Danny Cairns was a healthy 68-year-old before he fell ill with coronavirus, according to his brother, Hugh. When he developed a cough and sore throat at the end of March, he isolated at home in Greenock. But within days he was so ill he had to be taken to hospital by ambulance. In a video call from his hospital bed, his last words to his brother were: ""I'm on my way out, mate"". He died on 26 March, three days after arriving in hospital. 'I'm on my way out, mate' Margaret Innes lived with her daughter, Sally McNaught, in Edinburgh for four years before her death at the very beginning of the pandemic. She was housebound and very frail but she loved sitting with their pet cat and dog, doing crosswords and watching quiz shows. Her favourite soap was Neighbours and she used to say ""I'm off to Australia now"". Ms McNaught said they stopped visitors coming to the house a week before lockdown, they washed their hands, cleaned everything and thought they would be safe. But Ms Innes woke up on Mother's Day with severe breathing difficulties. She died on 25 March, three days after going into hospital. She was 93. .

"Nicola Sturgeon confirms that restrictions will be eased, but face masks will be required ""for some time to come"" The first minister tells a virtual sitting of the Scottish Parliament that caution is still needed with rules easing at a ""responsible pace, not an irresponsible pace"" She confirms that from 19 July wedding and funeral limits move from 100 to 200 people and it will not longer be necessary to book two-hour slots in hospitality In England all legal restrictions, including those associated with face coverings, will be removed from next Monday. However, masks would still be ""expected and recommended"" in crowded indoor areas Ms Sturgeon says she hopes that it will still be possible for most legal restrictions to end on 9 August in Scotland From that date ""blanket"" self-isolation requirements will no longer apply to those who have been double vaccinated and whose tests come back negative Scotland's Conservative and Labour leaders voice criticism of the Scottish government's vaccine rollout programme and test and protect system BBC Scotland News Headlines from Nicola Sturgeon's announcement to the Scottish Parliament The GMB union has issued a warning over the possibility of changes to self-isolation rules, saying ""don't go there"". Senior Organiser for Public Services Drew Duffy says unions were told on Tuesday morning that exemptions were being considered because of understaffing crises in the NHS and social care sector. But he says those problems were ""well understood"" by ministers and employers pre-Covid and
they ""didnât act"". He adds that the move would only anger and concern
staff who were ""already absolutely exhausted and undercut"", while confirming their safety was not a priority for the government. This should act as a final warning about the need for urgent and transformative investment in health and social care, so we can attract and retain the people and skills we so obviously need. That means delivering proper value for workers in their pay and conditions. Drew Duffy, GMB union Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Business will be disappointed that the continued requirement for self isolation for those in proximity to people testing positive for Covid. That is taking a toll on firms currently seeing large numbers of workers required to stay at home, meaning some are having to close temporarily.


That wonât be eased until the next phase rules, scheduled for 9 August. And even then, those without double jags will still have to isolate. They are more likely to be young, and much of hospitality depends on young workers.


They will have to close up at midnight, contrary to expectations of a move to flexible, local licensing rules. This is not just for Cinderella and vampires, but because those still carousing after 12 are less likely to be observing distancing rules. Outdoor gatherings also remain constrained, with a maximum of 15 people. With that limit, little of this summerâs events industry looks salvageable, though itâs over to economy secretary Kate Forbes to negotiate application of the rules for events that are already planned. A mixed response comes from the Scottish Tourism Alliance, who are relieved to move forward, but say it is 'not the level zero' they envisaged. CEO Marc Crothall says the changes will be the closest to normal the industry has experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. He said there was good news for the wedding and events
sector with the removal on outdoor distancing requirements for groups of 15 to
allow guests to mingle, but said he was disappointed this was not brought forward to Friday to allow more freedoms at weddings
this weekend. But he remains concerned about the effects of self-isolation rules.  There are huge concerns across the industry in relation to the self-isolation policy and the impact this is having on businesses to staff.  We are reassured by the Scottish governmentâs commitment to removing the need for people to self-isolate if they are double vaccinated. Marc Crothall, Scottish Tourism Alliance A leading figure in the retail industry says the government's announcement on restrictions will likely ""further push back recovery"" for city centres and high streets. Ewan
MacDonald-Russell, the Scottish Retail Consortium's head of policy, points out that face coverings and physical distancing will still affect staff and customers. He says: ""Whilst
government views rising case numbers as justification for a deceleration on the
path back to normality, that doesnât mean the pressures on businesses arenât
also real. ""The Scottish government needs to be prepared to consider how best to
support struggling retailers if the return back to normal trading continues to
take longer than anticipated."" The announcement that Scotland will move in tandem with England's travel quarantine rules has pleased travel businesses. Passengers returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine on their return if they are fully vaccinated. Jacqueline Dobson, the president of Barrhead Travel said that it was encouraging with a few weeks left of the school holidays. And she expected booking demand would be high over the coming weeks. âTens of thousands of holidaymakers and those travelling to reunite with loved ones will be relieved. The two key areas of concern from those travelling abroad were of quarantine on return and cost of testing. Breaking down the barriers of one of these issues is a step in the right direction. Jacqueline Dobson, Barrhead Travel Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor The words youâre not hearing from Nicola Sturgeon are âFreedom Dayâ. Instead, this is more like Caution Month, to follow 15 others, as the ratchet is gradually eased. For business, this puts on hold, at least until 9 August, the permission to let office workers return to their desks. That is a big loss for city centres, where footfall has taken a big hit from the loss of commuter custom in cafes, bars, restaurants and shops. It also comes at a cost to public transport operators, who will wantcontinued subsidy to plugthe revenue gap. Much more welcome for businesses is an easing of the distance rules indoors, down for everyone for two metres to one, allowing them to re-arrange their space, and accommodate more people. For hospitiality, it no longer requires advance booking to get a table to eat, so there should be more passing trade. And they like clarity. In contrast with the rules announced for England on Monday, shops, hospitality and public transport can be clear that the law still requires face covering. It is not open to individualsâ or staff interpretation. So legal liability for infection is not a private companyâs concern, and the first minister is saying sheâs willing to take any flak thatâs going. Nicola Sturgeon makes the case that gradual easing stands the best chance of being sustainable, and so long-term, that approach is better for the economy. The week before the 9 August changes, expect further caution for the next stage. Question from Jessica from Ingliston The need for young people in school, college or university to self isolate if they are close contacts of positive cases is being reviewed as part of preparations for the new academic term. The first minister tells MSPs the Scottish government has asked its education advisory group for advice on whether the requirement, which causes significant disruption to young people and their families, can be removed. She adds the group's conclusions will be set out ""well in advance of
the new term"". Nicola Sturgeon also confirms she is still waiting on advice from the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as to whether children over 12 should be vaccinated. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce is disappointed in the modified level zero framework. Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron said that the progress on 19 July would be an ""encouraging milestone"" towards the full re-opening of Scotland's economy. However, she said the modified framework deviated away from what businesses
had been preparing for and that moving the goalposts at this late stage would cause
uncertainty, negatively impacting on business confidence and recovery. She said her view was to that we should continue on the path set out towards the lifting of all
restrictions on the 9th of August as planned The postponing of the phased return of offices will be a bitter blow for employees and employers alike, many of which had been getting ready to welcome employees back into offices from next week. This will also sound alarm bells for those town and city centre businesses, reliant on office worker footfall and custom. Dr Liz Cameron, Scottish Chambers of Commerce Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Easing restrictions is likely to lead to a rise in people testing positive for coronavirus. The argument from the first minister is that this is manageable as vaccines are creating a good ring of protection against serious disease and death. But it creates another problem. More positive cases means more of their contacts having to isolate, all with the potential to seriously disrupt key services like schooling or the NHS. The number of NHS staff either sick or isolating due to Covid has doubled over the last month. As the health service deals with an increase in Covid patients alongside higher than usual levels of non-Covid admissions, this becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Senior medical staff wanted a rethink of the rules around self isolation, most have had two jags, they also wear PPE at work and are regularly tested. They will be pleased to hear the plan is to remove them after 9 August provided people are double vaccinated and test negative. The Federation
of Small Businesses (FSB) Scotland has praised the move to level zero with modifications. Policy chair Andrew McRae said it was good news for smaller businesses bound by the 2m social distancing rule but said the announcement did little for the events industry. He also said that the big key date for business would be 9 August. Small businesses do now have some clarity about the conditions in which theyâll be trading. Itâs less good news for  the events sector, trying salvage something of whatâs left of the summer, that weâre not seeing the complete end of social distancing outside. Removing the requirement to pre-book your slot at a hospitality venue should hopefully generate some extra passing trade. Andrew McRae, FSB Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has provided an update
on Covid restrictions: From Monday 19 July, all parts of Scotland will be at level
zero, however, there will be modifications. These include: hospitality venues being required to
close at midnight; physical distancing in indoor public places and postponing
the instruction to return to the office.  Question from Scott in Glasgow UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said masks would still be ""recommended"" on public transportin England, but people without a face covering would no longer be fined after restrictions are eased on 19 July. But in Scotland the first minister has confirmed face coverings will remain mandatory on public transport when the country moves to level zero on Monday. Nicola Sturgeon also tells MSPs it is ""highly likely "" that the mandatory wearing of face coverings will remain the Scottish government's position when all Covid restrictions are lifted on 9 August. She adds: ""I think wearing a face covering is a something that we are likely to be required to do for some time yet."" Ms Sturgeon says face coverings are a ""small price to pay"" to protect those at the highest clinical risk from the virus. And she tells MSPs she does not want Scotland to become a two-tier society where the most vulnerable have to ""shield by default."" The largest hospital in the Highlands is no longer on ""code black"" status. Raigmore Hospital in Invernesshad reached capacity last weekamid increasing Covid cases. All non-urgent elective surgery was cancelled, as was outpatient activity - with the exception of areas including cancer and urgent procedures. However NHS Highland said the situation was no longer considered to be code black, and thanked staff for their efforts. Read more Willie Rennie, in his last question as Lib Dem leader,  brings up hospital ""code blacks"", closed pharmacies and waste unlifted due to high numbers of key workers self-isolating. He asks if there is a plan for a ""test and release"" system so these people can return to work. He also highlights a lack of services during the pandemic for adults with special needs and their families. On this, the first minister says that physical distancing has prevented many services and the reduction to 1m indoors will enable many services to restart. Allow Twitter content?

On hospitals pausing non-Covid treatment, she says this is kept to the shortest time period possible. On self-isolation, she says that she hopes to move away from the blanket requirement for close contacts to isolate for 10 days. Ms Sturgeon is considering ahead of that if that system can be introduced for key groups including health and social care. She says she is discussing this with trade unions but is mindful when speaking of this, those working in those services may see if as giving less protection to them. A decision will be announced in due course. She also pays tribute to Mr Rennie,who announced his resignation yesterday, for ""a good shift"" of ten years. David Wallace LockhartBBC Scotland political reporter Nicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said âI will always err on the side of going more cautiouslyâ. England is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. 

But Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasise restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option âfor good headlinesâ. A statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.

Despite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned. An obvious point of divergence from England â face coverings.

While laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (theyâll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear theyâll stay here âfor as long as necessaryâ. 

It feels like theyâll be one of the last measures to go. Greens co-leader Lorna Slater asks whether it is too early to
restart large indoor events which are largely staffed by young people - and could they
become super spreader events. The FM says the question is ""perfectly sensible"" and that she will always ""err on going more cautiously"". Ms Sturgeon says the government is trying to ensure over-18s are vaccinated as ""quickly as possible"" - a ""key priority"" - and adds that the government is not taking an upper limit off restrictions on large events. Organisers still need to go through an application process if they wish to host numbers above the limit, she explains. And in reference to the UK government's plans for ""freedom day"", she says to ""declare premature victory against the virus is a
foolâs paradise"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says what the FM has announced is not ""a clear strategy"" to cope with the new phase of the pandemic. He says the new phase requires a new approach, he says Test and Protect has not been maximised and says Scotland's vaccine rollout has slowed. He asks Ms Sturgeon to pandemic-proof our workplaces and schools and again brings up a potential move to a four-week gap between vaccine doses. Ms Sturgeon says that Mr Sarwar has just given some ""glib soundbites"" and ""irresponsibility"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She says no devolved government has gone against the JCVI on vaccines and says the dosage interval given by the JCVI remains eight weeks and if advice changes the government position will change. The FM says they want to make schools and workplaces as safe as possible but to underplay the complexities of that does no one any favours. She says that the government is doing more work around ventilation in schools but that it takes time and the best clinical advice. She says advice for schools will be issued in time for the new term. Ms Sturgeon ends by saying that vaccine rollout is not slowing because of anything the Scottish government is doing. The constraining factors are supply and dosage intervals. Question from Thanasis from Edinburgh From Monday self-isolation will no
longer be required for people arriving from countries on the amber list,
provided they are fully vaccinated through a UK vaccination programme. But the first minister confirms travellers must also take PCR test on the second day after arrival. Ms Sturgeon tells MSPs: ""We will continue to take a precautionary approach to
the inclusion of countries on the amber list. ""And, notwithstanding this change, we continue to
advise against non essential overseas travel at this time."" She also confirms that anyone testing positive for, or experiencing symptoms of, Covid will still be required to isolate for ten days. Lucy WhyteBBC Scotland education correspondent It will be frustrating for many families that there was no decision yet on whether children and teenagers will have to isolate in the coming school year. Tens of thousands of pupils were at home at any one time during last term, the vast majority because they were Covid contacts not Covid cases. In England, young people will not have to isolate when they return to school and the first minister's note that they are working on a plan here, is a nod to what she knows is mounting parent pressure  to do the same. Could we be in a position where children will have to face more severe restrictions than their vaccinated parents when it comes to isolation? That would be a hard sell and go against the government's position to make education a priority as we come out of this pandemic. I expect by the time young people are heading back to school, they will be following the same rules as the rest of society. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Scotland is to move to level zero of Covid restrictions on 19 July, but mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for ""some time"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the planned easing had to be modified due to the spread of the Delta variant. The move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals. However, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the return of workers to offices is to be delayed. Ms Sturgeon said ""sensible precautions"" had to be maintained while the vaccine programme continues. She said she still hoped Scotland could move beyond level zero from 9 August - the point at which the government aimed to scrap most legal restrictions.

Ministers also plan to remove the blanket requirement for close contacts of those who test positive to self-isolate - as long as they have had two doses of vaccine - at that point. Ms Sturgeon said a decision would be made before the new academic term on whether or not school pupils who are the close contacts of positive cases will have to self-isolate. And fully-vaccinated people returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine as of Monday, as long as they take a test after arrival. However, the first minister told MSPs that mandatory precautions like the mandatory wearing of face coverings and guidance on ventilation and hand hygiene would remain in place ""for some time"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""We must stick to a cautious approach. We are easing restrictions next week, but we are not abandoning them. ""And even when we move beyond level zero, we will continue to require some baseline measures such as face coverings."" Ministers say the success of the vaccine programme makes it possible to ease restrictions Scotland has been hit by a record-breaking third wave of Covid-19 cases in recent weeks, with the faster-spreading Delta variant putting pressure on health services. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs - who were recalled for a virtual session despite Holyrood being in recess - that the spike in infections had ""levelled off"", and that the vaccine programme was weakening the link between case number and severe illnesses. She said ""a gradual approach"" to easing restrictions stood the best chance of being sustainable and of minimising loss of life. Nicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said ""I will always err on the side of going more cautiously"". England is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. But Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasis restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option ""for good headlines"". A statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time. Despite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned. An obvious point of divergence from England is face coverings. While laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (they'll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear they'll stay here ""for as long as necessary"". It feels like they'll be one of the last measures to go. The move to level zero means: Up to eight adults from four households can meet indoors at home, and up to 10 can meet in a pub or restaurant - with no need to pre-book a two-hour slot. Up to 15 people from 15 households can meet outdoors, and up to 200 can attend weddings and funerals. Plans have, however, been modified in light of high case numbers: Hospitality venues will be required to close at midnight. Some physical distancing rules are to be maintained outdoors, with different groups of 15 required to stay at least 1m (3ft 3in) apart in public spaces - meaning there may be limits on some outdoor events. A ""gradual"" return to office working was due to be part of the move to level zero, but this has now been put back to 9 August. Ms Sturgeon said the move was ""not a complete and wholesale lifting of all restrictions"", but it said it ""does restore yet more freedom to all of us"". This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says lifting all restrictions right now would put people at risk Business groups broadly welcomed the changes, but some were critical of ministers ""moving the goalposts"" at the last minute by altering their plans. The Scottish Retail Consortium said firms ""will be reassured the sense of progress is being maintained, even if the pace has slowed"". The Federation of Small Businesses Scotland said no longer requiring people to book a slot in a bar or restaurant ""should hopefully generate some extra passing trade"", but said there was ""less good news"" for the events sector with outdoor restrictions to continue. And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the move to level zero was ""another encouraging milestone"", but said the modifications to plans would cause uncertainty - and said postponing the return to offices would be ""a bitter blow for employees and employers alike"". Some restrictions on outdoor gatherings will continue The virtual session of parliament gave opposition politicians the chance to question the first minister about the plans. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said ""we can't continue asking the public to sacrifice so much of their lives"". He said: ""The balance has to tilt further in favour of moving forward - we have to make progress back to normality. The public have done what was expected of them, now it's time for this SNP government to deliver."" Labour's Anas Sarwar said the changes to restrictions were welcome, but said ""inconsistent decision making and communications"" was hitting the response to the pandemic. He said: ""The high rate of cases is a cause for concern and I'm afraid what the first minister has presented today is not a clear strategy to cope with the new phase of the pandemic."" Scottish Green co-leader Lorna Slater said she had ""concerns about reducing restrictions while case numbers are so high"", voicing fears that it could lead to a vaccine-resistant variant emerging. And outgoing Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said changes to self-isolation rules must be made ""urgently"", with ""thousands of key workers"" having to quarantine despite testing negative.

"Government guidance urging nightclubs to make their customers show Covid passports has been branded unfair and unworkable by those running them. Venues have been advised to ask for the NHS Covid pass or a negative test result when they reopen on 19 July. But operators said not making the move mandatory was passing the buck. And the Night Time Industries Association called it ""disingenuous and unclear"", questioning how voluntary it really was. Michael Kill, who runs the association, told the BBC he had received inquiries from members seeking clarification. Mr Kill said that although the policy was not mandatory at present, it could turn out that venues were ""in the hands of local public health directors"" who could force them to comply. The government has also saidit ""reserves the right"" to force venues,externalto require people to show their Covid passport or proof of a negative Covid test in order to be allowed in. Mr Kill said the government seemed to be ""gauging the public narrative"" before deciding how tough to be, adding that this was likely to cause ""some level of chaos"". He accused the government of replacing the old clubland mantra of ""Rave, sleep, repeat"" with ""Leak, listen, then release"". The government declined to comment on Mr Kill's remarks. Nightclubs advised to ask for Covid passes One major nightclub firm, Rekom UK, which owns 42 venues including chains Pryzm, Bar&Beyond, Eden and Fiction, said on Monday it would not be asking for Covid passports. Its chief executive, Peter Marks, told the Press Association news agency his clubs would be reopening ""at full capacity and without any requirement for a negative Covid test"". However, he declined to comment when contacted by the BBC on Tuesday. Other nightclub operators contacted by the BBC expressed frustration at what they saw as the government making them bear all the responsibility. Tristan Moffat, operations director of the Piano Works, which has two London venues and will not be asking to see Covid passports, said: ""It's like we've been given a rope to hang ourselves with. ""If it all goes wrong, we'll be closed down again and the buck will be passed back to the operators."" The Piano Works' two venues have already reopened on a limited basis Mr Moffat said the change of date for the lifting of restrictions, from 21 June to 19 July, had cost his firm Â£250,000 in lost profit and trading losses incurred, compared with the same four-week period in 2019. He added that 90% of their customers were aged 20 to 35, precisely those who had not had the chance to be fully vaccinated. ""In an already nervous environment, this just adds another layer of fear and nervousness,"" he said. ""It's not fair - the government should either mandate something or not mandate it. ""They've been writing cheques of hope that we can't cash. Confidence is slipping away and we're the ones to suffer."" Another proprietor, pub owner Julie Spensley, whose son Stephen also owns a bar and a nightclub in Middlesbrough, said it would take up to 10 times longer to admit revellers if they had to show Covid passports. She said: ""Unless it's mandatory, we will not be introducing it."" Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mrs Spensley, who co-owns the Dickens Inn with her husband Tony, said the advice was ""very unworkable for venues such as late bars and nightclubs"". Her son, Stephen Spensley, owns the TS One bar and Spensley's Emporium nightclub, also in Middlesbrough. ""Nightclubs and late bars have queues outside and that's the way they operate,"" she said. Staff already had to check customers' ID to make sure they were old enough to be let in, so imposing further checks would not be practical, she added. ""We've had it tough for the last 16 months,"" she said. She stressed that she wanted people to stay safe, but questioned the wisdom of tighter restrictions on night-time venues when the government was easing the rules on social distancing and mask-wearing. People in England can do this by requesting an NHS Covid Pass via the NHS website or the NHS app. Once logged in, an NHS Covid Pass can be requested. The system generates a QR code, which lasts for 28 days. An NHS Covid Pass can be obtained two weeks after a second dose of the Covid vaccine, as long as both doses were given in England. A pass can be requested if you've had a negative PCR test or lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, which you have reported on the NHS website. These passes last 48 hours after the test result. Alternatively, a pass can be given following a positive PCR test result within the last six months, and when self-isolating has finished. The pass lasts for 180 days after the test result. People who have had both their jabs can also request an NHS Covid Pass letter by calling 119. This only shows vaccination status and has no expiry date. Click here to read more. Are you a nightclub owner? Are you confused by the guidance?

"This video can not be played A mother in Durban is forced to throw her baby from a building after it was set on fire The death toll in South Africa has risen to 72 as violence continues across the country following the jailing of former President Jacob Zuma. Crowds looting and setting alight shopping centres clashed with police in several cities on Tuesday. The BBC filmed a baby being thrown from a building in Durban that was on fire after ground-floor shops were looted. A day earlier, 10 people were killed in a stampede during looting at a shopping centre in Soweto. The military have been deployed to help police overstretched since the unrest began last week. South African police said in a statement they had identified 12 people suspected of provoking the riots, and that a total of 1,234 people had been arrested. President Cyril Ramaphosa has called it some of the worst violence witnessed in South Africa since the 1990s, before the end of apartheid, with fires started, highways blocked and businesses and warehouses looted in major cities and small towns in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories from the continent WATCH: Why has the violence broken out? Looting and shooting in South Africa 'war zone' From freedom fighter to president to jail Ministers have warned that if looting continues, there is a risk areas could run out of basic food supplies soon - but have ruled out declaring a state of emergency. The child was caught by a crowd of people who rushed to help those trapped in the apartment block in the central business district of Durban, a coastal city in KwaZulu-Natal, on Tuesday afternoon. Those stealing from shops on the ground floor of Smith Street had started the fire which spread, affecting those living upstairs. The BBC's Nomsa Maseko in Durban says that after catching the baby, the passers-by and neighbours rushed to get ladders to help other residents, including children, escape. The mother was reunited with her baby, but was too emotional to talk. The rescue services arrived after about 20 minutes to help douse the fires. More than 200 shopping malls had been looted by Monday afternoon, Bloomberg news agency quoted the chief executive officer of Business Leadership South Africa, Busisiwe Mavuso, as saying. Several shopping centres in Soweto - South Africa's largest township which was once home to Nelson Mandela - have been completely ransacked, with ATMs broken into, restaurants, stores selling alcohol and clothing shops all left in tatters. Soldiers working with the police managed to catch a few rioters; in total almost 800 have been arrested, but law enforcement remains heavily outnumbered, he reports. In KwaZulu-Natal - where livestock has also been stolen - the unrest continues with ambulances coming under attack by rioters in some areas,South Africa's TimesLive news site reports,external. Video footage shows that a blood bank was looted in Durban as Mr Ramaphosa addressed the nation on Monday night. By Farouk Chothia, BBC News The catalyst was the arrest last week of Zuma, with his supporters blockading major roads - the economic arteries of the nation - as they demanded the release of their political hero. Low income levels and unemployment - standing at a record high of 32.6% among the workforce and even higher at 46.3% among young people - are seen as the ticking bombs that have exploded. Many South Africans have been shaken by the riots that have swept through Zuma's political heartland of KwaZulu-Natal and the economic hub of Gauteng. And many feel that his successor as president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has failed to provide decisive leadership - either to calm anger over Zuma's imprisonment or to reassure South Africans that they will be safe. Mr Ramaphosa was accused of belatedly deploying troops - and only 2,500 of them compared with the 8,000 he deployed to enforce a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 last year (and authorising the use of more than 70,000 members of the defence forces if need be). But there is no agreement over the deployment - the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) opposition party has opposed it, saying the solution lies in ""political intervention and engagement with our people"". Many residents in affected areas have remained at home, and some have formed what local media call ""defence squads"" to protect their neighbourhoods and businesses as looting and burning continues. There is no doubt that the unrest is the biggest security challenge that Mr Ramaphosa has faced since he became president in 2018 after ousting Zuma. It is bound to worsen the economic crisis, already hit by the pandemic, given the scale of destruction. He was convicted of contempt of court last month after failing to attend an inquiry into corruption during his presidency. The 79-year-old, who denies corruption, was given a 15-month prison sentence. He handed himself in to police last Wednesday. He is hoping to get the sentence rescinded or reduced by the country's constitutional court. However, legal experts say his chances of success are slim. People are being investigated for inciting the violence Police Minister Bheki Cele has warned that ""no amount of unhappiness or personal circumstances from our people gives the right to anyone to loot, vandalise and do as they please and break the law"". There has been some concern over fake news online fuelling the unrest, while the governing African National Congress (ANC)had already revealed it was looking into tweets sent by Zuma's daughter, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla,external. State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo said officials were ""busy sorting fact from fiction"" after receiving information that former security agents linked to Zuma had instigated the violence.

"Scotland is to move to level zero of Covid restrictions on 19 July, but mandatory use of face coverings is to remain in place for ""some time"". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the planned easing had to be modified due to the spread of the Delta variant. The move to level zero means more people will be allowed to meet indoors and attend weddings and funerals. However, limits on outdoor meetings are to be maintained, and the return of workers to offices is to be delayed. Ms Sturgeon said ""sensible precautions"" had to be maintained while the vaccine programme continues.

"Gareth Southgate says each of his players is proud to represent England - based on how loudly they sing the national anthem, it seems he's got a point ""We have been a beacon of light to bring people together and the national team stands for everybody."" As England football manager Gareth Southgate suggests, his Euro 2020 team sparked a sense of national pride and unity that runs deeper than the temporary heartbreak caused by Sunday's failed penalty shootout. Butthe racist abuse that followedhas been depressing - particularly those who had fallen in love with the team for the first time. ""I never thought I'd be cheering on England, not ever. But here I am,"" Binta Williams tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. The 22-year-old student from Manchester normally wouldn't care about English football - but says she felt ""so proud"" of the Euros squad that she's become ""somewhat patriotic"". ""The team come from so many backgrounds and a lot are people of colour, like Raheem Sterling. I'm Jamaican, he's Jamaican,"" she says. ""Watching him smash it for England, the feeling's just like - wow."" Binta Williams says she's never cared about the England football team before More than half of the 26 players in the Euro 2020 squad have at least one parent or grandparent born outside the UK, according to the Migration Museum. That includes Bukayo Saka, whose parents are Nigerian, Jadon Sancho, whose mum and dad are from Trinidad and Tobago - and Marcus Rashford, whose grandma lived on the Caribbean island of St Kitts. All three players received racist abuse on social media after not scoring their penalties in the shootout on Sunday. ""It's just embarrassing as a country that fans behave in that way,"" Binta says. She feels it's driven a wedge in the national unity Southgate spoke of. ""You think we're making progress as a country all coming together - and then we lose and it's back to square one,"" she says. 'They brought us joy' - optimism amid defeat for England Mings criticises Patel over racism response How does England get over more penalty pain? Binta says in the past she's not wanted to wave the England flag, because of its negative connotations. The flag, which bears the cross of England's patron saint, St George, was adopted by far-right groups in the 1970s. It's since been associated with racial tension and white nationalism. Some 28% of white 18-24s and 25% of ethnic minority 18-24s say they see the flag as a negative symbol of nationalism, even during sporting tournaments,a 2021 survey by research group British Future found,external. These percentages are much lower among older people. But Binta says the current England squad have helped change how she feels. ""For the first time, I'm proud of this country,"" she says. Cameron Cole, 27, says the ""disgusting"" abuse of Saka, Sancho and Rashford shows there is ""still a very long way to go"" to tackle racism in football. Cameron Cole says feeling represented on the pitch is ""one of the most important things"" But having faced racist abuse himself, Cameron says the aftermath of Sunday's game means the team represents him ""now more than ever"". ""I've had experiences before where I've had to speak out about it and seeing these stars do the same thing, it qualifies me more to do it in any circumstance, in employment or anywhere else,"" he tells Newsbeat. The Arsenal fan, from south London, says the fact many of Southgate's players are from similar neighbourhoods and ethnic minorities as him makes him feel ""a lot more comfortable"" cheering on nation than he used to do. Gareth Southgate says players such as Bukayo Saka faced ""unforgivable"" racist abuse following the final Only four players in the starting line-up of Sunday's final against Italy have parents and grandparents who were all born in the UK Racism in football - and society, is nothing new. But it's a particularly sad end to the tournament given how vocal the team have been in their fight for equality - as shown by their joint decision to take the knee at the beginning of every game. Despite some critics, the team never wavered in their gesture, which has had Southgate's full support. In a public letter to the nationpublished by the Players' Tribune,externalin June, Southgate said his players have a ""duty"" to speak up on issues such as equality, inclusivity and racial injustice ""while using the power of their voices to help put debates on the table, raise awareness and educate"". Why some fans say they boo England for taking the knee Raheem Sterling: 'He was always the best on the pitch' 'You're not England fans' captain Kane tells racists Hundreds of messages left on Rashford mural Southgate added that the pride each of his players have in representing their country ""cannot be questioned"". But as suggested by Binta, national pride doesn't always come easily in England. Some 61% of people who describe themselves as white are proud to declare their English identity, but among ethnic minorities it is just 32%,according to a BBC survey from 2018. Khomal Aruje, 24, says part of the problem is that ethnic minorities are under-represented by national sports. ""I never saw anyone that looked like me playing football growing up - and that cements itself inside you,"" she tells Newsbeat.

"Nicola Sturgeon confirms that restrictions will be eased, but face masks will be required ""for some time to come"" The first minister tells a virtual sitting of the Scottish Parliament that caution is still needed with rules easing at a ""responsible pace, not an irresponsible pace"" She confirms that from 19 July wedding and funeral limits move from 100 to 200 people and it will not longer be necessary to book two-hour slots in hospitality In England all legal restrictions, including those associated with face coverings, will be removed from next Monday. However, masks would still be ""expected and recommended"" in crowded indoor areas Ms Sturgeon says she hopes that it will still be possible for most legal restrictions to end on 9 August in Scotland From that date ""blanket"" self-isolation requirements will no longer apply to those who have been double vaccinated and whose tests come back negative Scotland's Conservative and Labour leaders voice criticism of the Scottish government's vaccine rollout programme and test and protect system BBC Scotland News Headlines from Nicola Sturgeon's announcement to the Scottish Parliament The GMB union has issued a warning over the possibility of changes to self-isolation rules, saying ""don't go there"". Senior Organiser for Public Services Drew Duffy says unions were told on Tuesday morning that exemptions were being considered because of understaffing crises in the NHS and social care sector. But he says those problems were ""well understood"" by ministers and employers pre-Covid and
they ""didnât act"". He adds that the move would only anger and concern
staff who were ""already absolutely exhausted and undercut"", while confirming their safety was not a priority for the government. This should act as a final warning about the need for urgent and transformative investment in health and social care, so we can attract and retain the people and skills we so obviously need. That means delivering proper value for workers in their pay and conditions. Drew Duffy, GMB union Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Business will be disappointed that the continued requirement for self isolation for those in proximity to people testing positive for Covid. That is taking a toll on firms currently seeing large numbers of workers required to stay at home, meaning some are having to close temporarily.


That wonât be eased until the next phase rules, scheduled for 9 August. And even then, those without double jags will still have to isolate. They are more likely to be young, and much of hospitality depends on young workers.


They will have to close up at midnight, contrary to expectations of a move to flexible, local licensing rules. This is not just for Cinderella and vampires, but because those still carousing after 12 are less likely to be observing distancing rules. Outdoor gatherings also remain constrained, with a maximum of 15 people. With that limit, little of this summerâs events industry looks salvageable, though itâs over to economy secretary Kate Forbes to negotiate application of the rules for events that are already planned. A mixed response comes from the Scottish Tourism Alliance, who are relieved to move forward, but say it is 'not the level zero' they envisaged. CEO Marc Crothall says the changes will be the closest to normal the industry has experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. He said there was good news for the wedding and events
sector with the removal on outdoor distancing requirements for groups of 15 to
allow guests to mingle, but said he was disappointed this was not brought forward to Friday to allow more freedoms at weddings
this weekend. But he remains concerned about the effects of self-isolation rules.  There are huge concerns across the industry in relation to the self-isolation policy and the impact this is having on businesses to staff.  We are reassured by the Scottish governmentâs commitment to removing the need for people to self-isolate if they are double vaccinated. Marc Crothall, Scottish Tourism Alliance A leading figure in the retail industry says the government's announcement on restrictions will likely ""further push back recovery"" for city centres and high streets. Ewan
MacDonald-Russell, the Scottish Retail Consortium's head of policy, points out that face coverings and physical distancing will still affect staff and customers. He says: ""Whilst
government views rising case numbers as justification for a deceleration on the
path back to normality, that doesnât mean the pressures on businesses arenât
also real. ""The Scottish government needs to be prepared to consider how best to
support struggling retailers if the return back to normal trading continues to
take longer than anticipated."" The announcement that Scotland will move in tandem with England's travel quarantine rules has pleased travel businesses. Passengers returning from amber list countries will not need to quarantine on their return if they are fully vaccinated. Jacqueline Dobson, the president of Barrhead Travel said that it was encouraging with a few weeks left of the school holidays. And she expected booking demand would be high over the coming weeks. âTens of thousands of holidaymakers and those travelling to reunite with loved ones will be relieved. The two key areas of concern from those travelling abroad were of quarantine on return and cost of testing. Breaking down the barriers of one of these issues is a step in the right direction. Jacqueline Dobson, Barrhead Travel Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor The words youâre not hearing from Nicola Sturgeon are âFreedom Dayâ. Instead, this is more like Caution Month, to follow 15 others, as the ratchet is gradually eased. For business, this puts on hold, at least until 9 August, the permission to let office workers return to their desks. That is a big loss for city centres, where footfall has taken a big hit from the loss of commuter custom in cafes, bars, restaurants and shops. It also comes at a cost to public transport operators, who will wantcontinued subsidy to plugthe revenue gap. Much more welcome for businesses is an easing of the distance rules indoors, down for everyone for two metres to one, allowing them to re-arrange their space, and accommodate more people. For hospitiality, it no longer requires advance booking to get a table to eat, so there should be more passing trade. And they like clarity. In contrast with the rules announced for England on Monday, shops, hospitality and public transport can be clear that the law still requires face covering. It is not open to individualsâ or staff interpretation. So legal liability for infection is not a private companyâs concern, and the first minister is saying sheâs willing to take any flak thatâs going. Nicola Sturgeon makes the case that gradual easing stands the best chance of being sustainable, and so long-term, that approach is better for the economy. The week before the 9 August changes, expect further caution for the next stage. Question from Jessica from Ingliston The need for young people in school, college or university to self isolate if they are close contacts of positive cases is being reviewed as part of preparations for the new academic term. The first minister tells MSPs the Scottish government has asked its education advisory group for advice on whether the requirement, which causes significant disruption to young people and their families, can be removed. She adds the group's conclusions will be set out ""well in advance of
the new term"". Nicola Sturgeon also confirms she is still waiting on advice from the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation as to whether children over 12 should be vaccinated. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce is disappointed in the modified level zero framework. Chief executive Dr Liz Cameron said that the progress on 19 July would be an ""encouraging milestone"" towards the full re-opening of Scotland's economy. However, she said the modified framework deviated away from what businesses
had been preparing for and that moving the goalposts at this late stage would cause
uncertainty, negatively impacting on business confidence and recovery. She said her view was to that we should continue on the path set out towards the lifting of all
restrictions on the 9th of August as planned The postponing of the phased return of offices will be a bitter blow for employees and employers alike, many of which had been getting ready to welcome employees back into offices from next week. This will also sound alarm bells for those town and city centre businesses, reliant on office worker footfall and custom. Dr Liz Cameron, Scottish Chambers of Commerce Lisa SummersBBC Scotland Health Correspondent Easing restrictions is likely to lead to a rise in people testing positive for coronavirus. The argument from the first minister is that this is manageable as vaccines are creating a good ring of protection against serious disease and death. But it creates another problem. More positive cases means more of their contacts having to isolate, all with the potential to seriously disrupt key services like schooling or the NHS. The number of NHS staff either sick or isolating due to Covid has doubled over the last month. As the health service deals with an increase in Covid patients alongside higher than usual levels of non-Covid admissions, this becomes increasingly difficult to manage. Senior medical staff wanted a rethink of the rules around self isolation, most have had two jags, they also wear PPE at work and are regularly tested. They will be pleased to hear the plan is to remove them after 9 August provided people are double vaccinated and test negative. The Federation
of Small Businesses (FSB) Scotland has praised the move to level zero with modifications. Policy chair Andrew McRae said it was good news for smaller businesses bound by the 2m social distancing rule but said the announcement did little for the events industry. He also said that the big key date for business would be 9 August. Small businesses do now have some clarity about the conditions in which theyâll be trading. Itâs less good news for  the events sector, trying salvage something of whatâs left of the summer, that weâre not seeing the complete end of social distancing outside. Removing the requirement to pre-book your slot at a hospitality venue should hopefully generate some extra passing trade. Andrew McRae, FSB Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has provided an update
on Covid restrictions: From Monday 19 July, all parts of Scotland will be at level
zero, however, there will be modifications. These include: hospitality venues being required to
close at midnight; physical distancing in indoor public places and postponing
the instruction to return to the office.  Question from Scott in Glasgow UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid said masks would still be ""recommended"" on public transportin England, but people without a face covering would no longer be fined after restrictions are eased on 19 July. But in Scotland the first minister has confirmed face coverings will remain mandatory on public transport when the country moves to level zero on Monday. Nicola Sturgeon also tells MSPs it is ""highly likely "" that the mandatory wearing of face coverings will remain the Scottish government's position when all Covid restrictions are lifted on 9 August. She adds: ""I think wearing a face covering is a something that we are likely to be required to do for some time yet."" Ms Sturgeon says face coverings are a ""small price to pay"" to protect those at the highest clinical risk from the virus. And she tells MSPs she does not want Scotland to become a two-tier society where the most vulnerable have to ""shield by default."" The largest hospital in the Highlands is no longer on ""code black"" status. Raigmore Hospital in Invernesshad reached capacity last weekamid increasing Covid cases. All non-urgent elective surgery was cancelled, as was outpatient activity - with the exception of areas including cancer and urgent procedures. However NHS Highland said the situation was no longer considered to be code black, and thanked staff for their efforts. Read more Willie Rennie, in his last question as Lib Dem leader,  brings up hospital ""code blacks"", closed pharmacies and waste unlifted due to high numbers of key workers self-isolating. He asks if there is a plan for a ""test and release"" system so these people can return to work. He also highlights a lack of services during the pandemic for adults with special needs and their families. On this, the first minister says that physical distancing has prevented many services and the reduction to 1m indoors will enable many services to restart. Allow Twitter content?

On hospitals pausing non-Covid treatment, she says this is kept to the shortest time period possible. On self-isolation, she says that she hopes to move away from the blanket requirement for close contacts to isolate for 10 days. Ms Sturgeon is considering ahead of that if that system can be introduced for key groups including health and social care. She says she is discussing this with trade unions but is mindful when speaking of this, those working in those services may see if as giving less protection to them. A decision will be announced in due course. She also pays tribute to Mr Rennie,who announced his resignation yesterday, for ""a good shift"" of ten years. David Wallace LockhartBBC Scotland political reporter Nicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said âI will always err on the side of going more cautiouslyâ. England is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. 

But Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasise restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option âfor good headlinesâ. A statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.

Despite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned. An obvious point of divergence from England â face coverings.

While laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (theyâll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear theyâll stay here âfor as long as necessaryâ. 

It feels like theyâll be one of the last measures to go. Greens co-leader Lorna Slater asks whether it is too early to
restart large indoor events which are largely staffed by young people - and could they
become super spreader events. The FM says the question is ""perfectly sensible"" and that she will always ""err on going more cautiously"". Ms Sturgeon says the government is trying to ensure over-18s are vaccinated as ""quickly as possible"" - a ""key priority"" - and adds that the government is not taking an upper limit off restrictions on large events. Organisers still need to go through an application process if they wish to host numbers above the limit, she explains. And in reference to the UK government's plans for ""freedom day"", she says to ""declare premature victory against the virus is a
foolâs paradise"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says what the FM has announced is not ""a clear strategy"" to cope with the new phase of the pandemic. He says the new phase requires a new approach, he says Test and Protect has not been maximised and says Scotland's vaccine rollout has slowed. He asks Ms Sturgeon to pandemic-proof our workplaces and schools and again brings up a potential move to a four-week gap between vaccine doses. Ms Sturgeon says that Mr Sarwar has just given some ""glib soundbites"" and ""irresponsibility"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She says no devolved government has gone against the JCVI on vaccines and says the dosage interval given by the JCVI remains eight weeks and if advice changes the government position will change. The FM says they want to make schools and workplaces as safe as possible but to underplay the complexities of that does no one any favours. She says that the government is doing more work around ventilation in schools but that it takes time and the best clinical advice. She says advice for schools will be issued in time for the new term. Ms Sturgeon ends by saying that vaccine rollout is not slowing because of anything the Scottish government is doing. The constraining factors are supply and dosage intervals. Question from Thanasis from Edinburgh From Monday self-isolation will no
longer be required for people arriving from countries on the amber list,
provided they are fully vaccinated through a UK vaccination programme. But the first minister confirms travellers must also take PCR test on the second day after arrival. Ms Sturgeon tells MSPs: ""We will continue to take a precautionary approach to
the inclusion of countries on the amber list. ""And, notwithstanding this change, we continue to
advise against non essential overseas travel at this time."" She also confirms that anyone testing positive for, or experiencing symptoms of, Covid will still be required to isolate for ten days. Lucy WhyteBBC Scotland education correspondent It will be frustrating for many families that there was no decision yet on whether children and teenagers will have to isolate in the coming school year. Tens of thousands of pupils were at home at any one time during last term, the vast majority because they were Covid contacts not Covid cases. In England, young people will not have to isolate when they return to school and the first minister's note that they are working on a plan here, is a nod to what she knows is mounting parent pressure  to do the same. Could we be in a position where children will have to face more severe restrictions than their vaccinated parents when it comes to isolation? That would be a hard sell and go against the government's position to make education a priority as we come out of this pandemic. I expect by the time young people are heading back to school, they will be following the same rules as the rest of society. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Google has been hit with a â¬500m (Â£427m) fine by France's competition authority for failing to negotiate ""in good faith"" with news organisations over the use of their content. The authority accused Google of not taking an order to do so seriously. Google told the BBC the decision ""ignores our efforts to reach an agreement"". The fine is the latest skirmish in a global copyright battle between tech firms and news organisations. Last year, the French competition authority ordered that Google must negotiate deals with news organisations to show extracts of articles in search results, news and other services. Google was fined because, in the authority's view, it failed to do this. In 2019, France became the first EU country to put a new Digital Copyright Directive into law. The law governed so-called ""neighbouring rights"" which are designed to compensate publishers and news agencies for the use of their material. As a result, Google decided it would not show content from EU publishers in France, on services like search and news, unless publishers agreed to let them do so free of charge. News organisations felt this was an abuse of Google's market power,external, and two organisations representing press publishers and Agence France-Presse (AFP) complained to the competition authority. Google told the BBC: ""We are very disappointed with this decision - we have acted in good faith throughout the entire process."" It said that it is, to date, the only company to have announced agreements on so-called neighbouring rights. It added it was about to finalise an agreement with AFP that includes a global licensing agreement and payments for press publications. The new ruling means that within the next two months Google must come up with proposals explaining how it will recompense companies for the use of their news. Should this fail to happen the company could face additional fines of â¬900,000 per day. ""When the authority decrees an obligation for a company, it must comply scrupulously,"" said the competition authority's Isabelle de Silva in a statement.

She adds: ""I think wearing a face covering is a something that we are likely to be required to do for some time yet."" Ms Sturgeon says face coverings are a ""small price to pay"" to protect those at the highest clinical risk from the virus. And she tells MSPs she does not want Scotland to become a two-tier society where the most vulnerable have to ""shield by default."" The largest hospital in the Highlands is no longer on ""code black"" status. Raigmore Hospital in Invernesshad reached capacity last weekamid increasing Covid cases. All non-urgent elective surgery was cancelled, as was outpatient activity - with the exception of areas including cancer and urgent procedures. However NHS Highland said the situation was no longer considered to be code black, and thanked staff for their efforts. Read more Willie Rennie, in his last question as Lib Dem leader,  brings up hospital ""code blacks"", closed pharmacies and waste unlifted due to high numbers of key workers self-isolating. He asks if there is a plan for a ""test and release"" system so these people can return to work. He also highlights a lack of services during the pandemic for adults with special needs and their families. On this, the first minister says that physical distancing has prevented many services and the reduction to 1m indoors will enable many services to restart. Allow Twitter content?

On hospitals pausing non-Covid treatment, she says this is kept to the shortest time period possible. On self-isolation, she says that she hopes to move away from the blanket requirement for close contacts to isolate for 10 days. Ms Sturgeon is considering ahead of that if that system can be introduced for key groups including health and social care. She says she is discussing this with trade unions but is mindful when speaking of this, those working in those services may see if as giving less protection to them. A decision will be announced in due course. She also pays tribute to Mr Rennie,who announced his resignation yesterday, for ""a good shift"" of ten years. David Wallace LockhartBBC Scotland political reporter Nicola Sturgeon made her strategy clear when she said âI will always err on the side of going more cautiouslyâ. England is returning towards normality at a quicker rate, and UK ministers have conceded this could result in very high case numbers. 

But Nicola Sturgeon wants to emphasise restraint. She mentioned a couple of times that she will not take the easy option âfor good headlinesâ. A statement aimed at Boris Johnson? He of course maintains his changes for England are the right moves at the right time.

Despite the cautious tone, most level zero changes are going ahead in Scotland from next week as planned. An obvious point of divergence from England â face coverings.

While laws around face coverings in England will be repealed shortly (theyâll still be encouraged), Nicola Sturgeon made clear theyâll stay here âfor as long as necessaryâ. 

It feels like theyâll be one of the last measures to go. Greens co-leader Lorna Slater asks whether it is too early to
restart large indoor events which are largely staffed by young people - and could they
become super spreader events. The FM says the question is ""perfectly sensible"" and that she will always ""err on going more cautiously"". Ms Sturgeon says the government is trying to ensure over-18s are vaccinated as ""quickly as possible"" - a ""key priority"" - and adds that the government is not taking an upper limit off restrictions on large events. Organisers still need to go through an application process if they wish to host numbers above the limit, she explains. And in reference to the UK government's plans for ""freedom day"", she says to ""declare premature victory against the virus is a
foolâs paradise"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar says what the FM has announced is not ""a clear strategy"" to cope with the new phase of the pandemic. He says the new phase requires a new approach, he says Test and Protect has not been maximised and says Scotland's vaccine rollout has slowed. He asks Ms Sturgeon to pandemic-proof our workplaces and schools and again brings up a potential move to a four-week gap between vaccine doses. Ms Sturgeon says that Mr Sarwar has just given some ""glib soundbites"" and ""irresponsibility"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She says no devolved government has gone against the JCVI on vaccines and says the dosage interval given by the JCVI remains eight weeks and if advice changes the government position will change. The FM says they want to make schools and workplaces as safe as possible but to underplay the complexities of that does no one any favours. She says that the government is doing more work around ventilation in schools but that it takes time and the best clinical advice. She says advice for schools will be issued in time for the new term. Ms Sturgeon ends by saying that vaccine rollout is not slowing because of anything the Scottish government is doing. The constraining factors are supply and dosage intervals. Question from Thanasis from Edinburgh From Monday self-isolation will no
longer be required for people arriving from countries on the amber list,
provided they are fully vaccinated through a UK vaccination programme. But the first minister confirms travellers must also take PCR test on the second day after arrival. Ms Sturgeon tells MSPs: ""We will continue to take a precautionary approach to
the inclusion of countries on the amber list. ""And, notwithstanding this change, we continue to
advise against non essential overseas travel at this time."" She also confirms that anyone testing positive for, or experiencing symptoms of, Covid will still be required to isolate for ten days. Lucy WhyteBBC Scotland education correspondent It will be frustrating for many families that there was no decision yet on whether children and teenagers will have to isolate in the coming school year. Tens of thousands of pupils were at home at any one time during last term, the vast majority because they were Covid contacts not Covid cases. In England, young people will not have to isolate when they return to school and the first minister's note that they are working on a plan here, is a nod to what she knows is mounting parent pressure  to do the same. Could we be in a position where children will have to face more severe restrictions than their vaccinated parents when it comes to isolation? That would be a hard sell and go against the government's position to make education a priority as we come out of this pandemic. I expect by the time young people are heading back to school, they will be following the same rules as the rest of society. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Google has been hit with a â¬500m (Â£427m) fine by France's competition authority for failing to negotiate ""in good faith"" with news organisations over the use of their content. The authority accused Google of not taking an order to do so seriously. Google told the BBC the decision ""ignores our efforts to reach an agreement"". The fine is the latest skirmish in a global copyright battle between tech firms and news organisations. Last year, the French competition authority ordered that Google must negotiate deals with news organisations to show extracts of articles in search results, news and other services. Google was fined because, in the authority's view, it failed to do this. In 2019, France became the first EU country to put a new Digital Copyright Directive into law. The law governed so-called ""neighbouring rights"" which are designed to compensate publishers and news agencies for the use of their material. As a result, Google decided it would not show content from EU publishers in France, on services like search and news, unless publishers agreed to let them do so free of charge. News organisations felt this was an abuse of Google's market power,external, and two organisations representing press publishers and Agence France-Presse (AFP) complained to the competition authority. Google told the BBC: ""We are very disappointed with this decision - we have acted in good faith throughout the entire process."" It said that it is, to date, the only company to have announced agreements on so-called neighbouring rights. It added it was about to finalise an agreement with AFP that includes a global licensing agreement and payments for press publications. The new ruling means that within the next two months Google must come up with proposals explaining how it will recompense companies for the use of their news. Should this fail to happen the company could face additional fines of â¬900,000 per day. ""When the authority decrees an obligation for a company, it must comply scrupulously,"" said the competition authority's Isabelle de Silva in a statement. ""Here, this was unfortunately not the case,"" she wrote. Australia vs tech firms: Whatâs this row about?

"The government has said bus and train companies must decide whether passengers have to wear face coverings on their services from Monday, when Covid rules are relaxed in England. Face masks have been mandatory on public transport for the past year to reduce the spread of the virus. But those rules will be replaced with government guidance advising passengers to wear masks only on busy services. Transport firms will be left to decide whether to enforce that advice and how. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said masks would still be ""recommended"" on public transport, but people without a face covering would no longer be fined after restrictions are eased on 19 July. Nevertheless, bus and train companies will still be able to turn away passengers who refuse to wear one - unless they are exempt. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said some of the 3.8m people classed as clinically vulnerable would be ""fearful"" to go on public transport if masks were not compulsory. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had not yet taken the decision whether to require masks on trams in Manchester as he wanted to avoid adding to people's confusion. Treasury Minister Stephen Barclay told BBC Breakfast the emphasis was now on ""trusting the British public"" to take a cautious approach and there would be specific guidance for vulnerable people. What changes will I see when restrictions end on 19 July? How are the rules on masks changing on 19 July? Why is social distancing coming to an end? London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the safest option would be to continue to legally require people to wear masks on public transport. His comments came asLabour criticised the government's approach to unlockingin England as ""high risk"" and ""fatalistic"". While virtually all legal restrictions in England will be lifted on Monday, some guidance will remain. There will no longer be any limits on how many people can meet and the 1m-plus distancing rule will be removed. Nightclubs will also be allowed to reopen for the first time since March 2020 and capacity limits will be removed for all venues and events. But nightclubs and other venues with large crowds will be encouraged to use Covid status certification - so-called domestic vaccine passports - ""as a matter of social responsibility"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday. Government guidance to work from home where possible will be lifted, but ministers are encouraging a gradual return to the workplace. On face coverings, Mr Johnson said: ""We expect and recommend that people wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you come into contact with those you don't normally meet, such as on public transport."" Asked if Monday's rule changes were irreversible, as has been repeatedly stated, Mr Johnson said he hoped they were but ""we must rule nothing out"". And in the Commons, Mr Javid said the government will ""have a review"" in September ""to make sure that we're properly set up for autumn and for winter"". Transport companies have been weighing up whether to mandate masks or not. If you're flying, chances are you will still need to wear one; many airlines have decided to keep masks as a requirement for travel. But most train, bus and coach operators in England will now decide they won't be mandatory, following the lead set by rail and passenger groups. Companies will still ask passengers to wear masks when services are busy. But there's concern among many transport operators that a blanket requirement could make people think that public transport is more dangerous than other indoor settings, like restaurants and pubs. We haven't yet heard from the London Mayor about whether masks will be required on Transport for London-run services. Wales and Scotland both still require anyone travelling on public transport to wear a mask by law, meaning that those taking services that cross the border from England will have notices reminding them to wear a face covering unless exempt. It is the second time this has happened during the course of the pandemic. The Confederation of Passenger Transport - a trade group representing bus and coach companies - said passengers will find it ""difficult to understand"" why the prime minister has ""singled out public transport as somewhere to wear a face covering when a range of other activities share its characteristics."" The group said it wanted clear guidance for operators and customers, adding that it was important to respect everyone's right to choose whether to wear a face covering once restrictions had eased. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said its members would ask passengers to wear face coverings in busy indoor settings ""out of respect for others"". It said enhanced cleaning would continue after 19 July and train companies would provide better information about how busy services are. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed masks would continue to be required on public transport and in healthcare settings ""even if"" the nation relaxes restrictions, which aredue to be reviewed,externalon 15 July. Rules regarding face coverings are due to be considered next month inNorthern Ireland, which is due to ease some Covid measures on 26 July. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is due to make an announcement about restrictions on Tuesday.Scotland is expected,externalto move to level 0 - the lowest level of restrictions in its roadmap - on 19 July and lift most legal restrictions on 9 August. The prime minister said it was vital to proceed with ""caution"" in England after 19 July, warning ""this pandemic is not over"" . Covid: 'For us it's not freedom day' Some firms to insist people still wear face masks Doctors call for face masks to stay in healthcare 'Personal responsibility needed to live with Covid' The peak of the current wave is not expected before mid-August and could lead to between 1,000 and 2,000 hospital admissions per day, according to government scientists. Central estimates from modellers advising the government also show that Covid deaths are expected to be between 100 and 200 per day at the peak, although there is a large amount of uncertainty. On Monday, the UK recorded 34,471 new cases, as well as six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It was the sixth consecutive day that cases were above 30,000. The number of deaths recorded on Mondays are often lower due to reporting lags over the weekend. More than 45.9 million people - or 87% of adults in the UK - have now had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. And more than 34.8 million - around two-thirds of adults - have had both doses.

"The UK gives much of its humanitarian aid to Yemen, with projects similar to this one run by a Kuwaiti charity Boris Johnson has defended the government's decision to cut foreign aid, saying this is needed during the ""economic hurricane"" caused by Covid. MPs are voting on whether to reverse the reduction on development spending from 0.7% to 0.5% of national income, brought in earlier this year. Opening a Commons debate, the prime minister said this was a temporary cut made to help reduce public borrowing. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""indefinite"". The government has faced cross-party criticism over the reduction, which amounts to almost Â£4bn. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Syrian children who know war planes but not shops Gates and others to partially cover UK aid cuts Charities criticise UK's aid cuts ahead of G7 Many Conservative MPs have spoken out against the move,announced last Novemberdespite a commitment to spending 0.7% in the party's 2019 election manifesto. Meeting the 0.7% figure was made law in 2015, and it is an internationally recognised target, and charities such as Oxfam and ActionAid have warned thatprojects are being called offas a result of the cuts. If MPs defeat the government in the vote, spending will revert to 0.7% of national income by January next year. If the government wins, it will happen only when national debt is falling and borrowing is no longer used for day-to-day spending. Last month, 30 Conservative MPs supported an amendment to a parliamentary bill, aimed at forcing the government to meet the 0.7% target. If they oppose the cut again later, another 14 or so Tories would have to join them to ensure a government defeat. Mr Johnson told MPs ministers had spent Â£407bn during the pandemic to ""shelter our people from an economic hurricane never before experienced in living memory"". He added: ""There must inevitably be consequences."" The prime minister said that this year national debt was expected to reach 100% of economic output, ""the highest for nearly six decades"". He added that the reduction was temporary and the UK could ""take pride that the UK will still contribute at least Â£10bn of our GDP"" to aid. ""This is not an argument about principle,"" Mr Johnson said. ""The only question is when we return to 0.7% and my purpose today is to describe how we propose to achieve this shared goal in an affordable way."" Governments only call votes if they think they can win. Ministers will hope the concession of a vote, the offer of clarity about when aid might increase and the lack of time their opponents have had to organise will give them an edge and soften the Tory rebellion. When it comes to whipping, the Treasury also has deep pockets and who knows what goodies might be on offer to dissident rebel MPs in the upcoming Spending Review? If the government wins, there will be consequences. The current status quo is that Downing Street is under political pressure to return aid spending to 0.7% of national income next year. But if the Treasury wins today, that will not happen. Aid spending will be locked in for years. How long will depend not just on the economy, but on Treasury's tax and spend decisions and its interpretation of some rather loose tests. Both sides in this debate accept UK aid cuts have a material impact. It is just a question of priorities - responsible belt-tightening at home or generosity abroad. But if the UK cuts aid by Â£4bn every year, then millions overseas will suffer. But Sir Keir, who confirmed Labour would vote against the government, said the cut was ""not in the national interest"", adding: ""Every member here was elected on a manifesto promise to retain the 0.7% target."" ""Every living prime minister thinks this is wrong,"" he added. ""There is only one prime minister who is prepared to do this and he is sitting there."" He later added: ""Cutting aid will increase costs and have a big impact on our economy. Development aid reduces conflict. It reduces disease and people fleeing from their homes. ""It is a false economy to pretend that this is some sort of cut that doesn't have consequences."" Former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May, one of the Conservative MPs who have been highly critical of the cut, said she would also vote against the government, but ""with regret"". ""We made a promise to the poorest people in the world,"" she added. ""The government has broken that promise."" And former Brexit Secretary David Davis called the cut to aid spending ""morally reprehensible"". On Saturday, a group of philanthropists, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,said they would provide Â£93.5m emergency fundingto cover some of the UK's reduction.

Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka missed their spot-kicks as Italy won 3-2 in a shootout after a 1-1 draw. All three players were targeted on social media after the game. ""I felt as if I'd let everyone down,""Rashford wrote in a statement.,external The 23-year-old Manchester United attacker added: ""I can take critique of my performance all day long, my penalty was not good enough, it should have gone in but I will never apologise for who I am and where I came from.

On Monday, England boss Gareth Southgate said the racist abuse was ""unforgivable"", and Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Football Association also condemned it. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the abuse and said ""it will not be tolerated"", while the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) has also launched an investigation. Messages of support were posted on a Marcus Rashford mural in his hometown after it was initially defaced Marcus Rashford's statement in full: ""I don't even know where to start and I don't even know how to put into words how I am feeling at this exact time. ""I've had a difficult season, I think that's been clear for everyone to see and I probably went into that final with a lack of confidence. I've always backed myself for a penalty, but something didn't feel quite right. ""During the long run-up I was saving myself a bit of time and unfortunately the result was not what I wanted. I felt as though I had let my team-mates down. I felt as if I'd let everyone down. A penalty was all I'd been asked to contribute for the team. I can score penalties in my sleep, so why not that one?

The PFA said that, while a number of these tweets were delete, the accounts have not been permanently suspended by Twitter. ""Our preliminary analysis suggests the volume of abuse flagged around the Euro 2020 final, aimed mainly at Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling, was higher than the rest of the tournament combined,"" the PFA added. Twitter said it had removed more than 1,000 posts over the past 24 hours and suspended a number of accounts for violating its rules. Facebook said it had recently announced tougher measures on its Instagram platform, including permanently deleting accounts that repeatedly send abusive direct messages. England captain Harry Kane has told those behind the racist abuse of Rashford, Sancho and Saka: ""You're not an England fan and we don't want you."" The Tottenham striker addedon Twitter:,external""They deserve support and backing, not the vile racist abuse they've had since last night.

"Vehicles were submerged by floodwater in Raynes Park Parts of London received a month's worth of rain in one day, causing flash floods. On Monday 47.8mm of rain fell in a 24-hour period in Kew, most of it in just one hour. The average monthly rainfall in July is 44.5mm. Residents were evacuated from their homes and train services cancelled, while cars were submerged in water. London Fire Brigade said it had taken more than 1,000 calls related to flooding. A spokesperson for the service said: ""We're asking people not to walk through or drive through the floodwater. Floodwater can be contaminated and vehicles can become unstable."" Thames Water said it received more than 2,500 calls in five hours on Monday as sewers filled up and flooded. ""While our pipes are designed to cope with most storms, yesterday's rainfall was so severe the system filled up very quickly,"" a spokesperson said. This video can not be played Flash floods leave cars submerged as roads fill with rain Among those to suffer was Queen guitarist Brian May, who lives in Kensington. The rock star said he was ""angry"" after a number of his ""precious"" belongings were ruined during the flooding. In a post on Instagram, he wrote: ""The whole bottom floor had been inundated with a sewage overflow - which has covered our carpets, rugs and all kinds of precious (to us) things in a stinking sludge. ""It's disgusting, and actually quite heart-breaking,"" the We Will Rock You writer added. ""It feels like we have been invaded, desecrated."" Daisy King, from Holland Park, described how she came home to find more than two feet of water in her flat. Daisy King's home was left under several inches of water She said: ""It was up to my knees and all my stuff was floating about in it. ""The fridge and oven were half-filled with water and books and records were ruined."" The owner of vintage record shop, Audio Gold, in Muswell Hill said ""tens of thousands of pounds-worth"" of his stock has been ruined in the floods. ""The two main things that were damaged were our records and the vintage wooden loud-speakers"", said Ben Shallcross. Blow-dryers are being used to dry the flooded carpets of the vintage record shop The businessman, who has owned the shop for 20 years, explained: ""Much of the shop's stock is stacked on the floor and the water has swelled up around the beautiful old speakers and ruined the veneer."" One resident in Maida Vale said his basement was ""under at least a foot of water, and it was black, so it is sewage water"". Shane, who lives on Shirland Road, said ""everything was wrecked"" by the floods which ""subsided quickly"" when the rain stopped. Allow Instagram content?

"Nearly all remaining Covid restrictions are coming to an end. But with infection rates and hospital admissions already rising sharply, it is a significant gamble. One expert likens what is being done to taking the ""control rods out of a nuclear reactor"". ""This is going to make things worse than they are now and we don't know when it will peak,"" says Loughborough University data analyst Dr Duncan Robertson. And that in many ways goes to the heart of the issue. This is our first ""natural wave"" of Covid - all the others have been brought to an end through lockdown and restrictions. The plan is for this one to exhaust itself. So predicting what will happen is much more difficult. The move has been given the personal backing of chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and a number of the scientists advising him. Infection rates were always going to rise at this stage of the roadmap - more mixing means it is easier for the virus to spread. But with significant levels of immunity from vaccination and natural infection the hope is spread of the virus will be brought under control in the coming weeks. How many people in the UK have been vaccinated so far? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Some have suggested the government should wait longer before taking this step. But infections are already rising so that will not halt the rise. And, according to Prof Whitty, were we to wait any longer, there is a risk the peak of infections this summer wave could be pushed to the autumn, which could make things worse with flu and other viruses circulating. But that does not mean government scientists do not have concerns. Behind the scenes, they have been questioning the policy on face masks, in particular, after ministers made big play of the fact mask-wearing would no longer be legally required. Not because it will dramatically alter the course of rising infections, but because of the message it sent out - that controlling infection no longer mattered. This has led to a definite change of approach with ministers now stressing the need to keep wearing masks in crowded indoor places. How are the rules on masks changing on 19 July? The reason is clear from the results of the latest modelling to be released. It looked at the impact of people returning almost immediately to normal behaviour, and compared it with a gradual resumption over months. The results estimated the gradual approach could halve the summer peak and avoid what is called an overshoot - whereby the surge in cases means greater numbers become infected than need be, before this summer wave peaks. The modelling shows this is much more important in reducing the peak than simply delaying the lifting of restrictions. It is why Prof Whitty has also referred to the importance of the public ""going slowly"" in the way they embrace new freedoms. Prof Matt Keeling, a modeller at the University of Warwick, has gone even further. ""If there is one message - the public is going to control the trajectory we are on,"" he said. But this is just one of many unknowns, which explains the huge range around the central estimate that hospital admissions will peak this summer at 1,000 to 2,000 a day. (The winter wave just gone hit 4,000 in comparison.) And if this does happen, it will come at a significant cost. While the vaccination programme has reduced the number of Covid deaths 10-fold, there could still be 100 to 200 deaths a day. About half of those are expected to be in unvaccinated people. It will also cause major disruption to the NHS. To put those summer figures into context, hospitals would expect to see about 1,000 admissions a day in the depths of winter, for all types of respiratory infections. Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire? ""We would get through it as we have before,"" says Dr Alison Pittard, of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine. ""But it would be at the expense of elective care and other treatments."" Another consequence will be more people struggling with long Covid either because it takes them time to recover after being hospitalised or from persistent symptoms, such as fatigue and brain fog, which for a small minority appear to happen after milder illness. But, in the end, unless restrictions are re-introduced, this wave is only likely to come to an end when the wall of immunity - from vaccination and natural infection - is high enough. And when that happens, England could find itself in the very strong position, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, hinted  last week. He said we were reaching the level of immunity where ""big waves"" may be in the past. This does not mean herd immunity - given how infectious the Delta variant is and the changing nature of the virus, many experts now question whether this will be possible. Covid, they believe, is going to be around forever. Instead, scientists expect some sort of equilibrium will be reached, whereby the R number, the average number of people an infected person passes the virus on to, will fluctuate around one. This will see more manageable waves ebb and flow. And with vaccines offering good protection against serious illness, society will be more willing to tolerate the burden. After all, in the most recent bad winter - 2017-18 -there were 300 to 400 flu deaths a day at the peak,external, more than is being predicted for this summer's Covid peak. Will we get there in the coming months? It is, one of the key government modellers told me, really too close to call.

"Police discovered nearly Â£180m worth of cryptocurrency on 10 July The Met Police has seized a record Â£180m worth of cryptocurrency linked to international money laundering in London. The seizure is the largest of its kind in the UK - beating the previous record set when the Met confiscated Â£114m of cryptocurrency on 24 June. A 39-year-old woman, arrested on suspicion of money laundering on 24 June, has been interviewed over the new seizure. She has since been bailed. The Met's economic crime command made the seizure after following up intelligence received about the transfer of criminal assets. The investigation is continuing. Transactions made using cryptocurrencies can provide more anonymity to senders and recipients of money. The Met did not say which cryptocurrencies they seized. Cryptocurrencies are digital money that is not issued by a bank. You can trade and invest these currencies like any other - and there are virtually no barriers to entry. The absence of regulation means the market can go up incredibly fast. During the lockdown, the total value of all cryptocurrencies increased from about Â£175bn to more than Â£1.75tn. Figures from the UK's financial watchdog show hundreds of thousands of people in the UK hold these digital currencies. But since the start of May, the market reached its highest-ever level and lost more than Â£1tn just a few weeks later. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Graham McNulty said: ""Proceeds of crime are laundered in many different ways. ""While cash still remains king in the criminal world, as digital platforms develop we're increasingly seeing organised criminals using cryptocurrency to launder their dirty money. ""The detectives on this case have worked tirelessly and meticulously to trace millions of pounds worth of cryptocurrency suspected of being linked to criminality and now being laundered to hide the trail. ""Our investigation will stop at nothing to disrupt the transfer and identify those involved."" How do cryptocurrencies work? Video, 00:02:22How do cryptocurrencies work?

All three players missed penalties in the 3-2 shootout loss to Italy in Sunday's Euro 2020 final. They were targeted on social media after the game. ""They deserve support and backing, not the vile racist abuse they've had since last night,"" Kane said. ""Three lads who were brilliant all summer had the courage to step up and take a pen when the stakes were high,"" the Tottenham striker addedon Twitter.,external ""If you abuse anyone on social media you're not an England fan and we don't want you.""

He went on to criticise Home Secretary Priti Patel who last month described players taking the knee against racism as ""gesture politics"". Earlier, manager Gareth Southgate said the racist abuse issued after the defeat was ""unforgivable"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Football Association also condemned it. The Metropolitan Police,externalis investigating the abuse and said ""it will not be tolerated"", while the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) has also launched an investigation. Chief Constable Mark Roberts, the National Police Chiefs' Council Football Policing Lead, said police were working with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter ""and enquiries are already being progressed"". ""It's just not what we stand for,"" saidSouthgate. ""We have been a beacon of light in bringing people together, in people being able to relate to the national team, and the national team stands for everybody and so that togetherness has to continue. ""We have shown the power our country has when it does come together and has that energy and positivity together. ""It's my decision who takes the penalties, it's not a case of players not volunteering or more experienced players backing out."" England and Borussia Dortmund midfielderJude Bellinghamtweeted a picture of the three players wearing crowns and wrote: ""We win together and we lose together. So proud to have team-mates with such top character. As for the racism, hurtful but not surprising. Will never get bored of saying that more needs to be done. Educate and control the platforms."" Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford missed penalties in England's shootout defeat European football's governing bodyUefacondemned the ""disgusting racist abuse"", adding: ""We stand by the players and the FA's call for the strongest possible punishments."" On Monday, League Two sideLeyton Orientsaid they had banned a fan for life in connection with the abuse. ""The supporter in question's actions on Twitter were alerted to the club late last night, and action has been taken swiftly to issue a banning order,"" the club said. Meanwhile, Premier League sideWolvessaid they had passed details to police after being alerted to racist abuse from one of their supporters. And a parish councillor in Shropshire has resigned after racist posts appeared on his personal Facebook page in the wake of England's defeat. Paul Bradbury, a member of Pontesbury Parish Council, said his account had been hacked. West Mercia Police said it had arrested a man in his 60s from Minsterley, Shropshire, on suspicion of inciting racial hatred and he remained in police custody. England had reached their first final in a major tournament since winning the World Cup in 1966 and, despite taking the lead against Italy, drew 1-1 after extra time before a penalty shootout. ""This England team deserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media,""said the prime minister.,external He later started a Downing Street briefing by praising the players, adding: ""They brought joy to this country and to those who have been directing racist abuse I say 'shame on you and I hope you will crawl back under the rock from which you emerged'."" England's players have taken a knee before games at the Euros to highlight the fight against racial inequality. On the day the tournament started on 11 June,the prime minister did not condemn fanswho jeered when England players took the knee during two warm-up games. Instead, Johnson said he wanted to see fans ""getting behind the team to cheer them on"" - and was then accused of not having ""the guts to call it out"" by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.

It added: ""We could not be clearer that anyone behind such disgusting behaviour is not welcome in following the team. ""We will do all we can to support the players affected while urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible. ""We will continue to do everything we can to stamp discrimination out of the game, but we implore government to act quickly and bring in the appropriate legislation so this abuse has real life consequences. This video can not be played Sancho, Jorginho & Saka miss penalties as Italy edge England at Wembley ""Social media companies need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers from their platforms, gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making their platforms free from this type of abhorrent abuse."" In February, thegovernment threatened social media companieswith ""large fines"" if they failed to tackle abuse on their platforms. ""It's unbelievable that we are still talking about it,""FA chief executive Mark Bullinghamtold BBC Sport. ""We've been so clear, these social media companies need to act. They need to stamp it out and they can do that. ""We are reiterating a call for the government to bring in the Online Harms Bill as soon as they can. We don't think it's acceptable in any walk of life for this racist abuse to happen and we want it to stop."" Rashford highlighted racial abuse he received on social media in May after losing the Europa League final with Manchester United. And last year Sancho was amongsport stars protesting against racismfollowing the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Social media companies have been criticised for a perceived lack of action on racist abuse on their platforms, and in April Instagram announced a tool to enable users to automatically filter out abusive messages from those they do not follow. Following numerous instances of online abuse, a number of clubs, players, athletes and sporting bodies took part in afour-day boycott of social mediain April to encourage companies to take a stronger stance against racist and sexist abuse. On the back of the abuse suffered by England's players after the Euro 2020 final,Facebooksaid it had recently announced tougher measures on its Instagram platform, including permanently deleting accounts that repeatedly send abusive direct messages. ""No one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don't want it on Instagram,"" said a Facebook spokesperson. ""We quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England's footballers last night and we'll continue to take action against those that break our rules. ""In addition to our work to remove this content, we encourage all players to turn on Hidden Words, a tool which means no one has to see abuse in their comments or DMs. ""No one thing will fix this challenge overnight, but we're committed to keeping our community safe from abuse."" Twittersaid it had removed more than 1,000 posts over the past 24 hours and suspended a number of accounts for violating its rules. Southgate said his team would ""heal together as a team now"" and that ""we're there for them [Sancho, Rashford and Saka] and I know that 99% of the public will be as well"". He added: ""Bukayo in particular has been an absolute star in this tournament, incredible maturity and the way he has played has brought a smile to so many people's faces. ""He's become such a popular member of the group and I know he has got everybody's support."" TheProfessional Footballers' Associationjoined the condemnation, saying those responsible ""represent the worst of us"", and that the response from social media companies was ""insufficient"". ""Racist abuse causes trauma. It will impact the targeted players, their team-mates, and we know it will also affect their peers,"" the PFA said. ""It causes hurt to all the other fans who view online hate, and it will inevitably live with the next aspiring generation of young players."" This video can not be played Ugo Monye shares his experience of 'disgraceful' fans' behaviour at Wembley Former England striker and BBC punditAlan Shearersaid he hoped ""social media companies expose these individuals"" who post online abuse. ""There are so many positives for social media but also so many negatives,"" Shearer told BBC Breakfast. ""The positives are that it allows so many of these players and squad to show their personality on the pitch and, most importantly, off the pitch. ""But on the negative side, what on earth are people thinking about - when these guys have been brave enough to take a penalty - to go online and abuse these players? ""What is wrong with some people? It is just so sad and ridiculous. I hope the social media companies expose these individuals. Absolutely disgusting."" Saka, who had his penalty saved by Italy keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, was consoled by his team-mates and England manager Southgate following his spot-kick. The 19-year-old has been at Arsenal since he was seven and the Gunners said they were ""proud"" of the winger's exploits at Euro 2020 and told him to ""hold your head high"". ""Last night we witnessed the leadership and character we've always known and loved in Bukayo,"" said anArsenalstatement. ""However, this feeling of pride quickly turned to sorrow at the racist comments our young player was subjected to on his social media platforms after the final whistle. ""Once again, we are sad to have to say we condemn the racism of a number of black players. ""This cannot continue and the social media platforms and authorities must act to ensure this disgusting abuse to which our players are subjected on a daily basis stops now. ""We have processes in place internally at Arsenal to ensure our players are supported both emotionally and practically on this issue but sadly there is only so much we can do."" Seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram it ""shows how much work still needs to be done"" to tackle the problem of online racist abuse. Former England defenderGary Nevillecriticised the stance of the prime minister and feared the worst when Sancho, Rashford and Saka missed their penalties. ""I wasn't surprised in the slightest that I woke up to those headlines,"" Neville told Sky News. ""I expected it the minute that the three players that missed, missed."" Allow Instagram content?

BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones This is the biggest test yet for the social media giants in their attempts to crack down on racial abuse of footballers - and so far it's not going well. Such is the volume of abusive comments that the companies rely increasingly on automated systems to weed it out. But these have severe limitations. On example - an orangutan emoji was used in an Instagram comment about one England footballer. But the user who reported it got a message saying ""our technology has found that this comment doesn't go against our Community Guidelines."" The message from Instagram went on to admit ""our technology isn't perfect"" - and made it clear that the human moderation team hadn't been able to review the decision because of the volume of reports. There will be pressure on the companies to make it impossible to use certain words or emojis - but they will point to criticism from others who say they should not  be policing speech that may be distasteful but is not illegal.

"This video can not be played Roxy Freebury has been involved with discussions over a new unit set up by Gwent Police A victim of crime says some people are put off reporting incidents because of delays in getting justice. More than 57,000 trials are yet to be heard in crown courts across England and Wales due to a backlog made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. This is despite investment by the UK government to reduce the backlog. One Welsh police force has set up a unit to help the growing number of people waiting for justice and reduce pressure on the 101 phone service. Lack of confidence locks young out of legal career 'Prison is the safest place for my mum' Is four years too long to wait for justice? Roxy Freebury, 24, from Newport, has twice been the victim of domestic abuse and said it was important to her safety to be kept informed. ""I had to ring the police myself and go into the police station with a friend, just to find out what was going on,"" she said, explaining the officer in charge of her case was on leave. ""I had just reported someone who Women's Aid said was dangerous, so I thought they [the police] would be looking out for me more. I didn't know if he was released or remanded until I chased them, then I felt like a nuisance."" She has since been involved in focus groups with the force, to advise how they can improve services. ""I think it'll make a big difference, because if people feel sometimes the police can be a bit lax with updates and cases take a long time, they might be more hesitant to report a crime. Chief Constable Pam Kelly believes the new unit is a ""win-win"" for everyone ""There's quite a misconception that the police will do nothing because sometimes it can take a long time. ""But now they know there's a unit to provide support for victims all the way through, even if your case takes longer."" Gwent Police Chief Constable Pam Kelly said 19 specialist officers answering calls and keeping victims updated would remove about 12% of calls to the 101 service. ""It's a win-win,"" she said. ""It speeds up 101 for the public, but more importantly makes sure we have the right service at the right time for victims. ""Victims often feel the most vulnerable but actually they are the most powerful part of the criminal justice system - without them coming forward we will never be able to bring offenders to justice."" Earlier this year victims' commissioner Dame Vera Baird warned the Commons Justice Select Committee that victims would drop out of the process because of delays in the courts. Cut jury size to clear courts backlog - Labour 'Grave concerns' for justice over court backlog Weeds, leaks, and four-year waits for justice Scott Bowen, a criminal solicitor in Newport, said a crime reported today might involve a 12 to 18-month delay before a decision is made to charge. It could then be another year before it comes to crown court. ""There's a huge impact not just on justice for victims of crime but also those accused of crime,"" he added. ""If you are a professional accused of a sexual offence, assault or dishonesty, you can often find yourself being suspended by your professional bodies until the conclusion of the case. ""This [unit] is a good thing, but this is really not addressing the core of the problem. ""This is addressing one of the consequences of the backlog and a lack of funding throughout the whole justice system."" A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: ""Major challenges remain which is why we are investing hundreds of millions to further increase capacity, including the opening of a nightingale court in Swansea to deliver swifter justice and support victims.""

"Marcus Rashford was one of three players to miss a penalty for England in the 3-2 shootout defeat at Wembley England forward Marcus Rashford apologised for his penalty miss but said he ""will never apologise for who I am"" after he was one of three players subjected to racist abuse following England's Euro 2020 final defeat. Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka missed their spot-kicks as Italy won 3-2 in a shootout after a 1-1 draw. All three players were targeted on social media after the game. ""I felt as if I'd let everyone down,""Rashford wrote in a statement.,external The 23-year-old Manchester United attacker added: ""I can take critique of my performance all day long, my penalty was not good enough, it should have gone in but I will never apologise for who I am and where I came from. ""I've felt no prouder moment than wearing those three lions on my chest and seeing my family cheer me on in a crowd of tens of thousands."" England's Tyrone Mings criticises Patel over racism response Hundreds of messages left on Rashford mural Hate Won't Win: Your messages of appreciation to England team Why abuse remains rife on social media Southgate keen to lead England to Qatar but feels like 'stomach has been ripped out' Pupils tell England team 'You're all heroes to us' A mural in Rashford's hometown of Withington was defaced after his penalty miss, before it was covered in messages of support. On Monday, England boss Gareth Southgate said the racist abuse was ""unforgivable"", and Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Football Association also condemned it. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the abuse and said ""it will not be tolerated"", while the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) has also launched an investigation. Messages of support were posted on a Marcus Rashford mural in his hometown after it was initially defaced Marcus Rashford's statement in full: ""I don't even know where to start and I don't even know how to put into words how I am feeling at this exact time. ""I've had a difficult season, I think that's been clear for everyone to see and I probably went into that final with a lack of confidence. I've always backed myself for a penalty, but something didn't feel quite right. ""During the long run-up I was saving myself a bit of time and unfortunately the result was not what I wanted. I felt as though I had let my team-mates down. I felt as if I'd let everyone down. A penalty was all I'd been asked to contribute for the team. I can score penalties in my sleep, so why not that one? ""It's been playing in my head over and over since I struck the ball and there's probably not a word to quite describe how it feels. Final. 55 years. 1 penalty. History. All I can say is sorry. I wish it had of gone differently. ""Whilst I continue to say sorry I want to shout out my team-mates. This summer has been one of the best camps I've experienced and you've all played a role in that. ""A brotherhood has been built that is unbreakable. Your success is my success. Your failures are mine. ""I've grown into a sport where I expected to read things written about myself. ""Whether it be the colour of my skin, where I grew up, or, most recently, how I decide to spend my time off the pitch. ""I can take critique of my performance all day long, my penalty was not good enough, it should have gone in but I will never apologise for who I am and where I came from. I've felt no prouder moment than wearing those three lions on my chest and seeing my family cheer me on in a crowd of tens of thousands. ""I dreamt of days like this. The messages I've received today have been positively overwhelming and seeing the response in Withington had me on the verge of tears. The communities that always wrapped their arms around me continue to hold me up. ""I'm Marcus Rashford, 23-year-old black man from Withington and Wythenshawe, South Manchester.

This video can not be played Racist abuse of England players is 'unforgivable' - Southgate The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) says shared data with Channel 4 news after the Euro 2020 final highlighted that more than 850,000 tweets were analysed across the whole tournament and showed: 1,913 flagged as potentially abusive, specifically targeting Sancho, Saka, Rashford and Raheem Sterling. 167 posts were considered to be ""high-risk"" abuse. The PFA said that, while a number of these tweets were delete, the accounts have not been permanently suspended by Twitter. ""Our preliminary analysis suggests the volume of abuse flagged around the Euro 2020 final, aimed mainly at Jadon Sancho, Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling, was higher than the rest of the tournament combined,"" the PFA added. Twitter said it had removed more than 1,000 posts over the past 24 hours and suspended a number of accounts for violating its rules. Facebook said it had recently announced tougher measures on its Instagram platform, including permanently deleting accounts that repeatedly send abusive direct messages. England captain Harry Kane has told those behind the racist abuse of Rashford, Sancho and Saka: ""You're not an England fan and we don't want you."" The Tottenham striker addedon Twitter:,external""They deserve support and backing, not the vile racist abuse they've had since last night. ""Three lads who were brilliant all summer had the courage to step up and take a pen when the stakes were high. ""If you abuse anyone on social media you're not an England fan and we don't want you."" Defender Tyrone Mings also used Twitter to talk of his pride in the team reaching the final but added: ""Waking up today and seeing my brothers being racially abused for being brave enough to put themselves in a position to help this country, is something that sickens, but doesn't surprise me.""

England and Borussia Dortmund midfielderJude Bellinghamtweeted a picture of the three players wearing crowns and wrote: ""We win together and we lose together.

It added: ""We could not be clearer that anyone behind such disgusting behaviour is not welcome in following the team. ""We will do all we can to support the players affected while urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible.

In February, thegovernment threatened social media companieswith ""large fines"" if they failed to tackle abuse on their platforms. ""It's unbelievable that we are still talking about it,""FA chief executive Mark Bullinghamtold BBC Sport. ""We've been so clear, these social media companies need to act. They need to stamp it out and they can do that. ""We are reiterating a call for the government to bring in the Online Harms Bill as soon as they can. We don't think it's acceptable in any walk of life for this racist abuse to happen and we want it to stop."" Rashford highlighted racial abuse he received on social media in May after losing the Europa League final with Manchester United. And last year Sancho was amongsport stars protesting against racismfollowing the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Social media companies have been criticised for a perceived lack of action on racist abuse on their platforms, and in April Instagram announced a tool to enable users to automatically filter out abusive messages from those they do not follow. Following numerous instances of online abuse, a number of clubs, players, athletes and sporting bodies took part in afour-day boycott of social mediain April to encourage companies to take a stronger stance against racist and sexist abuse. On the back of the abuse suffered by England's players after the Euro 2020 final,Facebooksaid it had recently announced tougher measures on its Instagram platform, including permanently deleting accounts that repeatedly send abusive direct messages. ""No one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don't want it on Instagram,"" said a Facebook spokesperson. ""We quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England's footballers last night and we'll continue to take action against those that break our rules. ""In addition to our work to remove this content, we encourage all players to turn on Hidden Words, a tool which means no one has to see abuse in their comments or DMs. ""No one thing will fix this challenge overnight, but we're committed to keeping our community safe from abuse."" Twittersaid it had removed more than 1,000 posts over the past 24 hours and suspended a number of accounts for violating its rules. Southgate said his team would ""heal together as a team now"" and that ""we're there for them [Sancho, Rashford and Saka] and I know that 99% of the public will be as well"". He added: ""Bukayo in particular has been an absolute star in this tournament, incredible maturity and the way he has played has brought a smile to so many people's faces. ""He's become such a popular member of the group and I know he has got everybody's support."" TheProfessional Footballers' Associationjoined the condemnation, saying those responsible ""represent the worst of us"", and that the response from social media companies was ""insufficient"". ""Racist abuse causes trauma. It will impact the targeted players, their team-mates, and we know it will also affect their peers,"" the PFA said. ""It causes hurt to all the other fans who view online hate, and it will inevitably live with the next aspiring generation of young players.""

""There are so many positives for social media but also so many negatives,"" Shearer told BBC Breakfast. ""The positives are that it allows so many of these players and squad to show their personality on the pitch and, most importantly, off the pitch. ""But on the negative side, what on earth are people thinking about - when these guys have been brave enough to take a penalty - to go online and abuse these players? ""What is wrong with some people? It is just so sad and ridiculous. I hope the social media companies expose these individuals. Absolutely disgusting."" Saka, who had his penalty saved by Italy keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, was consoled by his team-mates and England manager Southgate following his spot-kick. The 19-year-old has been at Arsenal since he was seven and the Gunners said they were ""proud"" of the winger's exploits at Euro 2020 and told him to ""hold your head high"". ""Last night we witnessed the leadership and character we've always known and loved in Bukayo,"" said anArsenalstatement. ""However, this feeling of pride quickly turned to sorrow at the racist comments our young player was subjected to on his social media platforms after the final whistle. ""Once again, we are sad to have to say we condemn the racism of a number of black players. ""This cannot continue and the social media platforms and authorities must act to ensure this disgusting abuse to which our players are subjected on a daily basis stops now. ""We have processes in place internally at Arsenal to ensure our players are supported both emotionally and practically on this issue but sadly there is only so much we can do."" Seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram it ""shows how much work still needs to be done"" to tackle the problem of online racist abuse. Former England defenderGary Nevillecriticised the stance of the prime minister and feared the worst when Sancho, Rashford and Saka missed their penalties.

BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones This is the biggest test yet for the social media giants in their attempts to crack down on racial abuse of footballers - and so far it's not going well. Such is the volume of abusive comments that the companies rely increasingly on automated systems to weed it out. But these have severe limitations. On example - an orangutan emoji was used in an Instagram comment about one England footballer. But the user who reported it got a message saying ""our technology has found that this comment doesn't go against our Community Guidelines."" The message from Instagram went on to admit ""our technology isn't perfect"" - and made it clear that the human moderation team hadn't been able to review the decision because of the volume of reports. There will be pressure on the companies to make it impossible to use certain words or emojis - but they will point to criticism from others who say they should not  be policing speech that may be distasteful but is not illegal.

"Police discovered nearly Â£180m worth of cryptocurrency on 10 July The Met Police has seized a record Â£180m worth of cryptocurrency linked to international money laundering in London. The seizure is the largest of its kind in the UK - beating the previous record set when the Met confiscated Â£114m of cryptocurrency on 24 June. A 39-year-old woman, arrested on suspicion of money laundering on 24 June, has been interviewed over the new seizure. She has since been bailed. The Met's economic crime command made the seizure after following up intelligence received about the transfer of criminal assets. The investigation is continuing. Transactions made using cryptocurrencies can provide more anonymity to senders and recipients of money. The Met did not say which cryptocurrencies they seized. Cryptocurrencies are digital money that is not issued by a bank. You can trade and invest these currencies like any other - and there are virtually no barriers to entry. The absence of regulation means the market can go up incredibly fast. During the lockdown, the total value of all cryptocurrencies increased from about Â£175bn to more than Â£1.75tn. Figures from the UK's financial watchdog show hundreds of thousands of people in the UK hold these digital currencies. But since the start of May, the market reached its highest-ever level and lost more than Â£1tn just a few weeks later. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Graham McNulty said: ""Proceeds of crime are laundered in many different ways. ""While cash still remains king in the criminal world, as digital platforms develop we're increasingly seeing organised criminals using cryptocurrency to launder their dirty money. ""The detectives on this case have worked tirelessly and meticulously to trace millions of pounds worth of cryptocurrency suspected of being linked to criminality and now being laundered to hide the trail. ""Our investigation will stop at nothing to disrupt the transfer and identify those involved."" How do cryptocurrencies work? Video, 00:02:22How do cryptocurrencies work?

"This video can not be played Thousands took to the streets in protest over the government's handling of coronavirus and the economy Dozens of people have been arrested in Cuba after thousands joined the biggest protests for decades against the island's Communist government, media and opposition sources say. Unauthorised public gatherings are illegal in Cuba and protests are rare. Images on social media showed what appeared to be security forces detaining, beating and pepper-spraying some of the protesters. Cuba's president labelled those protesting ""mercenaries"". In a four-hour-long televised address President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel slammed protestors as ""counter-revolutionaries"" while his foreign minister alleged the demonstrations had been financed and instigated by the United States. Three key issues that explain Cuba's rare protests Internet sheds light on Cuba anger - until it goes dark Miguel DÃ­az-Canel: The man succeeding the Castros But those who took to the streets said they were angry about the collapse of the economy, food and medicine shortages, price hikes and the government's handling of Covid-19. The government's response to the demonstrations was swift. Figures compiled by legal help centre Cubalex suggest around 100 people were arrested on Sunday. Among those detained is journalist Camila Acosta who was covering the protests for Spanish newspaper ABC. Spanish Foreign Minister JosÃ© Manuel Albares demanded her immediate release. A young man who only gave his name as Carlos Alberto told BBC News Mundo he was hiding at his girlfriend's home after taking part in a demonstration. ""A colleague of mine was arrested, they came to look for him at his home. I'm afraid the same thing could happen to me,"" he said. ""We weren't doing anything bad, we're just asking for freedom and with this attitude they're showing what they are: a dictatorship,"" he told BBC Mundo's Lioman Lima over the phone. There were reports of internet blackouts across the island. Access to mobile internet was rolled out in December 2018 in Cuba but is controlled by the state-owned telecommunications company Etecsa. Internet monitoring site Netblocks said access to WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Telegram had been restricted by Etecsa's servers. Mobile internet is the main way for Cubans to access independent news and many said the blackouts had increased the sense of ominous unease following the protests. There also appeared to be a heightened presence of security forces with one Havana resident reporting that ""the streets are full of police"". ""There are police at every corner and practically all you see going past is police patrols."" RamÃ³n Espinosa, a photographer with AP news agency, was injured while covering the protests Security forces detained people who took part in the demonstrations With messaging services down and dozens of people arrested, relatives of some of those detained gathered in front of police stations for news of their loved ones. Ariel GonzÃ¡lez told BBC News Mundo he had been to his local police station twice to enquire about his son, a 21-year-old student who was arrested during the protests. ""I knew he got roughed up because some of his friends who were with him told me. At the police station they told me they couldn't tell me where he is because he was taken by another 'institution',"" he said referring to the presence of plainclothes officers at the protests. Many of those attending the protests on Sunday complained about shortages ""There is no food, no medicine, there is no freedom. They do not let us live,"" one man named only as Alejandro said. Protesters also shouted ""freedom"" and ""down with the dictatorship"". President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel blamed the US sanctions on Cuba - which have been in place in various forms since 1962 - for the shortages, calling them a ""policy of economic suffocation"". The US - which has a decades-old history of hostilities with Cuba - has said it stands with Cubans, and called on those in government to refrain from violence and listen to its people. ""The Cuban people are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights,"" US President Joe Biden said. The anti-government protests began with a demonstration in the city of San Antonio de los BaÃ±os, south-west of Havana, but soon spread throughout the country. Many were broadcast live on social networks. Posts on social media showed people overturning police cars and looting some state-owned shops which price their goods in foreign currencies. For many Cubans, these shops are the only way they can buy basic necessities but prices are high. Some protesters targeted police vehicles and state-owned shops Cuba's economy is struggling. Tourism, one of the most important sectors, has been devastated by the restrictions on travel during the Covid pandemic. Sugar, which is mostly exported, is another key earner for Cuba. But this year's harvest has been much worse than expected. As a result, the government's reserves of foreign currency are depleted, meaning it cannot buy in imported goods to supplement shortages, as it would normally do. Are you taking part in the protests?

"This video can not be played Roxy Freebury has been involved with discussions over a new unit set up by Gwent Police A victim of crime says some people are put off reporting incidents because of delays in getting justice. More than 57,000 trials are yet to be heard in crown courts across England and Wales due to a backlog made worse by the coronavirus pandemic. This is despite investment by the UK government to reduce the backlog. One Welsh police force has set up a unit to help the growing number of people waiting for justice and reduce pressure on the 101 phone service. Lack of confidence locks young out of legal career 'Prison is the safest place for my mum' Is four years too long to wait for justice? Roxy Freebury, 24, from Newport, has twice been the victim of domestic abuse and said it was important to her safety to be kept informed. ""I had to ring the police myself and go into the police station with a friend, just to find out what was going on,"" she said, explaining the officer in charge of her case was on leave. ""I had just reported someone who Women's Aid said was dangerous, so I thought they [the police] would be looking out for me more. I didn't know if he was released or remanded until I chased them, then I felt like a nuisance."" She has since been involved in focus groups with the force, to advise how they can improve services. ""I think it'll make a big difference, because if people feel sometimes the police can be a bit lax with updates and cases take a long time, they might be more hesitant to report a crime. Chief Constable Pam Kelly believes the new unit is a ""win-win"" for everyone ""There's quite a misconception that the police will do nothing because sometimes it can take a long time. ""But now they know there's a unit to provide support for victims all the way through, even if your case takes longer."" Gwent Police Chief Constable Pam Kelly said 19 specialist officers answering calls and keeping victims updated would remove about 12% of calls to the 101 service. ""It's a win-win,"" she said. ""It speeds up 101 for the public, but more importantly makes sure we have the right service at the right time for victims. ""Victims often feel the most vulnerable but actually they are the most powerful part of the criminal justice system - without them coming forward we will never be able to bring offenders to justice."" Earlier this year victims' commissioner Dame Vera Baird warned the Commons Justice Select Committee that victims would drop out of the process because of delays in the courts. Cut jury size to clear courts backlog - Labour 'Grave concerns' for justice over court backlog Weeds, leaks, and four-year waits for justice Scott Bowen, a criminal solicitor in Newport, said a crime reported today might involve a 12 to 18-month delay before a decision is made to charge. It could then be another year before it comes to crown court. ""There's a huge impact not just on justice for victims of crime but also those accused of crime,"" he added. ""If you are a professional accused of a sexual offence, assault or dishonesty, you can often find yourself being suspended by your professional bodies until the conclusion of the case. ""This [unit] is a good thing, but this is really not addressing the core of the problem. ""This is addressing one of the consequences of the backlog and a lack of funding throughout the whole justice system."" A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: ""Major challenges remain which is why we are investing hundreds of millions to further increase capacity, including the opening of a nightingale court in Swansea to deliver swifter justice and support victims.""

"This video can not be played Racist abuse of England players is 'unforgivable' - Southgate England captain Harry Kane has told those behind the racist abuse of team-mates Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka: ""You're not an England fan and we don't want you."" All three players missed penalties in the 3-2 shootout loss to Italy in Sunday's Euro 2020 final. They were targeted on social media after the game. ""They deserve support and backing, not the vile racist abuse they've had since last night,"" Kane said. ""Three lads who were brilliant all summer had the courage to step up and take a pen when the stakes were high,"" the Tottenham striker addedon Twitter.,external ""If you abuse anyone on social media you're not an England fan and we don't want you.""

He went on to criticise Home Secretary Priti Patel who last month described players taking the knee against racism as ""gesture politics"". Earlier, manager Gareth Southgate said the racist abuse issued after the defeat was ""unforgivable"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Football Association also condemned it. The Metropolitan Police,externalis investigating the abuse and said ""it will not be tolerated"", while the UK Football Policing Unit (UKFPU) has also launched an investigation. Chief Constable Mark Roberts, the National Police Chiefs' Council Football Policing Lead, said police were working with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter ""and enquiries are already being progressed"". ""It's just not what we stand for,"" saidSouthgate. ""We have been a beacon of light in bringing people together, in people being able to relate to the national team, and the national team stands for everybody and so that togetherness has to continue. ""We have shown the power our country has when it does come together and has that energy and positivity together. ""It's my decision who takes the penalties, it's not a case of players not volunteering or more experienced players backing out."" England and Borussia Dortmund midfielderJude Bellinghamtweeted a picture of the three players wearing crowns and wrote: ""We win together and we lose together. So proud to have team-mates with such top character. As for the racism, hurtful but not surprising. Will never get bored of saying that more needs to be done. Educate and control the platforms."" Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford missed penalties in England's shootout defeat European football's governing bodyUefacondemned the ""disgusting racist abuse"", adding: ""We stand by the players and the FA's call for the strongest possible punishments."" On Monday, League Two sideLeyton Orientsaid they had banned a fan for life in connection with the abuse. ""The supporter in question's actions on Twitter were alerted to the club late last night, and action has been taken swiftly to issue a banning order,"" the club said. Meanwhile, Premier League sideWolvessaid they had passed details to police after being alerted to racist abuse from one of their supporters. And a parish councillor in Shropshire has resigned after racist posts appeared on his personal Facebook page in the wake of England's defeat. Paul Bradbury, a member of Pontesbury Parish Council, said his account had been hacked. West Mercia Police said it had arrested a man in his 60s from Minsterley, Shropshire, on suspicion of inciting racial hatred and he remained in police custody. England had reached their first final in a major tournament since winning the World Cup in 1966 and, despite taking the lead against Italy, drew 1-1 after extra time before a penalty shootout. ""This England team deserve to be lauded as heroes, not racially abused on social media,""said the prime minister.,external He later started a Downing Street briefing by praising the players, adding: ""They brought joy to this country and to those who have been directing racist abuse I say 'shame on you and I hope you will crawl back under the rock from which you emerged'."" England's players have taken a knee before games at the Euros to highlight the fight against racial inequality. On the day the tournament started on 11 June,the prime minister did not condemn fanswho jeered when England players took the knee during two warm-up games. Instead, Johnson said he wanted to see fans ""getting behind the team to cheer them on"" - and was then accused of not having ""the guts to call it out"" by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer.

TheFAsaid it was ""appalled"" by the ""online racism"" directed at the three players following the defeat at Wembley. It added: ""We could not be clearer that anyone behind such disgusting behaviour is not welcome in following the team. ""We will do all we can to support the players affected while urging the toughest punishments possible for anyone responsible. ""We will continue to do everything we can to stamp discrimination out of the game, but we implore government to act quickly and bring in the appropriate legislation so this abuse has real life consequences. This video can not be played Sancho, Jorginho & Saka miss penalties as Italy edge England at Wembley ""Social media companies need to step up and take accountability and action to ban abusers from their platforms, gather evidence that can lead to prosecution and support making their platforms free from this type of abhorrent abuse."" In February, thegovernment threatened social media companieswith ""large fines"" if they failed to tackle abuse on their platforms. ""It's unbelievable that we are still talking about it,""FA chief executive Mark Bullinghamtold BBC Sport. ""We've been so clear, these social media companies need to act. They need to stamp it out and they can do that. ""We are reiterating a call for the government to bring in the Online Harms Bill as soon as they can. We don't think it's acceptable in any walk of life for this racist abuse to happen and we want it to stop."" Rashford highlighted racial abuse he received on social media in May after losing the Europa League final with Manchester United. And last year Sancho was amongsport stars protesting against racismfollowing the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Social media companies have been criticised for a perceived lack of action on racist abuse on their platforms, and in April Instagram announced a tool to enable users to automatically filter out abusive messages from those they do not follow. Following numerous instances of online abuse, a number of clubs, players, athletes and sporting bodies took part in afour-day boycott of social mediain April to encourage companies to take a stronger stance against racist and sexist abuse. On the back of the abuse suffered by England's players after the Euro 2020 final,Facebooksaid it had recently announced tougher measures on its Instagram platform, including permanently deleting accounts that repeatedly send abusive direct messages. ""No one should have to experience racist abuse anywhere, and we don't want it on Instagram,"" said a Facebook spokesperson. ""We quickly removed comments and accounts directing abuse at England's footballers last night and we'll continue to take action against those that break our rules. ""In addition to our work to remove this content, we encourage all players to turn on Hidden Words, a tool which means no one has to see abuse in their comments or DMs. ""No one thing will fix this challenge overnight, but we're committed to keeping our community safe from abuse."" Twittersaid it had removed more than 1,000 posts over the past 24 hours and suspended a number of accounts for violating its rules. Southgate said his team would ""heal together as a team now"" and that ""we're there for them [Sancho, Rashford and Saka] and I know that 99% of the public will be as well"". He added: ""Bukayo in particular has been an absolute star in this tournament, incredible maturity and the way he has played has brought a smile to so many people's faces. ""He's become such a popular member of the group and I know he has got everybody's support."" TheProfessional Footballers' Associationjoined the condemnation, saying those responsible ""represent the worst of us"", and that the response from social media companies was ""insufficient"". ""Racist abuse causes trauma. It will impact the targeted players, their team-mates, and we know it will also affect their peers,"" the PFA said. ""It causes hurt to all the other fans who view online hate, and it will inevitably live with the next aspiring generation of young players."" This video can not be played Ugo Monye shares his experience of 'disgraceful' fans' behaviour at Wembley Former England striker and BBC punditAlan Shearersaid he hoped ""social media companies expose these individuals"" who post online abuse. ""There are so many positives for social media but also so many negatives,"" Shearer told BBC Breakfast. ""The positives are that it allows so many of these players and squad to show their personality on the pitch and, most importantly, off the pitch. ""But on the negative side, what on earth are people thinking about - when these guys have been brave enough to take a penalty - to go online and abuse these players? ""What is wrong with some people? It is just so sad and ridiculous. I hope the social media companies expose these individuals. Absolutely disgusting."" Saka, who had his penalty saved by Italy keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, was consoled by his team-mates and England manager Southgate following his spot-kick. The 19-year-old has been at Arsenal since he was seven and the Gunners said they were ""proud"" of the winger's exploits at Euro 2020 and told him to ""hold your head high"". ""Last night we witnessed the leadership and character we've always known and loved in Bukayo,"" said anArsenalstatement. ""However, this feeling of pride quickly turned to sorrow at the racist comments our young player was subjected to on his social media platforms after the final whistle. ""Once again, we are sad to have to say we condemn the racism of a number of black players. ""This cannot continue and the social media platforms and authorities must act to ensure this disgusting abuse to which our players are subjected on a daily basis stops now. ""We have processes in place internally at Arsenal to ensure our players are supported both emotionally and practically on this issue but sadly there is only so much we can do."" Seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton wrote on Instagram it ""shows how much work still needs to be done"" to tackle the problem of online racist abuse. Former England defenderGary Nevillecriticised the stance of the prime minister and feared the worst when Sancho, Rashford and Saka missed their penalties. ""I wasn't surprised in the slightest that I woke up to those headlines,"" Neville told Sky News. ""I expected it the minute that the three players that missed, missed."" Allow Instagram content?

BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones This is the biggest test yet for the social media giants in their attempts to crack down on racial abuse of footballers - and so far it's not going well. Such is the volume of abusive comments that the companies rely increasingly on automated systems to weed it out. But these have severe limitations. On example - an orangutan emoji was used in an Instagram comment about one England footballer. But the user who reported it got a message saying ""our technology has found that this comment doesn't go against our Community Guidelines."" The message from Instagram went on to admit ""our technology isn't perfect"" - and made it clear that the human moderation team hadn't been able to review the decision because of the volume of reports. There will be pressure on the companies to make it impossible to use certain words or emojis - but they will point to criticism from others who say they should not  be policing speech that may be distasteful but is not illegal.

"The government has said bus and train companies must decide whether passengers have to wear face coverings on their services from Monday, when Covid rules are relaxed in England. Face masks have been mandatory on public transport for the past year to reduce the spread of the virus. But those rules will be replaced with government guidance advising passengers to wear masks only on busy services. Transport firms will be left to decide whether to enforce that advice and how. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said masks would still be ""recommended"" on public transport, but people without a face covering would no longer be fined after restrictions are eased on 19 July. Nevertheless, bus and train companies will still be able to turn away passengers who refuse to wear one - unless they are exempt. The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said some of the 3.8m people classed as clinically vulnerable would be ""fearful"" to go on public transport if masks were not compulsory. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he had not yet taken the decision whether to require masks on trams in Manchester as he wanted to avoid adding to people's confusion. Treasury Minister Stephen Barclay told BBC Breakfast the emphasis was now on ""trusting the British public"" to take a cautious approach and there would be specific guidance for vulnerable people. What changes will I see when restrictions end on 19 July? How are the rules on masks changing on 19 July? Why is social distancing coming to an end? London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the safest option would be to continue to legally require people to wear masks on public transport. His comments came asLabour criticised the government's approach to unlockingin England as ""high risk"" and ""fatalistic"". While virtually all legal restrictions in England will be lifted on Monday, some guidance will remain. There will no longer be any limits on how many people can meet and the 1m-plus distancing rule will be removed. Nightclubs will also be allowed to reopen for the first time since March 2020 and capacity limits will be removed for all venues and events. But nightclubs and other venues with large crowds will be encouraged to use Covid status certification - so-called domestic vaccine passports - ""as a matter of social responsibility"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday. Government guidance to work from home where possible will be lifted, but ministers are encouraging a gradual return to the workplace. On face coverings, Mr Johnson said: ""We expect and recommend that people wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed spaces where you come into contact with those you don't normally meet, such as on public transport."" Asked if Monday's rule changes were irreversible, as has been repeatedly stated, Mr Johnson said he hoped they were but ""we must rule nothing out"". And in the Commons, Mr Javid said the government will ""have a review"" in September ""to make sure that we're properly set up for autumn and for winter"". Transport companies have been weighing up whether to mandate masks or not. If you're flying, chances are you will still need to wear one; many airlines have decided to keep masks as a requirement for travel. But most train, bus and coach operators in England will now decide they won't be mandatory, following the lead set by rail and passenger groups. Companies will still ask passengers to wear masks when services are busy. But there's concern among many transport operators that a blanket requirement could make people think that public transport is more dangerous than other indoor settings, like restaurants and pubs. We haven't yet heard from the London Mayor about whether masks will be required on Transport for London-run services. Wales and Scotland both still require anyone travelling on public transport to wear a mask by law, meaning that those taking services that cross the border from England will have notices reminding them to wear a face covering unless exempt. It is the second time this has happened during the course of the pandemic. The Confederation of Passenger Transport - a trade group representing bus and coach companies - said passengers will find it ""difficult to understand"" why the prime minister has ""singled out public transport as somewhere to wear a face covering when a range of other activities share its characteristics."" The group said it wanted clear guidance for operators and customers, adding that it was important to respect everyone's right to choose whether to wear a face covering once restrictions had eased. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said its members would ask passengers to wear face coverings in busy indoor settings ""out of respect for others"". It said enhanced cleaning would continue after 19 July and train companies would provide better information about how busy services are. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed masks would continue to be required on public transport and in healthcare settings ""even if"" the nation relaxes restrictions, which aredue to be reviewed,externalon 15 July. Rules regarding face coverings are due to be considered next month inNorthern Ireland, which is due to ease some Covid measures on 26 July. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is due to make an announcement about restrictions on Tuesday.Scotland is expected,externalto move to level 0 - the lowest level of restrictions in its roadmap - on 19 July and lift most legal restrictions on 9 August. The prime minister said it was vital to proceed with ""caution"" in England after 19 July, warning ""this pandemic is not over"" . Covid: 'For us it's not freedom day' Some firms to insist people still wear face masks Doctors call for face masks to stay in healthcare 'Personal responsibility needed to live with Covid' The peak of the current wave is not expected before mid-August and could lead to between 1,000 and 2,000 hospital admissions per day, according to government scientists. Central estimates from modellers advising the government also show that Covid deaths are expected to be between 100 and 200 per day at the peak, although there is a large amount of uncertainty. On Monday, the UK recorded 34,471 new cases, as well as six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It was the sixth consecutive day that cases were above 30,000. The number of deaths recorded on Mondays are often lower due to reporting lags over the weekend. More than 45.9 million people - or 87% of adults in the UK - have now had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. And more than 34.8 million - around two-thirds of adults - have had both doses.
