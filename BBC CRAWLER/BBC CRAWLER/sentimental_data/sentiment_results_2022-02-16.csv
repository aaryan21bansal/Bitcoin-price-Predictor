"Charities working with survivors of abuse say they have ""significant concerns"" about the Duke of York's offer to support trafficking victims. Prince Andrew made the pledge after settling the US civil sexual assault case brought by Virginia Giuffre, and agreeing to pay her an undisclosed sum. He made no admission of liability and has always denied the allegations. Labour MP Jess Phillips has expressed doubt Andrew could play a constructive role in combating trafficking. ""Those who work in sexual violence [and] human trafficking services are certainly not going to have open arms to his allyship... even if it was just finances,"" she said. Prince Andrew settles US civil sex assault case Who is Prince Andrew and what titles is he losing? Where does Prince Andrew get his money from? Prince Andrew must give up York title - city MP Ms Giuffre had been suing Andrew in a civil action, claiming he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17 - which the prince has repeatedly denied. On Tuesdayit was announced they had reachedan out-of-court settlement. A statement from their lawyers said the duke would pay an undisclosed sum to Ms Giuffre and make a ""substantial donation"" to her charity in support of victims' rights. It also said the duke regretted his association with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew hadpreviously told BBC Newsnightin 2019 he did not regret being friends with Epstein. No details of the payout to Ms Giuffre have been made public - and there are calls for more detail about where the money will come from. Labour MP Andy McDonald told BBC Newsnight that he intends to raise the issue in Parliament to find out whether public money is being used for the settlement. Mr McDonald said ""the issue isn't going to go away until people have that information and receive assurances that public money is not going to be used to in any way contribute to the settlement"". The exact amount of the financial settlement has not been revealed but reports have speculated that it could run into millions of pounds. The duke receives a Royal Navy pension and a stipend from the Queen's Duchy of Lancaster income. In a statement released on Tuesday, Andrew also pledged to ""demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims"". This video can not be played Watch: What did Prince Andrew say about Virginia Giuffre's allegations in the 2019 Newsnight interview? Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in 2019 about his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Watch thefull interview on BBC iPlayer. Maitlis: Andrew now seems to contradict answers he gave me Gabrielle Shaw, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac), said: ""Napac acknowledges and is grateful to the many generous fundraisers and donors who are survivors or supporters of survivors themselves,"" she added. ""With this trust being core to Napac's approach, any support for the charity that Prince Andrew may offer would raise significant concerns as to the ethical implications of accepting money or patronage from an individual who is a suspected perpetrator and who had ties to a convicted offender."" Beyond the Streets, a charity working to end sexual exploitation, said it was unlikely it would accept any support offered by Andrew. ""We think the priority of organisations who support women who have been exploited should be on their beneficiaries and not on the profile and activities of those who support them,"" a spokesperson said. ""This is particularly important in situations such as this where it could be perceived that there is a benefit to the potential supporter and there have been serious accusations involved."" Jayne Butler, chief executive of Rape Crisis England and Wales said while it had not been offered any support, financial or otherwise by Andrew or Ms Giuffre, it would not do so ""without consulting with our Rape Crisis member centres and with survivors"". Ms Phillips, shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: ""It's going to take a huge amount of effort and I think it will be incredibly hard for Prince Andrew to make that effort."" Prince Andrew, Virginia Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001 Ms Giuffre, now 38, claims she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by financier Epstein from the age of 16. Epstein died while awaiting trial in 2019. She claimed the duke sexually assaulted her on three separate occasions in London, New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. Who is Virginia Giuffre? Who was Jeffrey Epstein? In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Prince Andrew said he didn't recall meeting Ms Giuffre and that an incident in which she alleges they had sex at the Belgravia home of Ghislaine Maxwell ""didn't happen"". In January, a New York court ruled that the civil action against him could go ahead. Shortly afterwards, Buckingham Palace said the prince's military titles and royal patronages had been returned to the Queen and that he would defend Ms Giuffre's civil case as a ""private citizen"". If Prince Andrew had gone to court in the US to fight it out with Virginia Giuffre, it would have made headlines as tall as a New York skyscraper. That royal disaster zone has been averted by an out-of-court settlement. But it comes with high costs to Prince Andrew, both financial and reputational, and it will be a long road back before there is any chance of clearing his name in terms of public opinion.

"Visas offering foreign investors fast-track residency in the UK are being scrapped with immediate effect, the home secretary has confirmed. Priti Patel said ending Tier 1 investor visas, for those spending at least Â£2m, was the start of a ""renewed crackdown on illicit finance and fraud"". The scheme was introduced in 2008 to encourage wealthy people from outside the EU to invest in the UK. It has been under review for some time, after concerns it is open to abuse. The announcement had been expected next week amid pressure on ministers to cut UK ties to Russia over the threat of invasion to Ukraine, with a source confirming the decision to the BBC on Wednesday. But the move has been brought forward, with the government saying it was part of their ""new plan for immigration"". How much Russian money is there in the UK? Investor visas halted over money laundering The Tier 1 (investor) visa, often called a ""golden visa"", offers residency to those investing Â£2m or more in the UK, and allows their families to join them. Holders of these visas can then apply for permanent residency in the UK, at a speed depending on how much they invest. A Â£2m investment allows an application within five years, shortened to three years with Â£5m or two years if Â£10m is invested. But the route to residency is now being closed with immediate effect, with the government saying it ""failed to deliver for the UK people and gave opportunities for corrupt elites to access the UK"". Ms Patel added: ""I have zero tolerance for abuse of our immigration system. Under my new plan for Immigration, I want to ensure the British people have confidence in the system, including stopping corrupt elites who threaten our national security and push dirty money around our cities. ""Closing this route is just the start of our renewed crackdown on fraud and illicit finance. We will be publishing a fraud action plan, while the forthcoming Economic Crime Bill will crackdown on people abusing our financial institutions and better protect the taxpayer."" The Home Office said settlement in the UK will now be conditional on applicants ""executing an investment strategy that can show genuine job creation and other tangible economic impacts - passively holding UK investments will no longer be enough to obtain settlement.â¯""â¯ Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: ""Shutting the door to Putin's cronies is not enough - too many of them have already walked through it with virtually no questions asked."" She urged the government to publish its report into those who came to the UK on the visas. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper also called for the review to be published and said a general plan was needed to ""stop illicit finance coming into the UK"". She said ""for years the Conservatives failed to stamp out the influence of Russian money in the UK"" adding that it had ""taken international condemnation of our failures... for the home secretary to act"". The Home Office has issued 2,581 investor visas to Russian citizens since the scheme was introduced in 2008. Several changes have been made since the investor visa scheme was launched, including extra checks on how and when applicants acquired their wealth. Banks are also now required to complete certain checks before opening accounts for applicants - who are also required to submit extra paperwork if their qualifying funds are invested through a chain of different companies. In 2020, Parliament's intelligence and security committee argued for a ""more robust"" approach to approving Tier 1 visas as part of areport on Russian influence in the UK,external. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of Tier 1 (Investor) visas granted to Russians as 14,516. The correct figure to the end of March 2020 was 2,581.

"About 500 young people could be eligible for the scheme Every 18-year-old leaving care will be offered Â£1,600 a month for two years under a Welsh government basic income pilot. It is expected about 500 people will be eligible to join the scheme, which could cost up to Â£20m. Officials said it was the highest amount offered on a basic income scheme anywhere in the world. The Welsh Conservatives said it was a waste of money while Plaid Cymru called for the pilot to be expanded. The Â£1,600 a month will be taxed and is expected to be counted as income by the UK government, meaning it would affect someone's eligibility for benefits. It will be unconditional and will not be withdrawn if participants get a job. What is a universal basic income? Spain to use basic income to ease crisis pain Most Welsh homes to get Â£150 payment But the Welsh government is no longer calling the plans a pilot of Universal Basic Income (UBI), where a wider group of people would be given a regular sum of money. Ministers want to test out how the payments could help care leavers be better placed for their transition into independence as adults. Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt said the plans would ""deliver financial stability for a generation of young people that need it most"". Milly said the pilot is a ""good opportunity"" for carers A teenager who has foster parents said the pilot could make care leavers ""equal with everyone else"". Milly, 17, represents the National Youth Advocacy service on the Welsh Youth Parliament and has spoken openly about her care experiences. She said the pilot was a good opportunity, adding people in care were ""disadvantaged financially and this will bring us level"". She said it would be a ""safety net"" for those who have been in care who may not have support from their families. ""Many have been damaged, physical and mentally - this can help pay for private counselling or therapy as often public waiting lists for these services are so long."" Although she welcomes the announcement, Milly still has questions about how the payments will be rolled out: ""I'd like to see evidence that everyone in care will be entitled to it."" Every person leaving care at the age of 18 for the first 12 months of the pilot will be offered the chance to take part. They will receive payments for 24 months, amounting to an income worth Â£19,000 before tax annually, with the first payment a month after their 18th birthday. Officials say it is equivalent to thereal living wage,externaland will be taxed at thebasic rate,external. This video can not be played An experiment in Finland saw 2,000 people paid â¬560 (Â£490) a month, instead of their unemployment benefit. Laura Tams, 42, from Pontardawe, who has been fostering for six years, toldBBC Radio Walesadditional support was also needed for young people leaving care. ""These children have been through things that to you and I belong in nightmares. We cannot all of a sudden expect them at 18 to be able to run a house and to spend that money wisely."" Welsh officials are also promising extra support for those taking part, such as financial wellbeing training. There is no date for when the scheme will be launched, although officials said it was likely to be in the summer. Alex Sommerville, who was in care when she was younger, said she was concerned young people would not want to go into education or work Former youth worker Alex Sommerville, who left care when she was younger, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summersshe did not believe the scheme would encourage care leavers to find work, or study further. Ms Somerville, from Swansea, said: ""Some would still want to go for education or work, but there is a part of me thinking, if you're getting that wage every month, why would you?"" ""I'm very worried about giving young people all of that money and expecting them to know how to spend it in the best way for themselves."" Welsh Conservative spokesman for social partnership Joel James said trials had shown basic income failed to incentivise work and had proven to be a ""waste of public money"". Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman Luke Fletcher said it was a step in the right direction but needed a ""structure around it to enable it to meet the ambition of addressing poverty and unemployment, as well as improving health and financial wellbeing"". The income will be subject to tax UBI is where a government pays all individuals a set amount, regardless of their means. Backers say it could help reduce poverty and be easier and less stressful to navigate than more complex means-tested benefits, but opponents say it is extremely costly and not targeted at those who need it. Once it was announced that the pilot would focus on care leavers, critics argued it was not actually universal. The Welsh government had initially described it as a pilot of UBI, but has now stopped doing so. Asked why it was not a trial of UBI, Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt told BBC Wales that the government needed ""to be realistic"". and the pilot needed to be ""meaningful in terms of the funding"". A basic income for care leavers has been tried in Santa Clara, California, where 72 young adults received $1,000 (Â£739)initially for 12 months,external. In Finland, research on a basic income pilot with jobless people for two years found it did not lead them to find work,although they felt happier. The Welsh government plans were welcomed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity which researches poverty in the UK. To match the level of basic income for care leavers at about the real living wage is bold. With so many people in Wales paid only the national minimum wage there may well be those who think the offer to care leavers is over-generous. But in economic terms if the project is successful and results in better paid work and healthier lives, the long-term benefits would flow back into the economy. While this is not is a pilot of UBI, its outcomes will be relevant to the debate around that.

"Liam Wiggins has lived in a housing executive flat in the New Lodge area of Belfast for 12 years The rent freeze for Northern Ireland Housing Executive properties ""must be seen as a good thing"", a Belfast tenant says. Stormont's communities minister announced on Wednesday she was freezing rents for the coming 2022-23 financial year. Deirdre Hargey says it is to support residents during the ""cost-of-living crisis"". The Housing Executive manages about 85,000 homes in Northern Ireland. Liam Wiggins has lived in a housing executive flat in the New Lodge area of Belfast for 12 years. He said that with the cost of living generally becoming more expensive, any freeze should be welcomed. ""You go into the supermarket and small increases add up - a penny here, a penny there,"" he said. ""It might not be a big difference but it's not going up. ""If the Housing Executive rent was to go up by Â£10 a month even, to some people that's a massive difference - it's the difference between saying yes and no to something."" Mr Wiggins said while his rent was not too high, others in the area can pay up to Â£130 a week. ""That's nearly a mortgage,"" he said. ""Social housing was introduced to provide affordable housing. ""So for many this (rent freeze) is one less thing to worry about. It's a good thing."" Several utilities firms have announced large price increases in recent months, putting pressure on household finances. Deirdre Hargey said she wanted to support residents who were facing soaring fuel and household bills Somecompanies have increased gas and electricity tariffs for domestic customers several timesover the past year. The cost of food, petrol and other essentials has also gone up andover the course of 2021 inflation roseto 5.4%. Ms Hargey said she took the decision to prevent ""any further financial burden on individuals and families trying hard each day to make ends meet"". ""As communities minister my priority is to support people, particularly the most vulnerable, who are facing soaring fuel and household bills,"" she said. ""Right now, tenants need security and a freeze in their rents will provide a bit of stability on an important housing cost in an uncertain climate."" Heather Graham lives in a property in Bangor which is run by a housing association and will not benefit from the rent freeze. She says the announcement for housing executive tenants is ""unfair"" and feels other low-income households are being left out. ""I would prefer to be living in a Housing Executive house but unfortunately that (housing association) is what I got,"" Ms Graham said. ""A place in the Housing Executive is nearly half of what I pay and I still have to pay for the increase in heating costs and food. ""I also live on my own so I have to do it all with a low income."" Heather Graham says she lives alone and struggles with the cost of living due to rising fuel and electricity costs Ms Graham said people living in the private sector are also struggling with the cost of living. ""I'm just living and there's no spare money,"" she said. ""I'm paying an extra Â£10-20 for fuel, gas and electric than I normally would and then there's food shopping and food for my cat. ""I don't get help from the government and I wasn't eligible for the winter fuel payment after Christmas."" The Housing Executive is a non-departmental public body but it is subject to the overall direction and control of the minister for communities. The minister does not have control over independent social housing providers, but she has asked housing associations to consider the financial pressures tenants are facing when setting next year's rent.

"China's economy is increasingly state-led according to the Biden administration The US has accused China of causing ""serious harm"" to workers and firms around the world with its trade policies. The US Trade Representative accused Beijing of repeatedly failing to live up to trade commitments. It published its annual review of China's compliance with the deal that gave it membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Wednesday. China said it is a firm supporter of and important contributor to the WTO. How the West invited China to eat its lunch China's trade practices come under fire at WTO What is the World Trade Organization? The US report is the first since President Biden's appointee Katherine Tai took up office as the top US trade negotiator, and it lays out US concerns about China's trade policies. Many of the them are long-standing in Washington and are shared by both Democrats and Republicans. They include Beijing's subsidies for industries it deems important, restrictions on foreign companies' abilities to do business in China and lack of protection for intellectual property rights. China says it is ""building a socialist market economy"" that will allow market forces to determine resource allocation and allow the government to ""play a better role"". US Trade Representative Katherine Tai says China's trade practices are harming workers and businesses The report says,external: ""China's embrace of a state-led, non-market approach to the economy and trade has increased rather than decreased over time, and the mercantilism that it generates has harmed and disadvantaged US companies and workers, often severely."" It also points out that the US has won all 27 cases it has brought against China at the WTO, but ""meaningful reforms by China remain elusive"". The trade war which started under former President Donald Trump means that more than half of what the world's two biggest economies sell each other is subject to tariffs, or import taxes. Despite this, trade between the two countries soared to $657.4bn (Â£484bn) last year after struggling through the pandemic. That's less than $1.5bn short of the record set in 2018. The trade relationship between China and the US is arguably the most important bilateral relationship in the world. It matters to all of us, and it's not going well. The conclusion drawn in Washington that China is buying less from the US than it was five years ago, rather than $200bn more, shows how difficult it will be to make progress. And whether you look at bilateral trade ties, or at a multilateral trade forum like the WTO, relations between the two largest economies in the world are a little bit stuck. There's not much evidence that the tariffs have helped either side. Nor is there any great prospect that they will be removed any time soon. Equally, China's membership of the WTO has not really made it more like the West, and it has certainly had no impact on political freedoms. These are two very different economic systems and the rivalry between them will help define the 21st Century. Dennis Shea, who was the US Ambassador to the WTO during Donald Trump's presidency, told the BBC that failure to achieve lasting change was a driving force behind the trade deal the two sides agreed in 2020. ""We undertook the phase one trade deal to try to exact costs on the Chinese to get their attention and to try to move the needle that way."" He added: ""Interestingly, Ambassador Tai [and] the current administration is still trying to enforce the Phase One deal."" In that deal, the US reduced some tariffs and China pledged to boost US imports by $200bn above 2017 levels as well as strengthen intellectual property rules. Chinese government spokesman Mr Liu Pengyu said trade with the US was growing and that the phase one deal was benefitting the US and the rest of the world. He said any differences could be addressed through dialogue. ""China has been working on joint implementation despite the impact of Covid-19, global economic recession, supply chain disruptions as well as US government's continuous sanctions and suppression towards Chinese entities,"" he said. Former US Ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea says the US China trade deal aimed to make Beijing change its approach on trade China has bought none of those extra goodsaccording to research,externalby Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute of International Economics in Washington. While the pandemic hasn't helped, he points out that US farmers and manufacturers have struggled to produce enough goods for the target to be achieved. Mr Bown told the BBC: ""There is no sense in which US-China trade relations will improve anytime soon, but there is also no sense that they are on the verge of getting worse. ""Unlike President Trump, the Biden administration is not threatening a re-escalation of the trade war and imposition of new tariffs on billions of dollars of trade."" President Biden and President Xi held a virtual summit in November but achieved little on their trade differences The World Trade Organization remains an unlikely place for the two sides to resolve their differences. The main dispute resolution mechanism, the Appellate Body, has beenunable to functionsince December 2019 because the US has repeatedly blocked the appointment of new judges, partly over its treatment of China. EU escalates David vs Goliath trade row with China WTO chief: 'Months' needed to fix disputes body The USTR report says that new strategies are needed to deal with ""the many problems posed by China's state-led, non-market approach to the economy and trade, including solutions independent of the WTO"". Mr Shea said that the increase in Chinese exports to the US and the growing trade deficit it has caused is not just because of US consumers' appetite for cheap Chinese goods. Another commitment that China needs to fulfil is a move towards making its economy more dependent on consumer spending, he says. ""Part of the imbalance is the fact that China has not moved to a consumption-led economy. They're still export-led, production-led"". The Peterson Institute's Chad Bown says other countries are increasingly voicing similar concerns. The inaugural US-EU Trade and Technology Council meeting was held in Pittsburgh in September He said: ""That includes the European Union, as demonstrated through the US-EU Trade and Technology Council, as well as Japan, where the three have formed a 'trilateral' group to identify potential new rules that could address problems posed by economies dominated by state-owned enterprises and industrial subsidies"". Any improvement in US-China trade relations, says Mr Bown, ""will take time and will [probably] only result from negotiations between not just those two economies, but the other major players as well"".

"Google didn't detail how it plans to make apps more private Google's plan to limit data tracking on its Chrome browser has been extended to cover apps on its Android-based smartphones. Its so-called Privacy Sandbox project aims to curb the amount of user data that advertisers can gather. Rival Apple now forces app developers to ask permission from users before tracking them. The news will be a blow to firms like Meta, which rely on putting their code on apps to track consumer behaviour. Meta said this month that Apple's changes would cost it $10bn (Â£7.3bn) this year. Google's Android operating system is used by about 85% of smartphone owners worldwide. Third-party cookies, which use people's browsing history to target adverts, will be phased out on Google's Chrome browser by 2023. In a blog, Google said it was now extending what it calls its Privacy Sandbox to Android apps, and working on solutions that will limit sharing users' data and ""operate without cross app identifiers, including advertising ID"". These identifiers are tied to smartphones and are used by apps to collect information. Google said that it will keep them in place for at least two years, while it works ""with the industry"" on a new system. ""We're also exploring technologies that reduce the potential for covert data collection, including safer ways for apps to integrate with advertising SDK (software developer kits),"" it added. The tech giant did not detail how it plans to do this. Apple decided in April last year that app developers had to explicitly ask for permission from users to use IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers). Data from advertising company Flurry Analytics, and published by Apple, suggests that US users are choosing to opt out of tracking 96% of the time. Google's blog did not name Apple, but referred instead to ""other platforms"" which it said ""have taken a different approach to ads privacy, bluntly restricting existing technologies used by developers and advertisers"". ""We believe that - without first providing a privacy-preserving alternative path - such approaches can be ineffective,"" it added. Google, unlike Apple, relies on advertising revenue.

"The Environment Agency is advising households to protect themselves from possible flooding and urging people to stay away from the coast on Friday People in Cornwall are being urged to only travel ""if absolutely necessary"" this Friday as Storm Eunice is set to cause disruption. Cornwall Council, which issued the warning, said people across the county were ""being urged to take precautions"". Those living in flood-risk areas along the north coasts of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset have been told to prepare for possible flooding. People are advised to stay away from the coast. The Environment Agency said strong winds, large waves and tidal surges were likely to cause wave-overtopping and floods during high tide on Friday. Anamber weather warning for wind,externalis in place across most of England from 03:00 GMT until 21:00 on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Analysis: David Braine, Senior Weather Presenter, BBC South West Storm Eunice is unusual because it has not yet formed, and normally we can follow areas of low pressure across the Atlantic as they develop and give reasonable guidance as to the track and the intensity. The exact track and time of wind intensity is difficult to predict, but most of the computer models we use suggest that on Friday, between 09:00 to 12:00 GMT, there may well be damaging gusts close to 100mph (161km/h) along the north coasts of Devon and Cornwall. The last time we had such strength of wind was in February 2014, when theDawlish railway line was washed away. This may well be stronger, but the winds being westerly means that the risk to Dawlish is small. Whilst there is still some uncertainty in the track of Eunice, there is an increasing likelihood of widespread inland wind gusts of 60 to 70mph, (97km/h to 113km/h) and up to 80mph (129km/h) in a few places. Winds are expected to ease across western areas through Friday afternoon and eastern areas during the evening. Cornwall Council said: ""Residents are urged to pay close attention to the weather forecast over the next two days and are urged to only travel on Friday if absolutely necessary. ""People are urged to stay back from cliffs and seafronts due to the danger of large waves."" Devon County Council said it was also advising people totake extra care when travelling on Friday morning,external, because of possibilities of flying debris, fallen trees, damage to buildings and homes, roofs blown off and power lines brought down. High winds might also result in temporary bridge closures, including the Taw Bridge in Barnstaple, it said. Katharine Smith, Environment Agency flood duty manager, said: ""Strong winds could bring coastal flooding to parts of the west, south-west and south coast of England, as well as the tidal River Severn, through the early hours of Friday morning and into the early afternoon. ""Environment Agency teams are out on the ground closing gates, erecting barriers and clearing screens where flood debris can build up, and stand ready to operate further flood defences if needed. ""We urge people to stay safe on the coast and warn wave watchers against the unnecessary danger of taking 'storm selfies'. Coastguards said boat owners should make sure their vessels were properly secured to moorings. Paddy Cochrane, from Falmouth Coastguard, told BBC Radio Cornwall: ""We would hope that boat owners, anybody who is out on moorings this time of the year, go out, double check your lines, make sure that all your moorings are properly secured, chain-to-chain rather than rope-to-chain if you can, or double up on your ropes. ""Just ensure that if you live on the coast that everything's battened down because we're going to get a fair old blow come through."" Windy weather this week has already affected events and facilities. In Cornwall, Truro Farmers' Market on Wednesday was postponed ahead of the storm, and the Jubilee Pool in Penzance announced it was closing until next Wednesday.

"The cost of living hit a fresh 30-year high last month as energy, fuel and food prices continued to soar and retailers reined in seasonal discounts. Prices surged by 5.5% in the 12 months to January, up from 5.4% in December, increasing the squeeze on household budgets. Inflation is now rising faster than wages and is expected to climb above 7% this year. The government said it was taking action but Labour urged it to do more. Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. If the cost of a bottle of milk was Â£1 and then rises by 5p, milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? Since pandemic restrictions were eased last year, companies have faced higher wage, shipping and energy costs which they have passed on to customers. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said electricity bills were up 19% in the year to January and gas bills up by 28%. Housing costs have also been rising, while the ONS said retailers offered fewer sales and discounts in the New Year, compared to the steeper discounts seen last January. ""Clothing and footwear pushed inflation up this month and although there were still the traditional price drops, it was the smallest January fall since 1990, with fewer sales than last year,"" ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said. The cost of household staples is also rising, with pasta prices up 15%, cooking oil up 16% and margarine soaring 37% in the year to January, squeezing household budgets. Worst to come for food price rises - Tesco Cost of pasta and tomatoes jump as shop prices rise UK wage growth lags rising cost of living On Wednesday,Heineken became the latest big firm to warn it was putting up pricesfollowing Marmite-maker Unilever, bakers Greggs and the supermarket Tesco. Bestway Wholesale, which owns the convenience store chains Costcutter and Bargain Booze, said rising costs ""absolutely"" meant the firm would cut its range of 25,000 low cost products. ""Obviously we're working very hard to push down costs and be as efficient as possible, but it's going to be difficult,"" managing director Dawood Pervez told the BBC. Inflation - which has been at a 30-year high since December - is set to get worse in April when the energy price cap is lifted. It will push up the average household fuel bill up by Â£693 a year in England, Scotland and Wales, while a planned rise in National Insurance will also hit people's pockets. It's worth recalling, as many older readers will, that although the highest inflation in nearly 30 years sounds scary, it's partly because the last three decades have seen one of the least scary periods for rises in consumer prices - certainly compared to the 30 years prior to that. The Bank of England has already put up interest rates twice since December in a bid to tame inflation and could raise them again to 0.75% soon. True, that will be the highest in 13 years. But that's only because 13 years ago, the Bank dropped rates to what were supposed to be emergency lows lasting only a few months due to the financial crisis. It's largely because growth in productivity (and therefore pay and living standards) has been so historically weak for the last 13 years, that the decision-makers on its Monetary policy Committee have only just got up the gumption, in the inflationary storm of the last two months, to start raising them again. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday the government understood the pressures families faced and was taking action. ""We recently stepped in to provide millions of households with up to Â£350 to help with rising energy bills,"" he said. ""We're also helping people on the lowest incomes keep more of what they earn by cutting the Universal Credit taper rate, and freezing alcohol and fuel duties to keep costs down."" But Pat McFadden, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government needed to do more. Last week the Bank of England put up interest rates to 0.5% from 0.25% in a bid to tame inflation. Some analysts believe the Bank - which aims to keep inflation at 2% - will take a more aggressive approach to rate hikes this year and next given the economic picture. But Willem Sels, from HSBC Private Banking and Wealth, predicted it would tread carefully ""as it knows that the factors behind inflation are also the drivers behind lower real income, which threaten to limit economic growth"". ""We expect the Bank rate to rise to 1.25%, lower than the markets' expectation of around 1.75%,"" he said.

"Mr Graham told the inquiry his wrongful conviction made his life feel worthless. A former Post Office branch manager has described the ""hell"" of when he was wrongly charged and convicted of stealing Â£65,000. William Graham worked his way up through the Post Office over years, having started there as a trainee. Speaking to an inquiry on Wednesday, he said he used to be ""the life and soul of the party"". He eventually became a Post Office manager in Sevenoaks, but was convicted of false accounting in 2011. A new IT system, installed at post offices across the country, was to blame for accounting errors at hundreds of different locations. Initially, Mr Graham said the discrepancies were small and he often topped up the balance himself. ""It was a case of taking money out of my wallet and putting it into the Post Office,"" he said, adding that soon he couldn't afford it, with the shortfall on one day showing up as Â£5,000. 'I want someone else jailed like I was' Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Postmistress: Post Office scandal 'ruined my life' Mr Graham was later given a 32-week suspended prison sentence after shortfalls of Â£65,000 were incorrectly identified. ""When they said the 32 weeks in prison, the gap before they said it was suspended - I could hear my wife scream,"" Mr Graham said. Between 2000 and 2014, more than 700 subpostmasters and mistresses were accused of theft, fraud and false accounting in the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. A total of 72 have had their names cleared so far. The inquiry - which is expected to run for the rest of this year - will look at whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system, called Horizon, and will also ask how staff were left to shoulder the blame. The software was developed by Japanese company Fujitsu. Visibly emotional, Mr Graham told the inquiry on Wednesday he was later diagnosed with depression and says he felt ""worthless"", not being able to provide for his family. Like other victims, he told the inquiry of the difficulty in finding a job after the charge. 72 sub-postmasters and mistresses celebrated the quashing of their convictions last April He was forced to take unpaid work in a charity shop, then asked to take a job in retailer ""Build a Bear"". His debt increased and the family home was threatened with repossession. He says he now hopes for some compensation from the Post Office, as well as further information. ""I want them to find out what went wrong, what caused the problems with the system... Surely they've got to come forward and tell us what went wrong? ""I've gone through far less than a lot of people... But for all of us, you want some sort of justice."" The Post Office has previously said it is ""sincerely sorry for the impact of the Horizon scandal on the lives of victims and their families and we are in no doubt about the human cost"". ""In addressing the past, our first priority is that full, fair and final compensation is provided and we are making good progress,"" it added. Gillian Howard ran the New Mill Post Office in West Yorkshire, taking up the role of subpostmistress after her husband suffered a stroke and had to step down. She received no training on Horizon, and eventually received a six-month community sentence order after pleading guilty to one count of fraud after incorrect shortfalls showed up. Her conviction was overturned last April, but she said on Wednesday the scandal meant she had ""become a recluse"". ""It's been horrendous,"" she said of the emotional impact on herself and her family. She received the letter notifying her of her prosecution on the morning of her daughter's wedding, just before the family were about to leave for the church. ""My husband always promised our daughter would always have the wedding of her dreams... It was the worst day of my life."" Another former subpostmaster wrongly convicted in the scandal told the inquiry on Wednesday that he wants to see ""someone go to prison"". Harjinder Butoy's conviction wasoverturned last April, after he spent years in prison for a crime he did not commit. Harjinder Butoy's conviction was overturned in April 2021 after he spent years in prison. ""My life got torn apart,"" Mr Butoy said. The inquiry heard he had to declare bankruptcy and move his family for fear of their safety after his imprisonment. Mr Butoy and his wife ran the post office in the Nottinghamshire market town of Sutton-in-Ashfield for five years. ""I actually enjoyed working there on the shop side. My wife and I bought it as a run-down business and did it up and had a good relationship with the public."" But he described problems with accounts cropping up as early as his first week in the role. ""There were discrepancies every week,"" he said, beginning at Â£5 or Â£10. He says he used to keep money on the side to make up any short-falls, but once they escalated to Â£100 or Â£200, he asked for help but got ""no interest"" from the helpdesk he contacted. Mr Butoy and his wife did not suspect anything was wrong when auditors turned up to check on the accounts. They had passed another audit the week before with no issues. But Mr Butoy was arrested, charged and sent to jail for stealing Â£208,000. He described feeling ""ashamed"", being led out of his Post Office in front of customers. Mr Butoy also lost more than six stone during his time in prison, due to the immense stress he was under. Led by retired High Court judge Sir Wyn Williams, the inquiry is beginning with six weeks of testimony from former Post Office staff, describing the devastating impact the false accusations have had on them and their families. The inquiry will also examine whether staff at software firm Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon software to complete tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking, knew the system had flaws while data from it was used in court to convict sub-postmasters.

"Google didn't detail how it plans to make apps more private Google's plan to limit data tracking on its Chrome browser has been extended to cover apps on its Android-based smartphones. Its so-called Privacy Sandbox project aims to curb the amount of user data that advertisers can gather. Rival Apple now forces app developers to ask permission from users before tracking them. The news will be a blow to firms like Meta, which rely on putting their code on apps to track consumer behaviour. Meta said this month that Apple's changes would cost it $10bn (Â£7.3bn) this year. Google's Android operating system is used by about 85% of smartphone owners worldwide. Third-party cookies, which use people's browsing history to target adverts, will be phased out on Google's Chrome browser by 2023. In a blog, Google said it was now extending what it calls its Privacy Sandbox to Android apps, and working on solutions that will limit sharing users' data and ""operate without cross app identifiers, including advertising ID"". These identifiers are tied to smartphones and are used by apps to collect information. Google said that it will keep them in place for at least two years, while it works ""with the industry"" on a new system. ""We're also exploring technologies that reduce the potential for covert data collection, including safer ways for apps to integrate with advertising SDK (software developer kits),"" it added. The tech giant did not detail how it plans to do this. Apple decided in April last year that app developers had to explicitly ask for permission from users to use IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers). Data from advertising company Flurry Analytics, and published by Apple, suggests that US users are choosing to opt out of tracking 96% of the time. Google's blog did not name Apple, but referred instead to ""other platforms"" which it said ""have taken a different approach to ads privacy, bluntly restricting existing technologies used by developers and advertisers"".

"A BBC investigation has found that women's intimate pictures are being shared to harass, shame and blackmail them on a massive scale, on the social media app Telegram. WARNING: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS CONTENT OF A SEXUAL NATURE In the split second Sara found out a nude photo of her had been leaked and shared on Telegram, her life changed. Her Instagram and Facebook profiles had been added, and her phone number included. Suddenly she was being contacted by unknown men asking for more pictures. ""They made me feel like I was a prostitute because [they believed] I'd shared intimate pictures of myself. It meant I had no value as a woman,"" she says. Sara stopped going out after her images were shared on Telegram Sara, not her real name, had shared the photo with one person, but it had ended up in a Telegram group with 18,000 followers, many from her neighbourhood in Havana, Cuba. She now fears strangers in the street may have seen her naked. ""I didn't want to go out, I didn't want to have any contact with my friends. The truth is that I suffered a lot."" She's not alone. After months of investigating Telegram, we found large groups and channels sharing thousands of secretly filmed, stolen or leaked images of women in at least 20 countries. And there's little evidence the platform is tackling this problem. Thousands of miles from Cuba, Nigar is having to adjust to a new life. Nigar says she has been forced to leave her country She's from Azerbaijan, but says she has been forced to leave her homeland. In 2021, a video of her having sex with her husband was sent to her family, and then posted in a Telegram group. ""My mum started crying and told me: 'There's a video, it was sent to me',"" she says. ""I was devastated, absolutely devastated."" The video was shared in a group with 40,000 members. In the footage, Nigar's now ex-husband's face is blurred but hers is clearly visible. She believes her ex secretly filmed her to blackmail her brother, a prominent critic of Azerbaijan's president. She says her mother was told the video would be released on Telegram unless her brother stopped his activism. ""They look at you as if you are a disgrace. Who cares if you were married?"" says Nigar. Nigar says she confronted her ex-husband about the video and he denied making it. We tried to get a comment from him, but he didn't reply. Nigar is still struggling to move on with her life: ""I can't recover. I see therapists twice a week,"" she says. ""They say there is no progress so far. They ask if I can forget it, and I say no."" The pictures of Nigar and Sara were both reported to Telegram, but the platform did not respond. Their experience is far from unique. The BBC has been monitoring 18 Telegram channels and 24 groups in countries ranging from Russia to Brazil, and Kenya to Malaysia. The total number of subscribers is nearly two million. Watch our investigation on YouTube:Telegram: Why won't you take my nudes down?,external Personal details like home addresses and parents' phone numbers were posted alongside explicit pictures. We saw group administrators asking members to send intimate images of ex-partners, colleagues or fellow-students to an automated account, so they could be published without revealing the identity of the sender. Telegram now says it has more than half a billion active users worldwide - that's more than Twitter - with many attracted by its emphasis on privacy. WhatsApp users flock to rival message platforms 'They wanted to tie me and my child to a horse' Revenge porn: What to do if you're a victim Millions moved to Telegram in January 2021 from WhatsApp, which changed its privacy terms. Telegram has long been popular with pro-democracy protesters in countries with media censorship. Users can post without sharing their name or phone number, and create public or private groups with up to 200,000 members, or channels which can broadcast to an unlimited number of people. Telegram was used to organise mass anti-government protests in Belarus Despite Telegram's reputation for privacy, only the ""secret chat"" option provides end-to-end encryption, which ensures just the two people talking can see the message. It's the default setting on secure chat apps like Signal and WhatsApp. This video can not be played What's behind Telegram's growing popularity? The platform also attracts users seeking a less regulated space, including those who have been banned from other platforms. ""According to Telegram and its owner, they don't want to censor users,"" says Natalia Krapiva, tech legal counsel at digital rights group Access Now. But our research has shown this light-touch approach to moderation has led Telegram to become a haven for the leaking and sharing of intimate images. Telegram does not have a dedicated policy to tackle the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, but its terms of service make users agree ""not to post illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels, bots, etc"". It also has an in-app reporting feature across both public and private groups, and channels where users can report pornography. To test how rigorously Telegram enforced its policies, we found and reported 100 images as pornography via the in-app reporting feature. One month later, 96 remained accessible. We could not locate four others, as they were in groups which we could no longer access. Disturbingly, while we were investigating these groups, an account from Russia also tried to sell us a folder containing child abuse videos for less than the price of a coffee. We reported it to Telegram and the Metropolitan Police, but two months later the post and the channel were still there. The account was only removed after we contacted the Telegram media team. Despite its lenient moderation, Telegram does take action against certain content. AfterApple briefly removed Telegram from its app storebecause of videos like the ones we were offered, Telegram took a more proactive stance on child abuse images. The platform alsoco-operated with EU crime agency Europol in 2019to eliminate a huge amount of Islamic State content that had proliferated on the platform. ""We know that Telegram can remove and [has] been removing terrorist-related content or some kind of very radical political content,"" says Dr Aliaksandr Herasimenka, researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. Members of far-right groups moved to Telegram But the removal of intimate images appears not to be a priority. We spoke to five Telegram content moderators on condition of anonymity. They told us they receive reports from users via an automated system, which they said they sort into ""spam"" and ""not spam"". They said they don't proactively search for intimate images and, as far as they know, Telegram doesn't use artificial intelligence to do that either. This lack of action has led some women to take steps themselves. Joanna reported images that were shared without consent in Telegram Joanna found a naked image of herself from when she was 13 years old in a notorious Malaysian Telegram group.

"Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance has not seen any de-escalation of Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders Following a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, he says the security threat from Russia represents a ""new normal"" for Europe ""This is the biggest concentration in forces in Europe since the Cold War,"" he says It comes after Russia said it was pulling back more troops - this time from the Crimean peninsula A series of cyber attacks on Tuesday knocked out the websites of Ukraine's defence ministry and two banks Ukraine has been marking a day of unity after earlier US reports suggested Russia could attack today Edited by Becky Morton That's all from today's live page team - thanks for following our coverage. The writers were Sam Cabral, Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea, Jennifer Meierhans, Alice Cuddy and David Molloy. The editor was Becky Morton. This video can not be played Watch: We don't see any Russian troop withdrawal, President Zelensky says We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly but before we finish, here's a quick recap of the major developments today: Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent This was a bleak
forecast for the future from Nato's secretary general. Jens Stoltenberg
described it as the most serious security crisis in Europe since the end of the
Cold War. And he made clear that the threat hasn't gone away. Stoltenberg said he'd seen no evidence that Russia had withdrawn forces from
the border with Ukraine and warned that Russia had maintained a massive
military force which was ready to attack. Even if President Putin doesn't give
that order, there are still signs this crises will cast a much
longer shadow. Stoltenberg said Russia's military build-up showed Moscow is prepared to contest European security with the use of
force. ""I regret to say it's the new normal,"" he said. That ""new
normal"" could also mean Nato increasing its military posture. Stoltenberg has tasked Nato military planners to look at setting up new
battlegroups on the alliance's Eastern flank - in Romania and the Black Sea
region. No final decision has yet been taken and Nato insists reinforcements
would only be sent to act as a deterrent. Nato is still calling on Russia
to engage in dialogue to reduce tensions. But if diplomacy doesn't work the
danger is both sides will end up with their armies doing the talking. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinese social media users are gripped by an unusual spat
between the UK and Russia, after a post was made on the UK Prime
Ministerâs official Sina Weibo account - Chinaâs answer to Twitter. The official Downing Street account, which has more than one
million followers, sent a message, in Chinese, to Russia's Vladimir Putin stating the Russian government ""should avoid
doing what would be a disastrous mistake for the country"". President Putin does not have an account on the platform. However, the Russian Embassy in China has responded to the post, calling it ""another
example of the Westâs 'information warfare' against Russia"". It added that the No 10 post ""was designed to fuel hysteria that it has manipulated
around the so-called âimminent Russian invasion of Ukraine'"". It is rare for foreign leaders to have official accounts on Weibo It is rare for foreign leaders or domestic officials to have accounts on Weibo. Chinaâs media environment is heavily state-controlled, meaning platforms such as Weibo are generally not used for political statements. The typical response to the post from users accuses the UK, like the US, of trying to stoke friction between Russia and the Ukraine. China is one of Russiaâs closest allies; media in China have sought to play down the suggestion of an imminent war. Instead, outlets have consistently claimed the US and British media have sought to inflame the situation to serve their respective government interests. Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian Maria says she stayed up at night listening for signs of trouble Will Russia withdraw or not? Thatâs the question many Ukrainians are asking today. Reports from US intelligence had suggested Moscow could launch an attack overnight - but this did not happen. âWhen my son woke me up around 03:00, I stayed anxious and alert for some time trying to hear something in the night,â says 29-year-old Maria Shtogryn, a mother of a toddler from Odesa. âWhen nothing happened tonight, I felt relievedâ. Ukrainians argue over whether the Russian invasion threat is real â in January 48% believed it was, and 39% thought it wasnât. But more than half - 56.5% - agree that Ukraineâs military and diplomatic efforts to prevent it aren't enough. Maria says sheâd like to see some defence reinforcements in place on the Black Sea beach where she strolls with her baby every day. For her, the danger of attack from the water is unsettling. While it might sound unlikely, the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine have had an impact on the Eurovision Song Contest, after Ukraine's candidate for this year's competition pulled out. Alina Pash had won a TV show to represent her country at the event, but she has nowwithdrawn from the process, with ""a heavy heart"". Ukraine's national broadcaster had already put her confirmation asthe country's act on hold, while an investigation was being carried out into a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. The 28-year-old says some people have attacked her online and called her un-Ukrainian for the visit. In an Instagram post,external, she writes: ""I am a Ukrainian citizen. I follow Ukrainian law and try to bring Ukraine's traditions and values into the world."" Visiting Crimea can be frowned upon and there are strict rules in place over how people travel to the region, with Ukrainians and foreigners only allowed to travel there through official land checkpoints. It's illegal under Ukrainian law to travel to Crimea via Russia. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that is under scrutiny. Soldiers take part in a battlegroup training exercise in Estonia, October 2020 Nato commanders have been told to go away and figure out how to deploy new battlegroups in the south-east of Europe. But what are they? Battlegroups are ""combat-ready"" military groups made up of forces from different Nato countries working together. They include artillery, tanks, and infantry, among other specialised skills. They're what Nato calls an ""enhanced forward presence"" in response to Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 - and amount to ""the biggest reinforcement of alliance collective defence in a generation"". There are four at the moment, based in: Three of those nations border Russia, while Poland is just one country away (and borders Ukraine). They are among the pain points when Russia complains of US and other foreign troops near its border. PrivatBank was among those targeted in the cyber-attack Officials in Ukraine are saying that cyber-attacks, which began yesterday, are likely the worst the country has ever seen. At least 10 major Ukrainian websites were unreachable due to the attacks, including the defence, foreign and culture ministries and Ukraineâs two largest state banks. The attack was planned in advance, is ongoing and is being performed from several countries, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov said at a briefing in Kyiv. The cost of the breach - through what is known as distributed denial-of-service or DDoS attacks - is now estimated to be in the millions of dollars. Ihor Konovalov, from the National Bank of
Ukraine, said the two banks that were targeted were ""fully prepared"" and had recovered control of their accounts without any funds being stolen. Several Ukrainian officials have blamed Russia for
the attack. They said its goal was to spread panic and instability. Moscow has denied involvement. Caroline DaviesBBC News, Moscow Before the Nato news conference Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry official, said that Moscow was preparing a fresh response to send to the US as the two countries continue a back-and-forth over the country's security demands. Russia issued demands to Nato and the US back in December which included a guarantee that Nato would not expand closer to Russiaâs borders. Late last month, the US complied with Russiaâs request that they write a written response to these demands. We asked Zakharova whether there were areas for negotiation given that Nato was not willing to abandon its open-door policy. âWe would like both sides to hear each other, not lecture each other or to make empty statements,â she replied. âWe will orientate ourselves on a serious conversation if our Western partners are ready for that.â Zakharova repeatedly criticised âAnglo-Saxon aggression, politics and rhetoricâ, blaming this for escalating the crisis in Ukraine. She also dismissed Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg as ânot the kind of person whose words can be seen in Moscow as serious argumentsâ. This video can not be played Watch: We do not see any signs of de-escalation on the ground, says Nato chief A little while earlier we heard from Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. Here are the main lines from his news conference: Caroline DaviesBBC Moscow correspondent Russia would consistently say that it doesn't see Nato as a defensive force, it sees it as one which is a threat to Russia. This has been the key security question that Russia has wanted an answer to and one of their big concerns is that the don't want Nato to expand any further. So the fact that there might be more troops, more feet on the ground in Nato countries, would be seen by Russia as going in the opposite direction to what Russia wants. There is of course no Kremlin response to Jens Stoltenberg's comments yet but it will be interesting to see what they say. Stoltenberg says there will be a ""high price"" if Russia uses force, saying sanctions will be imposed and that Ukraine is better trained and better equipped than when Russia annexed the Crimea in 2014. He says that even if we see a gradual development where Russia decides not to use force ""the fact that they would be willing to amass all these troops and combine that with a message that they are threatening an independent country"" - that in itself is serious. He says that is why Nato will have to consider some longer term adjustments in its posture in the East. No final decision has been made, but he says Romania is willing to host a battlegroup which France is willing to lead. And with that final question the news conference finishes. Asked again about the reported withdrawal of Russian troops Jens Stoltenberg says that Nato has been ""very transparent"" and says the information it has been sharing can be confirmed from open sources - including commercial satellites. ""I think it is very hard to dispute that Russia has amassed well over 100,000 troops and a lot of heavy equipment,"" he says. Stoltenberg adds that this is what Nato predicted several months ago and it has happened despite Russia denying that was the plan. Stoltenberg says there is ""cautious optimism"" that Russia is willing to engage in diplomatic efforts. ""While we think this is something we should take seriously... what we see on the ground is no withdrawal of troops, forces, or equipment,"" Stoltenberg says. Coupled with a cyber-attack on Ukraine which some are linking to Russia, he says ""these are the kind of actions and measures that we expect will come in advance of a bigger military intervention"". Stoltenberg is asked if sending in additional battle groups to the East will antagonise Russia. The secretary general insists Nato is working on a ""defensive"" basis - and has been clear the alliance is ready to sit down with Russia and address issues such as arms control. He says the best way to move forward is ""to engage in good faith"" and talk. It is possible to engage with Russia, he says, adding: ""We are not a threat, we are ready for dialogue."" But he cautions that the ""massive troop build-up"" combined with ""threatening rhetoric"" alongside Russia's track record must be taken seriously. ""That's why in a defensive way we are increasing our presence in the East,"" he adds. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale asks about new battle-groups and what Stoltenberg means by the ""new normal"". He says the new normal is for Russia to test the principles which underpin European security and says they have used force to try to intimidate other countries in Europe to accept the Russian demands. He says it is violating core principles which have been important for decades. ""Russia has demonstrated will to use force to try to coerce other countries and to try to change some fundamental principles that are important for our shared security,"" he says. He adds this is why it is important to consider long-term adjustments of Nato's posture in the east. Stoltenberg says Nato will look at establishing new battle groups in central and south-east regions within the alliance - such as Romania - as part of the defensive strategy against Russian aggression. He says military commanders will work on details and report back in weeks and there will be ongoing discussion on how Nato's defence can remain strong. An additional $270bn has been spent on Nato defence since 2014 by European allies and Canada, the secretary general adds. ""There are signs from Russia that diplomacy should continue but so far we do not see any sign of de-escalation on the ground,"" says Stoltenberg. ""No withdrawl of troops or equipment."" ""This may of course change. But for now Russian maintains a massive invasion force ready to attack with high capabilities from Crimea to Belarus,"" he says. ""This is the biggest concentration in forces in Europe since the Cold War."" Stoltenberg says Nato is not a threat to Russia and the steps it is taking are ""defensive"". He says that we don't know what will happen in Ukraine but we already know there is a crisis in security in Europe. Moscow has made it clear it is prepared to test the fundamental principles which have underpinned European security by using force, he says, adding this is the ""new normal in Europe"". Jens Stoltenberg repeats that it is not too late for Russia to step back from the brink of conflict. He says that Nato has sent concrete proposals on paper to Russia on transparency and arms control. Nato will not compromise on its core principles, he says. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.5658667
"A BBC investigation has found that women's intimate pictures are being shared to harass, shame and blackmail them on a massive scale, on the social media app Telegram. WARNING: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS CONTENT OF A SEXUAL NATURE In the split second Sara found out a nude photo of her had been leaked and shared on Telegram, her life changed. Her Instagram and Facebook profiles had been added, and her phone number included. Suddenly she was being contacted by unknown men asking for more pictures. ""They made me feel like I was a prostitute because [they believed] I'd shared intimate pictures of myself. It meant I had no value as a woman,"" she says. Sara stopped going out after her images were shared on Telegram Sara, not her real name, had shared the photo with one person, but it had ended up in a Telegram group with 18,000 followers, many from her neighbourhood in Havana, Cuba. She now fears strangers in the street may have seen her naked. ""I didn't want to go out, I didn't want to have any contact with my friends. The truth is that I suffered a lot."" She's not alone. After months of investigating Telegram, we found large groups and channels sharing thousands of secretly filmed, stolen or leaked images of women in at least 20 countries. And there's little evidence the platform is tackling this problem. Thousands of miles from Cuba, Nigar is having to adjust to a new life. Nigar says she has been forced to leave her country She's from Azerbaijan, but says she has been forced to leave her homeland. In 2021, a video of her having sex with her husband was sent to her family, and then posted in a Telegram group. ""My mum started crying and told me: 'There's a video, it was sent to me',"" she says. ""I was devastated, absolutely devastated."" The video was shared in a group with 40,000 members. In the footage, Nigar's now ex-husband's face is blurred but hers is clearly visible. She believes her ex secretly filmed her to blackmail her brother, a prominent critic of Azerbaijan's president. She says her mother was told the video would be released on Telegram unless her brother stopped his activism. ""They look at you as if you are a disgrace. Who cares if you were married?"" says Nigar. Nigar says she confronted her ex-husband about the video and he denied making it. We tried to get a comment from him, but he didn't reply. Nigar is still struggling to move on with her life: ""I can't recover. I see therapists twice a week,"" she says. ""They say there is no progress so far. They ask if I can forget it, and I say no."" The pictures of Nigar and Sara were both reported to Telegram, but the platform did not respond. Their experience is far from unique. The BBC has been monitoring 18 Telegram channels and 24 groups in countries ranging from Russia to Brazil, and Kenya to Malaysia. The total number of subscribers is nearly two million. Watch our investigation on YouTube:Telegram: Why won't you take my nudes down?,external Personal details like home addresses and parents' phone numbers were posted alongside explicit pictures. We saw group administrators asking members to send intimate images of ex-partners, colleagues or fellow-students to an automated account, so they could be published without revealing the identity of the sender. Telegram now says it has more than half a billion active users worldwide - that's more than Twitter - with many attracted by its emphasis on privacy. WhatsApp users flock to rival message platforms 'They wanted to tie me and my child to a horse' Revenge porn: What to do if you're a victim Millions moved to Telegram in January 2021 from WhatsApp, which changed its privacy terms. Telegram has long been popular with pro-democracy protesters in countries with media censorship. Users can post without sharing their name or phone number, and create public or private groups with up to 200,000 members, or channels which can broadcast to an unlimited number of people. Telegram was used to organise mass anti-government protests in Belarus Despite Telegram's reputation for privacy, only the ""secret chat"" option provides end-to-end encryption, which ensures just the two people talking can see the message. It's the default setting on secure chat apps like Signal and WhatsApp. This video can not be played What's behind Telegram's growing popularity? The platform also attracts users seeking a less regulated space, including those who have been banned from other platforms. ""According to Telegram and its owner, they don't want to censor users,"" says Natalia Krapiva, tech legal counsel at digital rights group Access Now. But our research has shown this light-touch approach to moderation has led Telegram to become a haven for the leaking and sharing of intimate images. Telegram does not have a dedicated policy to tackle the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, but its terms of service make users agree ""not to post illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels, bots, etc"". It also has an in-app reporting feature across both public and private groups, and channels where users can report pornography. To test how rigorously Telegram enforced its policies, we found and reported 100 images as pornography via the in-app reporting feature. One month later, 96 remained accessible. We could not locate four others, as they were in groups which we could no longer access. Disturbingly, while we were investigating these groups, an account from Russia also tried to sell us a folder containing child abuse videos for less than the price of a coffee. We reported it to Telegram and the Metropolitan Police, but two months later the post and the channel were still there. The account was only removed after we contacted the Telegram media team. Despite its lenient moderation, Telegram does take action against certain content. AfterApple briefly removed Telegram from its app storebecause of videos like the ones we were offered, Telegram took a more proactive stance on child abuse images. The platform alsoco-operated with EU crime agency Europol in 2019to eliminate a huge amount of Islamic State content that had proliferated on the platform. ""We know that Telegram can remove and [has] been removing terrorist-related content or some kind of very radical political content,"" says Dr Aliaksandr Herasimenka, researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. Members of far-right groups moved to Telegram But the removal of intimate images appears not to be a priority. We spoke to five Telegram content moderators on condition of anonymity. They told us they receive reports from users via an automated system, which they said they sort into ""spam"" and ""not spam"". They said they don't proactively search for intimate images and, as far as they know, Telegram doesn't use artificial intelligence to do that either. This lack of action has led some women to take steps themselves. Joanna reported images that were shared without consent in Telegram Joanna found a naked image of herself from when she was 13 years old in a notorious Malaysian Telegram group. She created a fake Telegram profile to join the group, where she anonymously searched for nude pictures and reported them. She also shared her findings with her friends.

"Mr Graham told the inquiry his wrongful conviction made his life feel worthless. A former Post Office branch manager has described the ""hell"" of when he was wrongly charged and convicted of stealing Â£65,000. William Graham worked his way up through the Post Office over years, having started there as a trainee. Speaking to an inquiry on Wednesday, he said he used to be ""the life and soul of the party"". He eventually became a Post Office manager in Sevenoaks, but was convicted of false accounting in 2011. A new IT system, installed at post offices across the country, was to blame for accounting errors at hundreds of different locations. Initially, Mr Graham said the discrepancies were small and he often topped up the balance himself. ""It was a case of taking money out of my wallet and putting it into the Post Office,"" he said, adding that soon he couldn't afford it, with the shortfall on one day showing up as Â£5,000. 'I want someone else jailed like I was' Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Postmistress: Post Office scandal 'ruined my life' Mr Graham was later given a 32-week suspended prison sentence after shortfalls of Â£65,000 were incorrectly identified. ""When they said the 32 weeks in prison, the gap before they said it was suspended - I could hear my wife scream,"" Mr Graham said. Between 2000 and 2014, more than 700 subpostmasters and mistresses were accused of theft, fraud and false accounting in the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. A total of 72 have had their names cleared so far. The inquiry - which is expected to run for the rest of this year - will look at whether the Post Office knew about faults in the IT system, called Horizon, and will also ask how staff were left to shoulder the blame. The software was developed by Japanese company Fujitsu. Visibly emotional, Mr Graham told the inquiry on Wednesday he was later diagnosed with depression and says he felt ""worthless"", not being able to provide for his family. Like other victims, he told the inquiry of the difficulty in finding a job after the charge. 72 sub-postmasters and mistresses celebrated the quashing of their convictions last April He was forced to take unpaid work in a charity shop, then asked to take a job in retailer ""Build a Bear"". His debt increased and the family home was threatened with repossession. He says he now hopes for some compensation from the Post Office, as well as further information. ""I want them to find out what went wrong, what caused the problems with the system... Surely they've got to come forward and tell us what went wrong? ""I've gone through far less than a lot of people... But for all of us, you want some sort of justice."" The Post Office has previously said it is ""sincerely sorry for the impact of the Horizon scandal on the lives of victims and their families and we are in no doubt about the human cost"". ""In addressing the past, our first priority is that full, fair and final compensation is provided and we are making good progress,"" it added. Gillian Howard ran the New Mill Post Office in West Yorkshire, taking up the role of subpostmistress after her husband suffered a stroke and had to step down. She received no training on Horizon, and eventually received a six-month community sentence order after pleading guilty to one count of fraud after incorrect shortfalls showed up. Her conviction was overturned last April, but she said on Wednesday the scandal meant she had ""become a recluse"". ""It's been horrendous,"" she said of the emotional impact on herself and her family. She received the letter notifying her of her prosecution on the morning of her daughter's wedding, just before the family were about to leave for the church. ""My husband always promised our daughter would always have the wedding of her dreams... It was the worst day of my life."" Another former subpostmaster wrongly convicted in the scandal told the inquiry on Wednesday that he wants to see ""someone go to prison"". Harjinder Butoy's conviction wasoverturned last April, after he spent years in prison for a crime he did not commit. Harjinder Butoy's conviction was overturned in April 2021 after he spent years in prison. ""My life got torn apart,"" Mr Butoy said. The inquiry heard he had to declare bankruptcy and move his family for fear of their safety after his imprisonment. Mr Butoy and his wife ran the post office in the Nottinghamshire market town of Sutton-in-Ashfield for five years. ""I actually enjoyed working there on the shop side. My wife and I bought it as a run-down business and did it up and had a good relationship with the public."" But he described problems with accounts cropping up as early as his first week in the role. ""There were discrepancies every week,"" he said, beginning at Â£5 or Â£10. He says he used to keep money on the side to make up any short-falls, but once they escalated to Â£100 or Â£200, he asked for help but got ""no interest"" from the helpdesk he contacted. Mr Butoy and his wife did not suspect anything was wrong when auditors turned up to check on the accounts. They had passed another audit the week before with no issues. But Mr Butoy was arrested, charged and sent to jail for stealing Â£208,000. He described feeling ""ashamed"", being led out of his Post Office in front of customers. Mr Butoy also lost more than six stone during his time in prison, due to the immense stress he was under. Led by retired High Court judge Sir Wyn Williams, the inquiry is beginning with six weeks of testimony from former Post Office staff, describing the devastating impact the false accusations have had on them and their families. The inquiry will also examine whether staff at software firm Fujitsu, which developed the Horizon software to complete tasks such as transactions, accounting and stocktaking, knew the system had flaws while data from it was used in court to convict sub-postmasters.

"Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance has not seen any de-escalation of Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders Following a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, he says the security threat from Russia represents a ""new normal"" for Europe ""This is the biggest concentration in forces in Europe since the Cold War,"" he says It comes after Russia said it was pulling back more troops - this time from the Crimean peninsula A series of cyber attacks on Tuesday knocked out the websites of Ukraine's defence ministry and two banks Ukraine has been marking a day of unity after earlier US reports suggested Russia could attack today Edited by Becky Morton That's all from today's live page team - thanks for following our coverage. The writers were Sam Cabral, Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea, Jennifer Meierhans, Alice Cuddy and David Molloy. The editor was Becky Morton. This video can not be played Watch: We don't see any Russian troop withdrawal, President Zelensky says We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly but before we finish, here's a quick recap of the major developments today: Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent This was a bleak
forecast for the future from Nato's secretary general. Jens Stoltenberg
described it as the most serious security crisis in Europe since the end of the
Cold War. And he made clear that the threat hasn't gone away. Stoltenberg said he'd seen no evidence that Russia had withdrawn forces from
the border with Ukraine and warned that Russia had maintained a massive
military force which was ready to attack. Even if President Putin doesn't give
that order, there are still signs this crises will cast a much
longer shadow. Stoltenberg said Russia's military build-up showed Moscow is prepared to contest European security with the use of
force. ""I regret to say it's the new normal,"" he said. That ""new
normal"" could also mean Nato increasing its military posture. Stoltenberg has tasked Nato military planners to look at setting up new
battlegroups on the alliance's Eastern flank - in Romania and the Black Sea
region. No final decision has yet been taken and Nato insists reinforcements
would only be sent to act as a deterrent. Nato is still calling on Russia
to engage in dialogue to reduce tensions. But if diplomacy doesn't work the
danger is both sides will end up with their armies doing the talking. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinese social media users are gripped by an unusual spat
between the UK and Russia, after a post was made on the UK Prime
Ministerâs official Sina Weibo account - Chinaâs answer to Twitter. The official Downing Street account, which has more than one
million followers, sent a message, in Chinese, to Russia's Vladimir Putin stating the Russian government ""should avoid
doing what would be a disastrous mistake for the country"". President Putin does not have an account on the platform. However, the Russian Embassy in China has responded to the post, calling it ""another
example of the Westâs 'information warfare' against Russia"". It added that the No 10 post ""was designed to fuel hysteria that it has manipulated
around the so-called âimminent Russian invasion of Ukraine'"". It is rare for foreign leaders to have official accounts on Weibo It is rare for foreign leaders or domestic officials to have accounts on Weibo. Chinaâs media environment is heavily state-controlled, meaning platforms such as Weibo are generally not used for political statements. The typical response to the post from users accuses the UK, like the US, of trying to stoke friction between Russia and the Ukraine. China is one of Russiaâs closest allies; media in China have sought to play down the suggestion of an imminent war. Instead, outlets have consistently claimed the US and British media have sought to inflame the situation to serve their respective government interests. Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian Maria says she stayed up at night listening for signs of trouble Will Russia withdraw or not? Thatâs the question many Ukrainians are asking today. Reports from US intelligence had suggested Moscow could launch an attack overnight - but this did not happen. âWhen my son woke me up around 03:00, I stayed anxious and alert for some time trying to hear something in the night,â says 29-year-old Maria Shtogryn, a mother of a toddler from Odesa. âWhen nothing happened tonight, I felt relievedâ. Ukrainians argue over whether the Russian invasion threat is real â in January 48% believed it was, and 39% thought it wasnât. But more than half - 56.5% - agree that Ukraineâs military and diplomatic efforts to prevent it aren't enough. Maria says sheâd like to see some defence reinforcements in place on the Black Sea beach where she strolls with her baby every day. For her, the danger of attack from the water is unsettling. While it might sound unlikely, the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine have had an impact on the Eurovision Song Contest, after Ukraine's candidate for this year's competition pulled out. Alina Pash had won a TV show to represent her country at the event, but she has nowwithdrawn from the process, with ""a heavy heart"". Ukraine's national broadcaster had already put her confirmation asthe country's act on hold, while an investigation was being carried out into a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. The 28-year-old says some people have attacked her online and called her un-Ukrainian for the visit. In an Instagram post,external, she writes: ""I am a Ukrainian citizen. I follow Ukrainian law and try to bring Ukraine's traditions and values into the world."" Visiting Crimea can be frowned upon and there are strict rules in place over how people travel to the region, with Ukrainians and foreigners only allowed to travel there through official land checkpoints. It's illegal under Ukrainian law to travel to Crimea via Russia. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that is under scrutiny. Soldiers take part in a battlegroup training exercise in Estonia, October 2020 Nato commanders have been told to go away and figure out how to deploy new battlegroups in the south-east of Europe. But what are they? Battlegroups are ""combat-ready"" military groups made up of forces from different Nato countries working together. They include artillery, tanks, and infantry, among other specialised skills. They're what Nato calls an ""enhanced forward presence"" in response to Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 - and amount to ""the biggest reinforcement of alliance collective defence in a generation"". There are four at the moment, based in: Three of those nations border Russia, while Poland is just one country away (and borders Ukraine). They are among the pain points when Russia complains of US and other foreign troops near its border. PrivatBank was among those targeted in the cyber-attack Officials in Ukraine are saying that cyber-attacks, which began yesterday, are likely the worst the country has ever seen. At least 10 major Ukrainian websites were unreachable due to the attacks, including the defence, foreign and culture ministries and Ukraineâs two largest state banks. The attack was planned in advance, is ongoing and is being performed from several countries, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov said at a briefing in Kyiv. The cost of the breach - through what is known as distributed denial-of-service or DDoS attacks - is now estimated to be in the millions of dollars. Ihor Konovalov, from the National Bank of
Ukraine, said the two banks that were targeted were ""fully prepared"" and had recovered control of their accounts without any funds being stolen. Several Ukrainian officials have blamed Russia for
the attack. They said its goal was to spread panic and instability. Moscow has denied involvement. Caroline DaviesBBC News, Moscow Before the Nato news conference Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry official, said that Moscow was preparing a fresh response to send to the US as the two countries continue a back-and-forth over the country's security demands. Russia issued demands to Nato and the US back in December which included a guarantee that Nato would not expand closer to Russiaâs borders. Late last month, the US complied with Russiaâs request that they write a written response to these demands. We asked Zakharova whether there were areas for negotiation given that Nato was not willing to abandon its open-door policy. âWe would like both sides to hear each other, not lecture each other or to make empty statements,â she replied. âWe will orientate ourselves on a serious conversation if our Western partners are ready for that.â Zakharova repeatedly criticised âAnglo-Saxon aggression, politics and rhetoricâ, blaming this for escalating the crisis in Ukraine. She also dismissed Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg as ânot the kind of person whose words can be seen in Moscow as serious argumentsâ. This video can not be played Watch: We do not see any signs of de-escalation on the ground, says Nato chief A little while earlier we heard from Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. Here are the main lines from his news conference: Caroline DaviesBBC Moscow correspondent Russia would consistently say that it doesn't see Nato as a defensive force, it sees it as one which is a threat to Russia. This has been the key security question that Russia has wanted an answer to and one of their big concerns is that the don't want Nato to expand any further. So the fact that there might be more troops, more feet on the ground in Nato countries, would be seen by Russia as going in the opposite direction to what Russia wants. There is of course no Kremlin response to Jens Stoltenberg's comments yet but it will be interesting to see what they say. Stoltenberg says there will be a ""high price"" if Russia uses force, saying sanctions will be imposed and that Ukraine is better trained and better equipped than when Russia annexed the Crimea in 2014. He says that even if we see a gradual development where Russia decides not to use force ""the fact that they would be willing to amass all these troops and combine that with a message that they are threatening an independent country"" - that in itself is serious. He says that is why Nato will have to consider some longer term adjustments in its posture in the East. No final decision has been made, but he says Romania is willing to host a battlegroup which France is willing to lead. And with that final question the news conference finishes. Asked again about the reported withdrawal of Russian troops Jens Stoltenberg says that Nato has been ""very transparent"" and says the information it has been sharing can be confirmed from open sources - including commercial satellites. ""I think it is very hard to dispute that Russia has amassed well over 100,000 troops and a lot of heavy equipment,"" he says. Stoltenberg adds that this is what Nato predicted several months ago and it has happened despite Russia denying that was the plan. Stoltenberg says there is ""cautious optimism"" that Russia is willing to engage in diplomatic efforts. ""While we think this is something we should take seriously... what we see on the ground is no withdrawal of troops, forces, or equipment,"" Stoltenberg says. Coupled with a cyber-attack on Ukraine which some are linking to Russia, he says ""these are the kind of actions and measures that we expect will come in advance of a bigger military intervention"". Stoltenberg is asked if sending in additional battle groups to the East will antagonise Russia. The secretary general insists Nato is working on a ""defensive"" basis - and has been clear the alliance is ready to sit down with Russia and address issues such as arms control. He says the best way to move forward is ""to engage in good faith"" and talk. It is possible to engage with Russia, he says, adding: ""We are not a threat, we are ready for dialogue."" But he cautions that the ""massive troop build-up"" combined with ""threatening rhetoric"" alongside Russia's track record must be taken seriously. ""That's why in a defensive way we are increasing our presence in the East,"" he adds. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale asks about new battle-groups and what Stoltenberg means by the ""new normal"". He says the new normal is for Russia to test the principles which underpin European security and says they have used force to try to intimidate other countries in Europe to accept the Russian demands. He says it is violating core principles which have been important for decades. ""Russia has demonstrated will to use force to try to coerce other countries and to try to change some fundamental principles that are important for our shared security,"" he says. He adds this is why it is important to consider long-term adjustments of Nato's posture in the east. Stoltenberg says Nato will look at establishing new battle groups in central and south-east regions within the alliance - such as Romania - as part of the defensive strategy against Russian aggression. He says military commanders will work on details and report back in weeks and there will be ongoing discussion on how Nato's defence can remain strong. An additional $270bn has been spent on Nato defence since 2014 by European allies and Canada, the secretary general adds. ""There are signs from Russia that diplomacy should continue but so far we do not see any sign of de-escalation on the ground,"" says Stoltenberg. ""No withdrawl of troops or equipment."" ""This may of course change. But for now Russian maintains a massive invasion force ready to attack with high capabilities from Crimea to Belarus,"" he says. ""This is the biggest concentration in forces in Europe since the Cold War."" Stoltenberg says Nato is not a threat to Russia and the steps it is taking are ""defensive"". He says that we don't know what will happen in Ukraine but we already know there is a crisis in security in Europe. Moscow has made it clear it is prepared to test the fundamental principles which have underpinned European security by using force, he says, adding this is the ""new normal in Europe"". Jens Stoltenberg repeats that it is not too late for Russia to step back from the brink of conflict. He says that Nato has sent concrete proposals on paper to Russia on transparency and arms control. Nato will not compromise on its core principles, he says. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"The Environment Agency is advising households to protect themselves from possible flooding and urging people to stay away from the coast on Friday People in Cornwall are being urged to only travel ""if absolutely necessary"" this Friday as Storm Eunice is set to cause disruption. Cornwall Council, which issued the warning, said people across the county were ""being urged to take precautions"". Those living in flood-risk areas along the north coasts of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset have been told to prepare for possible flooding. People are advised to stay away from the coast. The Environment Agency said strong winds, large waves and tidal surges were likely to cause wave-overtopping and floods during high tide on Friday. Anamber weather warning for wind,externalis in place across most of England from 03:00 GMT until 21:00 on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Analysis: David Braine, Senior Weather Presenter, BBC South West Storm Eunice is unusual because it has not yet formed, and normally we can follow areas of low pressure across the Atlantic as they develop and give reasonable guidance as to the track and the intensity. The exact track and time of wind intensity is difficult to predict, but most of the computer models we use suggest that on Friday, between 09:00 to 12:00 GMT, there may well be damaging gusts close to 100mph (161km/h) along the north coasts of Devon and Cornwall. The last time we had such strength of wind was in February 2014, when theDawlish railway line was washed away. This may well be stronger, but the winds being westerly means that the risk to Dawlish is small. Whilst there is still some uncertainty in the track of Eunice, there is an increasing likelihood of widespread inland wind gusts of 60 to 70mph, (97km/h to 113km/h) and up to 80mph (129km/h) in a few places. Winds are expected to ease across western areas through Friday afternoon and eastern areas during the evening. Cornwall Council said: ""Residents are urged to pay close attention to the weather forecast over the next two days and are urged to only travel on Friday if absolutely necessary. ""People are urged to stay back from cliffs and seafronts due to the danger of large waves."" Devon County Council said it was also advising people totake extra care when travelling on Friday morning,external, because of possibilities of flying debris, fallen trees, damage to buildings and homes, roofs blown off and power lines brought down. High winds might also result in temporary bridge closures, including the Taw Bridge in Barnstaple, it said. Katharine Smith, Environment Agency flood duty manager, said: ""Strong winds could bring coastal flooding to parts of the west, south-west and south coast of England, as well as the tidal River Severn, through the early hours of Friday morning and into the early afternoon. ""Environment Agency teams are out on the ground closing gates, erecting barriers and clearing screens where flood debris can build up, and stand ready to operate further flood defences if needed. ""We urge people to stay safe on the coast and warn wave watchers against the unnecessary danger of taking 'storm selfies'. Coastguards said boat owners should make sure their vessels were properly secured to moorings. Paddy Cochrane, from Falmouth Coastguard, told BBC Radio Cornwall: ""We would hope that boat owners, anybody who is out on moorings this time of the year, go out, double check your lines, make sure that all your moorings are properly secured, chain-to-chain rather than rope-to-chain if you can, or double up on your ropes. ""Just ensure that if you live on the coast that everything's battened down because we're going to get a fair old blow come through."" Windy weather this week has already affected events and facilities.

"Prince Andrew, Virginia Roberts and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001 There are calls for clarity over Prince Andrew's role in public life and how he will fund a financial settlement, after settling the US civil sexual assault case brought by Virginia Giuffre. The Duke of York agreed to pay an undisclosed sum as part of the settlement, and accepted Ms Giuffre had suffered as a victim of abuse. He made no admission of liability and has always denied the allegations. American lawyer Lisa Bloom said it was a huge victory for Ms Giuffre. ""This is a monumental win for Virginia,"" said Ms Bloom, who represents several of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's victims - adding that it was a win ""for everyday people... standing up against the rich and powerful"". Prince Andrew settles US civil sex assault case Who is Prince Andrew and what titles is he losing? Who is Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre? Prince Andrew must give up York title - city MP Ms Giuffre had been suing the Duke of York, claiming he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17 - which Prince Andrew has repeatedly denied. On Tuesdayit was announced they had reachedan out-of-court settlement. A statement from their lawyers said the duke would pay an undisclosed sum to Ms Giuffre and make a ""substantial donation"" to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights. It also said the duke regretted his association with Epstein. Prince Andrew hadpreviously told BBC Newsnightin 2019 he did not regret being friends with Epstein. But no details of the payout to Ms Giuffre have been made public - and there are calls for more detail about where the money will be coming from. Although the exact amount of the financial settlement has not been revealed, reports have speculated that it could run into millions of pounds. The duke receives a Royal Navy pension and a stipend from the Queen's Duchy of Lancaster income. This video can not be played Watch: Lawyer Gloria Allred says Virginia Giuffre could still testify against Prince Andrew Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Gloria Allred, a US attorney who has represented a number of Epstein's victims, said the statement confirming the settlement was ""vague"" and would have been ""carefully negotiated"". ""It's clear that the prince is not saying that he admits that he did anything wrong,"" she said. ""He does say that she has suffered as a victim of abuse. He doesn't say abuse by whom, he doesn't say sexual abuse, he doesn't say that he had anything to do with her."" Ms Allred said the ""war between the two partiesâ¦ will now end"", but added it remained possible that Ms Giuffre could testify in future court cases. ""No settlement such as this one can ever require that an accuser remain silent in the criminal justice system,"" she said. ""A prosecutor could decide to file criminal charges, in which case, Virginia could testify if called on."" This video can not be played Watch: What did Prince Andrew say about Virginia Giuffre's allegations in the 2019 Newsnight interview? Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in 2019 about his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Watch thefull interview on BBC iPlayer. Also speaking to BBC Breakfast, Liz Stein, one of Epstein's accusers, said the settlement had come as a shock, but taking the case to trial would have been ""incredibly difficult"" for Ms Giuffre. ""I think that what Virginia wanted more than anything else was validation and I think that in the settlement she got that,"" she said. ""Whatever he lost as a result of this could never compare to what the victims of Epstein, Maxwell, and the men that we were trafficked to have lost from our lives."" In the statement on Tuesday, Prince Andrew pledged to ""demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Ms Bloom said: ""I am sure that his money would be welcomed in organisations that are struggling to help victims everyday. ""In terms of his personal participation, probably not."" Former Royal Navy officer Rear Adm Chris Parry, who was Prince Andrew's flight commander, added: ""I think really he should look to a private life and enjoy essentially what is a very good privileged lifestyle. But I think he should stay out of the public eye."" If Prince Andrew had gone to court in the US to fight it out with Virginia Giuffre, it would have made headlines as tall as a New York skyscraper. That royal disaster zone has been averted by an out-of-court settlement. But it comes with high costs to Prince Andrew, both financial and reputational, and it will be a long road back before there is any chance of clearing his name in terms of public opinion. Read more here. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour, Labour MP Jess Phillips, who serves as Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding, said it would be very difficult for Prince Andrew to play a constructive role in combating sex trafficking in future. ""Those who work in sexual violence [and] human trafficking services are certainly not going to have open arms to his allyship... even if it was just finances,"" she said. Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Murray told BBC News transparency was needed about how the settlement will be funded if public money will be involved. Who are Virginia Giuffre's powerhouse lawyers? Who is Prince Andrew's Hollywood lawyer? Ms Giuffre, now 38, claims she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by financier Epstein from the age of 16. Epstein died while awaiting trial in 2019. She claimed the duke sexually assaulted her on three separate occasions in London, New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Prince Andrew said he didn't recall meeting Ms Giuffre and that an incident in which they had sex at the Belgravia home of Ghislaine Maxwell ""didn't happen"". In January, a New York court ruled that the civil action against him could go ahead. Shortly afterwards, Buckingham Palace said the prince's military titles and royal patronages had been returned to the Queen and that he would defend Ms Giuffre's civil case as a ""private citizen"". Speaking to theBBC's Americast podcast, New York lawyer Randy Zelin said of the settlement: ""Both sides gave a little something up, both sides can hold their heads up high"". Speaking in support of the duke, British socialite Lady Victoria Hervey said she hopes the Royal Family could now focus on the upcoming jubilee celebrations, and that ""Prince Andrew can put these false allegations behind him"".

"A T-shirt advert for retailer Boohoo has been banned after the advertising regulator ruled it was ""sexually suggestive"" and objectified women. The online fashion company's ad showed a model wearing a T-shirt with thong-style bikini bottoms and trainers. Boohoo, which has been criticised for its racy marketing before, said the model was wearing the T-shirt with a bikini as part of their swimwear range. The company said it was disappointed by the ruling, but has removed the images. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it had received a complaint that the ad was offensive, harmful and irresponsible. It added that while it understood the product was presented under the swimwear range, it still appeared in website searches for T-shirts and tops. ""We also noted that neither the partial nudity nor the bikini bottoms were relevant to the product and that the images did not show the product as it would usually be worn,"" the regulator said. Boohoo starts production at new factory Superdry warns of price rises and ends shop discounts The ""sexually suggestive"" images pictured the model kneeling from rear-view, sitting on the floor with legs apart and lifting the T-shirt. ""For those reasons, we concluded that the ad objectified and sexualised women. It was therefore irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence,"" the ASA said. The ASA ruled that the ad should be banned and said it told Boohoo to ensure that future ads were ""prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society"", and that they did not cause ""serious or widespread offence or harm by objectifying women"". It's not the first time Boohoo has come under fire for sexualised adverts. The ASA banned one of the firm's promotions in 2019 after Boohoo emailed customers with an ad that used the phrase ""Send nudes, set the tone with new season hues"" to market a range of clothes in skin tone colours. The regulator said this was ""socially irresponsible"" because young customers could be ""harmfully affected"" by pressure to share sexual images of themselves. A Boohoo spokesman said the company was ""disappointed"" by the ASA's latest ruling because it ""prides"" itself on its ""inclusive, body positive imagery"". ""Our marketing reflects the vibrant and confident culture of our brand, and is not designed to intentionally cause offence. ""We removed the associated images from our website when we received details of the complaint from the ASA,"" the spokesman added. Online fashion retailers are more likely than traditional retailers to use ""racy"" marketing, according toBBC analysis of Google search terms. Google uses the term ""racy"" to describe skimpy or sheer clothing, strategically covered nudity or provocative poses. The analysis found that on a typical UK High Street fashion retailer's website, 8% of women's modelling images were ""racy"" compared with 16% for online-only sites. Previously, the ASA banned an ad by online retailer Missguided for a promotion which it said featured ""highly sexualised"" images and ""objectified women"".

"Mask wearing is now guidance rather than law The health minister has revoked Northern Ireland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions, so rules that were formerly legally binding, such as wearing face coverings in enclosed public spaces, are now merely guidance. This means that while people are encouraged to follow restrictions, they will not face any punishment for not doing so. However, individual businesses are still able to ask customers to follow certain rules. Issues that were previously covered by guidance - such as the advice to work from home where possible - have not changed either, because the changes only affect legal restrictions. People are still being strongly encouraged to wear face masks in enclosed public spaces, such as shops, restaurants, cafes, bars and on public transport. In post-primary schools it was always guidance - rather than a legal requirement - for pupils to wear face coverings. This has not changed. Hospitality and entertainment venues will still be strongly encouraged to use so-called Covid passports, and the certificates will still be available for anyone who needs them to travel abroad. Social distancing is also still encouraged as well as meeting outdoors or in well-ventilated places were possible. The requirement for offices to take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing had already been removed, but soon risk assessments will no longer be required. People are still advised to work from home where possible but Health Minister Robin Swann has made it clear he wants the guidance to be urgently reviewed. He said he would work with ministerial colleagues on the issue. There have not been any changes to the rules on self-isolation. The Department of Health clarified on Tuesday evening that - contrary to England - the self-isolation rules in Northern Ireland were never enshrined in legislation. Instead, they were classified as ""very strong guidance"". Anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 should self-isolate for 10 days from the date their symptoms start or the date they took a test, whichever is sooner. They can leave isolation from day six if they have two consecutive lateral flow tests taken 24 hours apart, with the first taken no earlier than day five, and provided they do not have a high temperature. The testing and contact-tracing system will also remain in place. People are no longer required to social distance outdoors in Northern Ireland Travel rules remain in place, although there are currently no countries on the red list for international travel. If you are fully vaccinated and travelling to Northern Ireland from a country outside the Common Travel Area, you do not have to take a pre or post-departure test or self-isolate on arrival. However you must complete a UK passenger locator form in the 48 hours before you arrive and be able to prove your vaccination status. If you are not fully vaccinated you must complete a UK passenger locator form in the 48 hours before you arrive and be able to prove your vaccination status. You must also book and pay for a pre-departure PCR or LFD test to be taken in the two days before you travel to Northern Ireland and book and pay for a PCR test to be taken on or before day two following arrival. Foreign countries all have their own rules which you must follow if you are travelling to them. Dentistry has been severely disrupted by the pandemic and a large backlog of patients seeking routine appointments has built up since the first lockdown in March 2020. Dentistry was not specifically mentioned with the lifting of Covid restrictions, so dentists are still working underoperational guidelines issued by the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) which were last updated in December 2021,external. Currently, patients are asked about their Covid status before they attend appointments and those who have no symptoms of Covid or other respiratory infection can be treated under standard infection control measures that were in place before the pandemic began. But patients who test positive or who report Covid symptoms can only receive dental treatment if it is considered urgent and they should be segregated from other visitors to the surgery. A spokeswoman from the British Dental Association told BBC News NI that all enhanced measures to keep patients and staff safe have radically reduced capacity across the service and the current backlog means that routine appointments ""are still a long way off"". Translink said it will now encourage passengers to continue to wear face coverings in its vehicles and buildings A Translink spokesperson said the public service transport firm would ""continue to follow public health guidance"" regarding face coverings. ""To help keep everyone safe and in line with the latest guidance, we are encouraging our passengers to wear a face covering, if they can, in stations and on-board buses and trains,"" they added. There has been a mixed response on mask wearing guidelines from supermarkets and entertainment venues. Asda said wearing a face covering would now be ""a personal choice"". Sainsburys is continuing to ask people to wear them in its stores in Great Britain, but in Northern Ireland, the supermarket giant said it was reviewing what Stormont's health minister has said and will keep customers informed. Belfast's Grand Opera House has confirmed that it will continue to encourage people to wear face coverings, unless they are exempt or are eating and drinking. However, the Movie House Cinema chain said people could now make their own decisions on wearing face coverings.  It will also be removing guidance signs from its cinemas.

"Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg says the alliance has not seen any de-escalation of Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders Following a meeting of Nato defence ministers in Brussels, he says the security threat from Russia represents a ""new normal"" for Europe ""This is the biggest concentration in forces in Europe since the Cold War,"" he says It comes after Russia said it was pulling back more troops - this time from the Crimean peninsula A series of cyber attacks on Tuesday knocked out the websites of Ukraine's defence ministry and two banks Ukraine has been marking a day of unity after earlier US reports suggested Russia could attack today Edited by Becky Morton That's all from today's live page team - thanks for following our coverage. The writers were Sam Cabral, Doug Faulkner, Victoria Lindrea, Jennifer Meierhans, Alice Cuddy and David Molloy. The editor was Becky Morton. This video can not be played Watch: We don't see any Russian troop withdrawal, President Zelensky says We'll be pausing our live coverage shortly but before we finish, here's a quick recap of the major developments today: Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent This was a bleak
forecast for the future from Nato's secretary general. Jens Stoltenberg
described it as the most serious security crisis in Europe since the end of the
Cold War. And he made clear that the threat hasn't gone away. Stoltenberg said he'd seen no evidence that Russia had withdrawn forces from
the border with Ukraine and warned that Russia had maintained a massive
military force which was ready to attack. Even if President Putin doesn't give
that order, there are still signs this crises will cast a much
longer shadow. Stoltenberg said Russia's military build-up showed Moscow is prepared to contest European security with the use of
force. ""I regret to say it's the new normal,"" he said. That ""new
normal"" could also mean Nato increasing its military posture. Stoltenberg has tasked Nato military planners to look at setting up new
battlegroups on the alliance's Eastern flank - in Romania and the Black Sea
region. No final decision has yet been taken and Nato insists reinforcements
would only be sent to act as a deterrent. Nato is still calling on Russia
to engage in dialogue to reduce tensions. But if diplomacy doesn't work the
danger is both sides will end up with their armies doing the talking. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinese social media users are gripped by an unusual spat
between the UK and Russia, after a post was made on the UK Prime
Ministerâs official Sina Weibo account - Chinaâs answer to Twitter. The official Downing Street account, which has more than one
million followers, sent a message, in Chinese, to Russia's Vladimir Putin stating the Russian government ""should avoid
doing what would be a disastrous mistake for the country"". President Putin does not have an account on the platform. However, the Russian Embassy in China has responded to the post, calling it ""another
example of the Westâs 'information warfare' against Russia"". It added that the No 10 post ""was designed to fuel hysteria that it has manipulated
around the so-called âimminent Russian invasion of Ukraine'"". It is rare for foreign leaders to have official accounts on Weibo It is rare for foreign leaders or domestic officials to have accounts on Weibo. Chinaâs media environment is heavily state-controlled, meaning platforms such as Weibo are generally not used for political statements. The typical response to the post from users accuses the UK, like the US, of trying to stoke friction between Russia and the Ukraine. China is one of Russiaâs closest allies; media in China have sought to play down the suggestion of an imminent war. Instead, outlets have consistently claimed the US and British media have sought to inflame the situation to serve their respective government interests. Viktoriia ZhuhanBBC Ukrainian Maria says she stayed up at night listening for signs of trouble Will Russia withdraw or not? Thatâs the question many Ukrainians are asking today. Reports from US intelligence had suggested Moscow could launch an attack overnight - but this did not happen. âWhen my son woke me up around 03:00, I stayed anxious and alert for some time trying to hear something in the night,â says 29-year-old Maria Shtogryn, a mother of a toddler from Odesa. âWhen nothing happened tonight, I felt relievedâ. Ukrainians argue over whether the Russian invasion threat is real â in January 48% believed it was, and 39% thought it wasnât. But more than half - 56.5% - agree that Ukraineâs military and diplomatic efforts to prevent it aren't enough. Maria says sheâd like to see some defence reinforcements in place on the Black Sea beach where she strolls with her baby every day. For her, the danger of attack from the water is unsettling. While it might sound unlikely, the ongoing tensions between Russia and Ukraine have had an impact on the Eurovision Song Contest, after Ukraine's candidate for this year's competition pulled out. Alina Pash had won a TV show to represent her country at the event, but she has nowwithdrawn from the process, with ""a heavy heart"". Ukraine's national broadcaster had already put her confirmation asthe country's act on hold, while an investigation was being carried out into a 2015 trip she made to Crimea, an area Russia seized control of in 2014. The 28-year-old says some people have attacked her online and called her un-Ukrainian for the visit. In an Instagram post,external, she writes: ""I am a Ukrainian citizen. I follow Ukrainian law and try to bring Ukraine's traditions and values into the world."" Visiting Crimea can be frowned upon and there are strict rules in place over how people travel to the region, with Ukrainians and foreigners only allowed to travel there through official land checkpoints. It's illegal under Ukrainian law to travel to Crimea via Russia. Alina has provided authorities with proof of how she entered the region but that is under scrutiny. Soldiers take part in a battlegroup training exercise in Estonia, October 2020 Nato commanders have been told to go away and figure out how to deploy new battlegroups in the south-east of Europe. But what are they? Battlegroups are ""combat-ready"" military groups made up of forces from different Nato countries working together. They include artillery, tanks, and infantry, among other specialised skills. They're what Nato calls an ""enhanced forward presence"" in response to Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014 - and amount to ""the biggest reinforcement of alliance collective defence in a generation"". There are four at the moment, based in: Three of those nations border Russia, while Poland is just one country away (and borders Ukraine). They are among the pain points when Russia complains of US and other foreign troops near its border. PrivatBank was among those targeted in the cyber-attack Officials in Ukraine are saying that cyber-attacks, which began yesterday, are likely the worst the country has ever seen. At least 10 major Ukrainian websites were unreachable due to the attacks, including the defence, foreign and culture ministries and Ukraineâs two largest state banks. The attack was planned in advance, is ongoing and is being performed from several countries, Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov said at a briefing in Kyiv. The cost of the breach - through what is known as distributed denial-of-service or DDoS attacks - is now estimated to be in the millions of dollars. Ihor Konovalov, from the National Bank of
Ukraine, said the two banks that were targeted were ""fully prepared"" and had recovered control of their accounts without any funds being stolen. Several Ukrainian officials have blamed Russia for
the attack. They said its goal was to spread panic and instability. Moscow has denied involvement. Caroline DaviesBBC News, Moscow Before the Nato news conference Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry official, said that Moscow was preparing a fresh response to send to the US as the two countries continue a back-and-forth over the country's security demands. Russia issued demands to Nato and the US back in December which included a guarantee that Nato would not expand closer to Russiaâs borders. Late last month, the US complied with Russiaâs request that they write a written response to these demands. We asked Zakharova whether there were areas for negotiation given that Nato was not willing to abandon its open-door policy. âWe would like both sides to hear each other, not lecture each other or to make empty statements,â she replied. âWe will orientate ourselves on a serious conversation if our Western partners are ready for that.â Zakharova repeatedly criticised âAnglo-Saxon aggression, politics and rhetoricâ, blaming this for escalating the crisis in Ukraine. She also dismissed Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg as ânot the kind of person whose words can be seen in Moscow as serious argumentsâ. This video can not be played Watch: We do not see any signs of de-escalation on the ground, says Nato chief A little while earlier we heard from Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg. Here are the main lines from his news conference: Caroline DaviesBBC Moscow correspondent Russia would consistently say that it doesn't see Nato as a defensive force, it sees it as one which is a threat to Russia. This has been the key security question that Russia has wanted an answer to and one of their big concerns is that the don't want Nato to expand any further. So the fact that there might be more troops, more feet on the ground in Nato countries, would be seen by Russia as going in the opposite direction to what Russia wants. There is of course no Kremlin response to Jens Stoltenberg's comments yet but it will be interesting to see what they say. Stoltenberg says there will be a ""high price"" if Russia uses force, saying sanctions will be imposed and that Ukraine is better trained and better equipped than when Russia annexed the Crimea in 2014. He says that even if we see a gradual development where Russia decides not to use force ""the fact that they would be willing to amass all these troops and combine that with a message that they are threatening an independent country"" - that in itself is serious. He says that is why Nato will have to consider some longer term adjustments in its posture in the East. No final decision has been made, but he says Romania is willing to host a battlegroup which France is willing to lead. And with that final question the news conference finishes. Asked again about the reported withdrawal of Russian troops Jens Stoltenberg says that Nato has been ""very transparent"" and says the information it has been sharing can be confirmed from open sources - including commercial satellites. ""I think it is very hard to dispute that Russia has amassed well over 100,000 troops and a lot of heavy equipment,"" he says. Stoltenberg adds that this is what Nato predicted several months ago and it has happened despite Russia denying that was the plan. Stoltenberg says there is ""cautious optimism"" that Russia is willing to engage in diplomatic efforts. ""While we think this is something we should take seriously... what we see on the ground is no withdrawal of troops, forces, or equipment,"" Stoltenberg says. Coupled with a cyber-attack on Ukraine which some are linking to Russia, he says ""these are the kind of actions and measures that we expect will come in advance of a bigger military intervention"". Stoltenberg is asked if sending in additional battle groups to the East will antagonise Russia. The secretary general insists Nato is working on a ""defensive"" basis - and has been clear the alliance is ready to sit down with Russia and address issues such as arms control. He says the best way to move forward is ""to engage in good faith"" and talk. It is possible to engage with Russia, he says, adding: ""We are not a threat, we are ready for dialogue."" But he cautions that the ""massive troop build-up"" combined with ""threatening rhetoric"" alongside Russia's track record must be taken seriously. ""That's why in a defensive way we are increasing our presence in the East,"" he adds. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale asks about new battle-groups and what Stoltenberg means by the ""new normal"". He says the new normal is for Russia to test the principles which underpin European security and says they have used force to try to intimidate other countries in Europe to accept the Russian demands. He says it is violating core principles which have been important for decades. ""Russia has demonstrated will to use force to try to coerce other countries and to try to change some fundamental principles that are important for our shared security,"" he says. He adds this is why it is important to consider long-term adjustments of Nato's posture in the east. Stoltenberg says Nato will look at establishing new battle groups in central and south-east regions within the alliance - such as Romania - as part of the defensive strategy against Russian aggression. He says military commanders will work on details and report back in weeks and there will be ongoing discussion on how Nato's defence can remain strong. An additional $270bn has been spent on Nato defence since 2014 by European allies and Canada, the secretary general adds. ""There are signs from Russia that diplomacy should continue but so far we do not see any sign of de-escalation on the ground,"" says Stoltenberg. ""No withdrawl of troops or equipment."" ""This may of course change. But for now Russian maintains a massive invasion force ready to attack with high capabilities from Crimea to Belarus,"" he says. ""This is the biggest concentration in forces in Europe since the Cold War."" Stoltenberg says Nato is not a threat to Russia and the steps it is taking are ""defensive"". He says that we don't know what will happen in Ukraine but we already know there is a crisis in security in Europe. Moscow has made it clear it is prepared to test the fundamental principles which have underpinned European security by using force, he says, adding this is the ""new normal in Europe"". Jens Stoltenberg repeats that it is not too late for Russia to step back from the brink of conflict. He says that Nato has sent concrete proposals on paper to Russia on transparency and arms control. Nato will not compromise on its core principles, he says. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"The Environment Agency is advising households to protect themselves from possible flooding and urging people to stay away from the coast on Friday People in Cornwall are being urged to only travel ""if absolutely necessary"" this Friday as Storm Eunice is set to cause disruption. Cornwall Council, which issued the warning, said people across the county were ""being urged to take precautions"". Those living in flood-risk areas along the north coasts of Cornwall, Devon and Somerset have been told to prepare for possible flooding. People are advised to stay away from the coast. The Environment Agency said strong winds, large waves and tidal surges were likely to cause wave-overtopping and floods during high tide on Friday. Anamber weather warning for wind,externalis in place across most of England from 03:00 GMT until 21:00 on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Analysis: David Braine, Senior Weather Presenter, BBC South West Storm Eunice is unusual because it has not yet formed, and normally we can follow areas of low pressure across the Atlantic as they develop and give reasonable guidance as to the track and the intensity. The exact track and time of wind intensity is difficult to predict, but most of the computer models we use suggest that on Friday, between 09:00 to 12:00 GMT, there may well be damaging gusts close to 100mph (161km/h) along the north coasts of Devon and Cornwall. The last time we had such strength of wind was in February 2014, when theDawlish railway line was washed away. This may well be stronger, but the winds being westerly means that the risk to Dawlish is small. Whilst there is still some uncertainty in the track of Eunice, there is an increasing likelihood of widespread inland wind gusts of 60 to 70mph, (97km/h to 113km/h) and up to 80mph (129km/h) in a few places. Winds are expected to ease across western areas through Friday afternoon and eastern areas during the evening. Cornwall Council said: ""Residents are urged to pay close attention to the weather forecast over the next two days and are urged to only travel on Friday if absolutely necessary. ""People are urged to stay back from cliffs and seafronts due to the danger of large waves."" Devon County Council said it was also advising people totake extra care when travelling on Friday morning,external, because of possibilities of flying debris, fallen trees, damage to buildings and homes, roofs blown off and power lines brought down. High winds might also result in temporary bridge closures, including the Taw Bridge in Barnstaple, it said. Katharine Smith, Environment Agency flood duty manager, said: ""Strong winds could bring coastal flooding to parts of the west, south-west and south coast of England, as well as the tidal River Severn, through the early hours of Friday morning and into the early afternoon. ""Environment Agency teams are out on the ground closing gates, erecting barriers and clearing screens where flood debris can build up, and stand ready to operate further flood defences if needed. ""We urge people to stay safe on the coast and warn wave watchers against the unnecessary danger of taking 'storm selfies'. Coastguards said boat owners should make sure their vessels were properly secured to moorings. Paddy Cochrane, from Falmouth Coastguard, told BBC Radio Cornwall: ""We would hope that boat owners, anybody who is out on moorings this time of the year, go out, double check your lines, make sure that all your moorings are properly secured, chain-to-chain rather than rope-to-chain if you can, or double up on your ropes. ""Just ensure that if you live on the coast that everything's battened down because we're going to get a fair old blow come through."" Windy weather this week has already affected events and facilities. In Cornwall, Truro Farmers' Market on Wednesday was postponed ahead of the storm, and the Jubilee Pool in Penzance announced it was closing until next Wednesday.

"A T-shirt advert for retailer Boohoo has been banned after the advertising regulator ruled it was ""sexually suggestive"" and objectified women. The online fashion company's ad showed a model wearing a T-shirt with thong-style bikini bottoms and trainers. Boohoo, which has been criticised for its racy marketing before, said the model was wearing the T-shirt with a bikini as part of their swimwear range. The company said it was disappointed by the ruling, but has removed the images. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said it had received a complaint that the ad was offensive, harmful and irresponsible. It added that while it understood the product was presented under the swimwear range, it still appeared in website searches for T-shirts and tops. ""We also noted that neither the partial nudity nor the bikini bottoms were relevant to the product and that the images did not show the product as it would usually be worn,"" the regulator said. Boohoo starts production at new factory Superdry warns of price rises and ends shop discounts The ""sexually suggestive"" images pictured the model kneeling from rear-view, sitting on the floor with legs apart and lifting the T-shirt. ""For those reasons, we concluded that the ad objectified and sexualised women. It was therefore irresponsible and likely to cause serious offence,"" the ASA said. The ASA ruled that the ad should be banned and said it told Boohoo to ensure that future ads were ""prepared with a sense of responsibility to consumers and to society"", and that they did not cause ""serious or widespread offence or harm by objectifying women"". It's not the first time Boohoo has come under fire for sexualised adverts. The ASA banned one of the firm's promotions in 2019 after Boohoo emailed customers with an ad that used the phrase ""Send nudes, set the tone with new season hues"" to market a range of clothes in skin tone colours. The regulator said this was ""socially irresponsible"" because young customers could be ""harmfully affected"" by pressure to share sexual images of themselves. A Boohoo spokesman said the company was ""disappointed"" by the ASA's latest ruling because it ""prides"" itself on its ""inclusive, body positive imagery"". ""Our marketing reflects the vibrant and confident culture of our brand, and is not designed to intentionally cause offence. ""We removed the associated images from our website when we received details of the complaint from the ASA,"" the spokesman added. Online fashion retailers are more likely than traditional retailers to use ""racy"" marketing, according toBBC analysis of Google search terms. Google uses the term ""racy"" to describe skimpy or sheer clothing, strategically covered nudity or provocative poses. The analysis found that on a typical UK High Street fashion retailer's website, 8% of women's modelling images were ""racy"" compared with 16% for online-only sites. Previously, the ASA banned an ad by online retailer Missguided for a promotion which it said featured ""highly sexualised"" images and ""objectified women"".

"About 500 young people could be eligible for the scheme Every 18-year-old leaving care will be offered Â£1,600 a month for two years under a Welsh government basic income pilot. It is expected about 500 people will be eligible to join the scheme, which could cost up to Â£20m. Officials said it was the highest amount offered on a basic income scheme anywhere in the world. The Welsh Conservatives said it was a waste of money while Plaid Cymru called for the pilot to be expanded. The Â£1,600 a month will be taxed and is expected to be counted as income by the UK government, meaning it would affect someone's eligibility for benefits. It will be unconditional and will not be withdrawn if participants get a job. What is a universal basic income? Spain to use basic income to ease crisis pain Most Welsh homes to get Â£150 payment But the Welsh government is no longer calling the plans a pilot of Universal Basic Income (UBI), where a wider group of people would be given a regular sum of money. Ministers want to test out how the payments could help care leavers be better placed for their transition into independence as adults. Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt said the plans would ""deliver financial stability for a generation of young people that need it most"". Milly said the pilot is a ""good opportunity"" for carers A teenager who has foster parents said the pilot could make care leavers ""equal with everyone else"". Milly, 17, represents the National Youth Advocacy service on the Welsh Youth Parliament and has spoken openly about her care experiences. She said the pilot was a good opportunity, adding people in care were ""disadvantaged financially and this will bring us level"". She said it would be a ""safety net"" for those who have been in care who may not have support from their families. ""Many have been damaged, physical and mentally - this can help pay for private counselling or therapy as often public waiting lists for these services are so long."" Although she welcomes the announcement, Milly still has questions about how the payments will be rolled out: ""I'd like to see evidence that everyone in care will be entitled to it."" Every person leaving care at the age of 18 for the first 12 months of the pilot will be offered the chance to take part. They will receive payments for 24 months, amounting to an income worth Â£19,000 before tax annually, with the first payment a month after their 18th birthday. Officials say it is equivalent to thereal living wage,externaland will be taxed at thebasic rate,external. This video can not be played An experiment in Finland saw 2,000 people paid â¬560 (Â£490) a month, instead of their unemployment benefit. Laura Tams, 42, from Pontardawe, who has been fostering for six years, toldBBC Radio Walesadditional support was also needed for young people leaving care. ""These children have been through things that to you and I belong in nightmares. We cannot all of a sudden expect them at 18 to be able to run a house and to spend that money wisely."" Welsh officials are also promising extra support for those taking part, such as financial wellbeing training. There is no date for when the scheme will be launched, although officials said it was likely to be in the summer. Alex Sommerville, who was in care when she was younger, said she was concerned young people would not want to go into education or work Former youth worker Alex Sommerville, who left care when she was younger, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summersshe did not believe the scheme would encourage care leavers to find work, or study further. Ms Somerville, from Swansea, said: ""Some would still want to go for education or work, but there is a part of me thinking, if you're getting that wage every month, why would you?"" ""I'm very worried about giving young people all of that money and expecting them to know how to spend it in the best way for themselves."" Welsh Conservative spokesman for social partnership Joel James said trials had shown basic income failed to incentivise work and had proven to be a ""waste of public money"". Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman Luke Fletcher said it was a step in the right direction but needed a ""structure around it to enable it to meet the ambition of addressing poverty and unemployment, as well as improving health and financial wellbeing"". The income will be subject to tax UBI is where a government pays all individuals a set amount, regardless of their means. Backers say it could help reduce poverty and be easier and less stressful to navigate than more complex means-tested benefits, but opponents say it is extremely costly and not targeted at those who need it. Once it was announced that the pilot would focus on care leavers, critics argued it was not actually universal. The Welsh government had initially described it as a pilot of UBI, but has now stopped doing so. Asked why it was not a trial of UBI, Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt told BBC Wales that the government needed ""to be realistic"". and the pilot needed to be ""meaningful in terms of the funding"". A basic income for care leavers has been tried in Santa Clara, California, where 72 young adults received $1,000 (Â£739)initially for 12 months,external. In Finland, research on a basic income pilot with jobless people for two years found it did not lead them to find work,although they felt happier. The Welsh government plans were welcomed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity which researches poverty in the UK. To match the level of basic income for care leavers at about the real living wage is bold. With so many people in Wales paid only the national minimum wage there may well be those who think the offer to care leavers is over-generous. But in economic terms if the project is successful and results in better paid work and healthier lives, the long-term benefits would flow back into the economy. While this is not is a pilot of UBI, its outcomes will be relevant to the debate around that.

"Alcohol Health Alliance commissioned research on sugar content in wine Analysis of more than 30 bottles of wine has found two glasses could be enough to reach the recommended daily sugar limit for adults. Research by Alcohol Health Alliance UK found some bottles had up to 59g of sugar - more than a glazed doughnut. An independent laboratory analysed bottles of red, white, rosÃ©, fruit and sparkling wine from popular UK brands. None of the bottles featured nutritional information on labels as this is currently not required by law. Calorie content was only displayed on a fifth of the bottles analysed by the lab. Campaigners are calling for change, to better inform wine drinkers about how many calories and how much sugar they are consuming. The NHS recommends,externaladults consume a maximum of 30g of ""free sugars"" per day, which includes sugar in fruit juices and smoothies, or sugar added to food or drink. Analysis shows that it's possible to reach an adult's daily sugar limit by drinking two medium-sized glasses of some wines. Analysis on more than 30 bottles of wine has found two glasses of some of sweeter wines is enough to reach your daily sugar limit It also found lower-strength wines were among those containing the most sugar, meaning they were not necessarily a healthy choice, despite their lower alcohol content. In the UK, alcoholic drinks are required to display volume and strength in units of alcohol by volume (ABV). 'Hidden sugar' in pre-mixed gin and cocktail drinks Sugar reduction in food well below target of 20% Labelling must also identify any common allergens, but there are no requirements for ingredients, health warnings or nutritional value as found on many other food and drink food products. A YouGov survey,externalof more than 12,000 people last year found that 61% wanted calorie information on wine labels - and more than 50% of those surveyed wanted the amount of sugar listed. In 2020, the UK government held a consultation on whether calories should be listed on alcoholic drinks - but there was no consultation on whether sugar content should be listed. Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance UK, called the current rules ""absurd"". ""Shoppers who buy milk or orange juice have sugar content and nutritional information right at their fingertips,"" he said. ""But this information is not required when it comes to alcohol - a product not just fuelling obesity, but with widespread health harms and linked to seven types of cancer."" Miles Beale, who heads up the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, says members of the group want people to have access to nutritional information for all alcoholic drinks, but suggested the information should be carried online. ""[We] have been pushing for greater information to be provided online,"" said Mr Beale. ""The alcohol industry can provide consumers with a far greater variety of information that is more relevant to consumers and which would not fit on a label,"" he added. ""There is significant variation in the number of calories in different alcoholic drinks and in different servings of drinks. Online is the best way to provide the volume and variety of information that consumers need to make quick and easy informed decisions. ""It would also cost less to deliver.""

"Scotland's dental leaders say the backlog for patients getting NHS treatment is ""enormous"". Official data shows people in more affluent areas were much more likely to be seen by a dentist in the last two years compared to poorer communities. Meanwhile, patients on long waiting lists are resorting to costly private treatment in order to be seen sooner. The Scottish government said it was committed to tackling the pandemic-related backlog in routine dental care. The shutdown of dental services in the early days of Covid, and then severe restrictions on working practices meant emergency care was prioritised in Scotland. A lack of routine care such as check-ups and hygienist visits meant a backlog built up. My NHS dentist can fix my son's teeth - if we go private Dental treatments dropped by 75% after Covid hit Clyde Munro secures Â£25m investment for acquisitions Figures from Public Health Scotland show there were 858,407 fewer patients seen by NHS dentists in the last two years compared to pre-pandemic times. The most recent data, from September 2021, also suggests the number of registered patients getting an appointment within a 24 month period is the lowest on record. Dentists say strict Covid protocols inside practices are partly to blame. David McColl, chairman of the Scottish Dental Practice Committee, said his colleagues had to prioritise people needing urgent, emergency treatment. He told BBC Scotland: ""We are still having to prioritise emergency, urgent care and we are still having to follow government guidelines on infection control. That means we just cannot see the same volume of people that we did pre-pandemic. ""We need to have the government be honest with the public and not pretend that everything is back to normal because healthcare is not back to normal. We are still having to maintain 2m social distancing within the practice and that cuts down on the number of people we can have flow through the practice."" Denise Hesketh is one of thousands of Scots who couldn't see a dentist during the start of the pandemic. The 58-year-old from Edinburgh has battled dental problems for years, but being unable to see a dentist during Covid meant her oral health has taken a turn for the worse. She told BBC Scotland: ""It was over a year before I was able to see a dentist and by then it just got too bad. Everything was unstable. It needn't have happened - it could have been repaired."" She now faces a bill of Â£20,000 for private care, with her NHS dentist unable to offer any help. Denise in 2019, before her teeth deteriorated Denise feels her appearance has made her unable to find work. ""I look so ugly and I try to wear my mask. I try not to smile, and not open my mouth I feel so ugly and have moments where I feel so paranoid,"" she said. ""Friends are not coming back to me. And getting a job interview, it's not a good look. ""It is painful and when I eat I have to concentrate on not getting hurt. ""I feel like a monster."" Some patients have raised fears that those who pay for private dental treatment are being prioritised. BBC Scotland has seen an email to patients from one practice in Lanarkshire. It states ""Due to NHS restrictions and waiting lists on routine careâ¦ there are other options for check-ups for adults and children to pay privately"". The email then offers ""dental membership"" allowing people to pay up to Â£24 a month for check-ups and discounts. And children's check-ups for Â£35. Thelatest data from Public Health Scotland,externalshows that oral health inequalities are worse than ever before. 45.1% of adults from Scotland's poorest areas managed to see a dentist during the pandemic, compared to 56.4% from the most affluent communities. Children in less affluent areas are less likely to have seen a dentist during the pandemic The problem is even more acute among children. 73.1% of young people from well-off locations got a dental appointment whereas that figure dropped to 55% of youngsters in poorer areas. The Scottish government said it was committed to tackling the pandemic-related backlog in routine dental care, and to ensure dental teams see more patients face-to-face, including those from deprived communities. It said an additional Â£50m and free PPE had been supplied to dentists to ensure NHS dental services were well placed to care for the oral health of the whole population. Public health minister Maree Todd said: ""We have done a lot to support dentists - we have helped with improving ventilation and we have supplied hand drills that don't produce an aerosol. ""I don't think we need to compromise on infection protection and control whilst we are still in the middle of a global pandemic. I am more than happy to wait for clinical advice that tells me it is safe to do that before that change is made. ""It is vitally important that everyone in Scotland can access an NHS dentist should they wish to. 95% did before the pandemic and we are keen to get back to that.""

"UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is meeting Nato members in Brussels on Wednesday The UK will ""judge Russia by its actions"" after reports it is moving back troops from the border of Ukraine, says Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. He said the UK government would ""take them at their word"", but it was ""too soon to tell"" if the move was genuine. Russia's defence ministryclaimed on Tuesdaythat it had withdrawn some troops conducting military exercises in districts bordering Ukraine. But Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky said the exit was not visible. Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also said the alliance had not seen any evidence of a departure by Russian troops. Speaking ahead of a meeting of Nato member defence ministers, he said: ""So far we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground - on the contrary, it appears that Russia continues the military build-up."" Reports had suggested that US intelligence believed an invasion could be launched in the early hours of Wednesday. But while that has not happened, US President Joe Biden warned a Russian attack on Ukraine was ""still very much a possibility"", and the human cost would be ""immense"". After a call between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida, the leaders said any invasion would ""shake the foundations of the international order and have severe consequences"". The Ministry of Defence confirmed it was increasing British forces in Estonia, as well as sending additional Apache helicopters to the region, and sending four additional Typhoon jets for air patrols. The department said the increase would bring British troop numbers in the country to the high hundreds, but not thousands. LIVE: Latest on Ukraine crisis Biden: Human cost of Russia attack would be immense How much Russian money is there in the UK? Russia has long been opposed to the former Soviet republic of Ukraine growing closer to Europe and its institutions. President Vladimir Putin has demanded a guarantee from the West that Ukraine will not join Nato - a defensive alliance of 30 countries - but Nato has said it will not close down any future agreements. Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border. President Putin insists Russia is not planning to invade, but the US and European countries - including the UK - have been providing support to Ukraine, such as training and weapons, and numerous governments have told their citizens to leave the country. Pictures made available by the Russian defence ministry claimed to show troops returning from exercises to their bases Analysis by Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent Think of this crisis as theatre - actors move across the stage, soliloquies are delivered. There are ""sounds off"", ambiguous and open to interpretation. We are all mesmerised by Russia's troop movements, constantly asking ourselves what each set of pictures means. And that's what the director of this theatre, Vladimir Putin, intends. He wants to keep us guessing. It's perfectly possible that the sight of Russian armour, crossing the Kerch strait from Crimea, represents a hoped-for sign of de-escalation. But as Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has reminded everyone, it's way too early to make any reliable judgement on what it all means. Vast numbers of Russian troops remain massed close to Ukraine's borders, arrayed in a fashion that western intelligence agencies can only interpret one way - this is an invasion force. That doesn't mean an invasion is coming. But even as the Kremlin denies it has any hostile intention, it suits President Putin for everyone to think that the stage is set for this drama's big battle scene. The UK has also pledged to impose tougher sanctions on Russia in the event of an invasion. But legislation to carry out the threat still needs to be approved by the British Parliament, which is currently in recess. The BBC understands MPs could be asked to sign off the plan early next week when they return to Westminster to send a message that the measures are ready and waiting. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for ""proper action"" on Russian cash and influence in the UK, adding: ""A failure to act now will only further strengthen Vladimir Putin in his attempts to stalk and menace his neighbours and democracies around the world."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Wallace said the UK was offering offering ""a range of forces - air, sea and land"" in support, with a doubling of troops in neighbouring Estonia and 1,000 more on standby if Nato calls on them. He said the troops would not be deployed if the situation between Russia and Ukraine de-escalated, but added it was ""important we make the plans so Russia knows we are serious about deterrence"". On reports Russia was moving back some of its troops from the border, Mr Wallace said: ""We will take them at their word, but judge them by their actions."" He added: ""I would be the first to be delighted by a de-escalation, we have all been working towards that, but we see 60% of Russia's land forces amassed on the Ukrainian and Belarus borders. ""I am an ex-soldier, that is not normal exercising, especially when you see the depth of deployments."" Earlier, the UK defence secretary told BBC Breakfast the build up of Russian troops on the ground had ""shown the opposite of the rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin"", but no-one knew what the country's leader was thinking. ""President Putin hasn't made a decision yet and, until a decision is made, none of us will know what will happen next."" But he said Russia ""hasn't got its way [as] Nato has not shut out people who wish to apply"". Countries in the West - including the UK - have threatened to introduce tough sanctions on Russia if they invade Ukraine. But what are the possible measures they could introduce? Banning Russia from Swift:The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, is an international banking transaction system. Russia is heavily reliant on Swift due to its multibillion exports of hydrocarbons traded in US dollars. Cutting the country off would terminate all international transactions, trigger currency volatility, and cause massive capital outflows. The US could also ban Russia from financial transactions involving US dollars - the world's reserve currency - meaning Russia would be extremely limited in what it could buy and sell around the world. Targeted export controls:The West could restrict the export of key commodities to Russia, such as goods containing American technology, like semiconductor microchips, which are used in everything from cars to smartphones. Energy restrictions and Nord Stream 2:Russia's economy is hugely dependent on selling gas and oil overseas. But the West could make it illegal for countries and companies to buy oil from the big Russian energy giants such as Gazprom or Rosneft. Europe could also put a halt to Nord Stream 2, a 759-mile proposed pipeline designed to transport gas from Russia to Germany. But Europe is already facing inflation and a cost of living crisis due to low supplies of gas. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Ukraine crisis Target individuals:Not only associates of Vladimir Putin but the Russian president himself. A total of 185 Russian individuals, many of whom were involved in the annexation of the Crimea and the separatist movement in Eastern Ukraine, are already subject to sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans. London clampdown:The British government has threatened to block Russian companies from raising capital in London and to expose property and company ownership. Sanctions could also be imposed to restrict the ability of Russian individuals to invest and live in London. According to the Office for National Statistics, Russian investment in the UK accounted for Â£25.5bn in 2016.

"What comes next for Prince Andrew after he settles the claims against him? If Prince Andrew had gone to court in the US to fight it out with Virginia Giuffre, it would have made headlines as tall as a New York skyscraper. That royal disaster zone has been averted by anout-of-court settlement. But it comes with high costs to Prince Andrew, both financial and reputational, and it will be a long road back before there is any chance of clearing his name in terms of public opinion. He won't get back any of the royal patronages, military links or the HRH title that weretaken away from him. And the many questions raised by hisBBC Newsnight interview- about his connections with Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein and details such as his inability to sweat - will be left unanswered. If not a smoking gun, there is still the unexplained smoke from a Woking pizza oven. The implication of this deal means he is potentially paying millions of dollars to someone he still contends he has no memory of ever meeting. The deal says that Prince Andrew ""regrets his association with Epstein"", but that picture of the prince with the sex offender will continue to haunt him. That even more famous picture of Ms Giuffre, Prince Andrew and Maxwell, taken in London almost 21 years ago, will always be there when his name is mentioned, frozen in digital aspic. Long shadows have been cast which will be hard to shift. This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in 2019 about his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Watch thefull interview on the BBC's YouTube channel,external. Legal experts had been predicting that a settlement was the most likely outcome from this civil court case, in which Ms Giuffre had brought sexual assault claims against Prince Andrew. ""It was the best of the bad options available to him,"" said Gideon Benaim, a partner at law firm Simkins, who specialises in protecting high-profile reputations. ""If it had continued it would have inevitably damaged him even further,"" said Mr Benaim. Prince Andrew settles sex assault claims Ruthless royals move to limit damage Prince Andrew loses HRH and military titles Anna Rothwell at law firm Corker Binning said Prince Andrew's Newsnight interview on its own ""would have given Ms Giuffre's lawyers a wealth of material to use in cross examination"". But where does it leave Prince Andrew now? A few weeks ago his legal team was full of fighting talk about being ready to battle it out in court and wanting to knock down Ms Giuffre's allegations. Now the tone has changed completely to recognising that Ms Giuffre has ""suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks"". The civil claims against Prince Andrew had already produced damaging headlines for the royals But Mr Benaim says the deal avoids any admission of guilt and any personal wrongdoing and stops a case which threatened an endless supply of negative headlines. ""Reputationally he had to get rid of this - almost regardless of the cost,"" said the lawyer. Prince Andrew can maintain his innocence, with nothing proven against him, and he could argue that he was paying a price to protect his family from any further damaging coverage. The number of zeroes in that payment remains confidential, but it's likely to look like a long row of those emojis of popping eyes. There is also some ambiguity about whether it is one or two payments being made. ""The parties will file a stipulated dismissal upon Ms Giuffre's receipt of the settlement (the sum of which is not being disclosed). ""Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights,"" says the joint statement accompanying the deal. Whether that means separate payments to Ms Giuffre and the charity has not been clarified by Prince Andrew's representatives. Who is paying for the pay-out could be another issue. Kate Macnab, a lawyer at Reeds Solicitors, says: ""It is likely there will be some demands to know where the payment is coming from - public or private purse?"" In terms of what comes next, the settlement contains a line suggesting how he might try to begin restoring his reputation. ""He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims."" Although at the moment he might be at risk of losing more links with organisations, than making new ones - particularly anything connected to sex trafficking. There will still be constitutional roles. Prince Andrew remains a counsellor of state, unless legislation is passed to change that, which means he is one of four senior royals who could act in place of the Queen if illness meant she was unable to carry out official duties. From the wider Royal Family there might be relief that the case is over, rather than facing aPlatinum Jubilee yearclouded by allegations and more revelations. But for Prince Andrew it's hard to see any way back to public life. Will he be able to take part in jubilee events or official royal family occasions? Even with no admission of guilt, or any concessions to the claims against him, his future relationship with the public, and any appearances at royal events, will be awkward to say the least.

"The cost of living hit a fresh 30-year high last month as energy, fuel and food prices continued to soar and retailers reined in seasonal discounts. Prices surged by 5.5% in the 12 months to January, up from 5.4% in December, increasing the squeeze on household budgets. Inflation is now rising faster than wages and is expected to climb above 7% this year. The government said it was taking action but Labour urged it to do more. Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. If the cost of a bottle of milk was Â£1 and then rises by 5p, milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? Since pandemic restrictions were eased last year, companies have faced higher wage, shipping and energy costs which they have passed on to customers. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said electricity bills were up 19% in the year to January and gas bills up by 28%. Housing costs have also been rising, while the ONS said retailers offered fewer sales and discounts in the New Year, compared to the steeper discounts seen last January. ""Clothing and footwear pushed inflation up this month and although there were still the traditional price drops, it was the smallest January fall since 1990, with fewer sales than last year,"" ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said. The cost of household staples is also rising, with pasta prices up 15%, cooking oil up 16% and margarine soaring 37% in the year to January, squeezing household budgets. Worst to come for food price rises - Tesco Cost of pasta and tomatoes jump as shop prices rise UK wage growth lags rising cost of living On Wednesday,Heineken became the latest big firm to warn it was putting up pricesfollowing Marmite-maker Unilever, bakers Greggs and the supermarket Tesco. Bestway Wholesale, which owns the convenience store chains Costcutter and Bargain Booze, said rising costs ""absolutely"" meant the firm would cut its range of 25,000 low cost products. ""Obviously we're working very hard to push down costs and be as efficient as possible, but it's going to be difficult,"" managing director Dawood Pervez told the BBC. Inflation - which has been at a 30-year high since December - is set to get worse in April when the energy price cap is lifted. It will push up the average household fuel bill up by Â£693 a year in England, Scotland and Wales, while a planned rise in National Insurance will also hit people's pockets. It's worth recalling, as many older readers will, that although the highest inflation in nearly 30 years sounds scary, it's partly because the last three decades have seen one of the least scary periods for rises in consumer prices - certainly compared to the 30 years prior to that. The Bank of England has already put up interest rates twice since December in a bid to tame inflation and could raise them again to 0.75% soon. True, that will be the highest in 13 years. But that's only because 13 years ago, the Bank dropped rates to what were supposed to be emergency lows lasting only a few months due to the financial crisis. It's largely because growth in productivity (and therefore pay and living standards) has been so historically weak for the last 13 years, that the decision-makers on its Monetary policy Committee have only just got up the gumption, in the inflationary storm of the last two months, to start raising them again. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday the government understood the pressures families faced and was taking action. ""We recently stepped in to provide millions of households with up to Â£350 to help with rising energy bills,"" he said. ""We're also helping people on the lowest incomes keep more of what they earn by cutting the Universal Credit taper rate, and freezing alcohol and fuel duties to keep costs down."" But Pat McFadden, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government needed to do more. Last week the Bank of England put up interest rates to 0.5% from 0.25% in a bid to tame inflation. Some analysts believe the Bank - which aims to keep inflation at 2% - will take a more aggressive approach to rate hikes this year and next given the economic picture. But Willem Sels, from HSBC Private Banking and Wealth, predicted it would tread carefully ""as it knows that the factors behind inflation are also the drivers behind lower real income, which threaten to limit economic growth"". ""We expect the Bank rate to rise to 1.25%, lower than the markets' expectation of around 1.75%,"" he said.

"About 500 young people could be eligible for the scheme Every 18-year-old leaving care will be offered Â£1,600 a month for two years under a Welsh government basic income pilot. It is expected about 500 people will be eligible to join the scheme, which could cost up to Â£20m. Officials said it was the highest amount offered on a basic income scheme anywhere in the world. The Welsh Conservatives said it was a waste of money while Plaid Cymru called for the pilot to be expanded. The Â£1,600 a month will be taxed and is expected to be counted as income by the UK government, meaning it would affect someone's eligibility for benefits. It will be unconditional and will not be withdrawn if participants get a job. What is a universal basic income? Spain to use basic income to ease crisis pain Most Welsh homes to get Â£150 payment But the Welsh government is no longer calling the plans a pilot of Universal Basic Income (UBI), where a wider group of people would be given a regular sum of money. Ministers want to test out how the payments could help care leavers be better placed for their transition into independence as adults. Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt said the plans would ""deliver financial stability for a generation of young people that need it most"". Milly said the pilot is a ""good opportunity"" for carers A teenager who has foster parents said the pilot could make care leavers ""equal with everyone else"". Milly, 17, represents the National Youth Advocacy service on the Welsh Youth Parliament and has spoken openly about her care experiences. She said the pilot was a good opportunity, adding people in care were ""disadvantaged financially and this will bring us level"". She said it would be a ""safety net"" for those who have been in care who may not have support from their families. ""Many have been damaged, physical and mentally - this can help pay for private counselling or therapy as often public waiting lists for these services are so long."" Although she welcomes the announcement, Milly still has questions about how the payments will be rolled out: ""I'd like to see evidence that everyone in care will be entitled to it."" Every person leaving care at the age of 18 for the first 12 months of the pilot will be offered the chance to take part. They will receive payments for 24 months, amounting to an income worth Â£19,000 before tax annually, with the first payment a month after their 18th birthday. Officials say it is equivalent to thereal living wage,externaland will be taxed at thebasic rate,external. This video can not be played An experiment in Finland saw 2,000 people paid â¬560 (Â£490) a month, instead of their unemployment benefit. Laura Tams, 42, from Pontardawe, who has been fostering for six years, toldBBC Radio Walesadditional support was also needed for young people leaving care. ""These children have been through things that to you and I belong in nightmares. We cannot all of a sudden expect them at 18 to be able to run a house and to spend that money wisely."" Welsh officials are also promising extra support for those taking part, such as financial wellbeing training. There is no date for when the scheme will be launched, although officials said it was likely to be in the summer. Alex Sommerville, who was in care when she was younger, said she was concerned young people would not want to go into education or work Former youth worker Alex Sommerville, who left care when she was younger, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summersshe did not believe the scheme would encourage care leavers to find work, or study further. Ms Somerville, from Swansea, said: ""Some would still want to go for education or work, but there is a part of me thinking, if you're getting that wage every month, why would you?"" ""I'm very worried about giving young people all of that money and expecting them to know how to spend it in the best way for themselves."" Welsh Conservative spokesman for social partnership Joel James said trials had shown basic income failed to incentivise work and had proven to be a ""waste of public money"". Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman Luke Fletcher said it was a step in the right direction but needed a ""structure around it to enable it to meet the ambition of addressing poverty and unemployment, as well as improving health and financial wellbeing"". The income will be subject to tax UBI is where a government pays all individuals a set amount, regardless of their means. Backers say it could help reduce poverty and be easier and less stressful to navigate than more complex means-tested benefits, but opponents say it is extremely costly and not targeted at those who need it. Once it was announced that the pilot would focus on care leavers, critics argued it was not actually universal. The Welsh government had initially described it as a pilot of UBI, but has now stopped doing so. Asked why it was not a trial of UBI, Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt told BBC Wales that the government needed ""to be realistic"". and the pilot needed to be ""meaningful in terms of the funding"". A basic income for care leavers has been tried in Santa Clara, California, where 72 young adults received $1,000 (Â£739)initially for 12 months,external. In Finland, research on a basic income pilot with jobless people for two years found it did not lead them to find work,although they felt happier. The Welsh government plans were welcomed by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a charity which researches poverty in the UK. To match the level of basic income for care leavers at about the real living wage is bold. With so many people in Wales paid only the national minimum wage there may well be those who think the offer to care leavers is over-generous. But in economic terms if the project is successful and results in better paid work and healthier lives, the long-term benefits would flow back into the economy. While this is not is a pilot of UBI, its outcomes will be relevant to the debate around that.

"Liam Wiggins has lived in a housing executive flat in the New Lodge area of Belfast for 12 years The rent freeze for Northern Ireland Housing Executive properties ""must be seen as a good thing"", a Belfast tenant says. Stormont's communities minister announced on Wednesday she was freezing rents for the coming 2022-23 financial year. Deirdre Hargey says it is to support residents during the ""cost-of-living crisis"". The Housing Executive manages about 85,000 homes in Northern Ireland. Liam Wiggins has lived in a housing executive flat in the New Lodge area of Belfast for 12 years. He said that with the cost of living generally becoming more expensive, any freeze should be welcomed. ""You go into the supermarket and small increases add up - a penny here, a penny there,"" he said. ""It might not be a big difference but it's not going up. ""If the Housing Executive rent was to go up by Â£10 a month even, to some people that's a massive difference - it's the difference between saying yes and no to something."" Mr Wiggins said while his rent was not too high, others in the area can pay up to Â£130 a week. ""That's nearly a mortgage,"" he said. ""Social housing was introduced to provide affordable housing. ""So for many this (rent freeze) is one less thing to worry about. It's a good thing."" Several utilities firms have announced large price increases in recent months, putting pressure on household finances. Deirdre Hargey said she wanted to support residents who were facing soaring fuel and household bills Somecompanies have increased gas and electricity tariffs for domestic customers several timesover the past year. The cost of food, petrol and other essentials has also gone up andover the course of 2021 inflation roseto 5.4%. Ms Hargey said she took the decision to prevent ""any further financial burden on individuals and families trying hard each day to make ends meet"". ""As communities minister my priority is to support people, particularly the most vulnerable, who are facing soaring fuel and household bills,"" she said. ""Right now, tenants need security and a freeze in their rents will provide a bit of stability on an important housing cost in an uncertain climate."" Heather Graham lives in a property in Bangor which is run by a housing association and will not benefit from the rent freeze. She says the announcement for housing executive tenants is ""unfair"" and feels other low-income households are being left out. ""I would prefer to be living in a Housing Executive house but unfortunately that (housing association) is what I got,"" Ms Graham said. ""A place in the Housing Executive is nearly half of what I pay and I still have to pay for the increase in heating costs and food. ""I also live on my own so I have to do it all with a low income."" Heather Graham says she lives alone and struggles with the cost of living due to rising fuel and electricity costs Ms Graham said people living in the private sector are also struggling with the cost of living. ""I'm just living and there's no spare money,"" she said. ""I'm paying an extra Â£10-20 for fuel, gas and electric than I normally would and then there's food shopping and food for my cat. ""I don't get help from the government and I wasn't eligible for the winter fuel payment after Christmas."" The Housing Executive is a non-departmental public body but it is subject to the overall direction and control of the minister for communities. The minister does not have control over independent social housing providers, but she has asked housing associations to consider the financial pressures tenants are facing when setting next year's rent.

"The cost of living hit a fresh 30-year high last month as energy, fuel and food prices continued to soar and retailers reined in seasonal discounts. Prices surged by 5.5% in the 12 months to January, up from 5.4% in December, increasing the squeeze on household budgets. Inflation is now rising faster than wages and is expected to climb above 7% this year. The government said it was taking action but Labour urged it to do more. Inflation is the rate at which prices rise. If the cost of a bottle of milk was Â£1 and then rises by 5p, milk inflation is 5%. Why are prices rising so quickly? Since pandemic restrictions were eased last year, companies have faced higher wage, shipping and energy costs which they have passed on to customers. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said electricity bills were up 19% in the year to January and gas bills up by 28%. Housing costs have also been rising, while the ONS said retailers offered fewer sales and discounts in the New Year, compared to the steeper discounts seen last January. ""Clothing and footwear pushed inflation up this month and although there were still the traditional price drops, it was the smallest January fall since 1990, with fewer sales than last year,"" ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said. The cost of household staples is also rising, with pasta prices up 15%, cooking oil up 16% and margarine soaring 37% in the year to January, squeezing household budgets. Worst to come for food price rises - Tesco Cost of pasta and tomatoes jump as shop prices rise UK wage growth lags rising cost of living On Wednesday,Heineken became the latest big firm to warn it was putting up pricesfollowing Marmite-maker Unilever, bakers Greggs and the supermarket Tesco. Bestway Wholesale, which owns the convenience store chains Costcutter and Bargain Booze, said rising costs ""absolutely"" meant the firm would cut its range of 25,000 low cost products. ""Obviously we're working very hard to push down costs and be as efficient as possible, but it's going to be difficult,"" managing director Dawood Pervez told the BBC. Inflation - which has been at a 30-year high since December - is set to get worse in April when the energy price cap is lifted. It will push up the average household fuel bill up by Â£693 a year in England, Scotland and Wales, while a planned rise in National Insurance will also hit people's pockets. It's worth recalling, as many older readers will, that although the highest inflation in nearly 30 years sounds scary, it's partly because the last three decades have seen one of the least scary periods for rises in consumer prices - certainly compared to the 30 years prior to that. The Bank of England has already put up interest rates twice since December in a bid to tame inflation and could raise them again to 0.75% soon. True, that will be the highest in 13 years. But that's only because 13 years ago, the Bank dropped rates to what were supposed to be emergency lows lasting only a few months due to the financial crisis. It's largely because growth in productivity (and therefore pay and living standards) has been so historically weak for the last 13 years, that the decision-makers on its Monetary policy Committee have only just got up the gumption, in the inflationary storm of the last two months, to start raising them again. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said on Wednesday the government understood the pressures families faced and was taking action. ""We recently stepped in to provide millions of households with up to Â£350 to help with rising energy bills,"" he said. ""We're also helping people on the lowest incomes keep more of what they earn by cutting the Universal Credit taper rate, and freezing alcohol and fuel duties to keep costs down."" But Pat McFadden, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government needed to do more. Last week the Bank of England put up interest rates to 0.5% from 0.25% in a bid to tame inflation. Some analysts believe the Bank - which aims to keep inflation at 2% - will take a more aggressive approach to rate hikes this year and next given the economic picture. But Willem Sels, from HSBC Private Banking and Wealth, predicted it would tread carefully ""as it knows that the factors behind inflation are also the drivers behind lower real income, which threaten to limit economic growth"". ""We expect the Bank rate to rise to 1.25%, lower than the markets' expectation of around 1.75%,"" he said.

"A BBC investigation has found that women's intimate pictures are being shared to harass, shame and blackmail them on a massive scale, on the social media app Telegram. WARNING: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS CONTENT OF A SEXUAL NATURE In the split second Sara found out a nude photo of her had been leaked and shared on Telegram, her life changed. Her Instagram and Facebook profiles had been added, and her phone number included. Suddenly she was being contacted by unknown men asking for more pictures. ""They made me feel like I was a prostitute because [they believed] I'd shared intimate pictures of myself. It meant I had no value as a woman,"" she says. Sara stopped going out after her images were shared on Telegram Sara, not her real name, had shared the photo with one person, but it had ended up in a Telegram group with 18,000 followers, many from her neighbourhood in Havana, Cuba. She now fears strangers in the street may have seen her naked. ""I didn't want to go out, I didn't want to have any contact with my friends. The truth is that I suffered a lot."" She's not alone. After months of investigating Telegram, we found large groups and channels sharing thousands of secretly filmed, stolen or leaked images of women in at least 20 countries. And there's little evidence the platform is tackling this problem. Thousands of miles from Cuba, Nigar is having to adjust to a new life. Nigar says she has been forced to leave her country She's from Azerbaijan, but says she has been forced to leave her homeland. In 2021, a video of her having sex with her husband was sent to her family, and then posted in a Telegram group. ""My mum started crying and told me: 'There's a video, it was sent to me',"" she says. ""I was devastated, absolutely devastated."" The video was shared in a group with 40,000 members. In the footage, Nigar's now ex-husband's face is blurred but hers is clearly visible. She believes her ex secretly filmed her to blackmail her brother, a prominent critic of Azerbaijan's president. She says her mother was told the video would be released on Telegram unless her brother stopped his activism. ""They look at you as if you are a disgrace. Who cares if you were married?"" says Nigar. Nigar says she confronted her ex-husband about the video and he denied making it. We tried to get a comment from him, but he didn't reply. Nigar is still struggling to move on with her life: ""I can't recover. I see therapists twice a week,"" she says. ""They say there is no progress so far. They ask if I can forget it, and I say no."" The pictures of Nigar and Sara were both reported to Telegram, but the platform did not respond. Their experience is far from unique. The BBC has been monitoring 18 Telegram channels and 24 groups in countries ranging from Russia to Brazil, and Kenya to Malaysia. The total number of subscribers is nearly two million. Watch our investigation on YouTube:Telegram: Why won't you take my nudes down?,external Personal details like home addresses and parents' phone numbers were posted alongside explicit pictures. We saw group administrators asking members to send intimate images of ex-partners, colleagues or fellow-students to an automated account, so they could be published without revealing the identity of the sender. Telegram now says it has more than half a billion active users worldwide - that's more than Twitter - with many attracted by its emphasis on privacy. WhatsApp users flock to rival message platforms 'They wanted to tie me and my child to a horse' Revenge porn: What to do if you're a victim Millions moved to Telegram in January 2021 from WhatsApp, which changed its privacy terms. Telegram has long been popular with pro-democracy protesters in countries with media censorship. Users can post without sharing their name or phone number, and create public or private groups with up to 200,000 members, or channels which can broadcast to an unlimited number of people. Telegram was used to organise mass anti-government protests in Belarus Despite Telegram's reputation for privacy, only the ""secret chat"" option provides end-to-end encryption, which ensures just the two people talking can see the message. It's the default setting on secure chat apps like Signal and WhatsApp. This video can not be played What's behind Telegram's growing popularity? The platform also attracts users seeking a less regulated space, including those who have been banned from other platforms. ""According to Telegram and its owner, they don't want to censor users,"" says Natalia Krapiva, tech legal counsel at digital rights group Access Now. But our research has shown this light-touch approach to moderation has led Telegram to become a haven for the leaking and sharing of intimate images. Telegram does not have a dedicated policy to tackle the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, but its terms of service make users agree ""not to post illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels, bots, etc"". It also has an in-app reporting feature across both public and private groups, and channels where users can report pornography. To test how rigorously Telegram enforced its policies, we found and reported 100 images as pornography via the in-app reporting feature. One month later, 96 remained accessible. We could not locate four others, as they were in groups which we could no longer access. Disturbingly, while we were investigating these groups, an account from Russia also tried to sell us a folder containing child abuse videos for less than the price of a coffee. We reported it to Telegram and the Metropolitan Police, but two months later the post and the channel were still there. The account was only removed after we contacted the Telegram media team. Despite its lenient moderation, Telegram does take action against certain content. AfterApple briefly removed Telegram from its app storebecause of videos like the ones we were offered, Telegram took a more proactive stance on child abuse images. The platform alsoco-operated with EU crime agency Europol in 2019to eliminate a huge amount of Islamic State content that had proliferated on the platform. ""We know that Telegram can remove and [has] been removing terrorist-related content or some kind of very radical political content,"" says Dr Aliaksandr Herasimenka, researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. Members of far-right groups moved to Telegram But the removal of intimate images appears not to be a priority. We spoke to five Telegram content moderators on condition of anonymity. They told us they receive reports from users via an automated system, which they said they sort into ""spam"" and ""not spam"". They said they don't proactively search for intimate images and, as far as they know, Telegram doesn't use artificial intelligence to do that either. This lack of action has led some women to take steps themselves. Joanna reported images that were shared without consent in Telegram Joanna found a naked image of herself from when she was 13 years old in a notorious Malaysian Telegram group. She created a fake Telegram profile to join the group, where she anonymously searched for nude pictures and reported them. She also shared her findings with her friends. Amid intense media pressure, the group was eventually closed down. But during the course of our investigation, we found at least two duplicate groups sharing the same kind of images. ""Sometimes you just feel so helpless, because we tried to do so much to remove these groups. But they're still coming up, so I don't know if there's an end to it, honestly,"" says Joanna. Telegram declined an interview with us, but in a statement it told us it does proactively monitor public spaces and process user reports about content which violates its terms of service. Telegram did not confirm if posting people's intimate images without consent is allowed on the platform, or whether they are removed. The rollout of ads on some public channels on Telegram - along with investment - has signalled thatfounder Pavel Durov is intending to monetise the platform,external. This is likely to increase pressure on Telegram and its libertarian founder to fall more in line with social media rivals such as WhatsApp, which has started to introduce polices against sharing intimate pictures. It remains to be seen how long the company will resist greater moderation as it moves into new markets and starts to generate revenue. For the women whose reputations have been destroyed and lives damaged by the sharing of their intimate images on Telegram, change cannot come soon enough.

"UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is meeting Nato members in Brussels on Wednesday The UK will ""judge Russia by its actions"" after reports it is moving back troops from the border of Ukraine, says Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. He said the UK government would ""take them at their word"", but it was ""too soon to tell"" if the move was genuine. Russia's defence ministryclaimed on Tuesdaythat it had withdrawn some troops conducting military exercises in districts bordering Ukraine. But Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky said the exit was not visible. Nato's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, also said the alliance had not seen any evidence of a departure by Russian troops. Speaking ahead of a meeting of Nato member defence ministers, he said: ""So far we have not seen any de-escalation on the ground - on the contrary, it appears that Russia continues the military build-up."" Reports had suggested that US intelligence believed an invasion could be launched in the early hours of Wednesday. But while that has not happened, US President Joe Biden warned a Russian attack on Ukraine was ""still very much a possibility"", and the human cost would be ""immense"". After a call between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida, the leaders said any invasion would ""shake the foundations of the international order and have severe consequences"". The Ministry of Defence confirmed it was increasing British forces in Estonia, as well as sending additional Apache helicopters to the region, and sending four additional Typhoon jets for air patrols. The department said the increase would bring British troop numbers in the country to the high hundreds, but not thousands. LIVE: Latest on Ukraine crisis Biden: Human cost of Russia attack would be immense How much Russian money is there in the UK? Russia has long been opposed to the former Soviet republic of Ukraine growing closer to Europe and its institutions. President Vladimir Putin has demanded a guarantee from the West that Ukraine will not join Nato - a defensive alliance of 30 countries - but Nato has said it will not close down any future agreements. Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border. President Putin insists Russia is not planning to invade, but the US and European countries - including the UK - have been providing support to Ukraine, such as training and weapons, and numerous governments have told their citizens to leave the country. Pictures made available by the Russian defence ministry claimed to show troops returning from exercises to their bases Analysis by Paul Adams, BBC diplomatic correspondent Think of this crisis as theatre - actors move across the stage, soliloquies are delivered. There are ""sounds off"", ambiguous and open to interpretation. We are all mesmerised by Russia's troop movements, constantly asking ourselves what each set of pictures means. And that's what the director of this theatre, Vladimir Putin, intends. He wants to keep us guessing. It's perfectly possible that the sight of Russian armour, crossing the Kerch strait from Crimea, represents a hoped-for sign of de-escalation. But as Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has reminded everyone, it's way too early to make any reliable judgement on what it all means. Vast numbers of Russian troops remain massed close to Ukraine's borders, arrayed in a fashion that western intelligence agencies can only interpret one way - this is an invasion force. That doesn't mean an invasion is coming. But even as the Kremlin denies it has any hostile intention, it suits President Putin for everyone to think that the stage is set for this drama's big battle scene. The UK has also pledged to impose tougher sanctions on Russia in the event of an invasion. But legislation to carry out the threat still needs to be approved by the British Parliament, which is currently in recess. The BBC understands MPs could be asked to sign off the plan early next week when they return to Westminster to send a message that the measures are ready and waiting. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for ""proper action"" on Russian cash and influence in the UK, adding: ""A failure to act now will only further strengthen Vladimir Putin in his attempts to stalk and menace his neighbours and democracies around the world."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Wallace said the UK was offering offering ""a range of forces - air, sea and land"" in support, with a doubling of troops in neighbouring Estonia and 1,000 more on standby if Nato calls on them. He said the troops would not be deployed if the situation between Russia and Ukraine de-escalated, but added it was ""important we make the plans so Russia knows we are serious about deterrence"". On reports Russia was moving back some of its troops from the border, Mr Wallace said: ""We will take them at their word, but judge them by their actions."" He added: ""I would be the first to be delighted by a de-escalation, we have all been working towards that, but we see 60% of Russia's land forces amassed on the Ukrainian and Belarus borders. ""I am an ex-soldier, that is not normal exercising, especially when you see the depth of deployments."" Earlier, the UK defence secretary told BBC Breakfast the build up of Russian troops on the ground had ""shown the opposite of the rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin"", but no-one knew what the country's leader was thinking. ""President Putin hasn't made a decision yet and, until a decision is made, none of us will know what will happen next."" But he said Russia ""hasn't got its way [as] Nato has not shut out people who wish to apply"". Countries in the West - including the UK - have threatened to introduce tough sanctions on Russia if they invade Ukraine. But what are the possible measures they could introduce? Banning Russia from Swift:The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, is an international banking transaction system. Russia is heavily reliant on Swift due to its multibillion exports of hydrocarbons traded in US dollars. Cutting the country off would terminate all international transactions, trigger currency volatility, and cause massive capital outflows. The US could also ban Russia from financial transactions involving US dollars - the world's reserve currency - meaning Russia would be extremely limited in what it could buy and sell around the world. Targeted export controls:The West could restrict the export of key commodities to Russia, such as goods containing American technology, like semiconductor microchips, which are used in everything from cars to smartphones. Energy restrictions and Nord Stream 2:Russia's economy is hugely dependent on selling gas and oil overseas. But the West could make it illegal for countries and companies to buy oil from the big Russian energy giants such as Gazprom or Rosneft. Europe could also put a halt to Nord Stream 2, a 759-mile proposed pipeline designed to transport gas from Russia to Germany. But Europe is already facing inflation and a cost of living crisis due to low supplies of gas. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Ukraine crisis Target individuals:Not only associates of Vladimir Putin but the Russian president himself. A total of 185 Russian individuals, many of whom were involved in the annexation of the Crimea and the separatist movement in Eastern Ukraine, are already subject to sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans. London clampdown:The British government has threatened to block Russian companies from raising capital in London and to expose property and company ownership. Sanctions could also be imposed to restrict the ability of Russian individuals to invest and live in London. According to the Office for National Statistics, Russian investment in the UK accounted for Â£25.5bn in 2016.

"The UK car industry has called for a watchdog to oversee electric car charging prices and the availability of charge points. The growth in electric vehicles sales is outstripping the rollout of charging points, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. It said a regulator is needed to monitor the market. The government said it was providing Â£1.3bn to expand the charging network. Over the decade between 2011 and 2021 the number of charge points in the UK jumped from about 1,500 to more than 48,000, according to industry figures. But between 2019 and 2021 the number of electric cars on the road increased much faster than charge points were being rolled out. Moreover, the charge point rollout was uneven, going faster in the south of England than in the north, the industry body said. The SMMT called on the government to set up a new regulator called ""Ofcharge"" - the Office of Charging - to monitor the market. Public charging points ""remain critical to consumer confidence and are still relied upon by many commercial fleets, as well as the third of British households that do not have designated off-street parking,"" the SMMT added. Electric vehicles are seen as a way to cut greenhouse gas emissions from transport, whichbecame the largest emitting sector in the UK in 2016,external. But while there is soaring interest in electric cars, this hasn't yet translated into vehicles on the road. In 2020, the number of battery electric cars on the road increased by 114% to a record high of just under 200,000, while the number of plug-in hybrids jumped 35% to just under 240,000. There has also been a sharp increase in interest in second-hand electric cars. However, electric cars remain a tiny fraction of the cars on UK roads, representing just 1.3% of the total. Businesses have been leading the way with fleet purchases, but the car industry is pushing for consumers to buy into electric cars too. However, many people have concerns about electric cars, with two of the main ones being the cost of buying a car, and whether there are enough charge points, including for longer journeys, the car industry says. Last summer MPs also raised concerns about the cost of public charging, saying it was far more expensive than charging a car at home. Energy prices have soared since then. Electric car charging prices 'must be fair' say MPs Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, called for ""clear targets"" and more government support for rolling out charge points. A Department for Transport spokesperson said the government was providing more than Â£1.3bn ""to support the continued roll-out of charge points at homes, businesses and on residential streets across the UK, levelling up our charge point provision while supporting the deployment of rapid charge points on motorways and major A roads in England"". The government will publish its electric vehicle infrastructure plan soon, the spokesperson said, adding: ""We continue to work with local authorities to ensure they are engaged in the transition, and are encouraging them to make use of the on-street residential charge point scheme which last year committed Â£20m for the rollout of public charge points in residential areas.""

"Prince Andrew, Virginia Roberts and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001 There are calls for clarity over Prince Andrew's role in public life and how he will fund a financial settlement, after settling the US civil sexual assault case brought by Virginia Giuffre. The Duke of York agreed to pay an undisclosed sum as part of the settlement, and accepted Ms Giuffre had suffered as a victim of abuse. He made no admission of liability and has always denied the allegations. American lawyer Lisa Bloom said it was a huge victory for Ms Giuffre. ""This is a monumental win for Virginia,"" said Ms Bloom, who represents several of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's victims - adding that it was a win ""for everyday people... standing up against the rich and powerful"". Prince Andrew settles US civil sex assault case Who is Prince Andrew and what titles is he losing? Who is Prince Andrew accuser Virginia Giuffre? Prince Andrew must give up York title - city MP Ms Giuffre had been suing the Duke of York, claiming he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17 - which Prince Andrew has repeatedly denied. On Tuesdayit was announced they had reachedan out-of-court settlement. A statement from their lawyers said the duke would pay an undisclosed sum to Ms Giuffre and make a ""substantial donation"" to Ms Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights. It also said the duke regretted his association with Epstein. Prince Andrew hadpreviously told BBC Newsnightin 2019 he did not regret being friends with Epstein. But no details of the payout to Ms Giuffre have been made public - and there are calls for more detail about where the money will be coming from. Although the exact amount of the financial settlement has not been revealed, reports have speculated that it could run into millions of pounds. The duke receives a Royal Navy pension and a stipend from the Queen's Duchy of Lancaster income. This video can not be played Watch: Lawyer Gloria Allred says Virginia Giuffre could still testify against Prince Andrew Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Gloria Allred, a US attorney who has represented a number of Epstein's victims, said the statement confirming the settlement was ""vague"" and would have been ""carefully negotiated"". ""It's clear that the prince is not saying that he admits that he did anything wrong,"" she said. ""He does say that she has suffered as a victim of abuse. He doesn't say abuse by whom, he doesn't say sexual abuse, he doesn't say that he had anything to do with her."" Ms Allred said the ""war between the two partiesâ¦ will now end"", but added it remained possible that Ms Giuffre could testify in future court cases. ""No settlement such as this one can ever require that an accuser remain silent in the criminal justice system,"" she said. ""A prosecutor could decide to file criminal charges, in which case, Virginia could testify if called on."" This video can not be played Watch: What did Prince Andrew say about Virginia Giuffre's allegations in the 2019 Newsnight interview? Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in 2019 about his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Watch thefull interview on BBC iPlayer. Also speaking to BBC Breakfast, Liz Stein, one of Epstein's accusers, said the settlement had come as a shock, but taking the case to trial would have been ""incredibly difficult"" for Ms Giuffre. ""I think that what Virginia wanted more than anything else was validation and I think that in the settlement she got that,"" she said. ""Whatever he lost as a result of this could never compare to what the victims of Epstein, Maxwell, and the men that we were trafficked to have lost from our lives."" In the statement on Tuesday, Prince Andrew pledged to ""demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Ms Bloom said: ""I am sure that his money would be welcomed in organisations that are struggling to help victims everyday. ""In terms of his personal participation, probably not."" Former Royal Navy officer Rear Adm Chris Parry, who was Prince Andrew's flight commander, added: ""I think really he should look to a private life and enjoy essentially what is a very good privileged lifestyle. But I think he should stay out of the public eye."" If Prince Andrew had gone to court in the US to fight it out with Virginia Giuffre, it would have made headlines as tall as a New York skyscraper. That royal disaster zone has been averted by an out-of-court settlement. But it comes with high costs to Prince Andrew, both financial and reputational, and it will be a long road back before there is any chance of clearing his name in terms of public opinion. Read more here. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour, Labour MP Jess Phillips, who serves as Shadow Minister for Domestic Violence and Safeguarding, said it would be very difficult for Prince Andrew to play a constructive role in combating sex trafficking in future. ""Those who work in sexual violence [and] human trafficking services are certainly not going to have open arms to his allyship... even if it was just finances,"" she said. Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Murray told BBC News transparency was needed about how the settlement will be funded if public money will be involved. Who are Virginia Giuffre's powerhouse lawyers? Who is Prince Andrew's Hollywood lawyer? Ms Giuffre, now 38, claims she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by financier Epstein from the age of 16. Epstein died while awaiting trial in 2019. She claimed the duke sexually assaulted her on three separate occasions in London, New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Prince Andrew said he didn't recall meeting Ms Giuffre and that an incident in which they had sex at the Belgravia home of Ghislaine Maxwell ""didn't happen"". In January, a New York court ruled that the civil action against him could go ahead. Shortly afterwards, Buckingham Palace said the prince's military titles and royal patronages had been returned to the Queen and that he would defend Ms Giuffre's civil case as a ""private citizen"". Speaking to theBBC's Americast podcast, New York lawyer Randy Zelin said of the settlement: ""Both sides gave a little something up, both sides can hold their heads up high"". Speaking in support of the duke, British socialite Lady Victoria Hervey said she hopes the Royal Family could now focus on the upcoming jubilee celebrations, and that ""Prince Andrew can put these false allegations behind him"".

"David Boies and Sigrid McCawley Virginia Giuffre, the woman who sued Prince Andrew for sexual assault, has been represented by two of the most famed and formidable lawyers in America - David Boies and Sigrid McCawley. Mr Boies is renowned for his relentless cross examinations, and famously crushed Bill Gates on the stand in the 1990s. With a storied and colourful career that has spanned six decades, he has represented former Vice-President Al Gore and fought for same-sex marriage rights. Mrs McCawley's relentless interrogation skills helped to bring down Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking ring. She has been working with Epstein's accusers since 2015, and endured intimidation and threats while representing survivors. The duo, who have worked on the case free of charge, were preparing to fly to London next month to question Prince Andrew. Howeveran out-of-court settlement has now been reached in the civil law suit. The prince has always denied any wrongdoing. PROFILE:Who is Prince Andrew's Hollywood lawyer? David Boies, 80, is more commonly found in the deep end of corporate law and has been on both sides of the fight - saving companies from financial ruin, or suing them into it. He started his legal career at leading law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where his boss once described him as ""an eccentric genius"". He attracted high-profile clients and tried to sign up a young Donald Trump, according to the New York Times, but the firm wouldn't let him. In 1997, after 30 years and one-too-many conflicts of interest, he left the firm and took with him one of its biggest clients - George Steinbrenner, the owner of the New York Yankees. ""At the time it was a whirlwind,"" he told the BBC. ""There was so much work to do that I didn't have much time to think about it."" He started his own firm - Boies Schiller Flexner, and is known to be a relentless boss, once telling his exhausted team: ""Do you want to win, or do you want to sleep?"" Indeed, when he sat down to speak with the BBC for this profile, Mr Boies had just recovered from Covid-19, but kept working (remotely) despite feeling unwell, including delivering an address to the Supreme Court. David Boies in 1988 when he was working at Cravath, Swaine & Moore Being one of the most sought-after lawyers in the US comes at a price tag most people can't afford. ""Everybody's entitled to a lawyer, but not everybody is entitled to me,"" he once said. Charging about $2,000 (Â£1,470) per hour, Mr Boies is one of the highest paid lawyers in America. And he enjoys spending the fruits of his labour. He owns a multi-million dollar home that overlooks New York's Central Park, another sprawling home north of the city in Westchester County, a sailing yacht and a vineyard in California. He's been married three times. Wedding number one was when he and his wife were teenagers - they told their parents they were going to the school dance, but eloped to Mexico instead. His second marriage started off controversially as she was married to his law professor when they first got together. And in 1982 he married his third and current wife Mary, who is a well-established lawyer in her own right. David Boies has had six children - two with each wife. Tragically though, two of his children have died - Carol Louise Boies, 48, passed away from lung cancer in 2010 and Jonathan Boies, 50, died in 2019 from a vascular brain condition. He is ""clearly one of the great courtroom lawyers of our time"", US District Judge Jed Rakoff, who has presided over a number of Mr Boies' cases over the years, told the BBC. His intense cross-examinations have become legendary - while defending CBS in a defamation case in 1986, reporters are said to have hummed the Jaws theme song whenever he got up to question a witness. During another trial, he cross-examined an economist for 38 days. And he famously does all of this without ever referring to notes, partly because he is dyslexic. He says his struggle with reading has helped develop his ability to concentrate and memorise important information. In court, he is known for his considered and calm manner of speaking, doing away with legal jargon to explain things clearly and simply. ""The result is that judges and juries have total confidence in him,"" Judge Rakoff said. ""I think a lot of people don't appreciate the hard work that goes into what I do,"" Mr Boies said. ""They see a cross-examination and the performance - what they don't see is the hard work that goes into that performance."" David Boies is known for being a fierce cross-examiner with a formidable memory Vanity Fair dubbed him ""the man who ate Microsoft"" after he eviscerated Bill Gates on the stand ina landmark anti-trust case,external, in which the US government had accused Microsoft of business practices that bullied rivals and quashed competitors. Bill Gates, one of the richest men in the world and arguably one of the smartest, was no match for the litigator, who buried him during 20 hours of gruelling cross-examination. ""I had to learn as much if not more than they knew about the technology,"" Mr Boies said - no small feat for someone who has admitted to barely ever using a computer (although he says he's become far better during the pandemic). Of course, he hasn't won every case - music sharing platform Napster was shutdown after he failed to win their case against the music industry. And in 2000 the US presidential election was on the line when he represented Democratic nominee Al Gore, who was going up against Republican George W Bush. It was one of the closest and most controversial votes in US history, and after a vigorous legal fight the Supreme Court ruled in Bush's favour, who was being represented by Ted Olson. Years later, the professional foes became friends - Mr Boies and Mr Olson joined forces to fight againsta controversial law in Californiathat banned same-sex marriage. They eventually won a 2013 Supreme Court case to overturn the ban, allowing gay marriages to resume in the state. Reminiscing, Mr Boies told the BBC it gave him a fresh perspective on the ""human dimension"" of civil rights cases. ""Going into that litigation, I knew the discrimination against gay and lesbian couples was wrong. I knew it was hurtful and damaging. But when you actually get into that case you really realisehowdamaging and outrageous the discrimination is."" He bore the brunt of intimidation and death threats in both of these cases - during his fight for Al Gore, his teenage son was also targeted and security guards were stationed at their family home for safety. Ted Olson (R) said David Boies is ""an extraordinary lawyer"" and they have remained friends, regularly going on cycling holidays together There have also been various controversies in David Boies career - most notably his firm's work with convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein and Silicon Valley fraudster Elizabeth Holmes. Mr Boies eventually cut his ties with Weinstein, but the disgraced media mogul was a client of Boies Schiller Flexner for many years. It was revealed that the law firm handleda contract hiring an Israeli private detective firm called Black Cube,externalto spy on accusers and journalists. The agency was told to collect intelligence that would help stop any negative press about Weinstein. But despite these efforts, the allegations were published anyway, both inthe New York Times,externalandNew Yorker,external, effectively sparking the #MeToo movement. In a statement to his staff, Mr Boies said it ""seemed at the time like a reasonable accommodation for a long-time client. I regret having done this... It was not thought through, and that was my mistake."" David Boies and his wife Mary pictured with Harvey Weinstein in 2011 His firm has also been accused of victim shaming.A report by the New Yorker in 2017,externaldetails how Boies Schiller Flexner tried to use the sexual history of novelist Emma Cline against her, when she was embroiled in a plagiarism lawsuit with an ex-boyfriend. 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Mr Boies told the BBC his firm is ""absolutely"" being more careful about how its clients are defended, and that people are realising that this kind of victim blaming or shaming doesn't work. ""I think what you're going to see is the kind of mudslinging that has been too much a part of defending accusations of discrimination and sexual harassment will be less and less,"" he said. His reputation took another hit when it was revealed that lawyers at his firm intimidated whistleblowers who were lifting the lid on Silicon Valley CEO Elizabeth Holmes and her failed blood-testing company Theranos. In the exposÃ© Bad Blood, investigative journalist John Carreyrou lays out the aggressive efforts used to defend Holmes and silence Theranos critics, comparing them to the actions of ""thugs"". Elizabeth Holmes: From tech star to convicted fraudster Mr Boies had invested roughly $7 million worth of shares in Theranos. He also sat on the company's board and invited her to his 75th birthday part in Las Vegas. ""I still think she is a very intelligent, charismatic woman,"" he told the BBC. ""Whatever else you think, she is somebody with enormous intelligence and a tremendous work ethic."" Mr Boies has said that his friendship with Weinstein and admiration of Holmes did not blur his professional judgement, but in a profile with the New York Times in 2018, and without naming names, he conceded that he had made mistakes and that ""greater due diligence would have led me to decline the representation"". In the wake of the scandals,there was a mass exodus of up to 100 staff from Boies Schiller Flexner,external, including some of its top attorneys. But Mr Boies laughs off a question of whether he takes it personally - it's just part of the game. Sigrid McCawley, 49, became a managing partner of Boies Schiller Flexner last year after being with the firm for 20 years. Based in Florida, she has been working with Virginia Giuffre and other accusers of Jeffrey Epstein since 2015 and is considered one of America's lead attorneys for sexual abuse cases. She has worked with abuse survivors since her early days of law school, and has sat on the board of two not-for-profit organisations that help children and families in need - ChildNet and Jack and Jill. ""One of the things that makes her so successful working on these cases is her tremendous empathy,"" David Boies said. ""She identifies with people who are suffering injustice."" A mother of four, Mrs McCawley took on Virginia Giuffre's case when she returned from maternity leave after the birth of her youngest daughter. And she admits that it's often hard to find a balance between the demands of the job and leaving the emotional component at the office. ""You get very personal with your clientsâ¦ you come to know them, their pain, their life, what they've been through, how they've survived it,"" she told the BBC. ""It's very personal - I haven't found a good way to separate that. It's just all consuming."" When Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in 2019, she was on safari in South Africa with her family. Using her own satellite phone (which she always travels with, just in case), she was frantically making calls to her clients and the media. ""It was no vacation after that point,"" she said. ""I remember being in tents and I was trying to speak to the New York Times and my kids were in the same room and there were animals outside - it was less than ideal."" Sigrid McCawley says the #MeToo movement ""changed things in a tremendous way"". ""The shift was astronomical. In just that moment, the voices started to be heard and believed,"" she told the BBC. During her work with Epstein's accusers, Mrs McCawley was subject to threatening emails and intimidation, and believes she was followed by ""Epstein's crew"". ""For many years, particularly before #MeToo, I was scared to turn on my car when I would go into the parking lot - it has lived with me."" Sigrid McCawley said she and her clients endured ""a tremendous amount of attackâ¦ it's been really relentless"" But Sigrid McCawley is the first to say that she is not easily intimidated by anything or anyone. Describing how she is often the only woman in a courtroom (and is still all too often mistaken for a court reporter), Mrs McCawley says she is there to do a job and get the answers, regardless of who is being questioned. Her 12-hour deposition of Ghislaine Maxwell in 2016 eventually lead to the British socialite facing criminal charges.The transcript, which was made public in 2020,external, makes for excruciating reading, as the litigator questions Maxwell again and again about sex toys and a Prince Andrew lookalike puppet. Maxwell eventually jumps to her feet and pounds the table in exasperation. Key moments in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Who was Jeffrey Epstein? ""If you have an evasive witness who doesn't want to answer, you have to stay on that,"" she explained. ""You have to be relentless in the pursuit for that information, irrespective of how they're behaving."" She plans to do more pro bono work with abuse survivors, saying ""it has been an absolute privilege to get to work with [Epstein's accusers], as much as it's been very difficult, but I wouldn't go back and do it any differently.""

Ted Olson (R) said David Boies is ""an extraordinary lawyer"" and they have remained friends, regularly going on cycling holidays together There have also been various controversies in David Boies career - most notably his firm's work with convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein and Silicon Valley fraudster Elizabeth Holmes. Mr Boies eventually cut his ties with Weinstein, but the disgraced media mogul was a client of Boies Schiller Flexner for many years. It was revealed that the law firm handleda contract hiring an Israeli private detective firm called Black Cube,externalto spy on accusers and journalists. The agency was told to collect intelligence that would help stop any negative press about Weinstein. But despite these efforts, the allegations were published anyway, both inthe New York Times,externalandNew Yorker,external, effectively sparking the #MeToo movement. In a statement to his staff, Mr Boies said it ""seemed at the time like a reasonable accommodation for a long-time client. I regret having done this... It was not thought through, and that was my mistake."" David Boies and his wife Mary pictured with Harvey Weinstein in 2011 His firm has also been accused of victim shaming.A report by the New Yorker in 2017,externaldetails how Boies Schiller Flexner tried to use the sexual history of novelist Emma Cline against her, when she was embroiled in a plagiarism lawsuit with an ex-boyfriend. 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Mr Boies told the BBC his firm is ""absolutely"" being more careful about how its clients are defended, and that people are realising that this kind of victim blaming or shaming doesn't work. ""I think what you're going to see is the kind of mudslinging that has been too much a part of defending accusations of discrimination and sexual harassment will be less and less,"" he said. His reputation took another hit when it was revealed that lawyers at his firm intimidated whistleblowers who were lifting the lid on Silicon Valley CEO Elizabeth Holmes and her failed blood-testing company Theranos. In the exposÃ© Bad Blood, investigative journalist John Carreyrou lays out the aggressive efforts used to defend Holmes and silence Theranos critics, comparing them to the actions of ""thugs"". Elizabeth Holmes: From tech star to convicted fraudster Mr Boies had invested roughly $7 million worth of shares in Theranos. He also sat on the company's board and invited her to his 75th birthday part in Las Vegas. ""I still think she is a very intelligent, charismatic woman,"" he told the BBC. ""Whatever else you think, she is somebody with enormous intelligence and a tremendous work ethic."" Mr Boies has said that his friendship with Weinstein and admiration of Holmes did not blur his professional judgement, but in a profile with the New York Times in 2018, and without naming names, he conceded that he had made mistakes and that ""greater due diligence would have led me to decline the representation"". In the wake of the scandals,there was a mass exodus of up to 100 staff from Boies Schiller Flexner,external, including some of its top attorneys. But Mr Boies laughs off a question of whether he takes it personally - it's just part of the game. Sigrid McCawley, 49, became a managing partner of Boies Schiller Flexner last year after being with the firm for 20 years. Based in Florida, she has been working with Virginia Giuffre and other accusers of Jeffrey Epstein since 2015 and is considered one of America's lead attorneys for sexual abuse cases. She has worked with abuse survivors since her early days of law school, and has sat on the board of two not-for-profit organisations that help children and families in need - ChildNet and Jack and Jill. ""One of the things that makes her so successful working on these cases is her tremendous empathy,"" David Boies said. ""She identifies with people who are suffering injustice."" A mother of four, Mrs McCawley took on Virginia Giuffre's case when she returned from maternity leave after the birth of her youngest daughter. And she admits that it's often hard to find a balance between the demands of the job and leaving the emotional component at the office. ""You get very personal with your clientsâ¦ you come to know them, their pain, their life, what they've been through, how they've survived it,"" she told the BBC. ""It's very personal - I haven't found a good way to separate that. It's just all consuming."" When Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in 2019, she was on safari in South Africa with her family. Using her own satellite phone (which she always travels with, just in case), she was frantically making calls to her clients and the media. ""It was no vacation after that point,"" she said. ""I remember being in tents and I was trying to speak to the New York Times and my kids were in the same room and there were animals outside - it was less than ideal."" Sigrid McCawley says the #MeToo movement ""changed things in a tremendous way"". ""The shift was astronomical. In just that moment, the voices started to be heard and believed,"" she told the BBC. During her work with Epstein's accusers, Mrs McCawley was subject to threatening emails and intimidation, and believes she was followed by ""Epstein's crew"". ""For many years, particularly before #MeToo, I was scared to turn on my car when I would go into the parking lot - it has lived with me."" Sigrid McCawley said she and her clients endured ""a tremendous amount of attackâ¦ it's been really relentless"" But Sigrid McCawley is the first to say that she is not easily intimidated by anything or anyone. Describing how she is often the only woman in a courtroom (and is still all too often mistaken for a court reporter), Mrs McCawley says she is there to do a job and get the answers, regardless of who is being questioned. Her 12-hour deposition of Ghislaine Maxwell in 2016 eventually lead to the British socialite facing criminal charges.The transcript, which was made public in 2020,external, makes for excruciating reading, as the litigator questions Maxwell again and again about sex toys and a Prince Andrew lookalike puppet. Maxwell eventually jumps to her feet and pounds the table in exasperation. Key moments in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Who was Jeffrey Epstein? ""If you have an evasive witness who doesn't want to answer, you have to stay on that,"" she explained. ""You have to be relentless in the pursuit for that information, irrespective of how they're behaving."" She plans to do more pro bono work with abuse survivors, saying ""it has been an absolute privilege to get to work with [Epstein's accusers], as much as it's been very difficult, but I wouldn't go back and do it any differently.""

"Francine Wheeler with a photograph of her son Ben A company that made a rifle used in one of the US's deadliest school shootings has settled with the families of victims for $73m (Â£53.9m). The settlement from Remington Arms comes in response to a lawsuit brought by the families of nine of 26 victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. The case marks the first time a gun-maker has faced liability for a mass shooting. Until now, the industry had immunity from litigation. Each family will receive a share of the settlement, but other details of the deal were not disclosed. Josh Koskoff, a lawyer representing the families of victims, said they were delighted by the outcome because their focus was on ""preventing the next Sandy Hook"". ""Our loss is irreversible, in the sense this outcome is neither redemptive nor restorative,"" Lenny Pozner and Veronique De la Rosa, whose six-year-old son Noah was killed, wrote in testimony released after the settlement. ""What is lost remains lost,"" they added. ""However, the resolution does provide a measure of accountability in an industry that has thus far operated with impunity."" In the early 2000s, the National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups pushed states and the federal government to enact laws to protect gun manufacturers from financial responsibility for deaths that result from the use of their products. Their crowning achievement was the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, passed by Congress and signed by President George W Bush in 2005. That law has shielded many gun manufacturers from legal exposure, but it was not enough to protect Remington and its Bushmaster AR-15, used by Adam Lanza to kill 20 children and six school employees in Newtown, Connecticut. The families of five adults and four child victims claimed Remington pitched its rifle to ""at-risk"" young men in violent video games and with bombastic, militaristic language. They pointed to an exception in the federal law that prohibited illegal marketing claims. Remington's decision to pay $73 million to end the lawsuit suggests the company weighed the risk of going to trial and opened its chequebook. This settlement may encourage state governments and gun-control advocates who want to hold manufacturers financially responsible for gun violence to press on - offering them hope that existing legal protections won't always be an insurmountable obstacle. One example cited by Mr Koskoff featured an image of a rifle along with the words ""consider your man card reissued"". The lawsuit alleged that the campaign formed part of a larger and ""aggressive"" marketing effort that included product placement in video games. ""I had thought the case was about the gun, but it's just as much about the greed,"" he said at a news conference on Tuesday. The $73m amounts to the full amount of coverage available from Remington's four insurers. US city rules gun owners must have liability cover ""This victory should serve as a wake up call, not only to the gun industry, but also the insurance and banking companies that prop it up,"" he added. ""For the insurance and banking industries, it's time to recognise the financial cost of underwriting companies that elevate profit by escalating risk."" Last July, Remington - the oldest gun-maker in the US - offered $33 million to (Â£24m) to the families, falling far short of the $225m they'd sought in court. They rejected the offer and said they had collected enough evidence to prove misconduct from Remington. Remington, which was founded in 1816 and is based in North Carolina, has denied the allegations and claimed that there was no evidence that its marketing practices were related to the shooting at Sandy Hook. The company could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday. Despite the deaths of young children aged six and seven, no new national gun control laws were passed in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting.
