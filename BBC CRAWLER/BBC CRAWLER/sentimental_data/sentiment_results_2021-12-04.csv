"This video can not be played Watch villagers survey the aftermath of Mt Semeru's eruption in eastern Java Rescuers in Indonesia are searching for survivors in villages buried by hot ash, after Mt Semeru on Java island erupted on Saturday. Fourteen people are known to have died and dozens were injured, emergency authorities said. One volunteer in the nearby district of Lumajang filmed police and military officials working to dig out bodies with their bare hands. Houses were buried to their rooftops and vehicles wholly submerged. Taufiq Ismail Marzuqi, who filmed the struggle to excavate bodies, told Reuters the rescue efforts were ""very dire"". At least 11 villages in Lumajang, in East Java, were coated in volcanic ash. At least 56 people have been injured, with many suffering burns after they mistook the hot mud flow for flooding. ""There were 10 people carried away by the mud flow,"" said Salim, who lives in the village of Kampung Renteng. ""One of them was almost saved. He was told to run away but said 'I can't, who will feed my cows?'"" One man searching for survivors said 10 people were missing in his village. Another described what happened. ""Locals here thought it was just usual floods. We did not know it was hot mud. All of sudden, the sky turned dark as rains and hot smoke came. Thankfully, it was raining so we could breathe,"" he told AFP. Some relatives of the victims in Lumajang in East Java say they have not yet been able to collect their loved ones as some of the bodies have not yet been identified. People inspect their village which has been buried by volcanic ash A spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) said the injured were being treated at various hospitals and medical facilities. Some 1,300 people have been evacuated from the area so far, the agency said, and 10 sand mine workers who were trapped in buildings have been saved. Rescue shelters have been equipped with food, face masks, tarpaulins and body bags. The evacuation has been hampered by choking smoke, a power blackout, and rainstorms during the eruption which turned the debris into mud. An important bridge from the area to the nearby city of Malang was also severed during the eruption. Vehicles have been submerged and homes badly damaged A man and boy flee their home in Lumajang district, along with their livestock The head of Indonesia's geological agency said heavy rain falling on the lip of Mt Semeru's crater caused it to partially collapse, triggering the eruption. There had been no increase in seismicity to suggest any change in magma flow, he said. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) in Darwin, Australia said the ash cloudfrom the eruption appeared to have dissipated,external. The VAAC provides advice to the aviation industry about the location and movement of potentially hazardous volcanic ash. Ash that solidifies on cooler parts of plane engines can disrupt airflow, which can lead to engines stalling or failing completely. It also affects visibility for the pilots and can affect air quality in the cabin - making oxygen masks a necessity. Mt Semeru is in a near permanent state of eruption and regularly spews ash up to about 4,300m, so Saturday's eruption was a ""pretty significant increase in intensity"", Campbell Biggs, a meteorologist at the VAAC, told the BBC. What does volcanic ash do to planes? Mt Semeru rises 3,676m above sea level and is among Indonesia's almost 130 active volcanoes. The last time it erupted was in December 2020, forcing thousands of residents to take shelter. Indonesia sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where continental plates meet, causing frequent volcanic and seismic activity. Videos shared by emergency officials and local media showed residents running away as a giant ash cloud rose behind them. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was found with 130 injuries following his death The couple who killed six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes will have their sentences reviewed after claims they are too lenient. Emma Tustinwas jailed for 29 years on Friday for murder and child cruelty and Arthur's father, Thomas Hughes, was given 21 years for his manslaughter. The Attorney General's Office said the jail terms will be reviewed to ""determine whether they were too low"". It comes after Tory MP Julian Knight said the sentences were too lenient. Emma Tustin was convicted of Arthur's murder while his father, Thomas Hughes, found guilty of his manslaughter The Attorney General's Office has 28 days from the date of sentence to review a case, assess whether it falls under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme, and decide whether to refer to the Court of Appeal. It comes after several football clubs paid tribute to Arthur during Saturday's games. Coventry City, who hosted West Bromwich Albion, Walsall, who met Swindon in the FA Cup second round, and Wolverhampton Wanderers, who played Liverpool, asked supporters to take part in an applause in the sixth minute. Elsewhere, supporters clapped during the West Ham vs Chelsea game as a picture of Arthur was shown on a screen. Birmingham City - the club Arthur supported - tweeted on Saturday that players and fans staged a ""touching tribute"" by also clapping during their game away at Millwall. This video can not be played Birmingham City and Millwall fans pay tribute to Arthur Labinjo-Hughes with applause In a video posted on Twitter on Saturday, Solihull MP Mr Knight said he was standing in Cranmore Road close to Tustin's former home where Arthur was tortured and died in June 2020. He said there was a ""real sense of palpable loss"" over his death, adding there was also ""a sense of anger and questions how this was allowed to happen, how these horrible monsters were allowed to inflict this horrible torture on this young defenceless boy"".

Sentencing the couple on Friday, Mr Justice Wall told Coventry Crown Court the case was ""one of the most distressing and disturbing"" he had ever dealt with, adding that neither defendant had shown any remorse and their behaviour had been ""spiteful and sadistic"". Arthur died of a head injury inflicted by Tustin on 16 June. Tustin photographed him lying on the floor, and shared the image with Hughes. The missed opportunities to save Arthur Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: A life cut short by cruelty Dad and partner guilty of killing six-year-old Video played to jurors showed Arthur just before he died struggling to pick up his pillow and blanket because he was so weak and crying out that nobody loved him. After his death, he was found to have 130 injuries. A serious case review is under way over his death after social workers visited the house in the months before he died and found no cause for concern. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would leave ""no stone unturned"" to find out what went wrong and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he would make a statement about the case to Parliament on Monday.

"This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line US President Joe Biden and Russia's Vladimir Putin will speak via video call on Tuesday, the White House says, amid mounting tensions over Ukraine. It comes after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had evidence that Russia had made plans for a ""large scale"" attack on Ukraine. But he added it was unclear if Mr Putin had made a final decision to invade. Russia has denied any such intention, and accused Ukraine of executing its own troop build-up. In a statement released on Saturday evening, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Mr Biden will ""underscore US concerns with Russian military activities on the border with Ukraine and reaffirm the United States' support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine"" during his call with the Russian president. Ukraine says Russia has deployed armoured vehicles, electronic warfare systems and 94,000 troops along their shared border. Citing intelligence reports, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January. The Russian troop movement has strained already tense relations between Russia and the US. EXPLAINER:Why Russia is stoking border tensions with Ukraine On Friday, Mr Biden warned he would make it ""very, very difficult"" for Mr Putin to ""go ahead and do what people are worried he may do"". The US and its European allies have discussed imposing sanctions on Russia if it takes aggressive action. While Ukraine is not a Nato member, it has close ties with the bloc and has received Western weapons including US Javelin anti-tank missiles. Russian officials have denied any plans for an invasion, and say the border troops are there for military exercises. Moscow has accused Nato of engaging in provocative behaviour by holding drills in the Black Sea, off Crimea. Russia's foreign ministry also said Ukraine has itself sent 125,000 troops to their shared border. Kyiv declined to comment on the claim. This video can not be played Biden Putin Summit: Decoding the world leaders' body language This week Britain's most senior military officer said ""we have to be on our guard"" about the potential for conflict in the region. Gen Sir Nick Carter told the BBC that he ""distinctly hoped"" there would not be a war with Russia, but added that Nato would have to be ready for that eventuality. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine are nothing new. In 2014 Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and soon after started to back a separatist insurgency in Ukraine's east. More recently, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has imposed sanctions on a powerful friend of President Putin and banned broadcasts by three pro-Russian TV stations. Presidents Biden and Putin heldtheir only face-to-face talks in Geneva in June. Reuters reports that their last phone call was on 9 July. Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line.

"The government will announce a new drugs strategy on Monday overhauling the drug recovery and treatment system, the BBC has learned. The announcement is expected to pledge Â£700m over three years to tackle problem drug use. Measures will include a large focus on diversion, a tactic designed to remove drug users from the criminal justice system and get them into healthcare. Ministers are also set to announce investment to tackle drug gangs. The overhaul has been drawn together by at least six government departments, the BBC understands. It will form part of a wider week of law and order announcements for the government, which a source involved in the drug strategy said had frustrated some of those who worked on it - who wanted to make clear these measures would lead to fewer crime-focused drug policies. The government has been asked to comment. The diversion strategy is expected to be twofold - short prison sentences for drug use will be complemented with recovery programmes and there will be less emphasis on prosecuting people caught with substances. In Scotland, prosecutors can refer people accused of drugs offences for ""diversion"" and their Lord Advocate said people caught with Class A drugs could be given a police warning instead of facing prosecution - a move theConservatives had previously said amounted to ""de facto decriminalisation."" In his party conference speech, Boris Johnson accused Labour of ""decriminalising"" hard drugs after the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Scotland's decision was ""probably the right thing to do"" but was an ""independent decision"". It is understood there will also be more emphasis in the strategy on helping drug users leaving prison to find work and safe housing. The Times newspaper has reported drug treatment courses could be offered to those whose offending was fuelled by drugs, giving people the option of changing their behaviour or facing tougher punishments. One source heavily involved in forming the review told the BBC ""ministers have now accepted this [problem drug use] is a chronic health condition"". However, they added that because of concerns over how that would be viewed by the public and Conservative voters, it was unlikely the government would want it to be the focus of the announcement. The Home Office have been asked to comment. As well as an overhauling of drug treatment plans, ministers are expected to outline more investment to tackle county lines drug gangs - urban drug dealers who sell to customers in more rural areas via dedicated phone lines. The strategy has been drawn up as a response to the Dame Carol Black review of drugs, which reported in the summer and made 32 recommendations. The BBC understands the government has accepted at least 31 of these. The Times also reported the government was seeking to amend its Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill to give judges extra powers to order drug testing of anyone serving a community sentence. It said drug testing could be required on arrest for all crimes, and the government could outline plans to use drug dealers' phones to identify and support addicts - and warn people they were not anonymous when buying drugs. Drug and alcohol treatment sees rise in deaths Review urges more funding for addiction treatments in England Focus on drug users' recovery not crime - review The BBC has been told there will be no announcements on heroin-assisted treatment or drug consumption rooms. Politicians in Scotland have been pushing for the latter to be introduced but a source involved in forming the drugs strategy said Number 10 and the Home Office were ""very against"" them and a move in that direction may have needed a change to the Misuse of Drugs Act. Both departments have been asked to comment. Those drawing up the drug strategy were instructed to find ways of introducing new policies without having to make major change to legislation. It is also understood there will likely be no specific funding in this strategy for prisons to replace methadone with ""abstinence-based rehab"", a plan reported by The Telegraph newspaper earlier this week. However, Dominic Raab, the justice secretary, is expected to publish a separate strategy on problem drug use in prisons in a government White Paper. A government source told the BBC this would allow governors in prison to be more empowered to take action against drug use. The Times reported it could also involve further ""airport-style"" security in prisons for visitors and staff to prevent drug smuggling. A source also told BBC News ministers were set to announce a consultation on a ""Victims' Law"" that could enshrine victims' rights in law. One plan piloted already has given rape victims the automatic right to pre-record evidence in trials - which has been taking place at several crown courts in Leeds, Liverpool, London and Durham. Separately, the Law Commission - an independent body that advises government - is expected to release its review into hate crime soon to explore how to make existing laws more effective. On Saturday, the children's charity Plan International UK responded to reports the Law Commission was set to make public sexual harassment a criminal offence by saying the government ""must act swiftly on this recommendation"". The Telegraph reported the review would stop short of making misogyny a hate crime, which some campaigners had called for.

"Two separate overdrafts were created on Ben's accounts ""Thinking about [what happened] over and over is actually very worrying and quite scary."" Ben Gregory, 26, believes his drink was spiked during a night out in Clapham in south London. Criminals then stole Â£18,000 using financial apps on his smartphone. A leading campaigner in the fight against fraud says Ben's case appears to show fraudsters adopting the ""sinister"" tactic of spiking drinks to steal money from victims. David Clarke, chair of the Fraud Advisory Panel charity, says people need to be alert to the dangers this Christmas party season. ""Fraudsters are cruel, devious people online and in the physical world and people must be alert to the danger of having drinks spiked especially in the Christmas party season when people may be off guard."" Ben was on a night out with friends in the summer which went from a nice meal out, to a nightclub... before he woke up late the next morning unable to remember anything. ""I remember waking up... with no phone or wallet,"" he says. ""I woke up pretty dizzy, dazed, not quite sure what happened so obviously I was a bit alarmed. ""I had some messages on my work phone from my brother saying: 'Is everything OK [because] there's been an overdraft opened on our joint account. What's happened?'. ""As soon as I saw that alarm bells started ringing because I didn't do that."" What's being done to stop drink spiking? 'You definitely think twice about socialising now' Spiking people's drinks is more commonly associated with men targeting women and with sexual assault as the motive. But in Ben's case he believes criminals had targeted him with the intention of both defrauding and stealing from him. Over the space of just a few hours dozens and dozens of transactions, transfers and withdrawals were carried out using Ben's phone and cards. Two, separate, Â£2,500 overdrafts were created on his accounts and money in his savings accounts was transferred to current accounts and then withdrawn. In total, just over Â£18,000 was stolen from his American Express and Revolut cards and from HSBC and Monzo accounts. ""I felt terrible, absolutely terrible. Over the next few days I couldn't stop thinking about it, couldn't sleep, found it very hard to eat. Because ultimately I felt worried and vulnerable."" Police investigating Ben's case say they have made several arrests. Inspector Dave Laurie, who works for London's Metropolitan Police, says many incidents of people having their drinks spiked, whether with sexual assault or theft/fraud as the motive, go unreported due to things like embarrassment or memory loss. ""[Spiking] is a terrible thing that's happening and it goes further than the impact on the individual. This impact will run deep. And we know many spiking incidents will go unreported,"" he says. ""There are ways we can try to help stop spiking happening in the first place. ""Buy your own drink, watch it being poured, don't accept drinks from strangers, never leave it unattended. If your drink doesn't taste right throw it away and get another one."" Despite lots of calls to police forces, charities and other organisations it's impossible to know how common spiking fraud is. But David Clarke from the Fraud Advisory Panel says even if it is rare the consequences for victims are very real. ""We need big tech and big finance to come up with big solutions to this type of fraud, "" he says. ""Yes individuals can try to help themselves, but there is a limit to what people can do. ""We need technology to help because the crooks are so advanced."" As for Ben, American Express and Monzo refunded the money that was stolen within a matter of days. HSBC and Revolut initially refused to refund but reversed that decision once Money Box started investigating the case. HSBC said; ""We have thoroughly reviewed this case, and in light of new information we will be providing a full refund to Mr Gregory. ""While we have an experienced team looking for signs of fraud, as this case sadly highlights, scammers are unscrupulous criminals who use a range of techniques to exploit their victims. We encourage people to be on their guard."" Revolut said; ""This was an unusual case where the payments were authorised by the customer but, as is now clear, without his consent. We very much regret the distress and inconvenience to Mr Gregory and we have reimbursed his losses."" If you've been a victim of crime help and support is available atBBC Action Line.

Joao Pedro behind him. I left them more chances, but I didnât like to lose
without having a chance to do something more. Today maybe we were a little
tired. We didnât combine as well as against Chelsea, but itâs OK. ""There is a very good battle between the other teams. There

well at the moment. At the end of the season we want to celebrate some titles. ""My first four goals this season were all tap-ins. My last
few goals have been quite good, but it doesnât matter â what matters is putting the ball in the back of the net. Iâm happy to help the team. ""We know we donât have a striker. We have a lot of players who
try to get in the box and finish. We try to put numbers in the box. If we arrive in the box, weâre

"This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line US President Joe Biden and Russia's Vladimir Putin will speak via video call on Tuesday, the White House says, amid mounting tensions over Ukraine. It comes after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had evidence that Russia had made plans for a ""large scale"" attack on Ukraine. But he added it was unclear if Mr Putin had made a final decision to invade. Russia has denied any such intention, and accused Ukraine of executing its own troop build-up. In a statement released on Saturday evening, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that Mr Biden will ""underscore US concerns with Russian military activities on the border with Ukraine and reaffirm the United States' support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine"" during his call with the Russian president. Ukraine says Russia has deployed armoured vehicles, electronic warfare systems and 94,000 troops along their shared border. Citing intelligence reports, Ukraine's Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January. The Russian troop movement has strained already tense relations between Russia and the US. EXPLAINER:Why Russia is stoking border tensions with Ukraine On Friday, Mr Biden warned he would make it ""very, very difficult"" for Mr Putin to ""go ahead and do what people are worried he may do"". The US and its European allies have discussed imposing sanctions on Russia if it takes aggressive action. While Ukraine is not a Nato member, it has close ties with the bloc and has received Western weapons including US Javelin anti-tank missiles. Russian officials have denied any plans for an invasion, and say the border troops are there for military exercises. Moscow has accused Nato of engaging in provocative behaviour by holding drills in the Black Sea, off Crimea. Russia's foreign ministry also said Ukraine has itself sent 125,000 troops to their shared border. Kyiv declined to comment on the claim. This video can not be played Biden Putin Summit: Decoding the world leaders' body language This week Britain's most senior military officer said ""we have to be on our guard"" about the potential for conflict in the region. Gen Sir Nick Carter told the BBC that he ""distinctly hoped"" there would not be a war with Russia, but added that Nato would have to be ready for that eventuality. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine are nothing new. In 2014 Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and soon after started to back a separatist insurgency in Ukraine's east. More recently, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has imposed sanctions on a powerful friend of President Putin and banned broadcasts by three pro-Russian TV stations. Presidents Biden and Putin heldtheir only face-to-face talks in Geneva in June. Reuters reports that their last phone call was on 9 July. Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line.

"Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was found with 130 injuries following his death The couple who killed six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes will have their sentences reviewed after claims they are too lenient. Emma Tustinwas jailed for 29 years on Friday for murder and child cruelty and Arthur's father, Thomas Hughes, was given 21 years for his manslaughter. The Attorney General's Office said the jail terms will be reviewed to ""determine whether they were too low"". It comes after Tory MP Julian Knight said the sentences were too lenient. Emma Tustin was convicted of Arthur's murder while his father, Thomas Hughes, found guilty of his manslaughter The Attorney General's Office has 28 days from the date of sentence to review a case, assess whether it falls under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme, and decide whether to refer to the Court of Appeal. It comes after several football clubs paid tribute to Arthur during Saturday's games. Coventry City, who hosted West Bromwich Albion, Walsall, who met Swindon in the FA Cup second round, and Wolverhampton Wanderers, who played Liverpool, asked supporters to take part in an applause in the sixth minute. Elsewhere, supporters clapped during the West Ham vs Chelsea game as a picture of Arthur was shown on a screen. Birmingham City - the club Arthur supported - tweeted on Saturday that players and fans staged a ""touching tribute"" by also clapping during their game away at Millwall. This video can not be played Birmingham City and Millwall fans pay tribute to Arthur Labinjo-Hughes with applause In a video posted on Twitter on Saturday, Solihull MP Mr Knight said he was standing in Cranmore Road close to Tustin's former home where Arthur was tortured and died in June 2020. He said there was a ""real sense of palpable loss"" over his death, adding there was also ""a sense of anger and questions how this was allowed to happen, how these horrible monsters were allowed to inflict this horrible torture on this young defenceless boy"".

Sentencing the couple on Friday, Mr Justice Wall told Coventry Crown Court the case was ""one of the most distressing and disturbing"" he had ever dealt with, adding that neither defendant had shown any remorse and their behaviour had been ""spiteful and sadistic"". Arthur died of a head injury inflicted by Tustin on 16 June. Tustin photographed him lying on the floor, and shared the image with Hughes. The missed opportunities to save Arthur Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: A life cut short by cruelty Dad and partner guilty of killing six-year-old Video played to jurors showed Arthur just before he died struggling to pick up his pillow and blanket because he was so weak and crying out that nobody loved him. After his death, he was found to have 130 injuries. A serious case review is under way over his death after social workers visited the house in the months before he died and found no cause for concern. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would leave ""no stone unturned"" to find out what went wrong and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he would make a statement about the case to Parliament on Monday.

"Hundreds of households across Scotland are beginning a second weekend without power after Storm Arwen. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said that as of 17:30 about 350 customers, either single properties or small rural groups of homes, were still without power. The majority of homes still without power are in Aberdeenshire, with small numbers in Perthshire, Angus and Moray. SSEN said it planned to reconnect the remaining homes on Saturday. All homes across southern and central Scotland affected by the power outages have now been reconnected, say SP Energy Networks. About 5,100 home remain cut off in the north-east of England and Cumbria, where energy firmNorthern Powergrid has apologised for poor communication with affected households. Thousands to receive Storm Arwen power cut compensation Surviving seven days of winter without electricity Military personnel helping recovery in Aberdeenshire Mark Rough, SSEN director of operations, said: ""Our teams continued to make really good progress throughout Friday night and they're working really hard, in worsening weather conditions, to restore the last remaining customers throughout the course of today. ""Our localised network has sustained significant damage and through a combination of repairs and mobile generation we will continue to work until all power is restored. ""We have over 700 field staff carrying working with support from other network operators and contractors from across the UK and Ireland, and everyone is making a real effort to reconnect the final homes as quickly and safely as possible."" Meanwhile it has emerged that staff from the Queen's Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire have been involved in helping local people affected by the power cuts. They have been delivering hot water to cottages that were cut off, and providing soup to elderly local residents. The castle laundry also took in washing for those in need from more remote areas. The military has been called into help with welfare visits in the affected areas Louise Yule, of the Halfpenny farm animal sanctuary near Inverurie, Aberdeenshire toldBBC Good Morning Scotland, they were still without electricity eight days on from the storm. The sanctuary - home to a range of animals including reptiles, hamsters and guinea pigs - has been donated generators to allow them to pump water from its well and provide some heat. She said: ""It's been very stressful. ""To begin with it was only the vulnerable small animals we've been able to keep warm but you are running around making sure the generators keep running and the animals have plenty water and food."" The sanctuary is spending up to Â£100 a day keeping the generators running. Jim Savege, chief executive of Aberdeenshire Council, said it still had hundreds of volunteers out checking on people. He said: ""I know a lot of people who have animals have had a really tough time. ""We declared a major incident at 10:32 on Saturday morning and have been working flat-out since then - the main issue is the scale of the challenge facing SSEN. ""We're going to be moving into the recovery phase this weekend, getting people back on their feet and taking stock."" The power firms' response to the damage caused by Storm Arwen is to be reviewed by energy regulator Ofgem. The watchdog's review will focus on the resilience of the system and the network companies' emergency response.

spirit, togetherness and commitment. Iâm satisfied. Our Premier League starts
now. ""I spoke with the players before â I said be careful because
when we press higher, they move the ball very well. Itâs much better to stay a
little deeper and counter-attack. We played better, but of course there are
players who, one against one, have the key to open every defensive line. ""I wanted to give some more opportunities to [Joshua] King, so I put
Joao Pedro behind him. I left them more chances, but I didnât like to lose
without having a chance to do something more. Today maybe we were a little
tired. We didnât combine as well as against Chelsea, but itâs OK. ""There is a very good battle between the other teams. There

"Tian Tian gave birth to cubs before her arrival in Edinburgh They arrived like rock stars 12 years ago and like any modern celebrity couple, their love life has been the source of endless speculation ever since. But now the UK's only giant pandas are returning to China without having any offspring, despite eight attempts at artificial insemination. Tian Tian and Yang Guang - also known as Sweetie and Sunshine - were treated like VIPs (Very Important Pandas?) when they arrived in Edinburgh on 4 December 2011. Watch: 10 Ups & Downs of the panda pair They flew in from south west China in their own specially-chartered cargo plane - a 5,000 mile journey by Panda Express. Back then it had been 17 years since there was last a giant panda in a British zoo and from the moment their plane touched down at Edinburgh airport there was enormous public interest. The loan arrangement for the pandas had taken five years to negotiate, with Edinburgh Zoo agreeing to pay the Chinese an annual fee of one million dollars (currently about Â£790,000). It was also stipulated that any cub or cubs born in Edinburgh would be sent back to China when they were two years old. Tian Tian and Yang Guang arrived by a special Panda Express cargo plane Some thought the huge loan fee was a risk, since other zoos in Australia and North America had not recouped their costs. And conversely, there were critics who claimed the pandas had been brought to Scotland less for conservation reasons than in the hope of making money. One of those was animal activist Yvonne Taylor who said the pandas were like rock stars in that ""wherever they go, they draw the crowds"". But, she said, it was worth remembering there had never been any successful reintroduction of pandas born in captivity back to the wild. The man in charge of Edinburgh's pandas when they arrived, Iain Valentine, countered by saying that working with the animals in captivity inspired investment in the natural world. On their arrival, the pandas were instant celebrities and Edinburgh Zoo was transformed with banners and merchandise. An old gorilla enclosure was turned, at a cost of Â£250,000, into a forest residence for Tian Tian and Yang Guang. Their every need was catered for, with their favourite bamboo being supplied from the Netherlands. The pandas were an instant hit, boosting visitor numbers at the zoo In 1994 the last panda to live in Britain - London Zoo's Ming Ming - was sent back to China early after attempts to mate her with Bao Bao, a male loaned from Berlin Zoo, ended in savage and terrible fights. But Edinburgh's two giant pandas seemed to settle in well in their separate dens and the zoo decided that given the chance, they might breed. Both, at eight years old, were mature young adults and both had had cubs before, although not with each other. The tricky part is that female giant pandas have a breeding window of just 36 hours once a year. In the wild, they may take several mates but the panda team in Edinburgh wanted to see if Yang Guang would be successful with Tian Tian on his own. In early April 2012, the big day came. Yang Guang (L), the male panda, looks through the fence of his enclosure at Tian Tian Tian Tian was first artificially inseminated in April 2013 Male giant Panda Yang Guang (Sunshine) has already fathered cubs Tian Tian had been calling out to Yang Guang. He had been bulking up, building his strength by eating extraordinary amounts of bamboo. He was even doing handstands to leave his scent all over the enclosure. A Chinese panda expert judged the moment was right and the 'love tunnel' gate between the two cages was opened. It was much riskier than most first meetings. Sometimes giant pandas will attack each other. They didn't. They played, wrestled, made a lot of noise and Tian Tian got a little edgy. The pandas have boosted visitor numbers to Edinburgh zoo They were separated and put together again. They tried to mate several times but Tian Tian's tail got in the way. The keepers attempted to move it with a long pole but the two pandas failed to get together and the moment passed for another year. So in the spring of 2013, Edinburgh's giant panda team moved to a twin-track strategy. They would give their giant pandas the chance to mate naturally but they would also use artificial insemination, with samples taken both from Yang Guang and from Bao Bao, the German panda whose sperm had been frozen before he died. Once again, Tian Tian and Yang Guang did not mate when they were put together, but artificial insemination was successful. Unfortunately, Tian Tian's pregnancy didn't go full term. Tian Tian became pregnant again in 2014 but the outcome was the same. In 2015 zookeepers said they believedthe panda had ""reabsorbed"" her pregnancy in late term. In total, there have been eight unsuccessful attempts at artificial insemination, the latest one in 2021. Animal rights campaigners have accused the zoo of being more focused on making money than the pandas' welfare. The animal rights group Peta said: ""Pandas are not breeding machines but individuals, and they should not be sexually assaulted to produce babies for human amusement and display."" The zoo hoped the pandas would be big-money signings The zoo is a charity, which reported a Â£1.2m deficit before the pandas arrived. During their first year, that was turned into a surplus of Â£2.4m. Another similar surplus was reported in 2013. Visitor numbers have dropped since and the Covid pandemic caused major problems for the venue. The original 10-year loan deal was extended by two years due to the pandemic but it was announced in the summer that they would be heading back to China in early December. Visitor numbers and interest has risen again as people realised their days were numbered and Thursday is the final chance to see the pandas at Edinburgh Zoo. In the end, the two ageing rock stars, both now 20, turned out to be less of a love story and more like noisy neighbours.

game again. ""Take a look at what happened with Manchester United, Chelsea, we did it
really well, we didnât allow them to be who they are. I have a lot of respect for
Claudio [Ranieri], but itâs not that [Watford] didn't want to do it â we didn't allow it."" On Jack Grealish's missed chances:""Jack knows it, he has to do better but â in footfall,
putting the ball in the net is the hardest thing. ""Sometimes you score goals with three actions, sometimes
with 15 â itâs football. ""Thanks to Bernardo [Silva]. Because he made me not wrong [when Guardiola said Silva is the league's best player currently]. So thanks to him. I know heâs so humble, there are thousands - well not thousands - but
top players in the Premier League, and he is doing so well. ""There are always things we have to improve, but right now,
the guys are playing at a really good level."" Two games at the top in Europe tonight. Real Sociedad play La Liga leaders Real Madrid and Lens face Ligue 1's big dogs PSG. Follow live text commentary of those games here. FT: Watford 1-3 Man City Watford Watford boss Claudio Ranieri, speaking to Sky Sports:""If
somebody had told me some time ago, 'Claudio, against Manchester City, Manchester
United and Chelsea you would get three points', I would sign immediately. ""I saw a good spirit â at 3-0 down
we never gave up. We conceded a lot of counter-attacks but I saw a lot of
spirit, togetherness and commitment. Iâm satisfied. Our Premier League starts
now. ""I spoke with the players before â I said be careful because
when we press higher, they move the ball very well. Itâs much better to stay a
little deeper and counter-attack. We played better, but of course there are
players who, one against one, have the key to open every defensive line. ""I wanted to give some more opportunities to [Joshua] King, so I put
Joao Pedro behind him. I left them more chances, but I didnât like to lose
without having a chance to do something more. Today maybe we were a little
tired. We didnât combine as well as against Chelsea, but itâs OK. ""There is a very good battle between the other teams. There
are six or seven teams at least in the battle [to stay] in the Premier League.
Iâm confident. Of course we make mistakes, but we work to improve these
mistakes."" FT: Watford 1-3 Man City Manchester City Man City boss Pep Guardiola speaking to Sky
Sports:""A really good performance. We missed lot of chances, hopefully
next time we'll convert more. ""The game should be over quicker. We are in the routine that weâre
consistent in the way we play. In football the most difficult thing is to put the ball in the net. But the
way we played was really good again. ""We saw the games against United, Chelsea, Leicester, they
created a lot of chances by running on the counter, we stopped that today. ""We scored three beautiful goals and we could have scored
more."" On Bernardo Silva:""I want to say thank you, because after what I said [in midweek about Silva being the best in the league currently], the
performance he has done â he didnât make me wrong. So thank you. He did me well.
He is so important for us."" On Jack Grealish:""I asked Jack if he enjoyed playing in this position touching the
ball lots, he said yes. But still itâs a bit away from his best condition, he had
some days off, he needs rhythm, but itâs good. We have players that can play in
different positions."" Watford 1-3 Man City Phil Foden has scored 21 goals and
assisted a further 15 in all competitions for Manchester City since the start
of last seasonl. His 36 total goals and assists are three more than any other
player for the club over this period. Watford 1-3 Man City Watford have failed to keep a clean
sheet in any of their last 25 Premier League matches, the longest run of any
side since Burnleyâs 29 between November 2009 and
August 2014. FT: Watford 1-3 Manchester City Manchester City Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva, speaking to Match of the Day:""It's definitely a very good win. We should
probably have scored some more goals. At half-time it was 2-0 and it could have
been three or four. Weâre not even half way through [the season], thereâs a lot of work to
do. ""Each game demands different things. The team worked very
well with the ball. We moved them very well, controlled the counter-attacks
and kept putting pressure on them. We have to keep going. Itâs just the
beginning. ""Liverpool arenât dropping a lot of points, Chelsea arenât
dropping a lot of points. This season is going to be tough because the teams are
strong â not only the big teams but also the small teams. Itâs not going to be
easy. Weâre going to have to work a lot to win games.â Arsenal, Manchester United, Leicester, Chelsea and Manchester City were Watford's last five opponents. They beat United and lost to the other four. Watford are three points above the bottom three. FT: Watford 1-3 Man City Watford Watford captain Moussa Sissoko speaking to Sky
Sports:""It was a very tough game. We knew that City are always tough, they have a big squad. ""After our performance against Chelsea, we put in a lot of effort.
Today it wasnât easy, we gave out best, we tried to play our way â but City
were better than us, we have to accept that. ""The most important thing is to stay together and fight - we did that. ""This is our mentality now - to
commit from the beginning to the end. ""We can say our season will start now against an opponent that
is more our level and hopefully we'll play as we did today and get some points. ""The most important thing was to give our best, We did it and
we can be proud of that, even if we lose. We have time to check what was wrong
today and get ready for the next game. ""Weâve played some big teams in a row, we competed well
against the best teams in England, now weâll play against teams that are more
or less our level."" FA Cup There have been loads of FA Cup second-round games today. Watch the highlights here. Watford 1-3 Man City Bernardo Silva is Manchester City's top scorer in the Premier League this season with seven. Only Mohamed Salah (13), Jamie Vardy (9) and Diogo Jota (8) have scored more. No other City players have more than three goals. FT: Watford 1-3 Man City Manchester City Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva, speaking to Sky
Sports:""It was definitely a very good job in the first half. The team started very
well, creating chances and not allowing them to counter-attack. We scored two
in the first half but should have scored more. ""Itâs always better to be top of the league
than second, third or fourth, but itâs still early. Itâs so close â Liverpool are just one point behind us, Chelsea are two points behind us. ""Liverpool and Chelsea are having an amazing season. Itâs
tough for us to compete with each other. We know the level and standards are
very high. We know how tough it is to win the most competitive league in the
world. Weâre going to try our best, like we always do. ""This season Iâve been
scoring a lot and Iâll try to keep it that way. What matters is that weâre top of the
league now and the team are doing very
well at the moment. At the end of the season we want to celebrate some titles. ""My first four goals this season were all tap-ins. My last
few goals have been quite good, but it doesnât matter â what matters is putting the ball in the back of the net. Iâm happy to help the team. ""We know we donât have a striker. We have a lot of players who
try to get in the box and finish. We try to put numbers in the box. If we arrive in the box, weâre
going to score goals. ""Weâre happy with the moment and happy with our form. We have
to keep working because this season is going to be very tough."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (standard network charges apply) Agree with Lucas (19.24) and I'm a city fan.

"Hundreds of households across Scotland are beginning a second weekend without power after Storm Arwen. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said that as of 17:30 about 350 customers, either single properties or small rural groups of homes, were still without power. The majority of homes still without power are in Aberdeenshire, with small numbers in Perthshire, Angus and Moray. SSEN said it planned to reconnect the remaining homes on Saturday. All homes across southern and central Scotland affected by the power outages have now been reconnected, say SP Energy Networks. About 5,100 home remain cut off in the north-east of England and Cumbria, where energy firmNorthern Powergrid has apologised for poor communication with affected households. Thousands to receive Storm Arwen power cut compensation Surviving seven days of winter without electricity Military personnel helping recovery in Aberdeenshire Mark Rough, SSEN director of operations, said: ""Our teams continued to make really good progress throughout Friday night and they're working really hard, in worsening weather conditions, to restore the last remaining customers throughout the course of today. ""Our localised network has sustained significant damage and through a combination of repairs and mobile generation we will continue to work until all power is restored. ""We have over 700 field staff carrying working with support from other network operators and contractors from across the UK and Ireland, and everyone is making a real effort to reconnect the final homes as quickly and safely as possible."" Meanwhile it has emerged that staff from the Queen's Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire have been involved in helping local people affected by the power cuts. They have been delivering hot water to cottages that were cut off, and providing soup to elderly local residents. The castle laundry also took in washing for those in need from more remote areas. The military has been called into help with welfare visits in the affected areas Louise Yule, of the Halfpenny farm animal sanctuary near Inverurie, Aberdeenshire toldBBC Good Morning Scotland, they were still without electricity eight days on from the storm. The sanctuary - home to a range of animals including reptiles, hamsters and guinea pigs - has been donated generators to allow them to pump water from its well and provide some heat. She said: ""It's been very stressful. ""To begin with it was only the vulnerable small animals we've been able to keep warm but you are running around making sure the generators keep running and the animals have plenty water and food."" The sanctuary is spending up to Â£100 a day keeping the generators running. Jim Savege, chief executive of Aberdeenshire Council, said it still had hundreds of volunteers out checking on people. He said: ""I know a lot of people who have animals have had a really tough time. ""We declared a major incident at 10:32 on Saturday morning and have been working flat-out since then - the main issue is the scale of the challenge facing SSEN. ""We're going to be moving into the recovery phase this weekend, getting people back on their feet and taking stock."" The power firms' response to the damage caused by Storm Arwen is to be reviewed by energy regulator Ofgem. The watchdog's review will focus on the resilience of the system and the network companies' emergency response. The power firms will be paying compensation to those affected by the prolonged power cuts.

Three mothers who suffered birthing complications due to Covid feature in a video by the NHS and government. One mother, Tanviha, said: ""My family were told it was unlikely I'd survive and to prepare for the worst.""

Tanviha, who works in anaesthesiology and research in Manchester, said the vaccine was not available to pregnant women when she caught Covid. She quickly became seriously ill and was taken to intensive care and her son was delivered by emergency C-section. ""The day after I was intubated, the nurse told them they were going to switch the machine off, but instead I was transferred to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine, which is a last resort for patients with severe heart and lung failure, and it saved my life,"" she said. ""The first time I saw my son he was two months old. It's the scariest experience of mine and my family's life but I'm just grateful that me and my son are alive.

"Lord Frost (left) and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ (right) - pictured at a previous meeting - will speak again next Friday The European Commission's MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has said it is ""time to get medicines across the finish line"" after holding talks with Lord Frost about the Northern Ireland Protocol. Mr Å efÄoviÄ had previously said it was his top priority to agree a deal to guarantee the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He added that ""strong political will"" was needed to advance on other issues. UK Brexit Minister Lord Frost said the progress had ""been quite limited"". ""The gap between our positions is still significant,"" he said. ""There has been some potential convergence on the medicines issue but agreement has not been reached."" Lord Frost said the UK's position remained that it would use Article 16 of the protocol, which would suspend parts of the deal, if solutions could not be found on the issues being negotiated. The two men will speak again next Friday. The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 as a way to avoid a hardening of the Irish land border. It leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, meaning goods can flow freely with the Republic of Ireland. However, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control, amounting to an ""Irish Sea border"". A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What is Article 16 and why does it matter? The EU has proposed reforms to improve the operation of the protocol. However, the UK wants more fundamental change, including removing the European Court of Justice from an oversight role. Guaranteeing supplies of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland is one of the big issues to resolve On Wednesday, Mr Å efÄoviÄ suggestedthe EU could act unilaterally to guarantee the supply of medicinesfrom Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The EU brought forward proposals earlier this year which it said would tackle the medicines issue. Mr Å efÄoviÄ said: ""I would 100% prefer if we can present this good solution as a joint approach. ""But I'm fully conscious of time. ""I have to be very, very clear that we are ready to move on our own if it's not possible at this stage to push on a joint approach."" The UK is continuing to threaten the use of the Article 16 mechanism if agreement cannot be reached on all protocol issues. It allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally suspended if they are causing serious problems or leading to diversion of trade.

"This video can not be played Watch villagers survey the aftermath of Mt Semeru's eruption in eastern Java Rescuers in Indonesia are searching for survivors in villages buried by hot ash, after Mt Semeru on Java island erupted on Saturday. Fourteen people are known to have died and dozens were injured, emergency authorities said. One volunteer in the nearby district of Lumajang filmed police and military officials working to dig out bodies with their bare hands. Houses were buried to their rooftops and vehicles wholly submerged. Taufiq Ismail Marzuqi, who filmed the struggle to excavate bodies, told Reuters the rescue efforts were ""very dire"". At least 11 villages in Lumajang, in East Java, were coated in volcanic ash. At least 56 people have been injured, with many suffering burns after they mistook the hot mud flow for flooding. ""There were 10 people carried away by the mud flow,"" said Salim, who lives in the village of Kampung Renteng. ""One of them was almost saved. He was told to run away but said 'I can't, who will feed my cows?'"" One man searching for survivors said 10 people were missing in his village. Another described what happened. ""Locals here thought it was just usual floods. We did not know it was hot mud. All of sudden, the sky turned dark as rains and hot smoke came. Thankfully, it was raining so we could breathe,"" he told AFP. Some relatives of the victims in Lumajang in East Java say they have not yet been able to collect their loved ones as some of the bodies have not yet been identified. People inspect their village which has been buried by volcanic ash A spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) said the injured were being treated at various hospitals and medical facilities. Some 1,300 people have been evacuated from the area so far, the agency said, and 10 sand mine workers who were trapped in buildings have been saved. Rescue shelters have been equipped with food, face masks, tarpaulins and body bags. The evacuation has been hampered by choking smoke, a power blackout, and rainstorms during the eruption which turned the debris into mud. An important bridge from the area to the nearby city of Malang was also severed during the eruption. Vehicles have been submerged and homes badly damaged A man and boy flee their home in Lumajang district, along with their livestock The head of Indonesia's geological agency said heavy rain falling on the lip of Mt Semeru's crater caused it to partially collapse, triggering the eruption. There had been no increase in seismicity to suggest any change in magma flow, he said. The Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) in Darwin, Australia said the ash cloudfrom the eruption appeared to have dissipated,external. The VAAC provides advice to the aviation industry about the location and movement of potentially hazardous volcanic ash. Ash that solidifies on cooler parts of plane engines can disrupt airflow, which can lead to engines stalling or failing completely. It also affects visibility for the pilots and can affect air quality in the cabin - making oxygen masks a necessity. Mt Semeru is in a near permanent state of eruption and regularly spews ash up to about 4,300m, so Saturday's eruption was a ""pretty significant increase in intensity"", Campbell Biggs, a meteorologist at the VAAC, told the BBC. What does volcanic ash do to planes? Mt Semeru rises 3,676m above sea level and is among Indonesia's almost 130 active volcanoes. The last time it erupted was in December 2020, forcing thousands of residents to take shelter. Indonesia sits on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"" where continental plates meet, causing frequent volcanic and seismic activity. Videos shared by emergency officials and local media showed residents running away as a giant ash cloud rose behind them. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Arthur Labinjo-Hughes was found with 130 injuries following his death The couple who killed six-year-old Arthur Labinjo-Hughes will have their sentences reviewed after claims they are too lenient. Emma Tustinwas jailed for 29 years on Friday for murder and child cruelty and Arthur's father, Thomas Hughes, was given 21 years for his manslaughter. The Attorney General's Office said the jail terms will be reviewed to ""determine whether they were too low"". It comes after Tory MP Julian Knight said the sentences were too lenient. Emma Tustin was convicted of Arthur's murder while his father, Thomas Hughes, found guilty of his manslaughter The Attorney General's Office has 28 days from the date of sentence to review a case, assess whether it falls under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme, and decide whether to refer to the Court of Appeal. It comes after several football clubs paid tribute to Arthur during Saturday's games. Coventry City, who hosted West Bromwich Albion, Walsall, who met Swindon in the FA Cup second round, and Wolverhampton Wanderers, who played Liverpool, asked supporters to take part in an applause in the sixth minute. Elsewhere, supporters clapped during the West Ham vs Chelsea game as a picture of Arthur was shown on a screen. Birmingham City - the club Arthur supported - tweeted on Saturday that players and fans staged a ""touching tribute"" by also clapping during their game away at Millwall. This video can not be played Birmingham City and Millwall fans pay tribute to Arthur Labinjo-Hughes with applause In a video posted on Twitter on Saturday, Solihull MP Mr Knight said he was standing in Cranmore Road close to Tustin's former home where Arthur was tortured and died in June 2020. He said there was a ""real sense of palpable loss"" over his death, adding there was also ""a sense of anger and questions how this was allowed to happen, how these horrible monsters were allowed to inflict this horrible torture on this young defenceless boy"".

The Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme allows anyone to lobby the Attorney General to refer a case to the Court of Appeal for review. Experienced senior judges then consider the term given to an offender and how it compares with any relevant guidelines on sentencing and previous similar crimes. Sentencing the couple on Friday, Mr Justice Wall told Coventry Crown Court the case was ""one of the most distressing and disturbing"" he had ever dealt with, adding that neither defendant had shown any remorse and their behaviour had been ""spiteful and sadistic"". Arthur died of a head injury inflicted by Tustin on 16 June. Tustin photographed him lying on the floor, and shared the image with Hughes. The missed opportunities to save Arthur Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: A life cut short by cruelty Dad and partner guilty of killing six-year-old Video played to jurors showed Arthur just before he died struggling to pick up his pillow and blanket because he was so weak and crying out that nobody loved him. After his death, he was found to have 130 injuries. A serious case review is under way over his death after social workers visited the house in the months before he died and found no cause for concern. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would leave ""no stone unturned"" to find out what went wrong and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said he would make a statement about the case to Parliament on Monday.

"Frank Beddard of Cowshill, County Durham, said he could have done with a visit from the Army the day after the storm hit The electricity supplier for the North East has warned that some homes will still be without power on Wednesday - 12 days after Storm Arwen struck. Northern Powergrid (NP) said its ""best estimate"" was that all of its 6,600 customers still off would be connected by Thursday. Earlier, a major incident was declared in Northumberland and the Army was drafted in to County Durham for help. In Cumbria, 1,300 households were without electricity on Friday evening. Regulator Ofgem has launched an ""urgent"" review into the energy network companies' response to the widespread cuts. Army called in after a week without power Ofgem to review power networks' response Surviving seven days without electricity Jim Cardwell, head of policy development at NP, said it had restored connections to about 98% of its customers since the storm knocked out supplies to hundreds of thousands of homes across the north of England on 26 November. ""We've allocated 700 engineering projects to get people back on,"" he told BBC Look North. ""Two hundred of those projects will be taking place up until Sunday with the other 500 to come. ""Our best estimate is that will take until the end of Wednesday for those 500 projects."" In response to criticism of NP's communication, he vowed it would ""start publishing information on our website, sending text messages and, where we have a community presence, giving out information locally"". He added: ""We don't want any distractions from getting the lights back on, communicating with our customers and helping with the welfare support with the other agencies involved in the emergencies that have been declared in County Durham and Northumberland."" Army personnel have been handing out parcels with hot water bottles, hats, blankets, gloves and thermal socks Durham County Council called in troops, it said, because NP was ""unable to confirm when supplies will be restored"". On Friday, soldiers distributed hundreds of emergency aid parcels to people entering a second week without power. Frank Beddard, of Cowshill, was grateful for his but said it had come too late. ""I just wish they'd been here six days ago. Boris Johnson should have said 'there's a problem up north, get up there'."" Jessica Teasdale, from Stanley in County Durham, told the PA news agency: ""People are frustrated and angryâ¦ everyone is getting ill. ""I saw my elderly neighbour yesterday, the poor man looked like he was going to cry. He's a vulnerable person but no-one has checked on him and he lives alone."" Her partner, Christopher Bertram, added: ""I am sitting looking at Jessica now and she is a wreck. She hasn't slept or washed properly for a week. She's like a shell of a person. It is awful to watch."" Christopher Bertram and Jessica Teasdale eventually had their power restored on Friday Durhamdeclared a major incidenton Thursday with supplies to thousands of properties in areas including Teesdale and Weardale still off. Amanda Hopgood, leader of Durham County Council, said she understood people were frustrated with the time it took to ramp up their response. ""Once we've made certain everyone is all right we will be looking to see what lessons can be learned. ""It wasn't that we weren't doing anything last weekend, we were, but as well as the power cuts we had roads blocked with snow."" Candles are in high demand in parts of Northumberland, the county's high sheriff said Northumberland County Council cited ""ongoing concerns"" for affected communities when it announced its additional measures. But there are also people who have questioned the amount of time it took for the authority to respond. Joanne Riddell, the high sheriff of Northumberland, said: ""Many people have told me there should have been a major incident declared on Saturday. ""Right now there is an urgent need for candles, torches, batteries, gas cylinders, camping stoves, hot water bottles and dry, cut firewood."" Jonathan Strutt, 43, lives in the small village of Kirkheaton in Northumberland, with his severely disabled 72-year-old mother, his wife and five-year-old son. They lasted three nights in their home before it became too cold and friends in Hexham took them in. He told the BBC: ""We have had to move into a friend's living room with my mother sleeping on their sofa while we sleep on the floor with our child. ""We have received no proactive information from Northern Powergrid even though she is on their vulnerable list. ""Communication has been woefully inadequate. ""I'm now having to try and source a generator and electrician on my own to get some power as the website is saying we won't be reconnected until Wednesday. ""We have convinced our son that it's a big adventure and he has been very resilient, he has a great outlook and we're thankful for that. ""We have been helping elderly people in the village - some of them are in their 90s - and I am worried for them. ""We can keep up but it's a matter of time before they get poorly and sick."" Compensation cap scrapped The energy regulator Ofgem has agreed new levels of compensation with the network companies for those affected by Storm Arwen: The Â£700 limit on compensation has been removed Â£70 compensation is available for first 48 hours, then Â£70 for every 12 hours thereafter without power Those customers without power for more than six-and-a-half days can now claim up to Â£140 a day Paul Turton in Weatherhill received a welfare check from members of the armed forces Fiona Hanlon, a Lib Dem councillor on South Lakeland District Council, has been co-ordinating a support hub in Cartmel, Cumbria, for those affected by the power cuts. She told BBC 5 Live: ""The problem has been that there is no connection between the people who are trying to organise the fixing and the actual hard, real-time data - so people who are off are not able to contact Electricity North West (ENWL) and therefore the company doesn't know they are off. ""Their systems have been overwhelmed, we do understand that and we know they have engineers out but the situation is going to go into next week there's no doubt about that because the damage is so severe. ""We had an 86-year-old woman who needs to go into hospital has been told she will have an 13-hour wait in the cold. We were trying to bring the ambulance time down, but we had no means of doing it. ""A family we've been trying to help all week have livestock, two small children and the gable end of their house was pulled down when the pylon collapsed. It's still across their garden and drive. ""They've been in darkness since Friday. A van has been there today to assess it, but they can't give a date or time [to fix it]. ENWL said it had drafted in specialist engineers from elsewhere in the country but spokesperson Paul Bircham said he was ""not sure the Army have the engineering capability to work on high voltage electricity networks"". ENWL said it had discussed how it could use Army support with logistics, providing generators and visiting vulnerable customers but had been ""able to manage this locally"".
