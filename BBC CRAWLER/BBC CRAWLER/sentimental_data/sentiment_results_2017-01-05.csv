"The Ocean Medallion device can be incorporated into jewellery or simply carried in a passenger's pocket Cruise line Carnival has launched a wearable gadget that allows services on board its ships to be personalised for guests. The Ocean Medallion can be worn as a necklace, clip or keychain - or carried in a passenger's pocket. It will connect to onboard facilities, tracking meal orders or automatically unlocking guests' cabins as they approach the door, for example. One analyst said it would have to be easy to use to entice holidaymakers. Details of the project are being outlined at two events at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. The Ocean Medallion will connect with onboard systems on the first specially modified cruise ship later this year via internet of things technology. Other ships in the Princess Cruises fleet will then adopt the system. It was a ""great example of novel uses for smart devices"", said Martin Garner, a tech analyst at CCS Insight. ""But, because people go on cruises as a relaxing holiday, the system will have to work flawlessly and be super-easy to use,"" he told the BBC. He also noted that, just like upgrading a big hotel, the venture would likely be a costly one - which adds ""a degree of risk"" for Carnival. The first ship to feature the system is the Regal Princess. 75 miles (121km) of cables, more than 7,000 sensors and 4,000 digital screens were installed in 10 days in Italy. ""It's going to almost be invisible to guests,"" the company said. ""They're not going to realise how much [technology] is in here."" Cruise ship workers will receive information about guests via the Ocean Medallion Holiday resorts and cruise ship brands, including Carnival's rival Royal Caribbean Cruises, increasingly offer visitors access to various services via smart bands or wearable gadgets. The undertaking could perhaps foreshadow what life in a future smart city or internet of things-powered shopping complex might be like. But Mr Garner noted not everyone had the capabilities of a cruise line. ""City officials don't typically have the budget to do grand-vision schemes like the Carnival re-fit,"" he said. ""In fact, most cities are chronically short of budget."" Connection technologies built in to the Ocean Medallion include Bluetooth and near field communications (NFC), according to the travel firm. This will allow passengers to: unlock their cabin doors automatically as they approach find the location of friends and family onboard the ship pay for merchandise without using cash or a credit card navigate from one place to another on the vessel connect guests to a gambling platform accessible around the ship The service will be offered first to passengers on the Regal Princess ship from November. It will then be expanded to the Royal Princess and Caribbean Princess ships in 2018.

"It sounds like a game-changing innovation: earbuds that auto-translate other languages. But what was supposed to be their big coming out week isn't going quite as planned. If you're a tech company wanting to grab the world's attention this week, then Las Vegas could be the worst place to be. Why? Well in the biggest CES yet with nearly 4,000 exhibitors you really have to shout very loud to be heard above the hubbub. If you're a giant company like Sony or Samsung, you pour your marketing millions into spectacular press conferences and ridiculously lavish show floor exhibits where visitors have to wade through deep pile carpet while being deafened by loud music and shouty demos. So, to arrive here as a one-man start-up with an innovative idea and try to get some attention requires both courage and optimism. Luckily Danny Manu has both in spades. When I met this young man from Manchester on the Las Vegas strip, he was desperately tired. His cheap flight from the UK had been delayed by eight hours on a Miami stopover - so he'd dashed from the airport to his AirBnB to drop his luggage, then came straight on to see me. ""I've not slept for 24 hours but I'm still moving and looking forward to it,"" he says. Danny's product is called Clik and he bills it as the world's first truly wireless earbuds with live translation. The idea is that you speak in one language and another person hears what you say in their own tongue, either via their own earbuds or via theMyManu,externalsmartphone app that Danny has already developed. Smart wireless earbuds and instant translation are ideas which giants like Apple and Google are addressing with vast investments - so it seems ridiculously ambitious for a one-man band to take them on. He has already had a few setbacks. He'd hoped to have a working model ready for CES, but says delays in manufacturing in China mean the earbuds won't be ready for a few weeks. Instead, he demonstrates the system on a set of ear headphones, getting me to say Bonjour into an iPad which then comes out of his headphones as Hello. We struggle with bad connectivity - often an issue when thousands are using the mobile networks at once - but Danny is hoping for a smoother demo in any of 37 languages when his stand is set up at the show. It has been an extraordinary journey to get this far. He's been working on the idea for four years while holding down a full time job as an engineer at a major aerospace company. He tells me that when he went to China to sign a deal with Foxconn to manufacture his product he could only take three days leave, so spent just one day in Shenzhen - to the amazement of his hosts - then got back on the plane. He has funded Clik from his own savings and a crowdfunding campaign and exhibiting at CES is costing him a tidy sum. So, is it worth it? ""I've had so many emails from companies that wanted to see the product,"" he says. ""That's the main reason I've come to CES."" He is also hoping to link up with distributors, manufacturers and other possible business partners. Let's be honest, the odds aren't great on Danny Manu beating the tech giants to launch a product that could transform the way we interact with people who speak a different language. In fact, he might be better to head to the roulette tables and pick a number to put his life savings on. But this brave young British entrepreneur, with the courage to stake everything on an innovation he believes could change the world, is just what CES should be all about.

"This video can not be played LG unveiled its ""wallpaper TV' at the CES tech show in Las Vegas South Korean tech giants LG and Samsung have launched TVs that aim to better blend in to consumers' living rooms. LG showed off a set that can be fitted almost flat against a wall while Samsung teased a new kind of TV - designed to look like a painting - that displays art when not in use. Samsung also unveiled a flagship set boasting greater brightness levels than before. Others, including Sony, also revealed new models. Samsung's flagship 75in (190cm) QLED 4K TV features the latest version of its quantum dot technology - tiny particles that emit different colours of light. These now feature a metal material that the firm says allows for better colour reproduction. Samsung has decided to stick with a curved display for its high-end models - despite criticism from some experts that viewing angles suffer with such designs. Samsung's quantum dots are tiny particles that emit light of different colours The QLED TV can achieve HDR (high dynamic range) brightness of between 1,500 and 2,000 nits - one nit equalling the light from a candle. ""It's insanely bright,"" said Jack Wetherill, a tech analyst at Futuresource. ""That is pretty power hungry one would imagine, but if they're going down the route of getting as good a picture as they can out of it, then fair enough."" This sets it apart from other set makers who use another premium TV screen technology, OLED (organic light-emitting diode). Such screens use a carbon-based film allowing the panel to emit its own light, rather than being backlit - this enables the ultra thin designs. Quantum dot TVs might not be able to display the deepest blacks possible with OLED, but they are generally brighter. LG's newest TV sticks out just 3.85mm from a wall when mounted against it LG's new OLED 4K TV was as thin as last year's - just 2.57mm thick - and will be available in 65 and 77in models. But the firm has now designed a new mount that uses magnets so the set can be fixed flat against a wall, which the firm says means it doesn't cast ""a single shadow"". LG also announced its latest TVs would support four HDR formats - including Hybrid Log-Gamma jointly developed by the BBC and the Japanese broadcaster NHK. This will allow sport and other live broadcasts to be shown in the format. Many experts agree that HDR makes a huge difference to the TV picture, making it seem richer and allowing for higher levels of contrast between light and dark tones. ""It is more vibrant, the colours are more distinctive,"" said Mr Wetherill. ""It does bring a much more impressive and immersive experience - no question about that."" It is not yet clear which format will become popular with content-makers, so LG's inclusion of all four should ensure it does not become obsolete if and when a winner emerges. The Samsung Lifestyle TV could be mistaken for a painting Samsung also showed off images of its new Lifestyle TV, which it described as ""a beautiful, always-on, truly smart display that transforms the TV to art"". It comes in a wooden frame, in an attempt to look like a painting. Sony also announced a new 4K OLED TV - its first - the latest in its Bravia range. As well as an HDR processor that can upscale standard dynamic range content to ""near 4K HDR quality"", the set has also dispensed with in-built speakers. Instead, it emits sound via vibrations produced on the surface of the screen itself. The new Bravia TV doesn't have speakers - the screen vibrates instead, which emits sounds This wasn't demonstrated at the press conference, noted Mr Wetherill, but it was, he said, ""an interesting concept"". Panasonic did not discuss its OLED TV plans at its press conference, though it is possible a prototype will be on the CES trade show floor. At last year's consumer electronics show IFA in Berlin, the company had said it would release details of the TV during the winter.

"Intel's Project Alloy headset was announced last year - but the CES demo was brand new Intel has shown off a headset that can replace a room's pre-scanned furniture with more appropriate video game scenery in virtual reality. The capabilities of the firm's Project Alloy headset, currently in development, were demoed at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Chief executive Brian Krzanich said Intel planned to license the technology to manufacturers by the end of 2017. But one analyst said VR remained a difficult market to target. The headset does not require a separate PC or a connection to a power source - both computer and battery are built in, noted Mr Krzanich as he introduced the latest prototype. Two players in a mock living room demonstrated on stage how the headset could create a virtual replica of the room featuring scanned obstacles such as furniture. Intel calls this ""merged reality"". In the demo, the bookcases and coffee table were then replaced, digitally, by similar-sized scenery more suited to the game - a futuristic spaceship. The headset converted scanned objects into more appropriate bits of video game scenery Project Alloy was first unveiled in August last year, but this was its most advanced demo yet. ""It was certainly interesting,"" said tech analyst Brian Blau at Gartner, who also praised the freedom offered by an ""all-in-one"" headset without a cable. However, he said it would have been even more impressive had the living room been scanned by the headset itself. ""They did say [the room] was pre-scanned, so I was a little bit disappointed by that."" The device will not be manufactured by Intel, but instead it will offer the technology to other tech firms to build products around. Intel hopes this process will begin in the final quarter of 2017. But the project's success may rely on others being willing to make content for it. ""They can enable all kinds of stuff but if it is not for the rest of those pieces they'll just have the parts out there,"" said Mr Blau. A demo of Project Alloy last year showed how the wearer's hand could be represented within the virtual world The firm also showed off a variety of other uses for a wide range of VR headsets - including high definition 360-degree video captured at a waterfall in Vietnam. Mr Blau said the use of volumetric video - which lets viewers peer around objects as though they were really present in the captured scene - was impressive. ""It is something we won't really see en masse for a long time because of its heavy data requirements,"" Mr Blau added. Other chip makers besides Intel have been developing virtual reality headset technology. Nvidia, for example, has been working onsoftware and processors,externalto power computing-intensive experiences. AMD is developing itsSulon Q headset,external, which - like Project Alloy - incorporates a computer and battery onboard, meaning no need for tethers or cables. Chip maker AMD recently announced it's own Sulon Q VR and AR headset. There is some optimism around the potential for growth within the virtual reality market at CES. US unit sales of VR headsets are predicted to reach 2.5 million in 2017, according to a presentation at the trade show by the Consumer Technology Association. But during Intel's event, Mr Krzanich acknowledged that many were still unsure if the technology would become truly popular. ""A lot of people are questioning is virtual reality going to take off, is it going to go anywhere?"" he acknowledged .

"Donald Trump is not popular in Mexico Mexico is being blamed by President-elect Donald Trump for taking jobs from the US. He's been putting pressure on US companies not to move jobs south, and this weekFord announced it was investing in its factory in Michiganrather than building a new plant in Mexico. During his election campaign, Mr Trump threatened to rip up Nafta, the free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, which has been in place for 23 years. But what impact has Nafta had in Mexico, and what would its potential demise mean for the country? In a leafy square in Mexico City on a warm December evening a group of excited children are hitting a brightly coloured pinata stuffed with sweets. A fellow passer-by explains to me that pinatas are a Mexican tradition, particularly at Christmas and birthdays. However, Mexicans also like pinatas ""in the shape of everything we want to hit"", he says. ""The latest trend is Donald Trump pinatas,"" he adds. This video can not be played A look back at some of the things Donald Trump has said about Mexicans Mr Trump is not popular in Mexico. He wasincredibly rude about Mexicansduring his election campaign, and at a time when the world seems to be turning away from free trade he threatened to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Mexico and Canada. The important thing about Nafta is that companies importing and exporting between the three countries pay no tariffs. Mr Trump believes it's been bad for the US as cheaper Mexican labour has meant some US manufacturers have moved production across the border, resulting in job losses at home. Nafta was implemented in 1994 and over the past 23 years Mexico has grown as a manufacturing hub. Today the United States and Mexico trade over $500bn (Â£400bn) in goods and services a year, equal to about $1.5bn a day. Mexico is the US's second-biggest export market, and the US is Mexico's largest. Thierry Legros says without Nafta his farming business would be under threat Red Sun Farms, a large vegetable-growing firm in central Mexico, depends on the free trade agreement. Its managing director, Thierry Legros, shows me into a vast greenhouse, 200m long, with row upon row of tomato plants. The company also grows peppers and exports 90% of its crop to the US and Canada. So what would it mean if Mr Trump repealed the Nafta agreement completely with its tariff-free trading? ""We might need to close the whole company,"" Thierry tells me. ""It would be around 3,000 direct jobs, so with all the indirect that's quite a lot, probably double that."" Outside Thierry's office three flags flutter in the wind - one for each Nafta country. The three Nafta flags at Red Sun Farms reflect the company's integration within the free trade area Red Sun Farms even owns a farm in the US and sends Mexican workers over there. However, there's a stark wage differential, with pay significantly higher in the US. ""Right now with the exchange rate that's huge,"" Thierry explains, ""it's about one to eight, one to 10."" These Red Sun Farms workers in Mexico earn far less than their counterparts in the US As well as enabling Mexico to export freely, Nafta also opened the door to US imports, giving Mexican consumers much greater choice. ""It was an achievement, it was against history,"" says economic consultant Luis de la Calle, who was one of the negotiators of the free trade agreement. ""Most Mexicans thought that it was impossible or not convenient to have a strategic association with the US, and many people in the US never thought that Mexico could be their partner."" You can listen toIn Business: Mexico and Mr Trumpon BBC Radio 4 at 20:30 GMT on Thursday, 5 January and at 21:30 GMT on Sunday, 8 January. Increased demand, as a result of free trade, forced Mexican manufacturers to improve quality. Luis de la Calle says that before Nafta Mexico had three producers of TV sets, and the quality was ""awful"". But today, Mexico is ""the largest manufacturer of TV sets in the world"". They are exported and are ""high quality, completely different from the protected market we had before"". The instantly recognisable VW Beetles are manufactured in Puebla, Mexico Mexico is now a centre of manufacturing for overseas companies, such as the motor industry. General Motors and Ford both have factories in Mexico as well as the US. But Donald Trump has put public pressure on US companies not to move production, and has threatened to impose import duties on cars coming in from Mexico. It's a sensitive subject and the American carmakers refused to be interviewed. Donald Trump had this message for the car industry earlier this week However, in the city of Puebla, a two-hour drive from the capital, the German car manufacturer Volkswagen is the biggest employer with 14,000 staff. It's the only place in the world where VW produces its famous Beetle, and as you enter the site you're greeted by a display of Beetles suspended in the air like a piece of installation art. The Golf and Jetta models are also produced here. Thomas Karig from VW Mexico was tight-lipped about whether the firm had come under any pressure about jobs Like the US carmakers, Volkswagen's Mexican production is integrated with its US plant. ""We use a lot of parts coming from the US for assembly here in Mexico in Puebla, and our colleagues in Chattanooga in Tennessee - they use a lot of parts coming from Mexico,"" explains Thomas Karig from Volkswagen Mexico. This integration is possible because there are no tariffs to pay each time components are sent from one Nafta country to another. But when I ask whether Volkswagen has come under pressure from Mr Trump about keeping jobs in the US, the atmosphere cools and there is a curt ""no comment"". The Nafta agreement has not benefited everyone in Mexico though. Some small farmers were unable to compete with US agricultural imports and big Mexican rivals. According to a study by the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, from 1991 to 2007 some 4.9 million family farmers were displaced. Some found work with big exporting agricultural companies, but there was still a net loss of 1.9 million jobs. Three of Aurelio's children are illegal migrants in the US An hour's drive from Puebla I meet Aurelio, whose family has farmed a tiny patch of land since 1925. Deep in the dry countryside he raises a few cows. Job opportunities are scarce and three of his five children have migrated illegally to the US where they have found work painting cars. But Donald Trump has said he wants to deport illegal immigrants. Aurelio takes out his mobile phone and calls one of his sons in the US. Is his son worried about this, I ask. His son says that if there is a chance of being deported they will have to look elsewhere, but adds: ""Mexico is a tough choice because of lack of opportunities, violence, high taxes and the economic situation, so it wouldn't be easy."" President Obama has deported at least 2.4 million illegal immigrants so this isn't a new policy. And according to the Pew Research Center, by 2014 more Mexican immigrants returned to Mexico than migrated to the US. Luis de la Calle says both the US and Mexico benefit from Nafta Mr de la Calle acknowledges that the free trade agreement has split the country. He says there are two types of regions in Mexico. ""[There are] parts of the south of Mexico that are disconnected from international trade, that are lagging behind, where Nafta had little impact. Rates of growth are low, there is little investment, and you don't see large manufacturing operations."" In contrast to this, he says: ""There are 16 or 17 other states that grow very fast, you see a lot of dynamism."" These he describes as ""Nafta states"" with exporting businesses. However, he dismisses Mr Trump's criticism of Mexico. ""He says [Nafta's] been great for Mexico, actually his whole argument is that Mexico is doing so well. It's flattering."" He also claims that the US is benefiting from its close manufacturing links with Mexico. However, when I ask who would come off worst if Nafta were repealed, the US or Mexico, he answers, ""Mexico because we are smaller, but the US would lose quite a bit as well."" Donald Trump wasn't the first US presidential candidate to criticise Nafta. Hillary Clinton and even Barack Obama did so on their campaign trails. But abandoning it completely? The US may find it has too much to lose and perhaps Mr Trump has realised that too.

"Farming has the most to gain - and lose from Brexit Of all UK industries, farming could lose or gain the most from Brexit. At worst Brexit could devastate the farming sector; on average 60% of farm incomes come in the form of EU subsidies. The report byInforma Agribusiness Intelligence,externalestimates that without subsidies 90% of farms would collapse and land prices would crash. So far no one has said the subsidies will be taken away, or even that they will shrink. Indeed, the government has promised to match them up until 2020. But beyond that it has promised nothing. Some argue that without any subsidies at all, nine in 10 farms would collapse as businesses This week has seen a flurry of activity as the farming industry tries to grapple with what comes next. MPs from the Environmental Audit Committee warned on Tuesday of the dangers of Brexit to farming. Its report, theFuture of the Natural Environment after the EU Referendum,external, says: Leaving the Common Agricultural Policy will threaten the viability of some farms Trade agreements which impose taxes on UK farm exports will threaten farm and food business incomes New trading relationships with states outside the EU could lead to increased competition from countries with lower food, animal welfare and environmental standards Meanwhile farmers gathered at the Oxford Farming Conference (OFC) this week to listen to the Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom, but there were precious few details on what would happen once EU subsidies go. ""We will be consulting in the near future on exactly the shape of future farm and agriculture support,"" said Ms Leadsom. ""I will be committed to supporting farming in both the short and longer term."" Andrea Leadsom gave few details on what would happen to farming after the UK leaves the EU Also at the OFC was George Eustice, Minister of State at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA, who was a little more detailed. ""I want to support agriculture to where it becomes more profitable, more vibrant, so we see expanding food production in this country, where we are supporting farmers to deliver eco-system services. ""So that rather than telling them 'here's a subsidy now here's a list of environmental demands', we should be saying to farmers you have a role to play to enhance our agricultural environment, and we are going to reward you for those services that you offer."" The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) started in 1962 as the first members of what is now the EU emerged from over a decade of food shortages during and after World War Two. Its emphasis was on production and food security but as farmers were paid for whatever they produced, they over-produced leading to food ""mountains"". A reform process, including the ""greening"" of the CAP which emphasised environmental practices, has resulted in farmers mostly being paid depending on how much land they own - but some wealthy UK landowners now receive subsidies of up to Â£3m a year. For instance, the Newmarket farm of Khalid Abdullah al Saud, billionaire owner of the legendary horse Frankel, receives Â£400,000 a year. Lord Iveagh who lives on the 22,486-acre Elveden Estate in Suffolk, receives over Â£900,000. Yet working out what to replace EU subsidies with is raising passions. Many farmers see opportunities once the UK is no longer in the Common Agricultural Policy At the same conference the journalist and environmental activist George Monbiot had a run-in with the deputy head of the National Farmers Union (NFU) Minette Batters over the role of farmers after Brexit. Mr Monbiot believes farming subsidies should be replaced by a fund to alleviate rural poverty, an environmental fund and help for new entrants into the sector. When he asked Ms Batters if she was happy to see subsidies paid to wealthy farmers. Ms Batters hesitated and then said: ""It depends on what they do with it,"" adding ""I can't emphasise it enough, farmers embrace the environment"". An aghast-looking Mr Monbiot replied saying ""Farmers, have, more than any other group been responsible for the environmental degradation of the countryside."" A few hundred yards down the road, another conference was going on. This was the Oxford Real Farming Conference (ORFC), set up 10 years ago to give an alternative view on farming. While the OFC is all suits, largely men, and a large NFU presence, the ORFC is more woolly jumpers, more women, more beards and more delegates, many of them young. If there is no free trade agreement with the EU Britain would rely on trading rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation The two are not absolutely opposed to each other - coming together this year for the first time to jointly discuss the weighty subject of cheese and how to produce it. And the feeling at both conferences is that, despite uncertainties, everyone sees huge opportunities once the UK is no longer in the Common Agricultural Policy. And, of course, everyone is pushing their own agenda. Guy Watson, the founder of the country's largest organic retailer, Riverford Organic Farmers, bravely told a gathering of livestock farmers that ""there is no getting away from it, we have to eat less meat"" David Baldock, a senior fellow at the Institute for European Environmental Policy said: ""It's really not the end of the world to think that we are going to produce slightly less and better."" Surprisingly neither were shouted down and there were even suggestions from the audience that VAT ought to be levied on meat. While most of the lobby groups have a view on reforming subsidies, they are less clear about the problem of trade. 90% of UK exports in beef and lamb go to the EU If there is no free trade agreement with the EU, Britain would rely on trading rules laid down by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which could be very uncomfortable for farmers having to pay taxes, or tariffs, to sell into the single market. Calum Kerr, MSP and Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesman for the SNP, said 90% of beef and lamb exports, and 70% of pork exports go to the EU. ""WTO rules would look at a minimum tariff into the EU of 20%. On red meat which ... is critically important [economic] modelling suggests anywhere between 50% and.... a 76% increase in costs into the EU market. ""That's why we believe we should remain a part of the EU market."" The NFU's Ms Batters said: ""We have to do a deal with Europe and it is a deal that will shape our landscape for generations to come."" Nearly every farmer believes Brexit offers an opportunity to change the system, but exactly how is a matter for debate As for competing with countries outside the EU, Ms Leadsom promised she wouldn't lower environmental and animal welfare standards to clinch free trade deals. Ms Batters, herself a beef farmer, said: ""The problem is that getting free trade deals in agriculture is notoriously difficult. ""Take Argentina. Michael Gove says he wants to do a deal with the South American countries. ""But they have a completely different system of rearing beef, using a degree of genetically modified products. ""I simply can't compete with that."" Nearly everyone believes Brexit offers an opportunity to change the system, but no one can agree how.

"Spot the mistake: Hugh Jackman has been renamed 'Hugh Jackilometresan' in a Trivial Pursuit question spotted by Twitter user John E Lewis. It's a Christmas staple with many families. When the turkey's gone cold and the evening's drawn in, it's the Trivial Pursuit board which often comes out. And it was a ""newish"" Christmas gift of the popular board game from his nephew which prompted John Lewis, 47, to share a picture of the game on social media that has subsequently been shared thousands of times. Lewis - not the department store, not the USman who is frequently mistaken for a department store on Twitter, but a journalist and editor from London - was playing the Family Edition of the game on Tuesday when his daughter discovered an unusual error. Reading a question about 2008 film Australia, starring Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman, Lewis' daughter was baffled. A mysterious 'Hugh Jackilometresan' appeared to have supplanted Jackman as the film's leading man. ""She showed us the card and we all found it hilarious,"" Lewis said. ""As an editor, I also immediately guessed how it had happened."" Lewis is not the first social media user to spot the error. @JackStooks and others noticed the problem back in 2015. Lewis believes that the error could have been caused by a ""cavalier find-and-replace command"" where 'km' had been substituted for 'kilometres' by the game's makers. Hasbro has been approached for comment. And he says that was not the only example he spotted. ""There is another error I later found in the same pack,"" he said, ""where 'kg' has been universally replaced to 'kilograms'. ""So the question reads: 'What U2 song plays in the 'backilogramsound' of the famous Friends episode where Ross tries to get Rachel back after they were on a break?"" Lewis shared his image on Facebook and Twitter, where his post has attracted thousands of retweets and likes. ""I don't even use Twitter that much,"" he said.

"Six handwritten letters from Princess Diana have sold for Â£15,100 at auction. One candid letter from Diana to ex-Buckingham Palace steward Cyril Dickman, revealed Prince Harry was ""constantly in trouble at school"". Another note described how young Prince William ""swamped"" his baby brother with ""an endless supply of hugs and kisses"". The letters form part of about 40 lots from Mr Dickman's former estate, which sold for Â£55,000 in total - exceeding the estimate price of Â£13,000. Cheffins, a Cambridgeshire auction house, said the lots were ""a unique collection of royal memorabilia"". Bidders from as far away as Australia, Japan and the US were trying to purchase the items. This video can not be played Auctioneer tells the BBC that the bidding was ""extraordinary... [it] never seemed to stop"" In a letter on headed Kensington Palace paper dated 20 September 1984, Diana thanked Mr Dickman for ""such a lovely card"" following the birth of her youngest son, Harry. She wrote: ""William adores his little brother and spends the entire time swamping Harry with an endless supply of hugs and kisses, hardly letting the parents near!"" ""The reaction to one tiny person's birth has totally overwhelmed us and I can hardly breathe for the mass of flowers that are arriving here!"" That letter sold for Â£3,200, having had an estimated auction price of Â£400-600. In another, dated 17 October 1992, Diana says how both young princes ""are well and enjoying boarding school a lot, although Harry is constantly in trouble!"". This sold for Â£2,400 - after an estimate of Â£600-900. The items were being sold by the family of the late Mr Dickman, who was head palace steward for more than 50 years. Described by Cheffins as ""a favourite of every member of the Royal Family"", he received handwritten notes from other senior royals dating back more than 30 years. The collection sold at auction also included letters, cards and photographs from Prince Charles and Princess Margaret, and Maundy money. In one letter from the Queen written on Windsor Castle headed paper, she thanks Mr Dickman for his ""thoughts and sympathy"" following the death of the Queen Mother. More than a dozen Christmas cards, including some from the Queen, Princess Diana and the Prince of Wales, were bought for Â£2,200.

"Sir Tim Barrow is the UK's new ambassador to the European Union The papers offer their interpretations of Sir Tim Barrow's appointment as the UK's new EU envoy after his predecessor resigned, questioning the government's Brexit strategy. TheFinancial Times,externalbelieves Theresa May has bowed to pressure by selecting a career diplomat, allaying concerns about the civil service becoming politicised. TheTimes,externaland theGuardian,externalboth argue that the prime minister wanted to calm the row about Brexit after the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers highlighted strains between some mandarins and ministers. The Guardian says the attacks on Sir Ivan's impartiality by former Conservative ministers had angered some senior civil servants, with some privately claiming they were considering stepping down. For the Sun,external, Britain's new ambassador to the European Union is a ""wily behind-the-scenes fixer"". It hopes Sir Tim will show ambition and optimism when it comes to leaving the EU. The Daily Telegraph criticises what it sees as Sir Ivan's ""distinctly undiplomatic"" resignation message,externaland calls on the civil service to demonstrate the loyalty and discretion it expects from ministers. According to the Daily Mail,external, theology students at the University of Glasgow are being warned they may see distressing images while studying the crucifixion of Jesus and are being given the chance to leave classes if they fear being upset. The paper says this is part of a trend among a number of universities to let students know about parts of courses that might be disturbing. Advocates say this helps protect the mental health of vulnerable students but critics believe people are left unable to face the realities of the world. Other examples, according to the article, include veterinary students being warned they will have to work with dead animals; while those studying forensic science are alerted that some lectures contain images of crime scenes. Several papers are concerned about the growing scale of household debt. The Daily Mirror says it has reached crisis levels with consumer credit standing at Â£192bn, the most since the economic crash of 2008. In particular,the Mirror highlights the plight of those aged 18 to 34,externalwho are struggling in the face of low wages and rising rents. For its lead, theSun has been speaking to a refugee from Syria,externalwho says he was was waved through border control despite having a bogus passport. He tells the paper that he bought the forged document for Â£300. The Sun says this is evidence of a security shambles which leaves Britain wide open to an attack from the Islamic State group. The Border Force declines to comment directly on the case but does tell the paper that technological changes have improved its ability to spot forged documents. The Telegraph offers a wry assessment,externalof the fallout after the Yorkshire seaside town of Scarborough barely noticed it had been struck by one of the biggest earthquakes to hit the UK in almost a decade.

Gatiss's response mirrors a poem Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself wrote in 1912, entitledTo An Undiscerning Critic,external.

"In 1986 Jill Saward, who has died aged 51, was raped after a gang of burglars broke into the Ealing vicarage where she lived. Her father, Michael - the vicar of St Mary's, Ealing - and her boyfriend were beaten with cricket bats by the men, who demanded money and jewellery. It was a sexual attack that shocked the nation, became headline news and was subsequently labelled the ""Ealing vicarage rape"". The media coverage of the case and the sentencing of the men who attacked Ms Saward - who later became Jill Drake - led to a public outcry about how rape victims were treated. Ringleader Robert Horscroft, then 34, who did not take part in the rape, was sentenced to 14 years in jail for his part in the burglary. Martin McCall, then 22, was given five years for rape and a further five for burglary, while Christopher Byrne, who was also 22, was given three years for his part in the sexual assault and five for the burglary. During sentencing, Old Bailey Judge Sir John Leonard said the trauma suffered by Ms Saward was ""not so very great"". Ms Saward's case affected the way rape victims were treated and is still being felt 30 years later. The public backlash against the media coverage and subsequent sentencing helped bring about changes to the way sexual assault cases were viewed. In particular, there was uproar at how one of the defendants had been given a longer sentence for the burglary than the attack. Several MPs, including Neil Kinnock, criticised the prison terms handed down - saying they were too lenient. The then-Labour leader said during a Commons debate in 1987: ""While it is necessary for judges to remain detached in the name of the law, sometimes they show an insensitivity to the suffering of victims which is difficult to comprehend."" And Margaret Thatcher, who was prime minister at the time, expressed her ""deep concern"" over the crime of rape following concerns about the case. Ms Saward's case also sparked fierce criticisms about press coverage of rape cases after Ms Saward's ordeal became front page news. While newspapers did not name Ms Saward as the victim, several of them published details which led her to be easily identifiable. This video can not be played Jill Saward, who was gang raped in 1986, says her attackers got the same sentence as for aggravated burglary The Sun newspaper printed the location of the attack and a photograph of Ms Saward with her eyes blacked out in the days following the rape. When investigated, the publication relied on the defence that media identification of a victim was only banned after a defendant was charged, which was the case at the time. Speaking in 1987 Ms Saward, who was an identical twin, demanded a change in the law to prevent this from happening. According to the Guardian, she said: ""Unless this is done, others may find themselves identifiable by a process of deduction from third parties known to be involved as victims of a crime as I was. ""This was very distressing both to myself and my family, and the manner in which some newspapers conveyed this information was highly insensitive and offensive."" The law was changed a year later to allow for the right to appeal against lenient sentences and to close a loophole which allowed media identification of a rape victim before a defendant was charged. The Press Council also published guidelines on how rape cases were reported to prevent victims' anonymity being breached through jigsaw identification. The notorious case put the laws on rape under the spotlight and led to calls by women's groups and politicians to call for changes to the way the crimes were viewed. These included making rape within marriage a criminal offence, making oral and anal intercourse classified as rape and tougher sentencing for rapists - all of which have been achieved. In 1990, Ms Saward broke new ground when she became the first rape victim in the UK to waive her right to anonymity. She co-wrote a book, Rape: My Story, which explored her ordeal and she went on to become a fierce campaigner for the rights of sexual assault victims. Her decision to speak publicly was driven by a desire to change attitudes towards victims and strengthen the support they receive. Ms Saward launched a help group for those who had experienced sex crimes and regularly appeared in the media to highlight issues faced by victims. Her commitment to the cause also saw her become a sexual assault case worker and she subsequently provided training to police forces across the country. Over the years, further changes have been made to the way sexual assault cases are handled - taking into account the way victims were treated. These include a ban on allowing an alleged rapist to cross-examine victims while representing themselves in court and restrictions on what evidence can be heard about a victim's sexual behaviour. New guidelines were published on the sentencing of sex offenders in England and Wales in 2013 which gave a greater emphasis on the impact on the victim - something Ms Saward had long campaigned for. Speaking to the BBC, she said: ""So long we've felt left out of the system or surplus to requirement, so to actually see victims' needs and what's happened to victims being put at the forefront of this is really, really good."" Ms Saward never gave up on her fight for victims' rights, and in 2015 she spoke out against calls to give those accused of sex crimes anonymity. In 1998, she came face-to-face with a member of the gang who devastated her life, but did not rape her, and told him: ""You don't need to say sorry."" But she also spoke about forgiveness and said in a BBC interview: ""I believe forgiveness gives you freedom. Freedom to move on without being held back by the past.""

I see so many people who have great shows, great products and great ideas but decide to cut the marketing budget, or just think that it will work because it's clever. I always say you could invent a kettle that boiled in a second, but if people don't know about it then it doesn't matter. Get people excited. Think of interesting and amazing ways to get people involved and get your message out there. Create a community and harness the power of social media. Be brave and try new things.

At Unruly, for example, we haven't let Brexit brouhaha put the brakes on our growth - on the contrary, our foot is flat on the pedal, and we've accelerated international expansion into India. It's also important that you nurture the wellbeing of the team. Make sure your team understands the value they bring to your organisation, and mentor them so they are prepared for the challenges ahead. Over the long term, the only strategy for an uncertain future is to keep and feed an open mind. Keep listening, keep learning, keep reading, keep evolving, keep experimenting, keep questioning, keep agile. Only then can you can keep on being at the cutting edge of trends that are reshaping the world we live in. I'm an optimist at heart and believe that if we build purposeful businesses with collaborative cultures, then rather than worrying about the future, we can help to shape it.

Firstly, passion - you must be totally passionate about what you do, because customers and employees will only be as passionate about your product or service as you are. Secondly - people. It is important that you employ great people. This will allow you to build a sustainable business with amazing customer loyalty and retention. Thirdly - product. Make sure that you give a quality product that will allow you to build a business that customers and potential staff will want to be aligned to. Finally - profit.

Find out more about Ryan Pip Black (right) runs Frame with friend Joan Murphy Success in business is about finding the right balance between pushing yourself to your limits, and knowing when to take time out to re-energise, regroup, and to take a moment to plan your next big push. Many of us are great at the pushing bit, but forget about the importance of the other side, which can lead to burnout or perhaps a growing underlying resentment of the dream you're following. In order to allow you the time to do this, it's essential that you build a strong team around you, who all share the same values. Empower them, give them space to grow, and reward them in the way that pushes them forwards individually - what motivates your team will vary drastically between individuals.

All that matters is that they elevate the team and help us achieve our goals. I think this approach will slowly become the norm, and we'll see more big businesses adopt this way of doing things. Technology is making the world a lot smaller, and communication has never been easier, which means you can always be in touch no matter where you are in the world. Obviously there are processes you need to put in place to make sure everyone's doing the job that's being asked of them and to maintain a strong company culture, but once this has been ironed out the benefits are undeniable.

Over the last couple of years I've built up a strong senior management team who I am heavily reliant on for the day-to-day running of the business. This has helped to give me space to breathe and focus on taking my business to new heights. Also, take time off occasionally. I think it's extremely important to completely switch off from work every now and again. I spent Christmas in Sri Lanka, turned off my emails and focused on me. It means that I come back to work in January - one of the busiest months in our industry - refreshed, focused and ready to tackle the year ahead. Find out more about Lee Be clear about what you want to achieve in 2017.  I have set myself half a dozen key things I want to realise this year. If you get to the end of the year without achieving any or all of them, the things you identified at the start of the year were either not important, or you failed to deliver them. If they weren't important after all, you called it wrong at the start of the year, which can be just as bad for your business as failing to achieve them. Always be alive to what is going on with your competition, and with the market uncertainty we'll experience over the next couple of years this will be even more critical. Too many people are too insular within their business, and they don't see who's in front and, even more importantly, they don't see who's coming up from behind.

"This video can not be played What is it like inside Guantanamo Bay? These are uncertain times at Guantanamo Bay. Not only for the detainees but also those who guard them. After eight years in which President Obama has tried - and failed - to close the detention facility, what will President Trump mean for its future? The first detainees arrived at Camp X-Ray 15 years ago in the early months of what was then called the ""War on Terror"". I first visited a few weeks later and watched the men in orange jumpsuits in steel cages in the hot Cuban sun. Guantanamo had been chosen partly because it was not US soil and so avoided coming under regular US law. The camp then had a thrown together feel - the Bush administration was improvising and no-one was sure how long it would last. The orange jumpsuits worn by detainees became notorious The next time I visited - two years later - Camp X-Ray had been replaced by the more permanent structure of Camp Delta. Guantanamo was here to stay. Its numbers grew - around 700 at its peak. But on his second day in office eight years agoPresident Obama promised to close the facility,externaland the pace of transfers increased. On my visit a few weeks ago, I found much of the Camp eerily empty, a lone iguana roaming around the barbed wire. But closing Guantanamo was a promise President Obama could not keep, partly because Congress blocked the transfer of any detainees to the US. Fewer than 60 men are now left. There are 20 currently cleared for release and the Obama administration is trying to transfer some of these out before its term ends. But on 3 January,President-elect Trump made his views clear in a tweet. ""There should be no further releases,"" he wrote. ""These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back on to the battlefield."" Most of the remaining detainees are held now in Camp Six. Inside a cell in Camp Six at Guantanamo Bay The uncertainty hanging over the base was clear as we toured the detention block. We were able to watch and film detainees in the communal areas of their cell block through one-way glass, an unsettling procedure. The detainees are not supposed to know we are there but clearly they realised as one put up a hand-painted sign showing a question mark with a padlock underneath. They followed the election result like everyone else and Col Steve Gabavics, Commander of the Joint Detention Force, told me: ""They were all watching TV - their behaviour was pretty much the same as any other night. ""We didn't notice any significant negative response. No-one came to us angry, no-one protested. They were simply interested to see what was going to happen."" Colonel Steve Gabavics said they noticed no reaction to Donald Trump's election victory One difference from my early visits is just how much more controlled - even mundane - the interaction between detainees and guards is now compared to the early days. The attacks of 2001 were still raw and there was a tension and sense of underlying aggression on both sides. Now, the atmosphere is much more controlled. Detainees tap on a window to summon a guard when they have a message to pass and the guard proceeds through a door into a cage-like structure inside the cell-block where they can communicate with a detainee. During our visit in December, officials say that the detainees were ""compliant"". But what does the arrival of President Trump mean? ""You know the detainees have questions - are the transfers going to stop when the new president takes office on 20 January? We don't know, they don't know. Their lawyers may speculate, but no-one knows,"" says Rear Adm Peter Clarke, commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo. He did say - before Donald Trump's latest tweet - that ""some of them may act up"" if they realise they are not going to be transferred. Somewhere else on the base, which sprawls across an otherwise isolated tip of Cuba, is Camp Seven. Its precise location is secret - leading to much speculation from visiting reporters. This is where so-called high value detainees are being held - men like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 11 September attacks who is going through the long slow process of a military commission - a form of trial. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in Pakistan in March 2003 and sent to the US detention centre in Cuba in 2006 Might it be not only that transfers out are stopped, but that current detainees find they have some company? ""We are going to load it up with bad dudes,"" Mr Trump said in the campaign trail in February last year. Camp Five was built to hold detainees but now sits empty. What if President Trump decides he wants to not just stop people leaving but send in new detainees? The maximum capacity of Camp Six is around 175 detainees. Camp Five could hold 80 - it has been part-converted to a new medical facility. That means potentially Guantanamo could accommodate more than 100 extra detainees pretty much immediately. More than that would require construction work. Officials say it is a ""reasonable assumption"" that they would want to segregate new detainees who would be more likely to be members of so-called Islamic State rather than al-Qaeda. ""We are prepared to receive some if that was required in the short term,"" Col Gabavics told us. The Obama administration's push to close Guantanamo also meant there was a reluctance to capture more detainees in counter-terrorism operations around the world, some former officials say. They believe that a policy of ""take no prisoners"" created an incentive to kill rather than capture, with the administration increasing the pace and the geographical spread of drone strikes which - on occasion - might mean useful intelligence gleaned from interrogation or captured material might be lost. Rear Adm Peter Clarke said he is confident he will not be asked to torture detainees Mr Trump has also said that he would consider returning to the practice of waterboarding detainees. Could that take place at Guantanamo? Rear Adm Clarke said he was ""confident"" that there will be no torture at Guantanamo. ""Whatever orders we receive, by the time they come to me from US Southern Command, I am confident those orders will be legal orders that I will be ready to carry out,"" he said. In the 15 years since Guantanamo was opened, the contours of America's war on terror have changed. New enemies have emerged and the question of what to do with those America is fighting - where to put them, how to treat them and even whether to kill or capture them - will now be for a new president to decide.

"This video can not be played CitizenAID aims to help the public save lives before the professionals arrive People need to learn lifesaving skills in case they are caught up in a terror attack in the UK, a team of senior military and civilian medics has said. They say people need to know how to help each other because it could take some time before it is deemed safe for paramedics to arrive on the scene. Their app, calledCitizenAID,external, offers step-by-step advice. The idea is supported by counter-terrorism police. Security services say a UK terror attack is highly likely. Although an individual's chance of being caught up in an incident is small, Brig Tim Hodgetts and Prof Sir Keith Porter, co-developers of CitizenAID, say it is a good idea for people to have a plan and the knowledge and skills to help each other. Their app, pocket book and website suggest how best to deal with injuries in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting or bombing incident. The system includes instructions on how to treat severe bleeding - one of the major causes of death in these scenarios. It guides people through packing, putting pressure on and elevating a wound, and how to use a tourniquet safely, for example. The programme also explains how to prioritise those who need treatment first and what to tell the emergency services once they arrive. CitizenAID is not a government initiative but its developers say it builds onnational advice,externalfrom national counter-terrorism police to: Run away in the event of an incident if you can Hide if you can't run Tell the emergency services. The system describes how to make a tourniquet out of a scarf to help stop bleeding The CitizenAID system says people should follow these steps and then go one step further. It suggests once people are safe, they should start treating casualties. Ch Insp Richard Harding, head of the National Counter Terrorism Security Office, told the BBC: ""One of the challenges we have is that when a serious incident, particularly a terrorist incident occurs, the first responders from a police perspective to a terrorist incident will inevitably be trying to deal with the people causing the threat. ""They won't have time to deal with the people who are injured and that gap is vital to saving people's lives. ""So we are really interested in the concept of CitizenAID. It allows the public and people involved in very rare incidents like this to help themselves and help others and their loved ones survive the situation."" According to its founders, CitizenAID builds on lessons learnt on the battlefield. Sir Keith Porter, professor of clinical traumatology at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, told the BBC: ""I have treated hundreds of soldiers whose lives have been saved by simply the applications of tourniquets when they have been shot or blown up. Teaching individual soldiers these skills has saved lives. ""And I think it is essential we train the public in those skills and that is exactly what CitizenAID does."" Brig Tim Hodgetts, medical director of the Defence Medical Services, told the BBC; ""We don't know when the next incident will be that will involve blasts or gunshots so we need a critical mass of the general public to learn these first aid skills. ""They are the people who are always going to be at the scene. They are the ones who are going to make a difference."" He added: ""I think we are doing the opposite of scaring the public, we are empowering the public. ''By giving them a step-by-step system we take away the anxiety because the decisions are already made and the right decisions in the right order can save lives."" The app is free to download and the pocketbook costs Â£1.99 to order. Sue Killen,  of St John Ambulance, added ""First aid can be the difference between life and death. Knowing basic first aid in a terror attack or in an everyday emergency at home or in the community, will give you more confidence to deal with a crisis. ""First aid is easy to learn and our first aid techniques cover a wide range of injuries that could occur in a terrorist incident including severe bleeding, crush injuries and shock. ""We encourage anyone who would like to learn first aid to go to our website to view our first aid videos, download our app or attend a first aid course.""

"Six handwritten letters from Princess Diana have sold for Â£15,100 at auction. One candid letter from Diana to ex-Buckingham Palace steward Cyril Dickman, revealed Prince Harry was ""constantly in trouble at school"". Another note described how young Prince William ""swamped"" his baby brother with ""an endless supply of hugs and kisses"". The letters form part of about 40 lots from Mr Dickman's former estate, which sold for Â£55,000 in total - exceeding the estimate price of Â£13,000. Cheffins, a Cambridgeshire auction house, said the lots were ""a unique collection of royal memorabilia"". Bidders from as far away as Australia, Japan and the US were trying to purchase the items. This video can not be played Auctioneer tells the BBC that the bidding was ""extraordinary... [it] never seemed to stop"" In a letter on headed Kensington Palace paper dated 20 September 1984, Diana thanked Mr Dickman for ""such a lovely card"" following the birth of her youngest son, Harry. She wrote: ""William adores his little brother and spends the entire time swamping Harry with an endless supply of hugs and kisses, hardly letting the parents near!"" ""The reaction to one tiny person's birth has totally overwhelmed us and I can hardly breathe for the mass of flowers that are arriving here!"" That letter sold for Â£3,200, having had an estimated auction price of Â£400-600.

"David Tennant plays RD Laing in Mad To Be Normal Scots actor David Tennant will bring the curtain down on this year's Glasgow Film Festival (GFF). The former Dr Who star will attend the closing gala on 26 February for the world premiere of his latest film, Mad To Be Normal. Also starring Michael Gambon and Gabriel Byrne, the film is about the life of Scots psychiatrist RD Laing. The 13th festival opens on 15 February with a screening of Handsome Devil, starring Sherlock actor Andrew Scott. GFF co-director Allison Gardner said: ""I am so excited to share the news about our great opening and closing galas. ""Handsome Devil is a real crowd-pleaser with a joyous spirit that makes it a perfect film to launch the festival. ""David Tennant gives an absolutely stunning performance as RD Laing in Mad To Be Normal and it seems only fitting that Glasgow should have the honour of hosting the premiere of a film about one of the city's most complex, charismatic figures."" RD Laing was seen as a radical when he set up a medication-free community for psychiatric patients in London in the 1960s. Andrew Scott's film Handsome Devil will open the festival The film also features Elizabeth Moss who starred in Mad Men and Girl, Interrupted. A documentary series about influential art writer John Berger, titled The Seasons in Quincy, has also been added to the GFF schedule after his death on 2 January. The result of a five-year project by Tilda Swinton, Colin MacCabe and Christopher Roth in collaboration with the composer Simon Fisher Turner, the documentary is made with four films on different aspects of Berger's life and will be shown on 24 and 25 February. The full festival programme is to be detailed later in January but events already announced include a live music performance involving Alex Kapranos and Stuart Braithwaite. The ABC show will follow a special screening of documentary Lost In France, looking at the rise of Scotland's independent music scene and bands such as Mogwai, Arab Strap and Franz Ferdinand. The 2017 GFF programme also celebrates Canadian cinema and the role of women in thrillers. Glasgow City Council leader Frank McAveety said: ""GFF is a highlight on the city's cultural calendar. ""The opening gala is always an exciting event, heralding the beginning of 11 packed days of film in the UK's cinema city.

"Mona Tinsley's face smiled out of countless newspaper articles and police leaflets It is 80 years since the murder of 10-year-old Mona Tinsley, a case which was by turns grisly, seedy and bizarre. It enthralled a nation and helped change the age-old principle that a murder could not be proved without a body. ""Oh it couldn't possibly be him,"" said Lilian Tinsley to the assembled police. Officers had a lead in the disappearance of Mona, her slight but sprightly 10-year-old daughter, but needed help. Just hours after she vanished after leaving her Newark-on-Trent school on 5 January 1937, a witness identified a man seen nearby as a former lodger from the Tinsleys' home. Local historian Chris Hobbs said: ""The reaction of Lilian and her husband Wilfred, when questioned, was odd. They seemed evasive. The house at the centre of the case has changed little on the outside ""When pressed by officers, Mrs Tinsley admitted they briefly had a lodger, known to the children as 'Uncle Fred'. ""Eventually she gave a name, Frederick Hudson, and, seemingly with great reluctance, the fact he was a friend of her sister Edith Grimes in Sheffield. ""Why would the parents be like this with the safety of their daughter at stake?"" Mr Hobbs queried. A possible, and murky, answer would emerge. Mrs Grimes gave them a slightly different name - Frederick Nodder - but insisted she had not seen him for months. This turned out to be a blatant lie. Officers quickly found a neighbour who had seen Nodder in Sheffield just after Christmas, driving a lorry marked 'Retford', a market town in Nottinghamshire. This led them to a haulage firm which provided an address in the nearby hamlet of Hayton. It was only a day since Mona had disappeared. 'No body, No murder' British justice was haunted by the wrongful execution of three people in 1660 Legal historian Benjamin Darlow says: ""This principle dates back to the case of William Harrison in 1660, known as the Campden Wonder. Mr Harrison disappeared from near Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, in 1660 and two men and a woman were found guilty and hanged for the crime. ""In 1662, Mr Harrison turned up with a story about being kidnapped. This had a dramatic impact on English criminal law and the 'no body, no murder' principle survived for the next 294 years. ""The Mona Tinsley case was part of an important narrative in the 20th Century which built up to the abolition of the principle in English Law in 1954. ""It was perhaps the most high-profile and widely reported case in this timeline. ""There is no longer a 'no body, no murder' principle in English criminal law. ""A murder conviction can be based on circumstantial evidence if it is compelling and convincing enough. ""While the principle is gone, it is still very difficult to prove murder without a body, unless there is alternative strong evidence pointing to the murderer."" Confronted outside his rented house, Nodder, 50, denied any involvement but a girl was seen at the house at about noon that day, just a few hours before. A search found a child's drawings as well as fingerprints on crockery. Nodder was arrested. Witnesses placed him on a bus from Newark to Retford on Tuesday afternoon. He was accompanied by a girl. Faced by this evidence, Nodder asked to see Mrs Grimes, insisting this would lead to Mona being found ""alive and well"". Nodder's house (centre, between trees) was a short distance from the Chesterfield canal Mr Hobbs said: ""It came out that Mrs Grimes had in fact seen Nodder on a weekly basis since he left Sheffield. She knew full well where Nodder lived but did not tell police. ""Newspaper reports describe them as being ""friendly"" but it is striking how both she and Mrs Tinsley tried to deflect attention away from Nodder. ""It seems likely Mrs Grimes was having an affair with him but it is surprising both she and Mona's own mother were prepared to obstruct the police investigation. ""Had it delayed the search by vital hours?"" Hundreds of people turned out to search fields and help police drag local rivers But when they met, Nodder offered only a statement insisting he had sent Mona to Sheffield to see Mrs Grimes. Nobody believed a word of Nodder's new statement - but the lack of a corpse hampered the investigation. After searches of the house, garden, nearby countryside and the ominously close Chesterfield canal, and just beyond it the River Idle, fat with winter rain, no new trace of the girl was uncovered. On 10 January 1937 Nodder was charged, but only with abduction. Supernatural sleuths Divining, or dowsing, claims the twitching of sticks can locate lost objects or water sources The desperate search for Mona used many conventional methods - but also some more bizarre efforts. Diviners - who search for an item with the aid of sticks or rods and mysterious intuition - featured prominently in the hunt for the girl, often seeming to direct the efforts of police. Most prominent was James Clarke of Melton Mowbray, who, carrying one of Mona's shoes and guided by whalebone sticks, focused on a gravel pit. On 14 January he told the Nottingham Post, ""Never was I more confident of success. I am so confident that if I was younger I would dig myself."" The pit was cleared. Nothing was found. Several mediums featured in the case. The Daily Mirror tested three - gaining access to both the Tinsley family and Nodder's house - but was given vague or conflicting answers. Estelle Roberts, one of the most famous psychics of the 1930s, later claimed to have been chauffeured to the the crime scene by police and told them Mona was in the river. Whatever she revealed to officers at the time, it was not enough to find the little girl. The case made national headlines. The Daily Express offered a Â£250 reward to find Mona, a different editor was threatened with jail for contempt for publishing a photo of Nodder. Press and public queued to get into hearings. It was reported some were ""laughing and joking as they pushed and struggled to their places"" and were told off by court officials. Nodder stood trial in Birmingham just two months later. Efforts to solve the mystery even featured in upmarket picture magazine The Sphere His defence argued hard Mona might still be found alive and well and no-one should speculate on her fate. Nodder did not give evidence. The jury took 16 minutes to convict him. He was jailed for seven years. Clearly frustrated by what he felt was a killer getting away lightly, Judge Mr Justice Rigby Swift said: ""You have been, most properly in my opinion, convicted by the jury of a dreadful crime. ""What you did with that little girl, what became of her, only you know. It may be that time will reveal the dreadful secret which you carry in your breast."" The searches had been exhaustive. Hundreds of volunteers had combed the countryside, leaflets had been handed out, an appeal broadcast on radio. The canal had been drained for five miles, the river dredged. As it stood, Nodder just had to bide his time. Nodder was described as unkempt but seemed to have been trusted by the Tinsley children But his luck ran out on 6 June. A family boating on the River Idle, a few miles downstream of Hayton, spotted a suspicious object under the water. When police arrived they found it was a body snagged in a drain. It was taken to a nearby pub where Wilfred Tinsley identified his daughter by her clothes. Injuries to her neck showed Mona had been strangled with a cord. Nodder was charged with murder. Nodder was hanged at Lincoln Prison still maintaining his innocence The law moved with vengeful speed. In November, the second time in a year, he stood trial. This time he gave evidence - still insisting he had put Mona on a bus for Sheffield. A two-day trial saw his defence, which claimed nothing directly proved he had killed Mona and no motive was established, briskly dismissed. Sentencing Nodder to death, Mr Justice Mcnaughton remarked: ""Justice has slowly but surely overtaken you"". On 30 December 1937, Frederick Nodder was hanged in Lincoln Prison. After the noose had done its work and the Tinsleys were left to grieve, the echo of the murder carried on. Its twists and revelations helped usher in a new way of seeking justice for the dead.

"This video can not be played Sound of 2017: Rag 'N' Bone Man Hip-hop bluesman Rag 'N' Bone Man has been named runner-up in the BBC's Sound of 2017, which aims to predict the year's biggest new acts. Born Rory Graham in Uckfield, near Brighton, the 31-year-old started his musical career as a jungle MC before his parents encouraged him to sing. His first big break came in 2012, when he supported Joan Armatrading, after his girlfriend sent promoters his early recordings - including videos of him singing on the toilet. ""I didn't know anything about it,"" he told his local newspaper The Argus. ""I made some of my early recordings while sitting on the toilet... They seemed to like it though."" Through constant gigging, he built a loyal fanbase until the emotiveBitter End,external, from his 2015 Disfigured EP, won support from Huw Stephens on Radio 1 and Jo Whiley on Radio 2. With a rasping voice not unlike Joe Cocker, he recently scored a major hit with the gospel-inspired singleHuman,external, which has topped the German charts for the last 13 weeks, and challenged Clean Bandit for the UK Christmas number one. He spoke to the BBC about his pirate radio past, becoming ""big in Germany"" and his favourite Disney songs. 5.Nadia Rose 4.Jorja Smith 3.Raye 2.Rag 'N' Bone Man 1.Ray BLK Congratulations on making the Sound of 2017's top five! How does it feel? It's a pretty exciting thing to be part of. It feels like I've put in all the hard work for a reason. Where did you get the name Rag 'N' Bone Man? I used to go round to my granddad's house on a Saturday morning, and we'd sit and eat our porridge and watch re-runs of Steptoe and Son on BBC Two. I thought it was hilarious - and Rag 'N' Bone Man sounded like a blues name to me. It reminded me of people like Sonny Boy Williamson and Big Mama Thornton. Imagine how different it would have been if you'd been watching repeats of Fawlty Towers. Yeah, I could have been called Basil! Did anyone ever advise you to go back to being Rory? I was asked if I wanted to change it a couple of times, but I like it. Whether you think it's stupid or not, it's memorable. The musician has worked with the likes of Kate Tempest and Jack Garratt Human has been number one in Germany for more than three months now. Is it strange to be big in Europe first? It's really crazy. I never expected it at all. I've been working as a musician for the last five or six years, but I saw myself as an underground artist and I was kind of happy doing that. But then, you know, when it started getting bigger I thought, ""Well, why not? Why shouldn't it be spread to a wider audience?"" In the UK, the song only entered the chart afterEmily Middlemas performed it on X Factor,external. How did you feel about that? I didn't have any choice in the matter! X Factor isn't my thing. I don't watch those shows. But somebody showed me her singing the song on their phone and, actually, she kind of nailed it. You spent a long time making hip-hop as a teenager. Were you a good MC? I think I was - but I always had the feeling everyone was better than me, you know? When I started singing, I left it behind. The star's debut album comes out in February. ""It feels like I've been waiting forever,"" he says What prompted you to start singing? Me and my dad used to go to these jam sessions and open mic nights but I was always scared of singing on stage. It felt different to rapping - more pressured. But it literally took one time for me to do it, and for people to come up and say, ""Dude, do you realise what your voice sounds like?"" for me to be like, ""OK, maybe I should do this more often!"" Where was that gig? It was my 21st birthday at a pub in East Grinstead. My dad said, ""You should get up and sing"" and because it was my birthday and I'd had a few drinks I went, ""Alright, yeah, I'll do it!"" What did you sing? The guys on stage were all double, if not triple, my age, and they were playing old blues tunes and standards. I knew all the words because my dad used to play them on a slide guitar when I was a kid. The first song you uploaded to YouTube was an old American folk song,Reuben's Train,external. I was surprised to see you playing guitar on it, because you don't anymore... I don't much, no, but I've just decided to start doing it again. What age did you start to learn? I always knew a little bit because my dad played but I didn't really have that much interest. You know what it's like when your dad tries to get you into something! But when I started singing, and I wanted to try and write songs, I realised I'd have to teach myself a bit more. So you had no formal training? My mum always wanted to send me to a music school but we didn't really have the money. So even now, I'm not a technically good singer. If you asked me to sing a particular harmony, I wouldn't know how. This video can not be played Rag 'N' Bone Man performs Skin at the Brixton Jamm What else were you into as a kid? I played a lot of basketball  - but I was a little terror as a kid. I caused a lot of problems for my mum. We used to have the old bill round my house a lot. I grew up in a little town called Uckfield and there's not much to do - so we used to fight a lot. I was never in serious trouble, but we used to have the local bobby round the house saying, ""Rory's been up to this again."" Then you got into jungle music? Yeah, when I was 16 or 17. We used to do little pirate radio stations and put out jungle mixes. What were those pirate radio shows like? Well, we have a couple of tapes, which are never allowed to be shown to anyone, ever! They are really bad. I listened back to one the other day and it is terrible. I'm keeping them firmly locked away. What's the most embarrassing bit? It's my voice. It's only just broken so I kind of sound like Scooby Doo. An acoustic performance on Later... With Jools gave Human early exposure in the UK You've been making music as Rag 'N' Bone Man for five or six years, now. Did you have to work to support yourself at the beginning? Yeah, I was a carer, looking after people with Asperger syndrome and Down's syndrome. My sister does something similar. It's a very rewarding job but quite a draining one. Mentally draining, yeah. But most of the time it was pretty fun, to be honest.I looked after a brother and sister who had Down's syndrome, and we used to drive around in the car, stick on Disney songs and sing along. That was my life for about four years. What was their favourite Disney song? I used to do impressions of the Jungle Book characters to the kids; and we loved The Aristocats as well. That was one of our favourites - Everybody Wants To Be A Cat. During that period, you gave away your Wolves EP for free. Why? Wolves marked a point where I wanted to write songs properly and I wanted a wider audience to hear them. So I thought, ""Why don't we just give it away? How can that be a bad thing?"" People love free stuff. And it worked. If definitely widened the audience. Was there a song that people really responded to? There's one calledLife In Her Yet,external. I wrote it after I spoke to my granddad about living on his own again, after losing his wife. I can't imagine being with someone for 50 years and then being on your own. That was the first song where I felt I could write about stuff like that. Where did Human come from? A friend asked me a question I didn't really feel qualified to answer, and I was like, ""Why are you asking me?"" That's what prompted the line, ""I'm no prophet or messiah"". Like, go and ask someone else. I don't have the answers for you! It's funny, because I spoke to other people and they think it's about humanity. Maybe it isâ¦ but that's what's good about music - people can interpret the song for themselves. In addition to his place on the Sound of 2017, the singer recently won the Brits Critics' Choice award I saw you play in Brixton recently, and you told the audience: ""It's hard to write sad songs when I feel so happy."" How big a problem is it? There was a period where I felt a lot of frustration and  and I wasn't happy in my relationship - and that definitely did make me write in a certain way. But I'm still learning as a songwriter, so I think I've definitely got it in me to write happier songs. Whether they'll be good or not, I don't know. You recently tweeted you'd been up at 3am writing rap lyrics about EastEnders, so that can always be the basis of album number two. Haha! Yeah, I still have that really childish side to me. I have a couple of tracks on the new album that I rap on. I need people to hear that side of my music, as well. Rag 'N' Bone Man's debut album, Human, will be released on 10 February by Sony Music.

"When a fire at an underground music event in California killed 36, families whose adult children had been missing for months or years were among those who feared the worst. Daleen Berry explains why she went looking for her daughter at the Ghost Ship. I had moved across the country to find my daughter, Trista, but the deadly warehouse fire in Oakland in December forced me to take the first step, the one I had been dreading. After hearing that people actually lived in the warehouse of artists' studios and performance spaces known as the Ghost Ship, I needed to see for myself, to ensure Trista - the name I'll call her to protect her privacy - was not among the dead. At the scene many had gathered to grieve and pay their respects. There were also people like me, who had lost touch with their loved ones for weeks, months, or even years, and were fearful they were inside when the fire started. I took the advice of an officer and drove to the Alameda County Sheriff's Office, where they had set up a makeshift family assistance centre to provide emotional support and privacy for the family members. We waited for updates from Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf and found comfort in a safe place, together. On one wall inside the centre were three lists: the confirmed dead, those who had been located and were safe, and those still reported as missing. On that last list were about 150 names. I knew then I was far from alone. Somehow, it made it easier to speak the words I'd refused to let myself believe: ""My daughter is missing."" Unlike TV, where missing people are portrayed as victims of sexual trafficking or serial murderers, most adults disappear for far less sinister reasons. As of late December, the California justice department had 20,470 reports of missing persons in the state. Of those, 7,854 are like my daughter, classified as ""voluntary missing adults"". More than 8,000 are runaways. Another 1,060 people were taken by a family member, while 764 disappeared under suspicious circumstances and 114 went missing during a catastrophe. At just 51, stranger abduction cases number the lowest. The 48 hours in the family assistance centre were among the most painful in my life, as I struggled to answer one question after another. When did you last hear from your daughter? June. Did you file a missing persons report? No. Do you have a preferred funeral home? No. This video can not be played Oakland residents held a vigil for victims of the fire A few months earlier I had packed up everything I owned, leaving behind family and friends to follow Trista's path west. I didn't tell them the real reason I was leaving - I wouldn't rest until I knew where Trista was. A kind and caring free spirit, Trista had gravitated to places like the Ghost Ship in the past. I knew that she might have lived there because this was her community: musicians, artists and other creative people. When I went to work for a small start-up in Oakland in 2009, she lived with me, then later followed me back to West Virginia. From there she travelled to Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, meeting up with fellow musicians. She was content to live in her own world, collecting items cast to the kerb and transforming them into beautiful works of art. But by 2014, while I was put the finishing touches on a true crime book about a missing daughter, Trista was becoming increasingly distant and withdrawn. By then, my daughter's temporary forays into seclusion had become legendary. I had been trying to understand them for 10 years because, at times weeks or even months would pass without so much as a word. But I always knew she would reach out to someone - my sister, her brother, my mother. Not this time, though. Trista terminated all but two ties in February 2015, when she returned to the Bay Area. By June 2016, the last time I heard from her, she severed the rest. I called her brother in San Francisco: he hadn't heard from her in a year. She changed her cell phone number. All of my emails to her bounced back. ""The email account that you tried to reach does not exist,"" Google repeatedly told me. This wasn't my first trip to Oakland to look for Trista. I drove there one month before the fire. I needed to check out our old neighbourhood in case my daughter had returned. She hadn't. Some of the victims of the fire were LGBT or made outcasts in other ways; people who believed their families had given up on them - or vice versa. But families like mine with missing children don't give up. We may stumble around, accidentally making matters worse. But it is never intentional. I met a few other parents whose children died in the fire. They didn't leave until the last handful of charred ashes was carried from the scene - when they knew for sure their child was truly, finally gone. Young and talented: Tributes pour in for Oakland fire dead A day after the fire, I finally forced myself to open the laptop Trista left behind in West Virginia a year earlier. I spent hours reaching out to her friends, fellow musicians, and a previous employer. They hadn't heard from her in years. No one knew anything. It was like Trista had closed the door on her old life, never to reopen it again. But I couldn't just wait for a phone call telling me if my daughter was dead or alive. I had to know myself, so I drove to Oakland from Sacramento. And waited, for as long as it took. After spending two days at the family services centre, I stumbled into my hotel room, still struggling with the enormity of it all. What will I do if they find her? What if they don't? The following morning, one of the mental health professionals on hand to help the families guided me down a corridor and into an office. There, two women greeted me from the state justice department's missing persons unit. ""We've located 1,000 people since 2001,"" they said. ""Even a few live Jane Does,"" they added hopefully. They asked more questions. I signed more paperwork. Then, after careful instructions, a gloved hand gave me what looked like a pink and white emery board. I opened my mouth, did as they directed, and handed over my saliva - my DNA - and the only link to my daughter. I just wanted to find Trista. Beg for her forgiveness. Tell her I was sorry - for me, for my mistakes, and for not understanding her well enough. For my family, who did likewise, and in whose heart she still holds a sacred place. Given that all 36 victims of the Ghost Ship fire have been identified, I have to believe Trista is still alive. Still out there, somewhere. Like the 150 or so other worried mothers of those on the missing list, I have but one thought: I love you. Please come back to me. Or - at the very least - phone home.

"During its 11-year-long civil war, Sierra Leone became famous for blood diamonds. Rebel and government groups fought brutally over diamond-rich territory in the north of the country and funded themselves by selling the stones to international buyers. Fourteen years after the conflict ended, diamond mining operations are still under way in the northern district of Kono. A South African company, Koidu Holdings, runs a large mine that uses sophisticated machinery to blast through kimberlite and identify diamond-dense areas in the deep earth. Nearby, artisanal miners line river banks, armed with sieves, spades and buckets. One of these miners, Philo, has worked in Kono for the past 23 years, but was driven out during the conflict and lived in Guinea as a refugee. When the war simmered down in December 2000, he returned home and started diamond mining again a year later. Many artisanal miners will admit that they have not found a diamond in months and are desperately poor. Yet in a country where there is 70% youth unemployment, mining at least provides some form of livelihood. Most men mine in a team of three. Philo works with two friends. One of them dives to scoop a bucket of mud and grit from the riverbed, while another man holds him down so he does not drift with the tide. The third collects the bucket and empties it into a mound. Once there is enough, the sifting begins. The three men swap roles regularly, to avoid getting too cold. Philo complains of chills when he gets out of the water and sucks a packet of cheap rum to warm up, saying: ""This work is tough and physically straining - if I had the qualifications or opportunity to do another job then I would at once."" The swampy area around the river has been dug out by artisanal miners, who are dotted all over, urgently scooping mud and sifting through it. At last, after three hours of sifting, Philo is thrilled to have found a tiny diamond. Some miners are able to invest in what is known as a ""rocker"". They use a power hose to squirt water through a layer of mud piled on to fine mesh. Once the mud is cleared they are more likely to spot a glinting diamond. However, Philo does not have this luxury. ""We are not able to afford this kind of machinery, we have to manage with just a bucket, spade and shaker [sieve],"" he says. In the local market each shaker sells for 25,000 Leones (about Â£3.50). Soon after Philo has discovered a diamond, he packs up early and heads into town with his team. He is happy, saying: ""This was a very good day, we hadn't seen a diamond for nearly a month."" On the way to his house, he bumps into his elder brother outside a shop. They greet each other in front of the rocky kimberlite mountain that has been created by Koidu Holdings' blasts. Philo says that he is jealous of their machinery and wealth, especially as diamonds in shallow ground are running out. Back home, Philo relaxes in his room with his uncle. During the conflict his mother was shot and killed by rebels, just outside the room in which he is now sitting. His whole house was burned down and had to be rebuilt. The following day Philo heads into Koidu town to sell his diamond in an office just off the high street. The going rate is $3,200 (Â£2,520) for a carat that is 40% pure, and much less for gems of lower purity. Philo obtains only $35 (about Â£28) for his find, but he is pleased as it is more than he had expected. All photographs byOlivia Acland,external Sierra Leone country profile Â© 2025 BBC.

"Olga Beno did not initially realise she was a winner A Canadian woman who has used the same lottery numbers for nearly 30 years has won the jackpot, winning a CA$5.3m ($3.9m; Â£3.2m) cash prize. Olga Beno from Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia, says she ""dreamt up"" the winning set of numbers in May 1989 and has regularly used them ever since. The win is a fillip for the cancer sufferer, who has had to sell her home to fund her treatment. She now plans to build an easy-access ranch-style home with her winnings. ""I know my numbers by heart, and I thought I saw them on the television screen the evening after the draw, but my eyes aren't good,"" Ms Benowas quoted by Atlantic Lottery as saying,external. ""So I forgot about it."" The next morning, she was going through the newspaper when she saw the winning digits again. ""At first I thought - it can't be. It's a mistake in the paper. Then I said to my sister, 'I think I won the lottery'. ""She said 'Phone me back when you want to tell me the truth'."" Ms Beno was one of two people to win CA$5.3m from the 28 December draw. The second ticket was sold in western Canada. Ten years ago she was diagnosed with Stage Four cancer and had to sell her home and start renting. She said that her husband, children and grandchildren had helped her to survive the illness, and that her intention now is to spoil them by taking them to Disney World.

"Intel's Project Alloy headset was announced last year - but the CES demo was brand new Intel has shown off a headset that can replace a room's pre-scanned furniture with more appropriate video game scenery in virtual reality. The capabilities of the firm's Project Alloy headset, currently in development, were demoed at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Chief executive Brian Krzanich said Intel planned to license the technology to manufacturers by the end of 2017. But one analyst said VR remained a difficult market to target. The headset does not require a separate PC or a connection to a power source - both computer and battery are built in, noted Mr Krzanich as he introduced the latest prototype. Two players in a mock living room demonstrated on stage how the headset could create a virtual replica of the room featuring scanned obstacles such as furniture. Intel calls this ""merged reality"". In the demo, the bookcases and coffee table were then replaced, digitally, by similar-sized scenery more suited to the game - a futuristic spaceship. The headset converted scanned objects into more appropriate bits of video game scenery Project Alloy was first unveiled in August last year, but this was its most advanced demo yet. ""It was certainly interesting,"" said tech analyst Brian Blau at Gartner, who also praised the freedom offered by an ""all-in-one"" headset without a cable. However, he said it would have been even more impressive had the living room been scanned by the headset itself. ""They did say [the room] was pre-scanned, so I was a little bit disappointed by that."" The device will not be manufactured by Intel, but instead it will offer the technology to other tech firms to build products around. Intel hopes this process will begin in the final quarter of 2017. But the project's success may rely on others being willing to make content for it. ""They can enable all kinds of stuff but if it is not for the rest of those pieces they'll just have the parts out there,"" said Mr Blau. A demo of Project Alloy last year showed how the wearer's hand could be represented within the virtual world The firm also showed off a variety of other uses for a wide range of VR headsets - including high definition 360-degree video captured at a waterfall in Vietnam. Mr Blau said the use of volumetric video - which lets viewers peer around objects as though they were really present in the captured scene - was impressive. ""It is something we won't really see en masse for a long time because of its heavy data requirements,"" Mr Blau added. Other chip makers besides Intel have been developing virtual reality headset technology. Nvidia, for example, has been working onsoftware and processors,externalto power computing-intensive experiences. AMD is developing itsSulon Q headset,external, which - like Project Alloy - incorporates a computer and battery onboard, meaning no need for tethers or cables. Chip maker AMD recently announced it's own Sulon Q VR and AR headset. There is some optimism around the potential for growth within the virtual reality market at CES. US unit sales of VR headsets are predicted to reach 2.5 million in 2017, according to a presentation at the trade show by the Consumer Technology Association. But during Intel's event, Mr Krzanich acknowledged that many were still unsure if the technology would become truly popular. ""A lot of people are questioning is virtual reality going to take off, is it going to go anywhere?"" he acknowledged .

"The Ocean Medallion device can be incorporated into jewellery or simply carried in a passenger's pocket Cruise line Carnival has launched a wearable gadget that allows services on board its ships to be personalised for guests. The Ocean Medallion can be worn as a necklace, clip or keychain - or carried in a passenger's pocket. It will connect to onboard facilities, tracking meal orders or automatically unlocking guests' cabins as they approach the door, for example. One analyst said it would have to be easy to use to entice holidaymakers. Details of the project are being outlined at two events at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. The Ocean Medallion will connect with onboard systems on the first specially modified cruise ship later this year via internet of things technology. Other ships in the Princess Cruises fleet will then adopt the system. It was a ""great example of novel uses for smart devices"", said Martin Garner, a tech analyst at CCS Insight. ""But, because people go on cruises as a relaxing holiday, the system will have to work flawlessly and be super-easy to use,"" he told the BBC. He also noted that, just like upgrading a big hotel, the venture would likely be a costly one - which adds ""a degree of risk"" for Carnival. The first ship to feature the system is the Regal Princess. 75 miles (121km) of cables, more than 7,000 sensors and 4,000 digital screens were installed in 10 days in Italy. ""It's going to almost be invisible to guests,"" the company said. ""They're not going to realise how much [technology] is in here."" Cruise ship workers will receive information about guests via the Ocean Medallion Holiday resorts and cruise ship brands, including Carnival's rival Royal Caribbean Cruises, increasingly offer visitors access to various services via smart bands or wearable gadgets. The undertaking could perhaps foreshadow what life in a future smart city or internet of things-powered shopping complex might be like. But Mr Garner noted not everyone had the capabilities of a cruise line. ""City officials don't typically have the budget to do grand-vision schemes like the Carnival re-fit,"" he said. ""In fact, most cities are chronically short of budget."" Connection technologies built in to the Ocean Medallion include Bluetooth and near field communications (NFC), according to the travel firm. This will allow passengers to: unlock their cabin doors automatically as they approach find the location of friends and family onboard the ship pay for merchandise without using cash or a credit card navigate from one place to another on the vessel connect guests to a gambling platform accessible around the ship The service will be offered first to passengers on the Regal Princess ship from November. It will then be expanded to the Royal Princess and Caribbean Princess ships in 2018.

But what impact has Nafta had in Mexico, and what would its potential demise mean for the country? In a leafy square in Mexico City on a warm December evening a group of excited children are hitting a brightly coloured pinata stuffed with sweets. A fellow passer-by explains to me that pinatas are a Mexican tradition, particularly at Christmas and birthdays. However, Mexicans also like pinatas ""in the shape of everything we want to hit"", he says. ""The latest trend is Donald Trump pinatas,"" he adds. This video can not be played A look back at some of the things Donald Trump has said about Mexicans Mr Trump is not popular in Mexico. He wasincredibly rude about Mexicansduring his election campaign, and at a time when the world seems to be turning away from free trade he threatened to end the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Mexico and Canada. The important thing about Nafta is that companies importing and exporting between the three countries pay no tariffs. Mr Trump believes it's been bad for the US as cheaper Mexican labour has meant some US manufacturers have moved production across the border, resulting in job losses at home. Nafta was implemented in 1994 and over the past 23 years Mexico has grown as a manufacturing hub. Today the United States and Mexico trade over $500bn (Â£400bn) in goods and services a year, equal to about $1.5bn a day. Mexico is the US's second-biggest export market, and the US is Mexico's largest. Thierry Legros says without Nafta his farming business would be under threat Red Sun Farms, a large vegetable-growing firm in central Mexico, depends on the free trade agreement. Its managing director, Thierry Legros, shows me into a vast greenhouse, 200m long, with row upon row of tomato plants. The company also grows peppers and exports 90% of its crop to the US and Canada. So what would it mean if Mr Trump repealed the Nafta agreement completely with its tariff-free trading? ""We might need to close the whole company,"" Thierry tells me. ""It would be around 3,000 direct jobs, so with all the indirect that's quite a lot, probably double that."" Outside Thierry's office three flags flutter in the wind - one for each Nafta country. The three Nafta flags at Red Sun Farms reflect the company's integration within the free trade area Red Sun Farms even owns a farm in the US and sends Mexican workers over there. However, there's a stark wage differential, with pay significantly higher in the US. ""Right now with the exchange rate that's huge,"" Thierry explains, ""it's about one to eight, one to 10."" These Red Sun Farms workers in Mexico earn far less than their counterparts in the US As well as enabling Mexico to export freely, Nafta also opened the door to US imports, giving Mexican consumers much greater choice. ""It was an achievement, it was against history,"" says economic consultant Luis de la Calle, who was one of the negotiators of the free trade agreement. ""Most Mexicans thought that it was impossible or not convenient to have a strategic association with the US, and many people in the US never thought that Mexico could be their partner."" You can listen toIn Business: Mexico and Mr Trumpon BBC Radio 4 at 20:30 GMT on Thursday, 5 January and at 21:30 GMT on Sunday, 8 January. Increased demand, as a result of free trade, forced Mexican manufacturers to improve quality. Luis de la Calle says that before Nafta Mexico had three producers of TV sets, and the quality was ""awful"". But today, Mexico is ""the largest manufacturer of TV sets in the world"". They are exported and are ""high quality, completely different from the protected market we had before"". The instantly recognisable VW Beetles are manufactured in Puebla, Mexico Mexico is now a centre of manufacturing for overseas companies, such as the motor industry. General Motors and Ford both have factories in Mexico as well as the US. But Donald Trump has put public pressure on US companies not to move production, and has threatened to impose import duties on cars coming in from Mexico. It's a sensitive subject and the American carmakers refused to be interviewed. Donald Trump had this message for the car industry earlier this week However, in the city of Puebla, a two-hour drive from the capital, the German car manufacturer Volkswagen is the biggest employer with 14,000 staff. It's the only place in the world where VW produces its famous Beetle, and as you enter the site you're greeted by a display of Beetles suspended in the air like a piece of installation art. The Golf and Jetta models are also produced here. Thomas Karig from VW Mexico was tight-lipped about whether the firm had come under any pressure about jobs Like the US carmakers, Volkswagen's Mexican production is integrated with its US plant. ""We use a lot of parts coming from the US for assembly here in Mexico in Puebla, and our colleagues in Chattanooga in Tennessee - they use a lot of parts coming from Mexico,"" explains Thomas Karig from Volkswagen Mexico. This integration is possible because there are no tariffs to pay each time components are sent from one Nafta country to another. But when I ask whether Volkswagen has come under pressure from Mr Trump about keeping jobs in the US, the atmosphere cools and there is a curt ""no comment"". The Nafta agreement has not benefited everyone in Mexico though. Some small farmers were unable to compete with US agricultural imports and big Mexican rivals. According to a study by the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research, from 1991 to 2007 some 4.9 million family farmers were displaced. Some found work with big exporting agricultural companies, but there was still a net loss of 1.9 million jobs. Three of Aurelio's children are illegal migrants in the US An hour's drive from Puebla I meet Aurelio, whose family has farmed a tiny patch of land since 1925. Deep in the dry countryside he raises a few cows. Job opportunities are scarce and three of his five children have migrated illegally to the US where they have found work painting cars. But Donald Trump has said he wants to deport illegal immigrants. Aurelio takes out his mobile phone and calls one of his sons in the US. Is his son worried about this, I ask. His son says that if there is a chance of being deported they will have to look elsewhere, but adds: ""Mexico is a tough choice because of lack of opportunities, violence, high taxes and the economic situation, so it wouldn't be easy."" President Obama has deported at least 2.4 million illegal immigrants so this isn't a new policy. And according to the Pew Research Center, by 2014 more Mexican immigrants returned to Mexico than migrated to the US. Luis de la Calle says both the US and Mexico benefit from Nafta Mr de la Calle acknowledges that the free trade agreement has split the country. He says there are two types of regions in Mexico. ""[There are] parts of the south of Mexico that are disconnected from international trade, that are lagging behind, where Nafta had little impact. Rates of growth are low, there is little investment, and you don't see large manufacturing operations."" In contrast to this, he says: ""There are 16 or 17 other states that grow very fast, you see a lot of dynamism."" These he describes as ""Nafta states"" with exporting businesses. However, he dismisses Mr Trump's criticism of Mexico. ""He says [Nafta's] been great for Mexico, actually his whole argument is that Mexico is doing so well. It's flattering."" He also claims that the US is benefiting from its close manufacturing links with Mexico. However, when I ask who would come off worst if Nafta were repealed, the US or Mexico, he answers, ""Mexico because we are smaller, but the US would lose quite a bit as well."" Donald Trump wasn't the first US presidential candidate to criticise Nafta. Hillary Clinton and even Barack Obama did so on their campaign trails. But abandoning it completely? The US may find it has too much to lose and perhaps Mr Trump has realised that too.

"Young Cubans are increasingly studying English As Cuba slowly opens up its economy to the rest of the world, more and more Cubans are learning English. The Cuban government has made proficiency in English a requirement for all high school and university students. As Will Grant reports from Havana, that approach differs from the Cold War, when Russian was the preferred foreign language. At the annual Havana Jazz Festival, the audience members, much like the music, were a mix of international and Cuban. Sitting on plastic chairs at the open-air venue, visitors from the United States, Europe and China mingled with local jazz aficionados. On stage, a saxophonist who lives in Denmark was reunited with some old Cuban friends. At such an international event, the common language is generally English. Many Cubans are already learning the language themselves, and if not, they are trying to make sure their children are. Morning assembly at Jesus Suarez Gayol Secondary School on the outskirts of Havana begins with the school's anthem. Secondary school pupils are expected to reach a certain standard in English The school is named after one of the guerrillas who fought alongside Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara but these teenagers are growing up in an increasingly different Cuba to the one Jesus Suarez did. For a start, a certain proficiency in English is now a requirement for all secondary school children and university graduates. During the Cold War, students could choose between learning English and Russian but Cuba's educational authorities told the BBC they now consider English a necessary skill for all of the nation's youth. ""As an international language, English has always had a place in our curriculum,"" says Director of Secondary Education Zoe de la Red Iturria. ""But we are now rolling out new techniques to evolve our learning of the English language,"" she adds. Zoe de la Red Iturria wants to modernise English-language learning in Cuba But language-teaching methods remain quite traditional, relying heavily on textbooks, parrot-fashion repetition and with only very limited Internet access. Olga Perez, national adviser for English teaching in Cuba, says the authorities are hoping to tackle that last issue. ""It would be very good for us if we had the internet in the schools. And we hope that in the future, we'll not only have the internet, we're also dreaming of installing language laboratories in every school."" And it is not just in the classrooms that English can be heard more frequently but on the streets of Havana, too. In what was a record year for tourism to Cuba, many Cubans have tried to teach themselves English without the help of any formal classes. Darvis Luis sells second-hand books and posters to tourists. He says he learnt English entirely through computer games, music videos and rock songs. ""I have to make conversation because I need to make money to eat,"" he says in easy-flowing, fast English. ""I have to learn how to speak with them and I have to get better and better. I tell them a story because books aren't so easy to sell. So you have to make them believe in what you're saying."" Darvis Luis taught himself English to be able to better sells his second-hand books to tourists Resources for Anglophiles and budding English-language students like Darvis Luis are limited in Cuba. One place they can go is Cuba Libro, the island's only English-language bookstore. Nestled in the leafy Havana district of Vedado, it is the brainchild of US healthcare journalist and long-time Havana resident Conner Gorry. Ms Gorry says that after some initial misgivings, local residents ""welcomed us with open arms"" once they saw ""the free cultural programming, high-quality literature and community outreach"" on offer. ""Literature is not subversive,"" she says. ""A Cuban government-run publishing house just published George Orwell's 1984 and that's available in state-run bookstores."" ""With increased tourism and increased business connections to the wider world, the Cubans are encouraging people to learn English. So we've become a resource,"" she adds. In the past months, as well as the jazz festival, Havana has hosted the annual film festival and the international ballet festival. The Latin American Film Festival has drawn Cubans and tourists to Havana It is at events like these that the thaw in relations with the US seems clearer than ever. The decision by the Obama Administration and the Castro government to rebuild their diplomatic ties has undeniably brought Cubans and Americans closer together. It has also brought about some potentially lasting collaboration in science and the arts. There are people on both sides who fear those steps could soon be reversed, especially in light ofcomments made to that effect by President-elect Donald Trump. For now though, the young students at Jesus Suarez are just keen to keep improving their ability to communicate with the rest of the world.

"This video can not be played Zach still remembers the moment he found out his mother had died Zach was four years old when his mother's new partner, David Potts, broke into the family home and set it on fire. Now aged nine, he is able to remain remarkably calm when describing how such a tragic event unfolded. ""[Potts] bought two litres of petrol and poured it all over the house, everywhere,"" he explains to theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""Then my mum and eldest brother went to try and stop him, but he lit the fuel just in time."" Potts, Zach's mother, Tracy, and his 15-year-old half-brother, Shaun, were killed in the blaze in Manchester, in September 2011. Zach survived, along with his 18-year-old half-sister, Cailin. He spent the next two months at a children's hospital. His father, Ric - who Zach now lives with - says it was ""heartbreaking"" to see the condition his son was left in. ""He had wires and tubes and things coming out from him all over the place. They put him into an induced coma, to help his body deal with the shock and the burns as best as [it could]. He was about 20% burns, mainly up to his arms."" According to Dr Jane Monckton-Smith, a criminologist currently leading one of the biggest studies of domestic homicide in the UK, such family killings are on the increase. She says that in 95% of cases the killer will be a man, and usually the head of the household. The perpetrators of such crimes often share certain traits, such as a need to control those around them, she adds. Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme'sfull film on domestic homicide here. Ric believes Potts showed this same behaviour towards Zach's mother, Tracy. ""From what I could gather he used to check the phone to see who she'd been talking to and texting,"" he says. ""He was allowed out [to socialise], but she wasn't."" Zach with his mother, Tracy Zach and his father both agree that what happened that day has brought them closer together. But Zach still remembers the moment he found out his mother had died. ""I was crying, and when I think about it, it makes me emotional,"" he says. His burns act as a reminder of what happened that night. Children at school sometimes ask him about them, leaving him to decide whether to ignore or explain them. Denise Williams met her ex-husband, Steven Wilson, when she was 16. Six months into their marriage he had started to show his ""true colours"", she says. ""He knew I had nowhere to go, no-one to run to. He'd call me all the different names under the Sun, he'd verbally abuse me, mentally abuse me, physically abuse me, punch me, kick me, whatever he had to do."" Denise was abused by her ex-husband Denise had cut ties with Wilson on several occasions, only to go back to him. She left him for the final time in February 2002, but - planning to go back for them later - did not take her two sons, Bret, eight, and, Bradley, seven, with her. When the couple met at a restaurant a few days later, the children were in the back of Wilson's car. He assaulted Denise, and drove off with them. About 20 minutes later, Denise received a call from Wilson. In it, she says, Wilson told her: ""I've just killed the kids, and I'm going to kill myself."" Denise remembers trying to listen out for the boys in the background, but couldn't hear them. Wilson had murdered his two sons by stabbing them. Denise vividly recalls the moment the police sergeant knelt on the floor and told her: ""Denise, they're dead."" She still suffers from regular nightmares in which she relives their deaths. ""I'm on a field, and I can see the car, and I can hear them calling, 'Mummy, Mummy, please help us Mummy.' And all I can see is a knife - a knife going up and down in a car as he's killing the boys."" Wilson was given two life sentences for the murders, but hanged himself in prison. Denise says she felt ""cheated"", and ""very, very angry at the fact that he hasn't got to live with this"". ""I'm the one left behind having to cope, trying to live with all this."" Wilson killed himself on Mother's Day - which Denise believes was one final act of revenge. According to Dr Monckton-Smith, perpetrators of domestic homicide will try to take their own lives ""in a lot of these cases"" - and often show ""a lack of remorse, which could be because they have a personality disorder"". Dr Jane Monckton-Smith says cases of domestic homicide can be stopped if warning signs are acted upon She also believes the killers nearly always plan the murders. Denise believes her boys were killed by Wilson as an act of revenge towards her. ""He lost power, he lost the control he had over me. Because I left him, he'd lost everything,"" she says. ""[The murders] were just purely to hurt me, because he knew how close me and the boys were. ""I think he knew that he'd lost the boys - that they'd come back to me - and so, if he couldn't have them, he made sure I couldn't have them [either]."" But despite the trauma she has suffered, Denise says she is glad of the eight years she had with her boys. ""The children may have died, but their memory is never going to die - it's always there.""
