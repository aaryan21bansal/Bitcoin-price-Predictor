"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen spoke via video conference on Saturday Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have ""agreed the importance"" of finding a post-Brexit trade deal, Downing Street has said. They agreed progress has been made in talks between the EU and UK but ""significant gaps"" remain, No 10 said. Both have instructed their chief negotiators to ""work intensively"" in order to try to bridge those gaps. Negotiations between the UK and EU broke up on Friday without agreement. Both sides are calling on the other to compromise on key issues, including fishing and government subsidies. Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen spoke during a phone call on Saturday and agreed to speak on a regular basis. A Downing Street spokesperson said the two had agreed on the importance of finding an agreement ""as a strong basis for a strategic EU-UK relationship in future."" The UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost,tweeted,externalthat work to resolve differences between the UK and EU ""begins as soon as we can next week"". What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit deal must be made, says business boss Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? Brexit jargon explained Speaking earlier, while on a visit to Leeds, Mr Johnson said he wants adeal like one struck between the EU and Canada, but reiterated the UK was ready should it have to leave without a deal. ""We're resolved on either course, we're prepared for either course and we'll make it work but it's very much up to our friends and partners,"" Mr Johnson said. It comes after Mrs von der Leyen called for talks to ""intensify"", as both sides set an October deadline to settle their differences. The significance of today's call between Boris Johnson and the head of the EU commission is that both sides have agreed to keep talking. Although formal negotiations ended yesterday without agreement, instead of throwing in the sponge - as Boris Johnson would put it - talks will now intensify. But a Downing Street statement made clear that while there are notable (and well-known) differences over fishing rights and subsidies to businesses, these aren't the only issues that need to be solved. There is the potential to compromise - for example, on phasing in new fishing arrangements and on having state aid provisions similar to other free trade agreements - but it's not clear the political willingness is yet there on both sides. The EU has to satisfy the demands of 27 different states. And Boris Johnson has to convince Brexit-supporting backbenchers that he hasn't sold out. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab aimed to reassure them by stating today that the days of being ""held over a barrel"" by Brussels are long gone. Asked about potential compromises that could be made, Mr Johnson said: ""The balance of trade is overwhelmingly on the side of the EU in the sense that they export much more to us than we do to them, certainly in manufacturing goods, and so we think there is a big opportunity for both sides to do well."" He pointed out that Canada is ""some way away"" but had managed to strike a deal with the EU while the UK remained the bloc's biggest trading partner. But he acknowledged a no-deal outcome where the UK would follow mainly World Trade Organization rules on trade with the EU was possible and would ""work very well"" - describing it as anAustralia-style arrangement. Speaking at the virtual Conservative Party conference, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the talks with the EU had been ""a tough process"" but ""with goodwill we should be able to get a deal"". He added: ""Recognising that we share the same high environmental and workforce standards as they do, but we want to do things in our own way, is a bit difficult for them and also there is the very vexed issue to do with fisheries."" However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the conference the ""days of being held over a barrel by Brussels are long gone"", as he stressed any trade deal must be ""fair"". TheEU wants access to UK fishing grounds for its boatsand says reaching a ""fair deal"" is a pre-condition of a deal, while the UK says they should be ""first and foremost for British boats"". The prime minister has set the deadline of the EU Council meeting on 15 October for securing a deal. After six months of trade talks with the EU, Lord Frost has claimed the outlines of an agreement are visible, but he warned that, without further compromise from the EU, differences over the contentious topic of fishing may be impossible to bridge. He described the final round of negotiations as ""constructive"" but ""familiar differences remain"". On fishing, the gap was ""unfortunately very large"" and he called for the EU to ""move further before an understanding can be reached"" on state aid. His EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, agreed the negotiations had been conducted in a ""constructive and respectful atmosphere"", with some ""positive new developments on some topics"" - such as aviation safety and police co-operation. But he said there was ""a lack of progress on some important topics"", such as climate change commitments, ""as well as persistent serious divergences on matters of major importance for the European Union"", including state aid and fishing. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord David Frost The UK formally left the EU in January, but entered a transition period - where the UK has kept to EU trading rules and remained inside its customs union and single market - to allow the two sides to negotiate a trade deal. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, but there have been concerns over whether a plan would be agreed before that period runs out on 31 December. Issues that have become particular sticking points between negotiators are state aid - where governments give financial support to businesses - and fishing rules. The EU has said a deal must be reached before the end of October to allow it to be signed off by the member states before the end of the year, while Mr Johnson has said both sides should ""move on"" if agreement was not reached by the middle of the month. If a deal is not done, the UK will go on to trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization rules.

"Boris Johnson spent three nights in intensive care after contracting coronavirus Dominic Raab has said he was ""really worried"" the PM could have died from Covid-19 after he was admitted to intensive care in the spring. The foreign secretary stood in for Boris Johnson during his time in intensive care and while he recovered.

Worried Tories pining for the 'Old Boris' Conservative MPs launch 'levelling up' taskforce Mr Johnson spent three nights in intensive care at London's St Thomas' Hospital in April after contracting coronavirus. Speaking about his experience after leaving hospital, the PM said it ""could have gone either way"" and thanked healthcare workers for saving his life. Mr Raab told the virtual conference that coronavirus had ""hit us hard, taking lives on a tragic scale"". ""It nearly took the life of our prime minister, our friend as well as our leader. ""I get asked a lot how I felt, when I covered for him. ""Well, I really worried we might lose him, and I was worried for Carrie (Symonds), pregnant with baby Wilf. ""But I always had faith that with the outstanding NHS care he received and his fighting spirit, he'd pull through."" Admitting there would be ""lessons to be learnt"" following the government's handling of the crisis, the foreign secretary added: ""I have to say, for every hurdle we faced, with every heart-rending loss, there was also a tale of courage, a moment of inspiration."" Dominic Raab stepped in for the prime minister during his sickness Mr Raab also spoke about the prospect of a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and the EU. The UK and the EU have pledged to ""work intensively"" in order to resolve their differences and reach a deal. But Mr Raab said that although the government wanted a free trade deal with the EU, ""any deal must be fair"". ""The days of being held over a barrel by Brusselsâ¦ are long gone,"" the foreign secretary said. He added there was ""no question the government will control our fisheries"". Both sides have been calling on the other to compromise on key issues, which include fishing and government subsidies. Also speaking at the conference, Michael Gove outlined the government's plans to move more Civil Service jobs outside of London - part of its ""levelling up"" agenda to spread investment and opportunity beyond London and south-east England. The Cabinet Office minister said ""far too many government jobs"" were based in Westminster and Whitehall. Mr Gove added: ""We have an amazing Civil Service and it has drawn its resources and people from lots of different communities - I think we now need to give back to those communities as well."" Plans to opena second headquarters in Leedswere also announced.

"This video can not be played Storm Alex: See the moment a building is swept into raging flood waters At least two people have died and up to 20 are still missing after a powerful storm hit south-eastern France and north-western Italy. Named Alex, the storm brought fierce winds and torrential rain. A number of villages north of Nice in France suffered serious damage from floods and landslides, with roads, bridges and homes destroyed. In north-western Italy, flooding was described as ""historic"". A section of a bridge over the Sesia river collapsed. Flood warnings as heavy rain continues in UK French Prime Minister Jean Castex has deployed the army and released emergency funds to tackle the worst floods for decades in south-eastern France. Up to 20 people are either missing or have not checked in with relatives. ""There are very many people of whom we have no news,"" Mr Castex said. Flood damage in Saint-Martin-Vesubie in the Alpes-Maritimes of south-eastern France Bernard Gonzalez, prefect of the Alpes-Maritimes region, said: ""Just because their loved ones haven't been able to get in touch doesn't mean that they have been taken by the storm."" He said the prospect of more rain was ""a worry"". Meteorological agency MÃ©tÃ©o-France said 450mm (17.7in) of rain fell in some areas over 24 hours - the equivalent of nearly four months at this time of year, reports Reuters news agency. The southern Alps region appeared the worst hit, with serious damage in the Roya, TinÃ©e, Esteron and VÃ©subie valleys. The villages of Saint-Martin-VÃ©subie and Rimplas were cut off, with roads inaccessible. A collapsed bridge after heavy rains hit the village of RoquebilliÃ¨re in southern France A road in RoquebilliÃ¨re was partially washed away during the storm One 29-year-old resident of RoquebilliÃ¨re told Agence France-Presse: ""I lost everything but we are alive. There must be one room left in my house."" Two elderly people were swept away as their house collapsed in the village and their fate is unknown. On Friday, the storm also buffeted France's western Atlantic coast, causing tens of thousands of homes to lose power. Winds of more than 180km/h (112mph) were recorded in Brittany on Thursday and Friday. The two fatalities were a 53-year-old firefighter in the Aosta Valley who died during a rescue operation, and a 36-year-old man whose car was swept into a river in the Piedmont region. His brother managed to get out of the car. A section of a key bridge over the Sesia river in Piedmont's Vercelli province collapsed shortly after it had been reopened on Saturday afternoon. Damaged caused to a road near Cuneo in Italy's Piedmont region In the rest of Piedmont, several villages were cut off after the rains made roads impassable. The situation there was described as ""extremely critical"" by officials. Piedmont President Alberto Cirio told La Stampa that 630mm of rain had fallen in 24 hours, an amount ""unheard of since 1954"". Hundreds of aid workers have been sent to help rescue efforts in the cut-off villages. The storm also affected the north-western regions of Lombardy and Liguria. The Roja river in Ventimiglia has also flooded. Flood alerts remain for sections of the Po river which have swollen by 3m in 24 hours. One good piece of news was the rescue of about 20 people reported missing by Italian authorities just over the border in France. Venice's newly built Mose flooding system went into operation The city of Venice, which had been braced for high waters after suffering violent storms in August, was successfully protected by a flood barrier system recently declared fully operational.

"Calvert-Lewin has become the first Everton player to score in each of their opening four games in a Premier League season Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored his ninth goal of the season and James Rodriguez netted twice as Everton beat Brighton to make it four Premier League wins from four for the impressive table-topping Toffees. However, it was another game that will prompt questions about the quality of goalkeeper Jordan Pickford for both club and country. All was going well for the home side after Calvert-Lewin rose highest to head in at the back post to cap another excellent week that saw himscore his second hat-trick of the seasonand earn afirst call-up to the senior England squad. But in the closing stages of a first half in which he had barely been tested, England keeper Pickford dropped a tame bouncing ball at the feet of Neal Maupay, who then slotted the ball in on the turn. The heavy rain during the match was undoubtedly a contributing factor but the poor error comes not long after theshocking mistake he made in the Carabao Cup win at Fleetwood. Thankfully for the home side, they were able to reclaim the lead before the break when Rodriguez picked out fellow Colombian Yerry Mina, who headed in from a free-kick. And it was Rodriguez who put the game beyond Albion, firstly sliding in to finish off Alex Iwobi's chipped cross at the back post then finding space in the same area to tap home Abdoulaye Doucoure's pass. Brighton were able to claim a consolation through a superb Yves Bissouma strike in added time but they have now lost three of their first four games. They can argue they deserved to take something from the defeats by Chelsea and Manchester United, but they can have no complaints about this. Aside from Pickford's form, the only other negative for Carlo Ancelotti's side was losing forward Richarlison to injury in the first half. Everton lead the division, having taken 12 points from 12, but could be overtaken this weekend by Leicester and Liverpool, who both play on Sunday. Action and reaction from Everton v Brighton, plus the rest of Saturday's Premier League action Lawro's predictions v Man City and Scotland midfielder Weir This video can not be played Everton performance complete - Ancelotti on Brighton win Since joining Everton from Sheffield United in August 2016, Calvert-Lewin has played under six managers, the first of which, Ronald Koeman, occasionally played him at right wing-back and tasked him with providing opportunities for others. Now, though, under the tutelage of Ancelotti, he is developing into a supreme finisher and the side is set up to supply him. Earlier in the season, in reference to the striker, Ancelotti harked back to his time as boss of AC Milan, when Filipo Inzaghi made the predatory one-touch finish an artform. Calvert-Lewin is not at that level yet, but you can see the shared DNA. One early chance, gifted to him by an error from Bissouma, saw him quickly get the ball out of his feet and fire a shot that Mat Ryan had to palm away. His opening goal - converted at the back post from Gylfi Sigurdsson's cross - looks simple on the surface, but is a testament to positioning, prowess and the ever-growing understanding of the service he needs from a team that has come a long way from some of the limp, directionless displays of last season. This video can not be played Brighton contributed to own downfall - Potter Rodriguez is a big factor in that and the Colombian has now been directly involved in six goals in his five games for Everton in all competitions this season. The Toffees have scored 24 goals in their seven games of the campaign, currently more than any other side in Europe's top five leagues. Things are not quite so rosy at the other end of the pitch, though. Pickford, who looked shaky throughout the game, gifted Brighton their equaliser and could easily have presented them with another goal when he palmed out a cross to Maupay for a shot that Tom Davies blocked. And it is not a new problem - Pickford has made 11 errors leading to goals in the Premier League since his debut for Everton in August 2017, more than any other goalkeeper in that time. Everton's superb attacking talent compensated for his big mistake on Saturday, but his form will be a concern to Ancelotti and England manager Gareth Southgate with three international fixtures coming up this month. Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti, speaking to MOTD:""Brighton played well. We played well also. We managed the situation of the game well. We had composure defensively and had opportunities on the counter attack. The performance was complete and this was the reason we deserved to win."" On James Rodriguez:""As I said on the first day, the players with quality have not a problem with that (settling in). The quality is there because football is not so complicated. The pitch is always the same, the opponents are always 11, the ball is the same, the goal doesn't move. Football is simple. It is not complicated."" On Dominic Calvert-Lewin's impressive start to the season:""There is not just one reason. He is confident, we are seeing him improving and he is scoring goals and that is the most important motivation for a striker. This is the moment of Dominic Calvert-Lewin now."" Brighton boss Graham Potter:""I don't think Everton had so many chances but we helped them, second half certainly. To concede just before half time was a blow for us and then we didn't start the second half so well. ""I think we contributed a little bit to our downfall today and that is something we need to be better at. ""We have conceded all our goals against Chelsea, Manchester United and Everton and they are want you consider to be top sixish teams."" Everton have won each of their opening four games to a top-flight season for the first time since 1969-70, when they went on to win the title. Everton have won their first seven games in all competitions in a season for the first time since 1894-95 (won first eight). Brighton remain winless away at Everton in all competitions, drawing two and losing seven of their nine visits. This game saw three Colombians start a Premier League match for the first time (James RodrÃ­guez and Yerry Mina for Everton and Steven Alzate for Brighton), with Mina's goal the first in the competition scored and assisted (RodrÃ­guez) by two Colombians. Since the start of last season, Everton striker Calvert-Lewin has scored seven headed goals in the Premier League, more than any other player. Since his Everton debut in August 2017, Gylfi Sigurdsson has registered 13 assists in the Premier League, more than any other player for the Toffees (Digne next on 12). Maupay has scored four goals in his last three Premier League appearances, as many as he managed in his previous 22 in the competition.

His brother managed to get out of the car. A section of a key bridge over the Sesia river in Piedmont's Vercelli province collapsed shortly after it had been reopened on Saturday afternoon. Damaged caused to a road near Cuneo in Italy's Piedmont region In the rest of Piedmont, several villages were cut off after the rains made roads impassable. The situation there was described as ""extremely critical"" by officials. Piedmont President Alberto Cirio told La Stampa that 630mm of rain had fallen in 24 hours, an amount ""unheard of since 1954"". Hundreds of aid workers have been sent to help rescue efforts in the cut-off villages. The storm also affected the north-western regions of Lombardy and Liguria. The Roja river in Ventimiglia has also flooded. Flood alerts remain for sections of the Po river which have swollen by 3m in 24 hours. One good piece of news was the rescue of about 20 people reported missing by Italian authorities just over the border in France. Venice's newly built Mose flooding system went into operation The city of Venice, which had been braced for high waters after suffering violent storms in August, was successfully protected by a flood barrier system recently declared fully operational.

"The Conservatives plan to open a second headquarters in Leeds, the party's co-chairman has announced. The new HQ - a northern counterpart to Conservative Campaign Headquarters in London -  is expected to open next year, Amanda Milling said, as she opened the party's virtual conference. Some MPs have urged the PM to set out a broad post-Brexit vision for the party. It comes as Boris Johnson has promised low-deposit mortgages to help young people get onto the housing ladder. In an interview withthe Daily Telegraph,externalahead of his party's four-day conference, the prime minister said he had asked ministers to work up plans for encouraging long-term fixed-rate mortgages with 5% deposits. ""We need mortgages that will help people really get on the housing ladder even if they have only a very small amount to pay by way of deposit, the 95% mortgages,"" he said. ""I think it could be absolutely revolutionary, particularly for young people."" Worried Tories pining for the 'Old Boris' Everybody got 'complacent' over virus, suggests PM The Conservative Campaign Headquarters, in Westminster, London, is where general election campaigns are run. It was known for many years as Conservative Central Office. According to BBC political correspondent Iain Watson, it houses press officers who undertake the more political tasks which civil servants cannot do - including attacking opponents and rebutting opponents' attacks. It also liaises with the ""voluntary party"" - the grassroots foot soldiers - and raises funds for national campaigning. The Conservatives argue that the new Leeds headquarters will reinforce their commitment to deliver for those in northern constituencies who voted for the party for the first time at the general election in December. ""This new headquarters will provide the party with a base at the heart of the blue wall,"" Ms Milling said. Also speaking at the conference, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government wanted to move more Civil Service jobs outside of London. ""Far too many government jobs tend to be in the Westminster and Whitehall village,"" he said. ""We have an amazing Civil Service and it has drawn its resources and people from lots of different communities - I think we now need to give back to those communities as well."" Meanwhile, Downing Street has set out the details of anindependent review of transport connections across the UK,external. The review, led by Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy, will look at improving road and rail networks and will also examine the ""cost, practicality and demand"" of building a bridge or tunnel between Northern Ireland and Scotland. The transport study will set out advice on a ""wide range of possible options"" to improve the quality and availability of links across the UK, Downing Street said.  793,139ONS population estimate in 2019 3out of eight constituencies are held by the Conservatives 23out of 99 council seats are held by the Conservatives One of the stated aims of the Tories' virtual conference is to demonstrate that the party is listening to those voters who said they were merely lending their support to the Conservatives. There will be a lot of talk about ""levelling up"" - in other words, doing more to spread investment and opportunity beyond London and the South East. But some recently-elected Conservative MPs believe the term is vague and not easily understood by voters. One of the 2019 intake told our correspondent: ""We need to put flesh on the bones of this agenda - it has be about more than a couple of shiny new rail stations."" Another said the prime minister had to ""raise his sights"" and provide a longer-term vision, amid concerns over narrowing polls. Mr Johnson told the Telegraph that he was determined to press ahead with a ""massive domestic agenda"" and deliver on Conservative manifesto promises, despite the ongoing coronavirus crisis. The prime minister has promised to create ""Generation Buy"" with low-deposit mortgages to help get young people onto the housing ladder. He has also insisted he remains a low-tax, libertarian Conservative who will pay for the cost of the pandemic through a ""free market-led recovery"". Meanwhile, Mr Johnson dismissed newspaper reports that he and Chancellor Rishi Sunak were now rivals as ""genuinely untrue"". ""We are as one,"" he said. Boris Johnson hired a personal trainer after ending up in hospital with coronavirus Asked about his coronavirus strategy, the prime minister said ""all of this is being kept under constant review"". ""If we make progress, all of these measures are capable of being changed,"" he said. New rules, such as restricting gatherings to a maximum of six people and limiting opening hours for hospitality venues, are among the national measures that have been introduced around the UK. UK coronavirus cases up by 6,968 on Friday What are the Covid rules where you live? Mr Johnson also offered some weight loss advice, after losing more than two stone following his experiencecontracting coronavirus earlier this year. According to the paper, he now weighs 15st 8lbs - having been 17st 6lbs - and said his top tip was ""eat less, move more, weigh less"". Mr Johnson has previously revealed he hashired a personal trainerto lose weight after acknowledging he was ""too fat"" when he caught Covid-19. Analysis by Alice Aitken, BBC Reality Check You may remember that the Conservativespledged to build 40 new hospitalsin their 2019 election manifesto. On the eve of the party conference, the prime minister confirmed Â£3.7bn in funding for the project - an increase on the Â£2.8bn previously announced. Six Hospital Trusts had already been promised Â£2.7bn in funding while 21 others were given a share of Â£100m in seed funding to develop proposals. On Friday those Trusts were told they will all be fully-funded to deliver 25 new hospitals. A new hospital at Shotley Bridge in Durham has been added to the list and the government is also inviting bids for a further eight schemes. They say these new schemes mean 48 hospitals will be delivered by 2030. TEST AND TRACE EXPOSED:Panorama hears from whistleblowers working on the coronavirus tracking system LOVE LIFE:Fancy an escape?

"This video can not be played EC president Ursula von der Leyen said the bill breached the UK's previous commitments. The EU has begun legal proceedings against the UK after it refused to ditch plans to override sections of its Brexit divorce deal. An EU deadline for the government to remove sections of the Internal Market Bill expired on Wednesday. The ""letter of formal notice"" could eventually lead to a court case against the UK at the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court. But the EU has not walked away from talks over a post-Brexit trade deal. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the UK would have until the end of November to respond to the EU's concerns over the draft legislation. UK-EU trade talks are continuing in Brussels this week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said both sides should ""move on"" if a deal was not reached by mid-October. Government's Brexit plan gets MPs' final backing EU ultimatum to UK over Brexit talks What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? In a brief statement, Mrs von der Leyen said the bill was a ""full contradiction"" of previous UK commitments over how a hard border on the island of Ireland should be avoided. She added that the bill was by its ""very nature a breach of the obligation of good faith"" contained in the withdrawal agreement that took the UK out of the EU in January. A spokesperson for the UK government said the bill was a necessary ""safety net"" to protect trade between different parts of the UK. They added the government would respond the EU's letter ""in due course"". Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte appeared to play down the importance of the Commission's letter, calling the move ""more administrative than political"". Analysis by Nick Beake, BBC Brussels Correspondent Although the headline is dramatic, this was the EU's next logical step. When it fired the UK an ultimatum to scrap the most controversial parts of the Internal Market Bill by the end of September, it knew it would likely have to follow up on its threat. And now it has. But any legal path is long and unpredictable - with no resolution likely to come before the UK's transition period ends on 31 December. The legal advice given to the EU member states has been that for any alleged breach of the withdrawal agreement committed in 2020, they would have a further four years to pursue the UK. For any alleged breach committed after the transition period, the EU could use the dispute settlement mechanism (which both sides agreed to in the agreement) to penalise and fine the UK. Or, it could ask the European Court of Justice to do the same. But this is drawn out legal territory. It seems the latest legal development will not torpedo the ongoing trade talks - for now. Both sides insist they do want a deal within the coming weeks, but the EU says it won't sign one off, as long as the UK's bill remains as it is. The EU and the UK are now trying to walk two tightropes. And it's precarious balancing act. One route leads to a trade deal, the other to an ugly court battle. But both sides are looking dead ahead, and neither want to blink first. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for both the UK and EU to work together over trade differences, adding: ""A deal can be done here"". ""It's absurd that with weeks to go, the focus and the energy is not on their negotiations, it's on threatened court proceedings,"" he added. MPsgave their final backingto the Internal Market Bill earlier this week. However, it will have to be approved by the House of Lords before it becomes law. In a bid to head off a potential rebellion from Tory backbenchers, ministers have granted the Commons a say before powers to override the Brexit divorce deal could be used. Boris Johnson reached a deal with Tory MPs to amend the bill earlier this month. The letter sent to the UK is the first stage in the process the Commission uses against countries it believes have broken EU law. It can end with the Commission taking governments to court at the European Court of Justice. The ECJ continues to have powers over the UK during the transition period, including over the interpretation and implementation of the withdrawal agreement. The court has powers to force countries to comply with its rulings, including imposing financial penalties. However, most cases are settled before then - and it can take many years for a case to move through the court. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses. The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail.

"Dame Carolyn will step down as CBI boss in November A post-Brexit trade deal ""can and must be made"", the organisation representing British businesses has said ahead of further UK-EU trade talks on Monday. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the boss of the Confederation of British Industry, said it was the time for ""the spirit of compromise to shine through"". The Brexit transition period, in which the UK has kept to EU trading rules, ends on 31 December. The UK and EU are yet to agree a deal that will govern their future trade. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said a trade agreement with the EU must be done by 15 October if it is going to be ready for the start of 2021. But despite this, talks have run into problems. There are still key points of disagreement - including, for example, on fishing. The next official round of talks - the ninth since March - begins on 28 September. Why does the UK need another Brexit deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Seven things that will change on 1 January The CBI carried out a survey of 648 companies which found only 4% said they would prefer no deal to be agreed on trade. And half of firms said the impact of dealing with the coronavirus had negatively affected their preparations for next year, when the transition period ends. ""Next week Brexit talks enter the 11th hour,"" said Dame Carolyn. ""Now must be the time for political leadership and the spirit of compromise to shine through on both sides. A deal can and must be made. ""Businesses face a hat-trick of unprecedented challenges - rebuilding from the first wave of Covid-19, dealing with the resurgence of the virus and preparing for significant changes to the UK's trading relationship with the EU."" This video can not be played Why is it so hard to reach a Brexit deal? She added: ""A good deal will provide the strongest possible foundation as countries build back from the pandemic. ""It would keep UK firms competitive by minimising red tape and extra costs, freeing much-needed time and resource to overcome the difficult times ahead."" According to BBC Europe editor Katya Adler,one EU diplomat said the two sides were ""90% there"" on agreeing technical issues. The diplomat said the ""remaining 10% is political"" and ""if that can't be solved, then the 90% is irrelevant"". Analysis: So near and yet so far What trade deals has the UK done? Any trade agreement will aim to eliminate tariffs and reduce other trade barriers. It will also aim to cover both goods and services. If negotiators fail to reach a deal, the UK faces the prospect of trading with the EU under the basic rules set by the World Trade Organization (WTO). If the UK has to trade under WTO rules, tariffs will be applied to most goods which UK businesses send to the EU. This would make UK goods more expensive and harder to sell in Europe. The UK could also do this to EU goods, if it chooses to. What trade deals has the UK done so far? What happens now that a deal's been done? What is the Brexit transition period?

"Trade negotiations tend not to begin with two sides in agreement - otherwise there would be nothing to negotiate. So it's not surprising to see the UK and EU set out rather different positions before talks begin in earnest. There are some broad similarities. The two sides agree they want a free-trade agreement, with no tariffs (border taxes on goods) or quotas (limits on the amount of goods). They are also keen to include as much of the service sector as possible. But that's the easy bit and this is likely to become a bruising experience for all involved. Terms and conditions always apply - and there are several possible flashpoints. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. First and foremost, the EU wants the UK to sign up to strict rules on fair and open competition, so if British companies are given tariff-free access to the EU market, they cannot undercut their rivals. These are known as level playing field guarantees and they have been a constant theme in the EU's negotiating position for nearly two years. Most importantly, itsnegotiating directives,external, adopted on 25 February 2020, say a future partnership must ""ensure the application"" in the UK of EU state-aid rules on subsidies for business. What is a level playing field? What are the EU rules about state aid? The UK would also be required to stay in line with the EU's rules on environmental policy and workers' rights in a way that would ""stand the test of time"". But the government has now rejected this approach entirely. The political declaration it agreed with the EU last year did speak of level playing field commitments but, armed with a big majority in the House of Commons, it has toughened up its language. In a document outlining the UK's approach to negotiations,externalpublished on 27 February 2020, it said: ""we will not agree to any obligations for our laws to be aligned with the EU's"". Instead, Boris Johnson has said he would create an independent system that would uphold the UK's international obligations and not undermine European standards. ""There is no need for a free-trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar,"" he said. He has also pointed out that there are areas such as maternity rights in which the UK has higher standards than the EU and that the UK spent farless money on state aidthan Germany or France. The EU says without a level playing field, it cannot offer any kind of basic free-trade agreement along the lines of the oneit has negotiated with Canada. The UK's response? A Canada-style deal would be its preference, but if that is not available, it will settle for what Australia has with the EU. In other words, no free-trade deal at all. The government says it will decide in June 2020 ""whether good progress has been possible on the least controversial areas of the negotiations"" (which it defines as things like financial services and data) and if not, it will start to focus on preparing for a new relationship without a formal free-trade deal. Either way, says Mr Johnson, a new relationship will begin on 1 January 2021. His critics accuse him of recklessness, but the prime minister says he has ""no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper"". The EU has said an agreement on fisheries must be concluded before any free-trade deal is finalised. That's because UK fishing waters are among the best in Europe. The UK says it's happy to consider a deal on fisheries but it must be based on the notion ""British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats"". The EU sees things rather differently. Its negotiating directives say a future deal should ""aim to avoid economic dislocation for [European] Union fishermen that have traditionally fished in United Kingdom waters"". The EU wants to ""uphold"" existing access on both sides to fishing waters - language that has strengthened under pressure from EU countries with big fishing fleets. Is fishing the next big Brexit argument? The EU also seems prepared to link access to fishing waters to the UK's ability to sell its fish in the EU market. But the UK also rejects that. Michael Gove told Parliament: ""We will take back control of our waters, as an independent coastal state, and we will not link access to our waters to access to EU markets. Our fishing waters are our sovereign resource."" Fishing is a tiny part of both sides' economies - in the UK it's well below 1% - but it has always been an emotional issue. And coastal communities depend on it on both sides of the Channel. When it comes to product standards and other regulations, the EU is a bit more flexible. ""We're not asking for alignment, I know it's a red rag to the UK, so I won't really mention it,"" the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier said. ""What I am looking for is consistency."" The UK says it must have the right to diverge from EU rules when it chooses to do so, but it won't do that just for the sake of doing things differently. The more it diverges, the more checks there will be and the more barriers to trade will emerge. One late addition to the EU's negotiating document is the demand that the UK should stick close to EU rules on food safety and animal health, which is seen by some as a reference to whether the UK might import chlorine-washed chicken from the US in the future. Similar trade-offs will have to be made in the services sector. UK financial services companies, for example, will lose the passporting rights that gave them unfettered access to the rest of the EU. Instead, the UK is hoping for a system of what's known as enhanced equivalence, which would give companies plenty of notice if the rules were about to change. But talk in government circles of frictionless trade has gone. The UK now accepts that will not be possible outside the EU single market and customs union. The EU's negotiating mandate recalls a statement made back in 2018, in which the other 27 member states agreed Gibraltar would not be included in any post-Brexit agreement between the UK and the EU. It doesn't rule out a separate deal between the UK and the EU that does cover Gibraltar, but that in turn would have to be agreed by the UK and Spain. This is another hot-button issue pretty much guaranteed to generate tabloid headlines. Mr Johnson has said he would be negotiating for what he called the whole UK family, including Gibraltar. Gaining independence from the rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was an important part of the argument for Brexit. Now, the EU is demanding the ECJ be given a legal role in policing any free-trade agreement. It wants the court to be able to issue binding rulings on disputes between the two sides, when they ""raise a question of interpretation of [European] Union law"". But the government's outline says it will not allow ""the EU's institutions, including the Court of Justice, to have any jurisdiction in the UK"". The ECJ does play a limited role in the withdrawal agreement, both in the special arrangements for Northern Ireland and in resolving any disputes over citizens' rights for the next few years. But a future trade deal is a different matter. Devising a dispute-resolution system that satisfies both sides will not be easy. It's not just about trade, it's about internal security co-operation and access to databases too. ""Where a partnership is based on concepts derived from European law,"" Michel Barnier said, ""obviously the ECJ should be able to continue to play its role in full"". The EU's mandate also says there should be ""automatic termination"" of law enforcement and judicial co-operation in criminal matters if the UK were to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights. The bottom line for the UK? The ECJ and the EU's legal order ""must not constrain the autonomy of the UK's legal system in any way"". So there are some big divides to be bridged. Both sides are accusing the other of moving the goalposts and backing away from commitments made in thenon-binding political declaration,external. Many observers expect a serious row and a possible breakdown in the talks sooner rather than later. On the other hand, both the UK and the EU say they would settle for a free-trade agreement. The difficult part will be working out how to get there and how to implement it. It is also worth recalling thegovernment's own internal analysis,externalfrom November 2018 suggested a Canada-style deal would leave the economy 4.9% smaller after 15 years than if the UK had stayed in the EU. There is a long way to go in a short period of time. UPDATE: This piece was originally published on 4 February 2020 and updated when the UK and EU released their negotiating mandates.

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen spoke via video conference on Saturday Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have ""agreed the importance"" of finding a post-Brexit trade deal, Downing Street has said. They agreed progress has been made in talks between the EU and UK but ""significant gaps"" remain, No 10 said. Both have instructed their chief negotiators to ""work intensively"" in order to try to bridge those gaps. Negotiations between the UK and EU broke up on Friday without agreement. Both sides are calling on the other to compromise on key issues, including fishing and government subsidies. Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen spoke during a phone call on Saturday and agreed to speak on a regular basis. A Downing Street spokesperson said the two had agreed on the importance of finding an agreement ""as a strong basis for a strategic EU-UK relationship in future."" The UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost,tweeted,externalthat work to resolve differences between the UK and EU ""begins as soon as we can next week"". What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit deal must be made, says business boss Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? Brexit jargon explained Speaking earlier, while on a visit to Leeds, Mr Johnson said he wants adeal like one struck between the EU and Canada, but reiterated the UK was ready should it have to leave without a deal. ""We're resolved on either course, we're prepared for either course and we'll make it work but it's very much up to our friends and partners,"" Mr Johnson said. It comes after Mrs von der Leyen called for talks to ""intensify"", as both sides set an October deadline to settle their differences. The significance of today's call between Boris Johnson and the head of the EU commission is that both sides have agreed to keep talking. Although formal negotiations ended yesterday without agreement, instead of throwing in the sponge - as Boris Johnson would put it - talks will now intensify. But a Downing Street statement made clear that while there are notable (and well-known) differences over fishing rights and subsidies to businesses, these aren't the only issues that need to be solved. There is the potential to compromise - for example, on phasing in new fishing arrangements and on having state aid provisions similar to other free trade agreements - but it's not clear the political willingness is yet there on both sides. The EU has to satisfy the demands of 27 different states. And Boris Johnson has to convince Brexit-supporting backbenchers that he hasn't sold out. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab aimed to reassure them by stating today that the days of being ""held over a barrel"" by Brussels are long gone. Asked about potential compromises that could be made, Mr Johnson said: ""The balance of trade is overwhelmingly on the side of the EU in the sense that they export much more to us than we do to them, certainly in manufacturing goods, and so we think there is a big opportunity for both sides to do well."" He pointed out that Canada is ""some way away"" but had managed to strike a deal with the EU while the UK remained the bloc's biggest trading partner. But he acknowledged a no-deal outcome where the UK would follow mainly World Trade Organization rules on trade with the EU was possible and would ""work very well"" - describing it as anAustralia-style arrangement. Speaking at the virtual Conservative Party conference, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the talks with the EU had been ""a tough process"" but ""with goodwill we should be able to get a deal"". He added: ""Recognising that we share the same high environmental and workforce standards as they do, but we want to do things in our own way, is a bit difficult for them and also there is the very vexed issue to do with fisheries."" However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the conference the ""days of being held over a barrel by Brussels are long gone"", as he stressed any trade deal must be ""fair"". TheEU wants access to UK fishing grounds for its boatsand says reaching a ""fair deal"" is a pre-condition of a deal, while the UK says they should be ""first and foremost for British boats"". The prime minister has set the deadline of the EU Council meeting on 15 October for securing a deal. After six months of trade talks with the EU, Lord Frost has claimed the outlines of an agreement are visible, but he warned that, without further compromise from the EU, differences over the contentious topic of fishing may be impossible to bridge. He described the final round of negotiations as ""constructive"" but ""familiar differences remain"". On fishing, the gap was ""unfortunately very large"" and he called for the EU to ""move further before an understanding can be reached"" on state aid. His EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, agreed the negotiations had been conducted in a ""constructive and respectful atmosphere"", with some ""positive new developments on some topics"" - such as aviation safety and police co-operation. But he said there was ""a lack of progress on some important topics"", such as climate change commitments, ""as well as persistent serious divergences on matters of major importance for the European Union"", including state aid and fishing. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord David Frost The UK formally left the EU in January, but entered a transition period - where the UK has kept to EU trading rules and remained inside its customs union and single market - to allow the two sides to negotiate a trade deal. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, but there have been concerns over whether a plan would be agreed before that period runs out on 31 December. Issues that have become particular sticking points between negotiators are state aid - where governments give financial support to businesses - and fishing rules. The EU has said a deal must be reached before the end of October to allow it to be signed off by the member states before the end of the year, while Mr Johnson has said both sides should ""move on"" if agreement was not reached by the middle of the month. If a deal is not done, the UK will go on to trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization rules.

"KT Tunstall is supporting a campaign to save grassroots music The UK risks losing its status as a leader of live music, KT Tunstall has warned, with hundreds of venues at risk of closure due to the pandemic. The Brit Award winner has spoken in support of a campaign to save the grassroots music sector, which industry bosses say is at risk of collapse. The Music Venues Trust says the 10pm curfew means venues are operating at an eighth of their previous income. The government is set to make a funding announcement on Monday. The trust launched its Save our Venues campaign in April, after a survey revealed 554 of its 670 member venues were under threat of ""imminent closure"".  It has raised more than Â£3m since April. Tunstall played her first show in the back room of The Vic CafÃ© in St Andrews, Scotland, when she was 16 and spent 10 years on the grassroots circuit before signing her first record deal in the early 2000s. ""If we don't have this eco-system of smaller venues, we don't have big acts any more,"" she said. ""We lose our place on the global stage as a country that has always been at the cutting edge of new music. ""If you are the sort of act that can step straight out into an arena, the chances are you were made by Simon Cowell."" The Shires perform at Sheffield's Leadmill Among the fundraising drives, a guitar raffle by the Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner raised more than Â£120,000 for the Leadmill in Sheffield, where the band played its first gig. Acts such as Elbow and the Pet Shop Boys are also set to play one-off, intimate live shows at smaller venues around the UK. Tickets for the event called Passport: Back To Our Roots, are subject to a prize draw. Music Venues Trust chief executive Mark Davyd said venues which reopen over winter, or which have already, will have to survive on a fraction of their usual takings. ""The government restrictions have reduced capacity in venues down to 25% - then restrictions on hours, we estimate, has removed something like 50% of their income,"" he said. ""The venue now has half of its available trading hours and a quarter of its usual audience. By that marker they are getting 12.5% of their income."" This video can not be played A music venue in Leicester may have to close if it does not receive more funding to help it survive amid social distancing. Despite the fundraising drive, Mr Davyd said the sector was still in a ""critical, red alert"" state. He said more money would be needed to see it through the next six months with the furlough scheme coming to a close and many of the workers in the industry, such as sound technicians and tour managers, ineligible for government support. Bands that have started their performance before 22:00 can finish. But venues, many of which rely on club nights after the performances, cannot sell drinks after then. Of the Â£2.9m raised so far, 62% has been already been spent on clearing rent arrears alone, according to MVT. Venues were given the all-clear to begin trading again from 15 August, but the latest survey by MVT found only 55% had a plan to reopen before Christmas. Some have been able to open outdoor areas for events and others have sought to set up live-streaming equipment to host virtual gigs at a reduced ticket price. KT Tunstall says music venues are a vital ""eco-system"" for performing arts talent in the UK Among them, The Georgian Theatre in Stockton-on-Tees has now spent Â£50,000 on such equipment in the hope of limiting its losses through winter. Chief executive Paul Burns said: ""It's a risk, but it's a calculated risk."" Mr Burns said the venue, which also offers music training schemes in the north east, used to make most of its income through bar takings. It is currently relying on regular applications to grant funds and donations. ""We are just trying to grab a little bit here and a little bit there,"" he said. Happy Mondays performing at the Leadmill in Sheffield Many operators are now pinning their hopes on either local crowdfunding campaigns or the outcome of Arts Council England's (ACE) Culture Recovery Fund - which aims to pump Â£500m into cultural venues across the country. Around 350 venue operators have applied for the latter. Recipients for the funding were expected to be announced on Monday. The Shed in the centre of Leicester, which last served a customer in March, is selling off all of its stock to keep it from going under. The venue has been a springboard for hundreds of acts, including Glastonbury headliners Kasabian, since opening in 1994. The 200-capacity venue used to host five separate club nights a week as well as four nights of live music. Under the current measures, it could only open to 18 people at a time. Opening a music venue in a pandemic Arctic Monkeys raise cash for struggling venues Music venues welcome emergency funding Manager Tom Carnell, 28, said it was relying on the success of its application to ACE for Â£60,000 as well as a crowdfunding appeal to clear its backlog of bills and pay a minimal wage to its three full-time staff. He said: ""If we don't get the [money], The Shed will have to shut permanently ""We have sat and discussed different ways we can adapt to how the world is working at the moment. ""But there is no viable option that will enable us to open the doors right now."" Out of 225 ongoing Save our Venues fundraising campaigns on the Crowdfunder website, only 41 have hit the target so far. Venues are petitioning for between Â£60,000 and Â£500 on the site but they are, on average, Â£8,600 short of their targets. Among the most successful, more than 2,800 people have pledged support for Camden's Jazz Cafe in return for future gig tickets, drinks or meals. But at a Â£31,000-a-month running cost, the Â£148,000 raised would keep it going for less than five months without further support.

"US President Donald Trump is discharged from the Walter Reed medical centre following three days of Covid treatment His doctors say he is safe to return to the White House but ""may not be entirely out of the woods yet"" In a tweet, he said we was feeling ""really good"", and added: ""Don't be afraid of Covid"" Questions remain about the seriousness of the president's illness after conflicting statements In the UK, a technical glitch which meant nearly 16,000 cases went unreported has caused delays to its track and trace system UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will ""always balance the books"" as coronavirus costs rise All bars in the French capital Paris will shut from Tuesday as the city's coronavirus alert is raised to maximum More than 35.1 million cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed globally, with over one million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Henri Astier and Lauren Turner Marine One delivers US President Donald Trump to the White House We're pausing our live coverage for now. We'll be back in a few hours with more updates from the UK and around the world. Before we go, here's a recap of some of the key moments from the day's swift-moving events:  We will continue to update our main story aboutPresident Trump's health and treatment here. And you can findmore of our coronavirus coverage here. Thanks for reading. President Trump raised a fist as left the military hospital, before walking to his vehicle and giving a thumbs-up. He was then driven to the Marine One helicopter to be transported to the White House. US President Donald Trump has left Walter Reed hospital, where he has been treated for Covid-19 over the last three days. He is now on his way back to the White House to continue his treatment there. Biden has called on Trump to ""support masks"" Now some reaction to President Trumpâs condition from Joe Biden, his Democratic challenger in Novemberâs presidential election. Biden has shown restraint since Trumpâs diagnosis, toning down his political rhetoric and suspending adverts attacking the president. But tonight, Biden struck a more combative tone, signalling a change in the dynamic of the election campaign. ""I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend,â Biden said at a rally in Little Havana in Miami on Monday. âNow that he's busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this: Listen to the scientists, support masks.â President Trump has eschewed face masks in the past and mocked Biden for wearing one in the first presidential debate. With Trump getting ready to leave Walter Reed Medical Center tonight, his daughter Ivanka has tweeted her thanks to the hospital's staff. Trump tweeted earlier that he would be discharged from hospital at about 18:30 local time - 23:30 BST. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a tweet announcing his imminent departure from hospital,external, President Trump played down the threat of Covid-19, as he has done throughout the pandemic. âDonât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life,â he wrote after receiving four days of round-the-clock medical care for the virus. However 209,000 Americans have died of the virus so far. Covid-19 treatments are improving and becoming more readily available, but the risk of death remains, especially in the US, where measures to contain the virus have been patchy. Since the beginning of April, there have been hundreds - sometimes thousands - of daily coronavirus deaths in the US,World Health Organization figures show,external. At 64.10 per 100,000 people, the Covid-19 death rate in the US is the 10th-highest in the world,according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University,external. Nancy Pelosi has been a vocal critic of the president's handling of the pandemic We have just heard from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected Democrat. She told MSNBC: ""[Trump] should not be dealing with it politically to make it look like he overcame the virus because he's had such good policies. Because in fact, he has been very destructive and dangerous to the country."" Hours earlier, the president tweeted he would be discharged from hospital, saying: ""Donât be afraid of Covid. Donât let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs & knowledge."" Pelosi also said the White House's testing protocol for Covid-19 ""apparently...doesn't work"". Since President Trumpâs Covid-19 diagnosis, his personal physician Dr Conley has been thrust into the spotlight. Conley has given daily briefings since on the president's condition since Saturday. But what do we know about the White House physician? The 40-year-old has been in the position since March 2018. Like most medical staff at the White House, Conley is a military officer. Conley is from Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2002 before studying at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. He received his degree in 2006. After further courses, Conley served with a Nato medical unit in Afghanistan. He received a Romanian Emblem of Honour for saving a Romanian soldier wounded by a homemade explosive device. The US Navy officer was later assigned to the White House Medical Unit. He then became Trump's acting personal doctor when the president nominated his then-physician, Dr Ronny Jackson, to head the US Department of Veteran Affairs. Read more about Conley here Cohen testified to Congress in 2019 Donald Trump's former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has sharply criticised his ex-boss for visiting supporters during his hospital stay while being treated for coronavirus. ""Heâs potentially infecting these people. And he doesnât care, because again, Donald Trump doesn't care about anyone other than himself,"" Cohen tells BBC World, adding that the Secret Service agents who rode in the heavily fortified car with him are now at higher risk of infection. ""They vow to take a bullet for him, as I once did,"" Cohen says, referring to probably his most famous quote from back when he was still a Trump loyalist. ""I would have taken a bullet for him but not if heâs the one pulling the trigger,"" he added. ""This is absolutely ridiculous and I do not understand what the man was thinking... But Donald Trump is an uncaged animal. ""He thinks he's completely autonomous. Heâs not going to answer to anyone."" The debate will take place in Salt Lake City in Utah on Wednesday On Wednesday night, Republican Vice-President Mike Pence will face Democratic Senator Kamala Harris for the only vice-presidential debate ahead of November's election. This election cycle has seen increased scrutiny on Pence and Harris, as they support the campaign of two presidential candidates in their 70s. With President Trump now receiving treatment for Covid-19, and more members of the White House announcing positive virus tests, thereâs a new emphasis on precautions from event organisers. For one, the vice-presidential candidates will stand more than 3m (9.8ft) apart (podiums at the first Trump-Biden debate last week were 2m apart). They will be separated by plexiglass, CNN reports. Covid testing is already under way for reporters and others planning on attending the debate in Salt Lake City, Utah. Whether everyone will be required to wear a mask this time remains to be seen. Now, we want to know:What questions do you have about the vice-presidential debate?You tell us hereand weâll get to work finding the answers. This video can not be played Trump's health team at Walter Reed say he is ready to leave White House physician Sean Conley said the president's health team was ""cautiously optimistic"" about his recovery. Less than an hour before Monday's briefing by doctors, Trump tweeted that he planned to leave hospital before the end of the day. White House physician Sean Conley said the team was 'cautiously optimistic' about the president's recovery. A little bit more now on what Dr Conley said at the briefing. He said Trump was a ""phenomenal patient"" during his four-day stay at the Walter Reed military hospital. ""He has never once pushed us to do anything that was beyond
safe and reasonable practice,"" he said. When commenting on the president's recent video and tweets, he said: ""He's back!"" But Dr Conley did not answer questions about the findings of scans of the president's lungs, which can be affected by the virus, citing rules and regulations about the sharing of information. He also said there was no evidence of ""live virus still present"" that Trump could transmit to others. Dr Conley said Trump âcontinued to improveâ After four days in hospital, President Trump has been cleared to return to the White House, with his physician deeming it âsafeâ to discharge him. Hereâs a timeline of some of the key moments in Trumpâs illness so far: Friday: Saturday: Sunday: Monday: Read more:Who Trump met and who's tested positive Here's a recap of what the doctors treating the president said at their briefing moments ago: Trump's campaign ran a series of attack ads against his Democratic rival Joe Biden on Monday. This is despite the fact that the Biden team removed attack ads after Trump went into hospital last week. The move puts the Democrats in a difficult position. The Biden campaign press secretary has already said it is ""inappropriate to use the president's illness to score political points"". Read more here. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Donald Trump is going âhomeâ. Of course, in this case, home is a secure government compound with
top-notch medical facilities. Still, the decision that the president can return to
the White House is being hailed by him and his medical team as an important
indication of his improving condition. âHeâs back,â White House physician Sean Conley said during his Monday
afternoon briefing. Conley and his fellow physicians shared positive details about the
presidentâs condition - a lack of fever, good blood-oxygen levels and âno
respiratory complaintsâ. But he once again refused to disclose when the
president last tested negative for the coronavirus â information that would
help determine if Trump exposed anyone else to the virus. And when
pressed for more details on the presidentâs condition, such as evidence of
longer-term damage to the his lungs, Conley cited patient privacy. This patient is the president of the United States, however, and
Americans may demand more details about his long-term health and prognosis,
particularly as they head to the polls in a month to decide whether to give him
another four-year term in office. Trump's coronavirus diagnosis came after a busy week running his administration and campaigning for November's election. This followed a positive test for his close aide,Hope Hicks, who reportedly started feeling symptoms on Wednesday. Since the president's diagnosis, several people close to him have tested positive too, including his press secretary. So far the majority of publicly released results have been negative. However, test accuracy can vary depending on when a sample is taken during the course of the illness. One taken very soon after exposure may not give an accurate result. The White House says it has begun contact tracing. We have had a closer look at some of the people we know Mr Trump has crossed paths with during the last week - starting with an event that is being investigated as a possible ""super-spreader"".   President Trump announced his Supreme Court pick, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, in front of a crowd of about 200 people on the White House lawn on 26 September Read more here. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Since testing positive for coronavirus, US President Donald Trump has been receiving a number of different drugs, as revealed by his doctors. It is unclear when the president contracted the virus, but there are two broad phases of a coronavirus infection - the first where the virus is the problem and the second, deadly phase, when our immune system goes into overdrive and starts causing massive collateral damage to other organs. Treatments fall into two camps - those that directly attack the virus and are more likely to be useful in the first phase and drugs to calm the immune system which are more likely to work in the second. So what drugs are being used and what do they tell us about his condition? Read more about his treatment here. The doctors' briefing has now ended, with the president saying he expects to leave hospital at 18:30 Eastern time (22:30 GMT). Stay with us as we bring you more details about what the doctors said and analysis. Dr Conley has also revealed that the president was given extra oxygen twice after experiencing a drop in oxygen levels. On Sunday, the doctor had confirmed that the president had been given supplemental oxygen on Friday at the White House, hours before he was flown to the hospital. But he did not say whether the president had been given oxygen after his levels dropped again on Saturday. The doctor also said that the president appeared to be a little dehydrated on Friday, when he had a high fever. Â© 2025 BBC.

"President Trump and his wife Melania plan to recover at the White House As news emerged that US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania had tested positive for coronavirus, the story shot to the top of every news agenda worldwide. It's just 32 days until Americans cast their votes in the race for the White House - and this is a seismic development. World leaders were quick to send the Trumps their well-wishes, with India's Twitter-loving Prime Minister Narendra Modi among the first. ""Wishing my friend @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS a quick recovery and good health,"" he wrote.

German media seemed somewhat unsurprised.""Trump usually does not wear a mask in public"", wrote the centre-right Die Welt,external, whilethe centrist Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung pointed out,externalthat the pandemic did not deter him from making numerous major election campaign appearances. Media in France echoed the sentiment that Mr Trump undermined his own health by underestimating the virus.

An anchor on Iranian state television broke the news ""with an unflattering image of the US president surrounded by what appeared to be giant coronaviruses"", the Associated Press reports. Elsewhere, questions have been asked about what the news could actually mean for the US presidential election.The India Today website anticipated that Trump's quarantine would bring his election campaign to a standstill,external, stating: ""The [presidential] debates and the entire Republican campaign now comes under a shadow."" The website quoted predictions by analysts that Trump may hope to get sympathy votes now that he has tested positive himself. But others, like Hindi-language daily the Navbharat Times, predicted that ""Trump's diagnosis and his attitude towards the pandemic will harm him in the election."" An artist in Mumbai, India, paints a mural of the ailing couple Pakistan's Geo News carried an online report,externalreading: ""The future of Trump's re-election campaign is in doldrums due to his illness and inability to address the rallies before the crucial November 3 vote.""

Fact-checking Trump on coronavirus In China, which Mr Trump has repeatedly blamed for the spread of the coronavirus, news of his illness was one of the most searched topics on Weibo, the popular (if heavily censored) social media app. The editor of the state-owned Global Times newspaper, Hu Xijin, tweeted in English: ""President Trump and the First Lady have paid the price for his gamble to play down the Covid-19.""

The Washington Post has dropped its paywall to allow people to read its live updates on the situation. Politico described Mr Trump as ""the world's highest-profile patient of a disease that has killed more than one million people"".

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen spoke via video conference on Saturday Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have ""agreed the importance"" of finding a post-Brexit trade deal, Downing Street has said. They agreed progress has been made in talks between the EU and UK but ""significant gaps"" remain, No 10 said. Both have instructed their chief negotiators to ""work intensively"" in order to try to bridge those gaps. Negotiations between the UK and EU broke up on Friday without agreement. Both sides are calling on the other to compromise on key issues, including fishing and government subsidies. Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen spoke during a phone call on Saturday and agreed to speak on a regular basis. A Downing Street spokesperson said the two had agreed on the importance of finding an agreement ""as a strong basis for a strategic EU-UK relationship in future."" The UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost,tweeted,externalthat work to resolve differences between the UK and EU ""begins as soon as we can next week"". What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit deal must be made, says business boss Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? Brexit jargon explained Speaking earlier, while on a visit to Leeds, Mr Johnson said he wants adeal like one struck between the EU and Canada, but reiterated the UK was ready should it have to leave without a deal. ""We're resolved on either course, we're prepared for either course and we'll make it work but it's very much up to our friends and partners,"" Mr Johnson said. It comes after Mrs von der Leyen called for talks to ""intensify"", as both sides set an October deadline to settle their differences. The significance of today's call between Boris Johnson and the head of the EU commission is that both sides have agreed to keep talking. Although formal negotiations ended yesterday without agreement, instead of throwing in the sponge - as Boris Johnson would put it - talks will now intensify. But a Downing Street statement made clear that while there are notable (and well-known) differences over fishing rights and subsidies to businesses, these aren't the only issues that need to be solved. There is the potential to compromise - for example, on phasing in new fishing arrangements and on having state aid provisions similar to other free trade agreements - but it's not clear the political willingness is yet there on both sides. The EU has to satisfy the demands of 27 different states. And Boris Johnson has to convince Brexit-supporting backbenchers that he hasn't sold out. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab aimed to reassure them by stating today that the days of being ""held over a barrel"" by Brussels are long gone. Asked about potential compromises that could be made, Mr Johnson said: ""The balance of trade is overwhelmingly on the side of the EU in the sense that they export much more to us than we do to them, certainly in manufacturing goods, and so we think there is a big opportunity for both sides to do well."" He pointed out that Canada is ""some way away"" but had managed to strike a deal with the EU while the UK remained the bloc's biggest trading partner. But he acknowledged a no-deal outcome where the UK would follow mainly World Trade Organization rules on trade with the EU was possible and would ""work very well"" - describing it as anAustralia-style arrangement. Speaking at the virtual Conservative Party conference, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the talks with the EU had been ""a tough process"" but ""with goodwill we should be able to get a deal"". He added: ""Recognising that we share the same high environmental and workforce standards as they do, but we want to do things in our own way, is a bit difficult for them and also there is the very vexed issue to do with fisheries."" However, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the conference the ""days of being held over a barrel by Brussels are long gone"", as he stressed any trade deal must be ""fair"". TheEU wants access to UK fishing grounds for its boatsand says reaching a ""fair deal"" is a pre-condition of a deal, while the UK says they should be ""first and foremost for British boats"". The prime minister has set the deadline of the EU Council meeting on 15 October for securing a deal. After six months of trade talks with the EU, Lord Frost has claimed the outlines of an agreement are visible, but he warned that, without further compromise from the EU, differences over the contentious topic of fishing may be impossible to bridge. He described the final round of negotiations as ""constructive"" but ""familiar differences remain"". On fishing, the gap was ""unfortunately very large"" and he called for the EU to ""move further before an understanding can be reached"" on state aid. His EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, agreed the negotiations had been conducted in a ""constructive and respectful atmosphere"", with some ""positive new developments on some topics"" - such as aviation safety and police co-operation. But he said there was ""a lack of progress on some important topics"", such as climate change commitments, ""as well as persistent serious divergences on matters of major importance for the European Union"", including state aid and fishing. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord David Frost The UK formally left the EU in January, but entered a transition period - where the UK has kept to EU trading rules and remained inside its customs union and single market - to allow the two sides to negotiate a trade deal. Formal talks began in March and continued throughout the pandemic, but there have been concerns over whether a plan would be agreed before that period runs out on 31 December. Issues that have become particular sticking points between negotiators are state aid - where governments give financial support to businesses - and fishing rules. The EU has said a deal must be reached before the end of October to allow it to be signed off by the member states before the end of the year, while Mr Johnson has said both sides should ""move on"" if agreement was not reached by the middle of the month. If a deal is not done, the UK will go on to trade with the bloc on World Trade Organization rules.

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen spoke via video conference on Saturday Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have ""agreed the importance"" of finding a post-Brexit trade deal, Downing Street has said. They agreed progress has been made in talks between the EU and UK but ""significant gaps"" remain, No 10 said. Both have instructed their chief negotiators to ""work intensively"" in order to try to bridge those gaps. Negotiations between the UK and EU broke up on Friday without agreement. Both sides are calling on the other to compromise on key issues, including fishing and government subsidies. Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen spoke during a phone call on Saturday and agreed to speak on a regular basis. A Downing Street spokesperson said the two had agreed on the importance of finding an agreement ""as a strong basis for a strategic EU-UK relationship in future."" The UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost,tweeted,externalthat work to resolve differences between the UK and EU ""begins as soon as we can next week"".

Brexit jargon explained Speaking earlier, while on a visit to Leeds, Mr Johnson said he wants adeal like one struck between the EU and Canada, but reiterated the UK was ready should it have to leave without a deal. ""We're resolved on either course, we're prepared for either course and we'll make it work but it's very much up to our friends and partners,"" Mr Johnson said.

"KT Tunstall is supporting a campaign to save grassroots music The UK risks losing its status as a leader of live music, KT Tunstall has warned, with hundreds of venues at risk of closure due to the pandemic. The Brit Award winner has spoken in support of a campaign to save the grassroots music sector, which industry bosses say is at risk of collapse. The Music Venues Trust says the 10pm curfew means venues are operating at an eighth of their previous income. The government is set to make a funding announcement on Monday. The trust launched its Save our Venues campaign in April, after a survey revealed 554 of its 670 member venues were under threat of ""imminent closure"".  It has raised more than Â£3m since April. Tunstall played her first show in the back room of The Vic CafÃ© in St Andrews, Scotland, when she was 16 and spent 10 years on the grassroots circuit before signing her first record deal in the early 2000s. ""If we don't have this eco-system of smaller venues, we don't have big acts any more,"" she said. ""We lose our place on the global stage as a country that has always been at the cutting edge of new music. ""If you are the sort of act that can step straight out into an arena, the chances are you were made by Simon Cowell."" The Shires perform at Sheffield's Leadmill Among the fundraising drives, a guitar raffle by the Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner raised more than Â£120,000 for the Leadmill in Sheffield, where the band played its first gig. Acts such as Elbow and the Pet Shop Boys are also set to play one-off, intimate live shows at smaller venues around the UK. Tickets for the event called Passport: Back To Our Roots, are subject to a prize draw. Music Venues Trust chief executive Mark Davyd said venues which reopen over winter, or which have already, will have to survive on a fraction of their usual takings. ""The government restrictions have reduced capacity in venues down to 25% - then restrictions on hours, we estimate, has removed something like 50% of their income,"" he said. ""The venue now has half of its available trading hours and a quarter of its usual audience. By that marker they are getting 12.5% of their income."" This video can not be played A music venue in Leicester may have to close if it does not receive more funding to help it survive amid social distancing. Despite the fundraising drive, Mr Davyd said the sector was still in a ""critical, red alert"" state. He said more money would be needed to see it through the next six months with the furlough scheme coming to a close and many of the workers in the industry, such as sound technicians and tour managers, ineligible for government support. Bands that have started their performance before 22:00 can finish. But venues, many of which rely on club nights after the performances, cannot sell drinks after then. Of the Â£2.9m raised so far, 62% has been already been spent on clearing rent arrears alone, according to MVT. Venues were given the all-clear to begin trading again from 15 August, but the latest survey by MVT found only 55% had a plan to reopen before Christmas. Some have been able to open outdoor areas for events and others have sought to set up live-streaming equipment to host virtual gigs at a reduced ticket price. KT Tunstall says music venues are a vital ""eco-system"" for performing arts talent in the UK Among them, The Georgian Theatre in Stockton-on-Tees has now spent Â£50,000 on such equipment in the hope of limiting its losses through winter. Chief executive Paul Burns said: ""It's a risk, but it's a calculated risk."" Mr Burns said the venue, which also offers music training schemes in the north east, used to make most of its income through bar takings. It is currently relying on regular applications to grant funds and donations. ""We are just trying to grab a little bit here and a little bit there,"" he said. Happy Mondays performing at the Leadmill in Sheffield Many operators are now pinning their hopes on either local crowdfunding campaigns or the outcome of Arts Council England's (ACE) Culture Recovery Fund - which aims to pump Â£500m into cultural venues across the country. Around 350 venue operators have applied for the latter. Recipients for the funding were expected to be announced on Monday. The Shed in the centre of Leicester, which last served a customer in March, is selling off all of its stock to keep it from going under. The venue has been a springboard for hundreds of acts, including Glastonbury headliners Kasabian, since opening in 1994. The 200-capacity venue used to host five separate club nights a week as well as four nights of live music. Under the current measures, it could only open to 18 people at a time. Opening a music venue in a pandemic Arctic Monkeys raise cash for struggling venues Music venues welcome emergency funding Manager Tom Carnell, 28, said it was relying on the success of its application to ACE for Â£60,000 as well as a crowdfunding appeal to clear its backlog of bills and pay a minimal wage to its three full-time staff. He said: ""If we don't get the [money], The Shed will have to shut permanently ""We have sat and discussed different ways we can adapt to how the world is working at the moment. ""But there is no viable option that will enable us to open the doors right now."" Out of 225 ongoing Save our Venues fundraising campaigns on the Crowdfunder website, only 41 have hit the target so far. Venues are petitioning for between Â£60,000 and Â£500 on the site but they are, on average, Â£8,600 short of their targets. Among the most successful, more than 2,800 people have pledged support for Camden's Jazz Cafe in return for future gig tickets, drinks or meals. But at a Â£31,000-a-month running cost, the Â£148,000 raised would keep it going for less than five months without further support.

"Boris Johnson is being urged to show he has got his ""mojo"" back, as the Conservatives' virtual conference gets under way. In January, the prime minister predicted that 2020 would be a ""fantastic year for Britain"". As forecasts go it was not the finest. Of course, no one could have predicted a global pandemic, and the impact it has had on the country's economy and way of life. And it is not hard to understand why his enthusiasm was uncurbed 10 months ago. After the chaos of a hung parliament, he'd delivered an 80-seat majority - the best general election result for the Conservatives for more than 30 years - and he was about to ""get Brexit done"". Some of his own colleagues believe he is a fairweather prime minister, and he's all at sea in turbulent political climes. But even during the coronavirus lockdown - and just before he was taken in to hospital - on 3 April, polling company YouGov gave the Conservatives a 52-28 lead over Labour. The main opposition party changed its own leader the day after. But even by mid-May, the governing party was leading by 48% to 33% in a YouGov survey. Johnson: Post-Brexit trade deal 'up to EU' Everybody got 'complacent' over virus, says PM Conservative MPs launch 'levelling up' taskforce Brady's 'win' shows Tory woe over Covid powers Going in to the virtual party conference season, the few clouds that were on the horizon in the spring now represent a gathering storm in the autumn. With Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer spending some months accusing the government of lacking competence, a mid-September YouGov poll suggested Labour and the Conservatives were neck-and-neck, on 40% apiece. Covid infections have risen significantly since the summer. The prime minister himselfseemed confused over some of the rulesthat he had introduced. There were rebellious noises from a swathe of his own backbenchers over a lack of scrutiny. There is nervousness on the Conservative benches over just how many jobs the new Job Retention Scheme will actually retain. And once private mutterings about the state of the prime minister's health have found their way in to the newspapers. Dominic Cummings remains the PM's closest adviser In The Spectator (the magazine Boris Johnson once edited), columnist Toby Youngconcluded last month,externalthat the prime minister's critics had been right about ""his inability to focus on anything for very long"". Yet only in April, the same Toby Young haddefended the PM,externalas a ""remarkable individual"" who ""cannot resist the pull of obligation to his country, the need to be of service"". And last month, Lord O'Donnell - formerly the UK's most senior civil servant - argued that the PM had ""expended' much of his political capital by defending the lockdown trip to Durham by his aide Dominic Cummings. Privately, some very senior Conservative MPs agree. One of them said to me: ""He is finding it hard to live with Dom, but he can't live without him. He is too dependent."" So can Boris Johnson use this week's Conservative conference to prevent simmering discontent - whether from voters or his own politicians -  from boiling over? The mood in the Parliamentary party is, at the very least, restless. Well-connected senior backbenchers have described the mood to me variously as ""apprehensive"", ""worrying"", ""bitter"" and ""concerning"". It isn't, as yet though, mutinous. Coronavirus has changed the face of the country There are deep concerns over the effect some of the lockdown measures are having on the economy. And some say - whatever the wider polling - that many grassroots members who were initially supportive of lockdown, want an assurance that the government will ""pull back from the precipice of doing it again"". One senior MP, who has been in direct touch with the prime minister, wants an explicit commitment in the coming week to rule out a new, national lockdown. But the concern goes deeper than what the government's measures are - there is also disquiet and discontent over how they have been introduced. The public complaints from some Conservative MPs over a lack of consultation and scrutiny is the tip of jagged iceberg. Beneath the surface, a frustration with how Mr Johnson's administration operates extends beyond the righteous anger of the sacked and the never-promoted. There has been a feeling that MPs have been treated as irrelevant at best and idiots - not even useful ones - at worst. ""There has been an attitude that they can just push anything through with a big majority and that attitude needs to be corrected,"" said one long-standing MP. A former minister complained that the PM's advisers ""are draining the life out of him, they are suffocating him"". Another said: ""There is a need for No 10 to build bridges"". So far this call for bridge-building, rather than bridge-burning, suggests that most Conservative MPs would like Mr Johnson to perform better, and perhaps behave better, rather than see him replaced. Indeed, some efforts at bridge building - such as a recent address to the backbench 1922 committee - between the prime minister and and his MPs has met with the approval of some in the Parliamentary party. But such is the mood at Westminster that one former adviser in the Boris Johnson administration believes that the main target audience of the prime minister's conference speech should be his own MPs. So what can he do to improve their morale and provide the wider public with a sense of his political mission? One of the most prominent Tory backbenchers feels Boris Johnson has already missed a trick. Instead of settling for a virtual conference, he believes that a physical, but socially-distanced event, would have provided a better sounding board for the prime minister. But rather like Toby Young, some former admirers of the prime minister are more critical now - they seek the return of the Old Boris, with a gleam in his eye. ""He must above all give a message of hope"", said one. Boris Johnson rarely gets to deliver good news these days Rather colourfully, a senior backbencher said he ""must banish the prophets of doom"", meaning the PM's scientific and medical advisers, and give a sense of where Britain would be when the virus is finally in retreat. Some say he needs to do more - mixing the Churchillian ""we'll get through it stuff"" with ""an apologetic, regretful tone on the need for draconian measures  - that that is not really him, or who we are"". One former minister said: ""We need him to make a case for modern Conservatism. What is the party for? Too many people just associate us with Brexit, the coronavirus and austerity."" There is a remarkable consensus on two points: That the speech shouldn't be a vehicle for policy-heavy announcements (though some would like to see a limited number designed to symbolise a direction of travel) That there must be a relentless focus on voters in the ""red wall"" seats that turned blue in December I say ""remarkable"" because some MPs representing seats that are deep blue are happy with a message directed at those in non-traditional seats. As one of them put it: ""The only reason we were elected to government was because of the swathe of red wall seats that came our way"". And a recent government adviser put it like this: ""These people made it clear on the doorsteps that they were only lending us their vote."" So what message will resonate with these vote-lenders? There is a feeling that a more voter-friendly phrase than ""levelling up"" - which dominates the conference fringe guide -  needs to be coined. It means spreading wealth and opportunity out of London and the South East of England - but there are complaints that it is too vague a concept for some of the party's more recent supporters. But insiders also argue against a return to the very clear ""Get Brexit done"" election mantra. ""Whether or not we get an agreement, people are just fed up hearing about it,"" one insider suggested. An MP who strongly campaigned both for Brexit and for Boris Johnson to lead the Conservatives told me: ""We now need a road map for the next few years, a sense of mission, as we move on - hopefully - from the Brexit era"". There is both hope and expectation that the PM will have more to say on the NHS, that symbolic infrastructure projects should be highlighted. And thatlast week's skills announcement, along with the language of ""radical change"" that accompanied it, will be built upon. ""We need flesh on the bones of the levelling up agenda. It has to be about more than a couple of shiny new train stations,"" said one member of the new intake, who defeated a Labour MP. It's also an unwritten rule of conference speeches that that party leaders take aim at their opponents. And there is an expectation , with next year's Holyrood elections looming, that the prime minister will have the SNP and not just Labour in his sights. It is likely to be intentional that the session which precedes the prime minister's speech on Tuesday is about defending the Union. Some Tory MPs are worried about draconian new laws Almost as important as the tone and content for some MPs will be body language. Last week, even though Covid has a long tail, Boris Johnson claimed he was ""fit as a butcher's dog"". Yet those who are claiming that the post-Covid prime minister resembles more of an emaciated stray seem to be getting a willing hearing in what are usually supportive newspapers. Some of those the prime minister has met in recent weeks say he is back to his usual self and don't recognise the downbeat portrait being painted of him. The prime minister himself told the BBC the idea that he wasn't his old self was ""sinister disinformation"". His conference speech will give him an opportunity to exude the impression that he is up to, and up for, the job. What has got some Conservative MPs scratching their heads is why the usually outwardly ebullient prime minister has so often been the main bearer of bad news during the Covid crisis. Sure, there is the talk of ""moonshots"" and ""building back better"" - distant sunlit uplands - but on a day-to-day basis he has had to front up what one MP described as ""police state"" restrictions, while leaving the ""good cop"" announcements to his Chancellor. A strategist who has worked with and for various ministers wondered why the prime minister hadn't ""nicked"" the best announcements for himself. He described Chancellor Rishi Sunak's ""hugely popular"" Eat Out to Help Out scheme as the ""promote Rishi"" campaign. He now felt Boris Johnson should reclaim some of the economic agenda, ""making it clear some businesses that otherwise would have gone under only exist because of this prime minister"". One former minister felt the shine could soon come off the chancellor, saying: ""What happens when Father Christmas turns in to Scrooge?"" Significantly, Labour , too, are focussing, laser-like, some of their political attacks on the Chancellor not the prime minister. One Tory MP with a background in government felt there was plenty of ""unexploded ordnance"". In due course, what - and how much - to tax will potentially put the chancellor in the firing line. But for now, Mr Sunak - who will make his conference speech on Monday - hands things out to voters, rather than takes them away. There are deep mutterings about whether some in government would like to see Rishi Sunak's profile grow to the proportions of a credible replacement for - but not challenger to - his next door neighbour should the need arise. One MP described it as ""an insurance policy"". Another MP cautions that ""we are not there yet"" but waxes lyrical about the chancellor's ability to devise and implement bold policies- and, crucially, to wrap them in a coherent Conservative narrative. He contrasts Mr Sunak favourably with many of his cabinet colleagues: ""They are not so much the tall poppies, but the weeds."" But a strong supporter of Boris Johnson said: 'I'm not so interested in the machinations between 10 and 11. ""The acolytes on both sides know it was Boris that won it. Rishi is Robin to Boris's batman."" There are perhaps far more challenges ahead for the prime minister than he envisaged when he declared that this would be a fantastic year  - but dissent hasn't led to any attempted dethronement. As one MP put it: ""He won us the election and, on his game, he can win us the next one."" One adviser put it slightly differently: ""The only question the conference has to answer is this: does Bojo have his mojo back?""

"Trade negotiations tend not to begin with two sides in agreement - otherwise there would be nothing to negotiate. So it's not surprising to see the UK and EU set out rather different positions before talks begin in earnest. There are some broad similarities. The two sides agree they want a free-trade agreement, with no tariffs (border taxes on goods) or quotas (limits on the amount of goods). They are also keen to include as much of the service sector as possible. But that's the easy bit and this is likely to become a bruising experience for all involved. Terms and conditions always apply - and there are several possible flashpoints. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. First and foremost, the EU wants the UK to sign up to strict rules on fair and open competition, so if British companies are given tariff-free access to the EU market, they cannot undercut their rivals. These are known as level playing field guarantees and they have been a constant theme in the EU's negotiating position for nearly two years. Most importantly, itsnegotiating directives,external, adopted on 25 February 2020, say a future partnership must ""ensure the application"" in the UK of EU state-aid rules on subsidies for business. What is a level playing field? What are the EU rules about state aid? The UK would also be required to stay in line with the EU's rules on environmental policy and workers' rights in a way that would ""stand the test of time"". But the government has now rejected this approach entirely. The political declaration it agreed with the EU last year did speak of level playing field commitments but, armed with a big majority in the House of Commons, it has toughened up its language. In a document outlining the UK's approach to negotiations,externalpublished on 27 February 2020, it said: ""we will not agree to any obligations for our laws to be aligned with the EU's"". Instead, Boris Johnson has said he would create an independent system that would uphold the UK's international obligations and not undermine European standards. ""There is no need for a free-trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar,"" he said. He has also pointed out that there are areas such as maternity rights in which the UK has higher standards than the EU and that the UK spent farless money on state aidthan Germany or France. The EU says without a level playing field, it cannot offer any kind of basic free-trade agreement along the lines of the oneit has negotiated with Canada. The UK's response? A Canada-style deal would be its preference, but if that is not available, it will settle for what Australia has with the EU. In other words, no free-trade deal at all. The government says it will decide in June 2020 ""whether good progress has been possible on the least controversial areas of the negotiations"" (which it defines as things like financial services and data) and if not, it will start to focus on preparing for a new relationship without a formal free-trade deal. Either way, says Mr Johnson, a new relationship will begin on 1 January 2021. His critics accuse him of recklessness, but the prime minister says he has ""no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper"". The EU has said an agreement on fisheries must be concluded before any free-trade deal is finalised. That's because UK fishing waters are among the best in Europe. The UK says it's happy to consider a deal on fisheries but it must be based on the notion ""British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats"". The EU sees things rather differently. Its negotiating directives say a future deal should ""aim to avoid economic dislocation for [European] Union fishermen that have traditionally fished in United Kingdom waters"". The EU wants to ""uphold"" existing access on both sides to fishing waters - language that has strengthened under pressure from EU countries with big fishing fleets. Is fishing the next big Brexit argument? The EU also seems prepared to link access to fishing waters to the UK's ability to sell its fish in the EU market. But the UK also rejects that. Michael Gove told Parliament: ""We will take back control of our waters, as an independent coastal state, and we will not link access to our waters to access to EU markets. Our fishing waters are our sovereign resource."" Fishing is a tiny part of both sides' economies - in the UK it's well below 1% - but it has always been an emotional issue. And coastal communities depend on it on both sides of the Channel. When it comes to product standards and other regulations, the EU is a bit more flexible. ""We're not asking for alignment, I know it's a red rag to the UK, so I won't really mention it,"" the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier said. ""What I am looking for is consistency."" The UK says it must have the right to diverge from EU rules when it chooses to do so, but it won't do that just for the sake of doing things differently. The more it diverges, the more checks there will be and the more barriers to trade will emerge. One late addition to the EU's negotiating document is the demand that the UK should stick close to EU rules on food safety and animal health, which is seen by some as a reference to whether the UK might import chlorine-washed chicken from the US in the future. Similar trade-offs will have to be made in the services sector. UK financial services companies, for example, will lose the passporting rights that gave them unfettered access to the rest of the EU. Instead, the UK is hoping for a system of what's known as enhanced equivalence, which would give companies plenty of notice if the rules were about to change. But talk in government circles of frictionless trade has gone. The UK now accepts that will not be possible outside the EU single market and customs union. The EU's negotiating mandate recalls a statement made back in 2018, in which the other 27 member states agreed Gibraltar would not be included in any post-Brexit agreement between the UK and the EU. It doesn't rule out a separate deal between the UK and the EU that does cover Gibraltar, but that in turn would have to be agreed by the UK and Spain. This is another hot-button issue pretty much guaranteed to generate tabloid headlines. Mr Johnson has said he would be negotiating for what he called the whole UK family, including Gibraltar. Gaining independence from the rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was an important part of the argument for Brexit. Now, the EU is demanding the ECJ be given a legal role in policing any free-trade agreement. It wants the court to be able to issue binding rulings on disputes between the two sides, when they ""raise a question of interpretation of [European] Union law"". But the government's outline says it will not allow ""the EU's institutions, including the Court of Justice, to have any jurisdiction in the UK"". The ECJ does play a limited role in the withdrawal agreement, both in the special arrangements for Northern Ireland and in resolving any disputes over citizens' rights for the next few years. But a future trade deal is a different matter. Devising a dispute-resolution system that satisfies both sides will not be easy. It's not just about trade, it's about internal security co-operation and access to databases too. ""Where a partnership is based on concepts derived from European law,"" Michel Barnier said, ""obviously the ECJ should be able to continue to play its role in full"". The EU's mandate also says there should be ""automatic termination"" of law enforcement and judicial co-operation in criminal matters if the UK were to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights. The bottom line for the UK? The ECJ and the EU's legal order ""must not constrain the autonomy of the UK's legal system in any way"". So there are some big divides to be bridged. Both sides are accusing the other of moving the goalposts and backing away from commitments made in thenon-binding political declaration,external. Many observers expect a serious row and a possible breakdown in the talks sooner rather than later. On the other hand, both the UK and the EU say they would settle for a free-trade agreement. The difficult part will be working out how to get there and how to implement it. It is also worth recalling thegovernment's own internal analysis,externalfrom November 2018 suggested a Canada-style deal would leave the economy 4.9% smaller after 15 years than if the UK had stayed in the EU. There is a long way to go in a short period of time. UPDATE: This piece was originally published on 4 February 2020 and updated when the UK and EU released their negotiating mandates.
