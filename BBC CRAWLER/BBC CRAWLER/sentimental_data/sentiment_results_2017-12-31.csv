"This video can not be played Video from the town of Dorud shows a crowd carrying what appears to be a wounded man Iran has moved to restrict social media networks that have been used to organise four days of anti-establishment protests. The ""temporary"" restrictions on the apps Telegram and Instagram were imposed to ""maintain tranquillity"", state news agency Irib reports. The protests have been the biggest show of dissent since huge rallies in 2009. President Hassan Rouhani has said Iranians have the right to protest, but not cause disorder. The protests began in the north-east as an outcry against economic hardship and rising prices, but turned political in many places, with slogans chanted against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Mr Rouhani and Iran's interventionist foreign policy in the region. In his first public comments since the demonstrations broke out, the Iranian president, speaking at a cabinet meeting, said that citizens were ""completely free to make criticism and even protests"". But he added that the government would not tolerate any action that created ""social disorder"", the Iranian Students News Agency reported. After violence flared in many places on Saturday, it is unclear how many demonstrations are occurring on Sunday. Small crowds have gathered in Tehran and police have used water cannon to disperse protesters at a major intersection - as captured in a video obtained by BBC Persian. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Durov explained in a Telegram post,externalthat a major foreign-based opposition channel, Amadnews, was blocked on Saturday by Telegram after it called for violence against police.

Iranian Communications Minister Mohammad-Javad Azari Jahromi had earlier accused channels like Amadnews of promoting ""armed uprising and social unrest"", including the use of petrol bombs. Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian There is widespread and seething discontent in Iran where repression is pervasive and economic hardship is getting worse - one BBC Persian investigation has found that on average Iranians have become 15% poorer in the past 10 years. Protests have remained confined to relatively small pockets of mostly young male demonstrators who are demanding the overthrow of the clerical regime. They have spread to small towns throughout the country and have the potential to grow in size. But there is no obvious leadership. Opposition figures have long been silenced or sent into exile. Even in exile, there is no one opposition figure that commands a large following. Some protesters have been calling for the return of the monarchy and the former shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, has issued a statement supporting the demonstrations. But there are signs that he is as much in the dark about where these protests are going as anyone else. BBC Persian, which broadcasts on TV, on radio and online from London, is banned in Iran - where staff and their families routinely face harassment and questioning from the authorities. There were outbreaks of clashes in several cities on Saturday and two protesters died of gunshot wounds in the western city of Dorud. The authorities said security forces did not open fire on demonstrators, and blamed the deaths instead on Sunni Muslim extremists and foreign powers. US warns Iran: The world is watching Iran's Revolutionary Guards take lead on foreign affairs Who are the Basij militia?,external Correspondents say the reference to foreign intelligence agencies was intended to mean Saudi Arabia. Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned anti-government protesters they will face the nation's ""iron fist"" if political unrest continues. Scores of people are reported to have been arrested in recent days, including 200 in Tehran on Saturday night. Students were involved in a number of clashes The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) is a powerful force with ties to the country's supreme leader, and is dedicated to preserving the country's Islamic system. Brig-Gen Esmail Kowsari told the Isna news agency: ""If people came into the streets over high prices, they should not have chanted those slogans and burned public property and cars."" Iran's interior minister has also warned the public that protesters will be held accountable. The Iranian authorities are blaming anti-revolutionaries and agents of foreign powers for the outbreak of protests. But politicians have also weighed in. Reformists tend to stress people's right to freedom of expression, while conservatives highlight economic problems and accuse some of attempting to hijack the protests and divert attention from economic problems to political demands. Who is Hassan Rouhani? The US has led international support for the protesters. In his latest tweet on the issue,external, President Donald Trump said that Iranians were ""finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism"". Iran's foreign ministry called earlier comments from Mr Trump and other US officials ""opportunistic and deceitful"". On Saturday, thousands of pro-government demonstrators turned out for pre-arranged rallies across the country to mark the eighth anniversary of the suppression of the 2009 street protests. Those mass demonstrations - referred to as the Green Movement - were held by millions of opposition supporters against the disputed election victory of incumbent president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. At least 30 people were killed and thousands arrested in the wave of protests, which drew the largest crowds on Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Clashes erupt in western Iran town.

"This video can not be played Police divers attended the scene of the crash Six people have died after a seaplane plunged into a river in Australia some 30 miles (50km) north of Sydney. Five of those killed were British nationals - one of them was an 11-year-old girl. They died alongside the pilot, who was Australian. The crash happened on the Hawkesbury River near the suburb of Cowan. The single-engine aircraft belonged to sightseeing flight company Sydney Seaplanes. Investigators do not yet know why it crashed. Acting Superintendent Michael Gorman from New South Wales police said the ""recovery operation continues"" at the site. The wreckage is lying in 13m (43ft) of water. The Foreign Office in London said: ""Officials from the British consulate are in contact with local authorities in relation to a seaplane accident near Sydney. Staff are ready to provide consular assistance."" An eyewitness, Myles Baptiste, told the broadcaster 9News that the plane was 500m (1,640ft) from him when it hit the water. ""It made a tight right-hand turn and as it actually turned around, the wings dipped and it nosedived straight into the water,"" he said. A woman at the scene told local TV the weather had been ""a bit bumpy"" but ""nothing to be concerned about"". Some debris was recovered from the water on Sunday. Officers recovered some debris from the seaplane Sydney Seaplanes offers scenic flights over local tourist attractions and waterways including the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge and Pittwater, as well as the Hawkesbury River region. The firm said it was suspending all operations until further notice and was helping police with the investigation into the cause of the crash.

"The UK's aid budget will be shifted to projects that promote its interests, the foreign secretary has said. Boris Johnson said the money will be ""more sensibly distributed"" to support foreign policy aims such as denying safe havens to Islamist militants. His comments came as Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, said the UK will provide a Â£21m boost to an emergency aid fund. The UK currently spends Â£13bn on aid each year. Speaking to the Times newspaper, Mr Johnson said ""the old jam jars are being smashed"" and money would be diverted to support government aims, including combating terrorist groups in Africa. It would also go to help refugees in Yemen and Rohingya Muslims fleeing across the Burmese border into Bangladesh, he added. Reality Check: How much does the UK spend on overseas aid? Where does UK aid go and why? The government is committed to spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid but some politicians oppose such spending. Conservative backbench MP Peter Bone has said the target ""means that important things at home like social care are struggling,"" while Ukip have called for the aid budget to be cut by 80% and focus only on emergency responses and eradicating disease. Labour backs the 0.7% target, saying global poverty reduction is itself in the UK's interest. In January,the government scrapped plans to fund an Ethiopian girl bandas part of a project to promote women's rights. It said there were ""more effective ways"" to invest UK aid. By Emma Vardy, BBC political correspondent For years there have been calls from some MPs for Britain's foreign aid budget to be cut, and the subject provides a steady stream of headlines in the right-leaning press. Priti Patel said too much of Britain's aid money was wasted, or spent poorly, when she was international development minister. The government recently suspended a Â£12m aid programme to Syria after a BBC investigation revealed the cash was at risk of going to jihadist groups. And before the 2017 General Election there were suggestions that Theresa May was planning to revise the 0.7% spending target, but eventually it remained unchanged. Mrs May says she is ""proud"" of the UK's record on foreign aid while Labour, the Lib Dems and SNP are also committed to keeping the 0.7% target. Mr Johnson's promise to spend foreign aid more wisely may improve confidence, but for the harshest critics it will not go anywhere near far enough. Many will continue to argue that in a time of economic difficulties for the UK, money spent abroad could be used to help tackle health and social care funding problems at home. Mr Johnson said the UK would gain more control of its aid spending after Brexit. About Â£1bn of the money the UK pays to the EU budget counts as part of the foreign aid budget. The EU spends that money on humanitarian aid and on emergency responses to world crises, as well as on projects in countries close to the EU and those hoping to join in the future. Ms Mordaunt said that the extra Â£21m for the United Nations' Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was needed because 2018 could be ""even bleaker"" than this year, with its ""harrowing"" humanitarian crises. The money will hep to provide millions of people with food, clean water, sanitation and vital health services.

"The banning of oil supplies was in response to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's weapons tests South Korean authorities have seized a second ship suspected of supplying oil to North Korea in violation of international sanctions, officials say. The Panama-flagged tanker, which is named Koti, is being held at a port near the western city of Pyeongtaek. South Korea has already impounded a Hong Kong-registered ship it suspects of secretly transferring 600 tonnes of refined oil to a North Korean vessel. The UN imposed sanctions on the North in response to its weapons programme. The latest vessel seized, which has a mostly Chinese and Burmese crew, is a 5,100-tonne oil carrier, South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. North Korea crisis in 300 words How North Korea does business under sanctions Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? South Korea revealed on Friday that it was holding the Hong Kong-registered Lighthouse Winmore. That ship entered Yeosu port in South Korea on 11 October,externalto load up with refined oil and left for Taiwan four days later. But instead of going to Taiwan it transferred the oil to a North Korean ship and three other vessels in international waters on 19 October, South Korean officials were quoted as saying. The Lighthouse Winmore was seized when it returned to Yeosu in November and remains in South Korea. The Lighthouse Winmore filled up with oil to take to Taiwan but never arrived, it is alleged Last week, US PresidentDonald Trump blamed China for allowing illegal oil shipments to reach North Korea. In a tweet, Mr Trump said that China had been ""caught red-handed"". He said there could never be ""a friendly solution"" to the North Korea crisis if oil was allowed to be exported to Pyongyang. Beijing, which earlier this month supported the US-drafted UN resolution that includes measures to slash the North's petrol imports by up to 90%, denies the allegation. The resolution bans ship-to-ship transfers of any goods destined for Pyongyang. The tough new sanctions were a fresh attempt to curb North Korea's controversial nuclear and ballistic missile tests.

"Volunteers could be used to guard some of the UK's borders, the Home Office has said. The plans under consideration are for ""Border Force Special Volunteers"" to be used at small air and sea ports. A Home Office spokesman said it was ""considering the potential benefits"" and looking at how they are used by police forces. But Conservative MPCharlie Elphicke told the Mail on Sunday:,external""We can't have a Dad's Army-type of set-up."" The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents many Border Force staff, said the government was risking the country's security ""on the cheap"". The proposal comes after recent reports have raised concerns over ""poor"" coverage of some minor harbours and landing places. The Border Force carries out immigration and customs controls for people and goods entering the UK. Butan assessment by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration,published in July, said there were long periods of non-attendance by Border Force at some locations as well as a shortage of staff able to use specialist scanners. It looked at 62 normally unmanned ports on the east coast and found that Border Force officers had not visited 27 of the sites between April 2015 to June 2016. Chief Inspector David Bolt's report also revealed the number of clandestine migrants detected at the ports had almost doubled in 12 months rising from 233 to 423. Another report by David Anderson QC, former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said there were similar issues with smaller south and east coast ports, marinas and landing places, adding it was ""conceivable"" they might be an option for returning foreign fighters or other terrorists. The Home Office said if it was to introduce volunteers, they would be used to ""bolster"" Border Force staffing levels and would not be used by Immigration Enforcement. But Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, called the plan ""ridiculous"". ""Border Force are already using poorly trained seasonal workers at most ports and airports, not just at peak periods but throughout the year because of permanent staff cuts,"" he said. ""The plans to use volunteer Border Force specials is a further move towards casualisation of the workforce."" Mr Elphicke, MP for Dover, said he would ""urge great caution before seeking to adopt a model like that used by the police, with special constables"". ""Border security is a skilled job, which takes many years of training.""

"This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important The Palestinians have announced they are recalling their envoy to the United States for ""consultations"", weeks after President Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not accept any US peace plan in the wake of Mr Trump's move. Protests and clashes broke out in the Gaza Strip after the announcement. A UN resolution calling on the US to cancel the decision was backed overwhelmingly by the General Assembly. Thirteen Palestinians have died in violence since Mr Trump's announcement, most killed in clashes with Israeli forces. Anger in Ramallah and delight in West Jerusalem The view from one street Trump Jerusalem shift puts counter-terror efforts at risk Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Maliki was recalling the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) envoy Husam Zomlot, Palestinian news agency Wafa said. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel occupied the east of the city, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. On Sunday Mr Abbas called Jerusalem the ""eternal capital of the Palestinian people"". Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries currently maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. However, President Trump has told the US state department to start work on moving the US embassy.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says ""the old political consensus is finished"" Labour is ""staking out the new centre ground in British politics"", Jeremy Corbyn has said as the party leaders gave their new year messages. Mr Corbyn said the prospect of a ""new Britain"" was ""closer than ever"" and he was leading a ""government in waiting"". Prime Minister Theresa May used her new year message to say Britons will feel ""renewed confidence and pride"" in 2018. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called for a second public vote on Brexit and ""a real cash injection for the NHS"". Britons will feel pride in 2018, says May Watch: BBC political review of 2017 Labour defied predictions of a landslide defeat in the 2017 general election to secure a hung parliament. The result saw the prime minister lose her Commons majority, but theConservatives remain the largest party. Mrs May acknowledged that 2017, during which she called a snap election, was a challenging year. ""That is true for each of us personally,"" she added. The prime minister also lost three senior cabinet members to scandal during 2017. However, she said: ""The real test is not whether challenges come; it's how you face them. ""Whether you allow a task to overcome you, or tackle it head on with purpose and resolve."" The Labour leader used his message to attack a ""failed system"" of governance and ""stagnant economy"" of wealth disparity run by a ""self-serving elite"". The 2017 general election showed ""the establishment's secret is out: they're not as strong as they appear"" and have ""no idea how to fix their broken system,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""The old political consensus is finished,"" he added. He insisted Labour now occupied the new centre ground in British politics. ""We are staking out the new centre ground in British politics, backing the things which most people want but are blocked by vested interests. ""We are a government in waiting, while the Conservatives are weak and divided and stuck in an outdated rut with no new ideas,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said Labour's mission was to ""give people support and security and use their talents, unleash their creativity and fulfil their hopes"". ""The hope of a new Britain, run in the interests of the many, not the few, is closer than ever before. ""Together we can, and we will, deliver it."" This video can not be played Theresa May says the government will focus on schools, the police and the NHS The prime minister said that while Brexit will be ""crucial"" in the coming year, it is ""not the limit"" of the government's ambitions. It will focus on schools, the police and NHS to change people's daily lives. Whilst 2017 was a turbulent year for Mrs May, she described it as one of progress, with the first stage of Brexit talks completed in December. ""Most people just want the government to get on and deliver a good Brexit, and that's exactly what we are doing"", she said. Mrs May said 2018 would also see her move closer to her goal of a ""stronger and fairer"" society. She said the government will ""build more good schools"" and more homes, ""so housing becomes more affordable"", while also working to ""enhance our natural environment for the next generation"". Sir Vince Cable says the Lib Dems will ""stand up for the underdog"" The Liberal Democrat leader, like Labour, used his message to confront ""the establishment"", saying his party was ""unafraid to swim against the tide"" and ""stand up for the underdog"". Sir Vince, whoreplaced Tim Farron as leader in July,said his party had ""a lot of work to do"" in 2018 to persuade the public to get behind them. In a video message, he said: ""There's still time to offer people the choice of an exit from Brexit; there's a big opportunity to win a real cash injection for the NHS and for schools; and to win the argument for thousands more affordable homes."" ""All over the country people are getting behind these campaigns by joining and supporting the Liberal Democrats."" He urged his party to ""get back to what we're good at"" by mobilising grassroots supporters, adding ""let's make 2018 our year"".

"Internet companies should face a tax punishment for failing to deal with the threat of terrorism in the UK, security minister Ben Wallace has said. Mr Wallace said firms such as Facebook, Google and YouTube were too slow to remove radical content online, forcing the government to act instead. While tech firms were ""ruthless profiteers"", governments were spending millions policing the web, he added. Facebook said Mr Wallace was wrong to say it put profits before safety. YouTube said violent extremism was a ""complex problem"" and addressing it was a ""critical challenge for us all"". Is pressure on tech giants having any effect? What can tech firms do to fight terror? May warns tech firms over terror content Terror online: Politicians v tech tycoons In an interview with the Sunday Times,external, Mr Wallace said tech giants were failing to help prevent the radicalisation of people online. ""Because content is not taken down as quickly as they could do,"" he claimed, ""we're having to de-radicalise people who have been radicalised. That's costing millions."" He said the refusal of messaging services - such as WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook - to give the security services access to message data was ""turning the internet into an anarchic violent space"". ""Because of encryption and because of radicalisation, the cost of that is heaped on law enforcement agencies,"" Mr Wallace told the newspaper. By Emma Vardy, BBC political correspondent This latest tax idea is a sign ministers are trying to explore all sorts of new ways to put pressure on tech firms. How strong a tool it might be is unclear. Tech giants' revenues are so high, a tax or effectively a fine, may not immediately change the measures they are already taking, although it could play well with the public. Google and Facebook have already stepped up their efforts to identify and take down extremist content, including using artificial intelligence to spot illegal content. But ministers want them to go further. Meanwhile smaller sites like Telegram and WordPress are a more difficult problem. They have done far less to tackle the use of their platforms by extremists. Firms based overseas are almost completely out of reach of any measures imposed by the UK government, and in reality when authorities try to engage with them, they don't get very far. Mr Wallace said ""the time for excuses is at an end"" and the government should look at ""all options"" of incentivising firms - ""including tax"". ""We should stop pretending that because they sit on beanbags in T-shirts they are not ruthless profiteers,"" he said. ""They will ruthlessly sell our details to loans and soft-porn companies but not give it to our democratically elected government."" In September Theresa May called for technology companies to take down terror content within two hours Simon Milner, policy director at Facebook, said Mr Wallace was wrong to say the company put profit before safety, especially in the fight against terrorism. He said millions of pounds had been invested in people and technology to identify and remove terrorist content. Home Secretary Amber Rudd and her European counterparts have welcomed coordinated efforts which were having a significant impact, he added. ""But this is an ongoing battle and we must continue to fight it together, indeed our CEO recently told our investors that in 2018 we will continue to put the safety of our community before profits."" Facebook recently announced that 99% of content relating to so-called Islamic State or al-Qaeda was taken down before users had flagged it up. A YouTube spokesperson told the BBC it was committed to being ""part of the solution"" and was doing more every day to tackle the problem. This year it had invested in machine-learning technology, recruited more reviewers of content and built partnerships with experts and collaborated with other companies, they added. Google has yet to respond to Mr Wallace's remarks. However, speaking in September, Kent Walker, general counsel for Google, said tech firms would not be able to ""do it alone"". ""We need people and we need feedback from trusted government sources and from our users to identify and remove some of the most problematic content out there."" Dr Shiraz Maher, from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at Kings College London, said: ""Mobilisation to terrorism still involves real life, real world contacts so governments can't solely blame tech companies. ""Also there is no easy fix, because what constitutes extremist material is subjective."" Automated take-down systems have in the past led to lots of ""useful"" content being removed by mistake, he added. ""Syrian activists documenting war crimes by the regime and Islamic State have had their videos pulled from YouTube. Those videos will be needed in the future to bring criminals to account in The Hague."" Is pressure on tech giants having any effect? Video, 00:06:35Is pressure on tech giants having any effect?

Storm Dylan swept across parts of Scotland on Sunday Earlier on Sunday, police closed part of Princes Street in Edinburgh to pedestrians for a couple of hours after part of a stage was blown over in the high winds. As Storm Dylan tore across central and southern parts of Scotland there were power outages caused by trees on the lines. The floodgates on the A78 were closed between Largs/Meigle and Wemyss Bay/Skerlmorlie A fallen tree blocked the B824 Hill of Row road in Dunblane The Met Office said a gust of wind measuring 76mph was recorded at Port Ellen on Islay. The storm also caused disruption to ferry services from Oban, Tarbert and Lismore and rail services between Edinburgh, Helensburgh and Glasgow Central and Largs. On the roads, there were restrictions on bridges and fallen trees caused some disruption. Sepa had issued flood warnings for some areas in the south west but these were later lifted.

"The initial death toll of 30 rose to 36 after six of the injured died in hospital At least 36 people have died in a head-on collision between a lorry and a Nairobi-bound bus on a notoriously dangerous road near Migaa in Kenya. Local officials said the accident happened at 03:00 (0:00 GMT), and the bus was speeding and in the wrong lane. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has ranked Kenya as one of the world's worst countries for road safety. Police believe over 100 people have died in the same area on the Nakuru-Eldoret highway in recent weeks. The bus was reportedly carrying 46 passengers to Nairobi from the western town of Busia when the accident happened. ""I was asleep when the accident occurred and all I heard was a loud bang and screams from all over before I was helped out,""a passenger who survived the crash told a local radio station,external. Officials say 34 of the dead were bus passengers, and two died in the Eldoret-bound lorry Both vehicles' drivers are said to be among the dead, with the youngest victim reportedly a three-year-old child. The Kenyan Red Cross said on Twitter that 18 passengers from the bus were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Six of the injured later died, officials say. Police say the accident on Sunday is the worst on the highway in the month of December. The National Transport and Safety Authority announced an immediate ban on overnight travel for long-distance buses following Sunday's crash. Earlier this monthKenyan officials announced the road was going to be renovated into a dual carriageway in 2018,external, in order to try and minimise accidents on the deadly stretch.

"This video can not be played Theresa May says 2017 has been a challenging year Britons will feel ""renewed confidence and pride"" in 2018, Theresa May has said in her new year message. The prime minister said that while Brexit will be ""crucial"" in the coming year, it is ""not the limit"" of the government's ambitions. It will focus on schools, the police and NHS to change people's daily lives. Whilst 2017 was a turbulent year for Mrs May, she described it as one of progress, with the first stage of Brexit talks completed in December. ""Most people just want the government to get on and deliver a good Brexit, and that's exactly what we are doing"", she said. Mrs May said 2018 would also see her move closer to her goal of a ""stronger and fairer"" society. She said the government will ""build more good schools"" and more homes, ""so housing becomes more affordable"", while also working to ""enhance our natural environment for the next generation"". Labour staking out centre ground - Corbyn Watch: BBC political review of 2017 She acknowledged that 2017, during which she called a snap election, only to lose the Conservative's Commons majority, was a challenging year. ""That is true for each of us personally,"" she added. The prime minister alsolost three senior cabinet members to scandalduring 2017. However, she said: ""The real test is not whether challenges come; it's how you face them. ""Whether you allow a task to overcome you, or tackle it head on with purpose and resolve."" Mrs May has previously said that she""will not be derailed""following her government's defeat on the EU Withdrawal Bill in early December. On Brexit her year ended better than expected, however, when she reached a deal with the EU that concluded the first stage of negotiations and will allow the second to get under way in the new year. In her message, the prime minister noted that 2018 is the 100th anniversary of the granting of women's suffrage, saying the occasion should be marked with a ""vow to eliminate all prejudice and discrimination from our society"", She also drew attention to the 70th birthday of ""our precious NHS"" and defended the Conservatives' running of the health service from frequent criticisms about a lack of funding. ""We will continue to invest in our NHS and ensure it can deliver a world-class service now and for generations to come,"" she said. In November, NHS leaders warned that an extra Â£1.6bn for frontline health services, announced in the budget,was not enough to tackle lengthening waiting times.

"A 24-hour strike is expected to cause disruption on some of the UK's main railway lines on New Year's Eve. A walkout by Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) members will bring delays and cancellations on South Western Railway (SWR) and CrossCountry networks. The union says it is striking over concerns about rosters, Sunday working and guards on trains. The government has accused the union of causing ""misery"" for passengers. Sunday's strike will disrupt services to and from London Waterloo, the country's busiest station. Managing director of South Western, Andy Mellors, said: ""We will do everything we can to keep our passengers moving during this unnecessary strike but passengers are warned to check before travelling and be prepared for queues if travelling back from the New Year's Eve fireworks."" CrossCountry is planning to run a reduced service between Newcastle and Edinburgh. There will not be a service between Glasgow and Aberdeen. All other CrossCountry lines are expected to be affected. Staying in this New Year? Youâre not alone Which New Year resolutions have you kept? The RMT union is planning more strikes in January on South Western, Southern, Merseyrail, Greater Anglia and Arriva Rail North. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""It's the continuing failure of the train companies and their political puppet masters in government to make any attempt whatsoever to resolve the range of separate disputes over rail safety that has led us to call this further action."" He added: ""The responsibility for the disruption that will be caused lays fairly and squarely at their door."" Rail minister Paul Maynard said: ""It is disgraceful that the RMT is seeking to cause misery to paying customers trying to get home to family and friends for the new year. ""Rail companies are working hard to keep passengers moving, and plan to run the majority of services, but we call on the RMT to show some decency and call off these strikes."" Over the Christmas period,snow and ice caused severe disruption to road, rail and air travel. The Met Office has issued an amber warning covering Northern Ireland and parts of southern and western Scotland, as Storm Dylan arrives to bring a wet and windy end to 2017. Forecasters warned there was the potential for ""injuries and danger to life from flying debris"", as winds are expected to reach 80mph. Some disruption across the road, rail and ferry network is also likely. However,organisers of Edinburgh's Hogmanay say they expect the event to go ahead, as any severe weather is due to happen before Sunday night's celebrations begin.

"This video can not be played Video from the town of Dorud shows a crowd carrying what appears to be a wounded man Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned anti-government protesters they will face the nation's ""iron fist"" if political unrest continues. Three days of demonstrations over falling living standards have become the biggest show of dissent since huge pro-reform rallies in 2009. A Revolutionary Guards commander said the protests had degenerated into people chanting political slogans and burning public property. Two protesters died of gunshot wounds. The authorities in Dorud in western Iran said security forces did not open fire on demonstrators, and blamed the deaths instead on Sunni Muslim extremists and foreign powers. Correspondents say the reference to foreign intelligence agencies was intended to mean Saudi Arabia. Iran has imposed ""temporary"" restrictions on social networks Telegram and Instagram. The decision was taken ""to maintain tranquillity and security of society"", a source told state news agency IRIB. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov tweeted that the action was taken after his company refused to shut down channels on the messaging app used to organise peaceful protests. Allow Twitter content?

Protesters in the cities of Khoramabad, Zanjan and Ahvaz called for the removal or death of Iran's Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps is a powerful force with ties to the country's supreme leader, and is dedicated to preserving the country's Islamic system. Brigadier-General Esmail Kowsari told the ISNA news agency: ""If people came into the streets over high prices, they should not have chanted those slogans and burned public property and cars."" Students were involved in a number of clashes Iran's interior minister has also warned the public that protesters will be held accountable. ""Those who damage public property, disrupt order and break the law must be responsible for their behaviour and pay the price,"" Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli said. ""The spreading of violence, fear and terror will definitely be confronted."" US warns Iran: The world is watching Iranians protest against high prices Who are the Basij militia?,external Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian There is widespread and seething discontent in Iran where repression is pervasive and economic hardship is getting worse - one BBC Persian investigation has found that on average Iranians have become 15% poorer in the past 10 years. Protests have remained confined to relatively small pockets of mostly young male demonstrators who are demanding the overthrow of the clerical regime. Protests have spread to even small towns throughout the country and have a potential to grow in size. But there is no obvious leadership. Opposition figures have long been silenced or sent into exile. Even in exile, there is no one opposition figure that commands a large following. Some protesters have been calling for the return of the monarchy and the former shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, has issued a statement supporting the demonstrations. But there are signs that he is as much in the dark about where these protests are going as anyone else. BBC Persian, which broadcasts on TV, on radio and online from London, is banned in Iran - where staff and their families routinely face harassment and questioning from the authorities. Protests began in the north-eastern city of Mashhad on Thursday and spread to other major cities on Friday. A small demonstration in Tehran grew to several thousand people on Saturday, and students clashed with police. The protests also became violent in several other towns. Among the recent events across Iran: In Abhar, demonstrators set fire to large banners bearing the picture of the supreme leader In Arak, protesters reportedly set fire to the local headquarters of the pro-government Basij militia In Mashhad, protesters burned police motorcycles in a confrontation caught on video The CEO of popular mobile messaging app Telegram said an Iranian account had been suspended,externalfor calling for attacks on police There are numerous reports of people losing internet access on their mobile phones Street protests have been reported in a number of other towns and cities, including Kermanshah, Shahrekord, Bandar Abbas, Izeh, Zanjan, Karaj, Tonekabon and Khorramabad There is also anger at Iran's interventions abroad. In Mashhad, some chanted ""not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran"", a reference to what protesters say is the administration's focus on foreign rather than domestic issues. Iran 'building permanent military base' in Syria Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals Iran is a key provider of military support to the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. It is also accused of providing arms to Houthi rebels fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which it denies, and is an ally of Lebanon's powerful Shia movement Hezbollah. The Iranian authorities are blaming anti-revolutionaries and agents of foreign powers for the outbreak. There were fires in Tehran as protests continued Also on Saturday, thousands of pro-government demonstrators turned out for pre-arranged rallies to mark the eighth anniversary of the suppression of the 2009 street protests. The US has led international support for the protesters. President Donald Trump tweeted,external: ""Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. The world is watching!"" Iran's foreign ministry called earlier comments from Mr Trump and other US officials ""opportunistic and deceitful"". Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) was set up shortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution to defend the country's Islamic system. It has since become a major force in the political, economic and military life of the country, with its own ground forces, navy and air force. It controls a volunteer militia of tens of thousands of people - the Basij Resistance Force. The IRGC sometimes works alongside police, and it was announced in December that it would do this again. Its stature says it will co-operate with law enforcement forces ""when necessary"" but there has been some controversy over its scope when dealing with civilians. Clashes erupt in western Iran town.

"This video can not be played Sir John Curtice: ""This will take quite a while to get used to."" Polling expert and political scientist John Curtice has been given a knighthood inthe Queen's New Year honours list. The veteran psephologist has been honoured for his high-profile work in political analysis. His 2017 election exit poll correctly predicted the Conservatives would lose their majority. The 64-year-old, famous for political predictions, said the honour was ""not something I saw coming"". Cult of Curtice: Love for polling guru Your questions: John Curtice His polling work has been lauded for its accuracy, often departing from the general consensus to correctly predict shock election results. The 2017 prediction led many to say that he was the true winner of the election. It followed accurate predictions in the 2005, 2010, and 2015 general elections. After Sir John's 2015 poll predicted a David Cameron win, former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown promised to eat his hat if it was correct. He was later given a hat-shaped cake on Question Time. In a tweet on Saturday, Lord Ashdown offered his congratulations and jokingly referred to the hat incident, although he misspelled the polling expert's name. Allow Twitter content?

""Well, I have to admit this was not something I saw coming. I am surprised as well as being honoured that I have been granted this knighthood."" Sir John said he was happy that so many people found his work useful. He said: ""The gratifying part of the citation for me is that it is not just for services to social sciences, but to politics. ""It is probably relatively rare for someone who avoids all partisan politics and all partisan comment to actually be cited as giving services to the political life of the nation. ""What seems to be true is that, for good or ill, people find that when I stand in front of a camera and try to explain to people what's going on politically using the academic work that I have done, people say that they find this useful, illustrating and informative."" Polling expert John Curtice has received a knighthood He admitted that he hopes 2018 will be a quieter year for politics. ""I guess like many other people in the political world, I am on tenterhooks as to what 2018 will bring"", he said. ""Many people will be hoping that, in contrast to the last four years, there will not be a major election or referendum, but I guess we've learnt not to presume that will happen. ""If the government doesn't survive for the next 12 months it may be that I'm going to have to chance my reputation yet again with yet another exit poll but, in truth, I'm hoping not and that 2018 will be a relatively quiet year."" Born in Cornwall, he became interested in politics and voting patterns as a child. ""My earliest memories go back to the resignation of Harold Macmillan and the death of Hugh Gaitskell in the early 1960s,"" he said in a2013 BBC interview. ""That's going back to the age of nine or 10, I was following those stories. ""I remember begging my parents to allow me to stay up during the 1964 general election count, and remember that very close result, and that only the following day did we knew that Harold Wilson had got an overall majority. ""Very odd pre-occupations for a nine or 10-year-old I utterly admit,"" He studied at Oxford, and in the late 1980s was approached by Strathclyde University to take over ""number crunching"" in their politics department, and has remained in the country throughout the intervening years. His time at Strathclyde has overseen the birth of devolution in Scotland, and the independence referendum in 2014. As well as his post at Strathclyde University, he is a senior research fellow at NatCen Social Research - Britain's largest independent social research agency - and president of the British Polling Council. He received a lifetime achievement award earlier this year at the Times Higher Education Awards in London. Sir John's official knighthood citation is for services to social sciences and politics.

"Stella and Bill Tomkinson (pictured bottom centre) with some of the children they looked after, who are now grown up A great-grandmother who looked after more than 100 children in 50 years has been appointed an MBE for services to foster care. Stella Tomkinson, 79, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, said she had been told about the honour in November. She said although fostering had its ups and downs, ""it is really rewarding"". Mrs Tomkinson said she had been ""really lucky,"" adding: ""I can honestly say that if I lived my life again, I would do exactly the same thing."" She and her husband Bill, a butcher, decided to become foster carers in the 1960s after discovering they could not have children. ""I had six miscarriages; it was heartbreaking,"" she said. They adopted a five-week-old baby girl in 1962 and then put their names down to adopt further children - only to be asked to foster a little girl with health problems instead. That prompted the couple to foster more children, including several with disabilities. ""The most we had living with us at any one time was seven,"" said Mrs Tomkinson. ""At the start, we just lived in a normal three-bedroom terrace in Nuneaton. We always had room for everyone though."" Mrs Tomkinson found her emotional attachment to her charges challenging at times. ""I always feel upset when they leave,"" she said. Some children stayed for a few months; others remained until adulthood. Mrs Tomkinson stopped fostering two years ago, after her husband's death in 2009. However, she has set up a weekly support group for parents of children with disabilities through Nuneaton and Bedworth's Mencap Society. She now has six adopted children, 16 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. ""I'm proud of all the children I've looked after,"" she said. ""Many people find Christmas a lonely time and if I hadn't had all these children, I would probably have been lonely too. ""I have been really lucky watching all these children grow up.""

"Four young children have been left ""terrified"" after they witnessed a ""horrific"" shooting of a man in a house in west Belfast, police have said. The paramilitary-style gun attack happened on Cavendish Street at about 19:45 GMT on Saturday. Three men entered a house and struck the man on the head before using a handgun to shoot him in both knees and his right ankle. The victim, who is 28, is in hospital receiving treatment to his injuries. A woman in the house who saw what happened was also assaulted. Det Sgt Kelly, of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, said it was a ""brutal attack in a busy residential area"" and showed how ""criminal groups seek to control communities through fear and violence"". ""The residents, including young children, have been left terrified by these events,"" he added. Sinn FÃ©in councillor Ciaran Beattie said the attack happened in a residential area and people had been left shocked. ""I condemn these type of shootings outright - there's no place for these actions in our society at all,"" he said.

"The UK's aid budget will be shifted to projects that promote its interests, the foreign secretary has said. Boris Johnson said the money will be ""more sensibly distributed"" to support foreign policy aims such as denying safe havens to Islamist militants. His comments came as Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, said the UK will provide a Â£21m boost to an emergency aid fund. The UK currently spends Â£13bn on aid each year. Speaking to the Times newspaper, Mr Johnson said ""the old jam jars are being smashed"" and money would be diverted to support government aims, including combating terrorist groups in Africa. It would also go to help refugees in Yemen and Rohingya Muslims fleeing across the Burmese border into Bangladesh, he added. Reality Check: How much does the UK spend on overseas aid? Where does UK aid go and why? The government is committed to spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid but some politicians oppose such spending. Conservative backbench MP Peter Bone has said the target ""means that important things at home like social care are struggling,"" while Ukip have called for the aid budget to be cut by 80% and focus only on emergency responses and eradicating disease. Labour backs the 0.7% target, saying global poverty reduction is itself in the UK's interest. In January,the government scrapped plans to fund an Ethiopian girl bandas part of a project to promote women's rights. It said there were ""more effective ways"" to invest UK aid. By Emma Vardy, BBC political correspondent For years there have been calls from some MPs for Britain's foreign aid budget to be cut, and the subject provides a steady stream of headlines in the right-leaning press. Priti Patel said too much of Britain's aid money was wasted, or spent poorly, when she was international development minister. The government recently suspended a Â£12m aid programme to Syria after a BBC investigation revealed the cash was at risk of going to jihadist groups. And before the 2017 General Election there were suggestions that Theresa May was planning to revise the 0.7% spending target, but eventually it remained unchanged. Mrs May says she is ""proud"" of the UK's record on foreign aid while Labour, the Lib Dems and SNP are also committed to keeping the 0.7% target. Mr Johnson's promise to spend foreign aid more wisely may improve confidence, but for the harshest critics it will not go anywhere near far enough. Many will continue to argue that in a time of economic difficulties for the UK, money spent abroad could be used to help tackle health and social care funding problems at home. Mr Johnson said the UK would gain more control of its aid spending after Brexit. About Â£1bn of the money the UK pays to the EU budget counts as part of the foreign aid budget. The EU spends that money on humanitarian aid and on emergency responses to world crises, as well as on projects in countries close to the EU and those hoping to join in the future. Ms Mordaunt said that the extra Â£21m for the United Nations' Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) was needed because 2018 could be ""even bleaker"" than this year, with its ""harrowing"" humanitarian crises. The money will hep to provide millions of people with food, clean water, sanitation and vital health services. As of April 2017: More than 40% of the budget went to multilateral organisations, such as the United Nations, who fund big projects like disaster relief The remaining 60% goes directly to developing countries The Department for International Development says the biggest regional beneficiary is Africa, which received a total of Â£2.54bn from the UK last year Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Syria, were each given more than Â£200m At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says ""the old political consensus is finished"" Labour is ""staking out the new centre ground in British politics"", Jeremy Corbyn has said as the party leaders gave their new year messages. Mr Corbyn said the prospect of a ""new Britain"" was ""closer than ever"" and he was leading a ""government in waiting"". Prime Minister Theresa May used her new year message to say Britons will feel ""renewed confidence and pride"" in 2018. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called for a second public vote on Brexit and ""a real cash injection for the NHS"". Britons will feel pride in 2018, says May Watch: BBC political review of 2017 Labour defied predictions of a landslide defeat in the 2017 general election to secure a hung parliament. The result saw the prime minister lose her Commons majority, but theConservatives remain the largest party. Mrs May acknowledged that 2017, during which she called a snap election, was a challenging year. ""That is true for each of us personally,"" she added. The prime minister also lost three senior cabinet members to scandal during 2017. However, she said: ""The real test is not whether challenges come; it's how you face them. ""Whether you allow a task to overcome you, or tackle it head on with purpose and resolve."" The Labour leader used his message to attack a ""failed system"" of governance and ""stagnant economy"" of wealth disparity run by a ""self-serving elite"". The 2017 general election showed ""the establishment's secret is out: they're not as strong as they appear"" and have ""no idea how to fix their broken system,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""The old political consensus is finished,"" he added. He insisted Labour now occupied the new centre ground in British politics. ""We are staking out the new centre ground in British politics, backing the things which most people want but are blocked by vested interests. ""We are a government in waiting, while the Conservatives are weak and divided and stuck in an outdated rut with no new ideas,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said Labour's mission was to ""give people support and security and use their talents, unleash their creativity and fulfil their hopes"". ""The hope of a new Britain, run in the interests of the many, not the few, is closer than ever before. ""Together we can, and we will, deliver it."" This video can not be played Theresa May says the government will focus on schools, the police and the NHS The prime minister said that while Brexit will be ""crucial"" in the coming year, it is ""not the limit"" of the government's ambitions. It will focus on schools, the police and NHS to change people's daily lives. Whilst 2017 was a turbulent year for Mrs May, she described it as one of progress, with the first stage of Brexit talks completed in December. ""Most people just want the government to get on and deliver a good Brexit, and that's exactly what we are doing"", she said. Mrs May said 2018 would also see her move closer to her goal of a ""stronger and fairer"" society. She said the government will ""build more good schools"" and more homes, ""so housing becomes more affordable"", while also working to ""enhance our natural environment for the next generation"". Sir Vince Cable says the Lib Dems will ""stand up for the underdog"" The Liberal Democrat leader, like Labour, used his message to confront ""the establishment"", saying his party was ""unafraid to swim against the tide"" and ""stand up for the underdog"". Sir Vince, whoreplaced Tim Farron as leader in July,said his party had ""a lot of work to do"" in 2018 to persuade the public to get behind them. In a video message, he said: ""There's still time to offer people the choice of an exit from Brexit; there's a big opportunity to win a real cash injection for the NHS and for schools; and to win the argument for thousands more affordable homes."" ""All over the country people are getting behind these campaigns by joining and supporting the Liberal Democrats."" He urged his party to ""get back to what we're good at"" by mobilising grassroots supporters, adding ""let's make 2018 our year"".

"George Papadopoulos allegedly shared his knowledge with a diplomat at an upscale London bar The investigation into possible connections between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign began after a tip-off from Australia, the New York Times reports. Trump adviser George Papadopoulos allegedly told Australia's top UK diplomat that Moscow had incriminating ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. The newspaper alleges the revelation came ""during a night of heavy drinking"" in London in May 2016. Australia later informed the FBI. The New York Times report claims that the exchange was the spark for establishing a secret investigation,externalinto possible connections between Russia and the Trump campaign in July 2016. The newspaper's story cites four anonymous American and Australian foreign officials ""with direct knowledge of the Australian's role"" as its source. The BBC has not independently verified the claims. Mr Papadopoulos has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBIabout meetings arranged while he was working with the Trump campaign. The FBI's original investigation has since been handed off to special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, with which Mr Papadopoulos is now cooperating. The White House has attempted to portray him as a ""low-level volunteer""with little influence within the campaign. However, Mr Papadopoulos is known to have attended several meetings with Mr Trump and other senior officials such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as well as meeting a British foreign office official and arranging high-level meetings. Three reasons why Papadopoulos is a key piece of the puzzle Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Mr Papadopoulos was told by a contact with Russian links that Moscow had ""dirt"" on Mr Trump's Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails"" in April 2016 - something revealed earlier this year. But the New York Times now reports that weeks later, in May, Mr Papadopoulos was speaking to Alexander Downer, Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, at an ""upscale London bar"" when he revealed the existence of the Russian information. It is not clear why Mr Papadopoulos chose to share his knowledge with Mr Downer, but the Times reports that the Australian diplomat passed the information to his government. Two months later, when copies of Mrs Clinton's emails began appearing online, the Australian government passed the information to the FBI. Once that happened, the newspaper said, ""the bureau opened an investigation that became one of its most closely guarded secrets"". ""Senior agents did not discuss it at the daily morning briefing, a classified setting where officials normally speak freely about highly sensitive operations."" The newspaper reports that corroborating intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and the Dutch, helped drive the investigation.

"Volunteers could be used to guard some of the UK's borders, the Home Office has said. The plans under consideration are for ""Border Force Special Volunteers"" to be used at small air and sea ports. A Home Office spokesman said it was ""considering the potential benefits"" and looking at how they are used by police forces. But Conservative MPCharlie Elphicke told the Mail on Sunday:,external""We can't have a Dad's Army-type of set-up."" The Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents many Border Force staff, said the government was risking the country's security ""on the cheap"". The proposal comes after recent reports have raised concerns over ""poor"" coverage of some minor harbours and landing places. The Border Force carries out immigration and customs controls for people and goods entering the UK. Butan assessment by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration,published in July, said there were long periods of non-attendance by Border Force at some locations as well as a shortage of staff able to use specialist scanners. It looked at 62 normally unmanned ports on the east coast and found that Border Force officers had not visited 27 of the sites between April 2015 to June 2016. Chief Inspector David Bolt's report also revealed the number of clandestine migrants detected at the ports had almost doubled in 12 months rising from 233 to 423. Another report by David Anderson QC, former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said there were similar issues with smaller south and east coast ports, marinas and landing places, adding it was ""conceivable"" they might be an option for returning foreign fighters or other terrorists. The Home Office said if it was to introduce volunteers, they would be used to ""bolster"" Border Force staffing levels and would not be used by Immigration Enforcement. But Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, called the plan ""ridiculous"". ""Border Force are already using poorly trained seasonal workers at most ports and airports, not just at peak periods but throughout the year because of permanent staff cuts,"" he said. ""The plans to use volunteer Border Force specials is a further move towards casualisation of the workforce."" Mr Elphicke, MP for Dover, said he would ""urge great caution before seeking to adopt a model like that used by the police, with special constables"". ""Border security is a skilled job, which takes many years of training.""

Mrs May acknowledged that 2017, during which she called a snap election, was a challenging year. ""That is true for each of us personally,"" she added. The prime minister also lost three senior cabinet members to scandal during 2017. However, she said: ""The real test is not whether challenges come; it's how you face them. ""Whether you allow a task to overcome you, or tackle it head on with purpose and resolve."" The Labour leader used his message to attack a ""failed system"" of governance and ""stagnant economy"" of wealth disparity run by a ""self-serving elite"". The 2017 general election showed ""the establishment's secret is out: they're not as strong as they appear"" and have ""no idea how to fix their broken system,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""The old political consensus is finished,"" he added. He insisted Labour now occupied the new centre ground in British politics. ""We are staking out the new centre ground in British politics, backing the things which most people want but are blocked by vested interests. ""We are a government in waiting, while the Conservatives are weak and divided and stuck in an outdated rut with no new ideas,"" he said. Mr Corbyn said Labour's mission was to ""give people support and security and use their talents, unleash their creativity and fulfil their hopes"". ""The hope of a new Britain, run in the interests of the many, not the few, is closer than ever before. ""Together we can, and we will, deliver it."" This video can not be played Theresa May says the government will focus on schools, the police and the NHS The prime minister said that while Brexit will be ""crucial"" in the coming year, it is ""not the limit"" of the government's ambitions. It will focus on schools, the police and NHS to change people's daily lives. Whilst 2017 was a turbulent year for Mrs May, she described it as one of progress, with the first stage of Brexit talks completed in December. ""Most people just want the government to get on and deliver a good Brexit, and that's exactly what we are doing"", she said. Mrs May said 2018 would also see her move closer to her goal of a ""stronger and fairer"" society. She said the government will ""build more good schools"" and more homes, ""so housing becomes more affordable"", while also working to ""enhance our natural environment for the next generation"". Sir Vince Cable says the Lib Dems will ""stand up for the underdog"" The Liberal Democrat leader, like Labour, used his message to confront ""the establishment"", saying his party was ""unafraid to swim against the tide"" and ""stand up for the underdog"". Sir Vince, whoreplaced Tim Farron as leader in July,said his party had ""a lot of work to do"" in 2018 to persuade the public to get behind them. In a video message, he said: ""There's still time to offer people the choice of an exit from Brexit; there's a big opportunity to win a real cash injection for the NHS and for schools; and to win the argument for thousands more affordable homes."" ""All over the country people are getting behind these campaigns by joining and supporting the Liberal Democrats."" He urged his party to ""get back to what we're good at"" by mobilising grassroots supporters, adding ""let's make 2018 our year"".

"George Papadopoulos allegedly shared his knowledge with a diplomat at an upscale London bar The investigation into possible connections between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign began after a tip-off from Australia, the New York Times reports. Trump adviser George Papadopoulos allegedly told Australia's top UK diplomat that Moscow had incriminating ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. The newspaper alleges the revelation came ""during a night of heavy drinking"" in London in May 2016. Australia later informed the FBI. The New York Times report claims that the exchange was the spark for establishing a secret investigation,externalinto possible connections between Russia and the Trump campaign in July 2016. The newspaper's story cites four anonymous American and Australian foreign officials ""with direct knowledge of the Australian's role"" as its source. The BBC has not independently verified the claims. Mr Papadopoulos has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBIabout meetings arranged while he was working with the Trump campaign. The FBI's original investigation has since been handed off to special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, with which Mr Papadopoulos is now cooperating. The White House has attempted to portray him as a ""low-level volunteer""with little influence within the campaign. However, Mr Papadopoulos is known to have attended several meetings with Mr Trump and other senior officials such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as well as meeting a British foreign office official and arranging high-level meetings. Three reasons why Papadopoulos is a key piece of the puzzle Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Mr Papadopoulos was told by a contact with Russian links that Moscow had ""dirt"" on Mr Trump's Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails"" in April 2016 - something revealed earlier this year. But the New York Times now reports that weeks later, in May, Mr Papadopoulos was speaking to Alexander Downer, Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, at an ""upscale London bar"" when he revealed the existence of the Russian information. It is not clear why Mr Papadopoulos chose to share his knowledge with Mr Downer, but the Times reports that the Australian diplomat passed the information to his government. Two months later, when copies of Mrs Clinton's emails began appearing online, the Australian government passed the information to the FBI. Once that happened, the newspaper said, ""the bureau opened an investigation that became one of its most closely guarded secrets"". ""Senior agents did not discuss it at the daily morning briefing, a classified setting where officials normally speak freely about highly sensitive operations."" The newspaper reports that corroborating intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and the Dutch, helped drive the investigation.

"Torchbearers spelling out ""braw"" as Edinburgh""s Hogmanay festival opened on Saturday with an ""iconic"" torchlight procession Edinburgh's Hogmanay organisers say they expect the event not to be affected by Storm Dylan. Strong winds have started to batter parts of Scotland - with some ferry sailings affected, and high wind warnings in place on some bridges. The Met Office issued an amber warning for wind for Argyll, Ayrshire and much of Dumfries and Galloway from 04:00 to 13:00 on Sunday. It highlighted ""potential for injuries and danger to life from flying debris"". The storm moved in from Northern Ireland overnight and was due to subside on Sunday afternoon. There were reports of trees blown down on roads in some parts of the country, including on Barrhead Road in Glasgow, in Lochgilphead and in Stranraer.  There were no injuries reported. The strong winds will travel in from Northern Ireland As festivities to mark the New Year got under way in Edinburgh, a torchlight procession took place in on Saturday evening, with the famous street party and Princes Street Gardens concert starring Rag'n'Bone Man happening late on Sunday. Torchbearers also marked the start of Scotland's Year of Young People spelling out ""braw"" which has been chosen by youngsters as the word which describes why they are proud to live in Scotland. In Edinburgh and parts of the Central, Tayside and Fife regions, a yellow ""be aware"" warning is in place from 02:00 until 15:00 on Sunday. Organisers said Edinburgh's event would go ahead in full, with any severe weather due to happen before Sunday night's celebrations began. A spokeswoman for Underbelly, the organisers of the Scottish capital's Hogmanay celebrations, said: ""Edinburgh's Hogmanay is, as always, in constant contact with the Met Office, receiving regular forecast updates specific to Edinburgh. ""Forecasters are predicting that Storm Dylan will hit Scotland's central belt between 12 midnight and 3pm on the 31st, happening after the torchlight procession on the 30th and passing before the Hogmanay celebrations on the 31st. ""The specific forecast produced for the Hogmanay celebrations by the Met Office considers all the latest data and provides the most likely scenario for Edinburgh City itself through which we are reassured that the planned events and preparations will not be affected and that the celebrations will go ahead in full."" More than 150,000 revellers are expected in the Scottish capital for the event. Gusts of up to 80mph are expected on Sunday Separately, a yellow warning for ice is currently in place for much of the north of Scotland, lasting until late on Sunday morning. Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said: ""Gusts of 55-65mph are expected quite widely, with some reaching up to 80mph in the worst affected areas. ""It's highly likely that these conditions will cause disruption to transport and it's important people take the weather into account if they are planning to travel by road, train, ferry and air. ""There is potential for debris on the trunk road network, as well as bridge restrictions, so drivers should check the most up-to-date information before they start their journey, drive to the conditions and follow police advice."" Large waves in coastal areas were also expected during the storm and there are warnings about the chance of bridge closures and power cuts.

"Internet companies should face a tax punishment for failing to deal with the threat of terrorism in the UK, security minister Ben Wallace has said. Mr Wallace said firms such as Facebook, Google and YouTube were too slow to remove radical content online, forcing the government to act instead. While tech firms were ""ruthless profiteers"", governments were spending millions policing the web, he added. Facebook said Mr Wallace was wrong to say it put profits before safety. YouTube said violent extremism was a ""complex problem"" and addressing it was a ""critical challenge for us all"". Is pressure on tech giants having any effect? What can tech firms do to fight terror? May warns tech firms over terror content Terror online: Politicians v tech tycoons In an interview with the Sunday Times,external, Mr Wallace said tech giants were failing to help prevent the radicalisation of people online. ""Because content is not taken down as quickly as they could do,"" he claimed, ""we're having to de-radicalise people who have been radicalised. That's costing millions."" He said the refusal of messaging services - such as WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook - to give the security services access to message data was ""turning the internet into an anarchic violent space"". ""Because of encryption and because of radicalisation, the cost of that is heaped on law enforcement agencies,"" Mr Wallace told the newspaper. By Emma Vardy, BBC political correspondent This latest tax idea is a sign ministers are trying to explore all sorts of new ways to put pressure on tech firms. How strong a tool it might be is unclear. Tech giants' revenues are so high, a tax or effectively a fine, may not immediately change the measures they are already taking, although it could play well with the public. Google and Facebook have already stepped up their efforts to identify and take down extremist content, including using artificial intelligence to spot illegal content. But ministers want them to go further. Meanwhile smaller sites like Telegram and WordPress are a more difficult problem. They have done far less to tackle the use of their platforms by extremists. Firms based overseas are almost completely out of reach of any measures imposed by the UK government, and in reality when authorities try to engage with them, they don't get very far. Mr Wallace said ""the time for excuses is at an end"" and the government should look at ""all options"" of incentivising firms - ""including tax"". ""We should stop pretending that because they sit on beanbags in T-shirts they are not ruthless profiteers,"" he said. ""They will ruthlessly sell our details to loans and soft-porn companies but not give it to our democratically elected government."" In September Theresa May called for technology companies to take down terror content within two hours Simon Milner, policy director at Facebook, said Mr Wallace was wrong to say the company put profit before safety, especially in the fight against terrorism. He said millions of pounds had been invested in people and technology to identify and remove terrorist content. Home Secretary Amber Rudd and her European counterparts have welcomed coordinated efforts which were having a significant impact, he added. ""But this is an ongoing battle and we must continue to fight it together, indeed our CEO recently told our investors that in 2018 we will continue to put the safety of our community before profits."" Facebook recently announced that 99% of content relating to so-called Islamic State or al-Qaeda was taken down before users had flagged it up. A YouTube spokesperson told the BBC it was committed to being ""part of the solution"" and was doing more every day to tackle the problem. This year it had invested in machine-learning technology, recruited more reviewers of content and built partnerships with experts and collaborated with other companies, they added. Google has yet to respond to Mr Wallace's remarks. However, speaking in September, Kent Walker, general counsel for Google, said tech firms would not be able to ""do it alone"". ""We need people and we need feedback from trusted government sources and from our users to identify and remove some of the most problematic content out there."" Dr Shiraz Maher, from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at Kings College London, said: ""Mobilisation to terrorism still involves real life, real world contacts so governments can't solely blame tech companies. ""Also there is no easy fix, because what constitutes extremist material is subjective."" Automated take-down systems have in the past led to lots of ""useful"" content being removed by mistake, he added. ""Syrian activists documenting war crimes by the regime and Islamic State have had their videos pulled from YouTube. Those videos will be needed in the future to bring criminals to account in The Hague."" Is pressure on tech giants having any effect? Video, 00:06:35Is pressure on tech giants having any effect?

""We will continue to invest in our NHS and ensure it can deliver a world-class service now and for generations to come,"" she said.

"Millennials will benefit from the biggest ""inheritance boom"" of any post-war generation, but it will be too late to solve housing struggles and wealth inequality, a report says. Those who have parents and grandparents in the ""baby boomer"" generation will be left record sums of wealth, the Resolution Foundation said. But they will have to wait - until, on average, the age of 61, it suggests. The think tank defines millennials as those currently aged 17 to 35. The Resolution Foundation said that inheritances were set to more than double over the next 20 years, and this will peak in 2035, as the generally high-wealth baby boomers progress through old age. Millennials 'lose wages race with Gen X' Where do 70% of millennials own a home? MPs given guide to millennials Have baby boomers stolen the family silver? Almost two-thirds of young adults have parents who own property, which they may get a share of in the future, the report said. By comparison, only 38% of adults born in the 1930s received an inheritance. The report also noted millennials were only half as likely to own their home at 30 as baby boomers were. Laura Gardiner, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""Older generations have benefitted hugely from the big increases in household wealth in Britain over recent decades. ""While the millennials have done far less well in accumulating their own assets, they are likely to benefit from an inheritance boom in the decades ahead. ""This is likely to be very welcome news for those millennials, including some from poorer backgrounds who in the past would have been unlikely to receive bequests. ""They have the good fortune to benefit from the luck of the baby boomer generation."" But she said inheritance was ""not the silver bullet"" that will get the generation on the housing ladder or address growing wealth gaps in society, as it was unlikely to come when they are trying to buy a family home. 25-year-old Rachel Hosie, a lifestyle writer for the Independent, says the proposed inheritance boom is not much comfort to her generation. ""We have student debts, we don't have guaranteed pensions, and we've had tricky financial times to have been entering the world of work. ""We were really told for a lot of my generation that if we were ambitious and worked hard then we'd get a good job after studying hard, then we'd earn money and be able to buy a house and settle down - and we'd have this life that we saw a lot of our parents have, and now we're struggling,"" she said. However, Cari Rosen - who's the editor ofGransnet, an online community for the over-50s,external- says the report misses out an important factor. ""Half of women and a third of men are going to have to pay for care at some point. And actually one in four people who pays for care runs out of money,"" she said. ""So we have said to our own millennial there might well be nothing left for you,"" she added. She said: ""Of course we want to give our children an inheritance, the thought that what we've worked really hard for doesn't go to our children to help them through their lives is a really terrible one - but we don't know and there is no way of preparing for that or insuring for that.""

"This video can not be played Video from the town of Dorud shows a crowd carrying what appears to be a wounded man Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned anti-government protesters they will face the nation's ""iron fist"" if political unrest continues. Three days of demonstrations over falling living standards have become the biggest show of dissent since huge pro-reform rallies in 2009. A Revolutionary Guards commander said the protests had degenerated into people chanting political slogans and burning public property. Two protesters died of gunshot wounds. The authorities in Dorud in western Iran said security forces did not open fire on demonstrators, and blamed the deaths instead on Sunni Muslim extremists and foreign powers. Correspondents say the reference to foreign intelligence agencies was intended to mean Saudi Arabia. Iran has imposed ""temporary"" restrictions on social networks Telegram and Instagram. The decision was taken ""to maintain tranquillity and security of society"", a source told state news agency IRIB. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov tweeted that the action was taken after his company refused to shut down channels on the messaging app used to organise peaceful protests. Allow Twitter content?

Protesters in the cities of Khoramabad, Zanjan and Ahvaz called for the removal or death of Iran's Supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps is a powerful force with ties to the country's supreme leader, and is dedicated to preserving the country's Islamic system. Brigadier-General Esmail Kowsari told the ISNA news agency: ""If people came into the streets over high prices, they should not have chanted those slogans and burned public property and cars."" Students were involved in a number of clashes Iran's interior minister has also warned the public that protesters will be held accountable. ""Those who damage public property, disrupt order and break the law must be responsible for their behaviour and pay the price,"" Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli said. ""The spreading of violence, fear and terror will definitely be confronted."" US warns Iran: The world is watching Iranians protest against high prices Who are the Basij militia?,external Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian There is widespread and seething discontent in Iran where repression is pervasive and economic hardship is getting worse - one BBC Persian investigation has found that on average Iranians have become 15% poorer in the past 10 years. Protests have remained confined to relatively small pockets of mostly young male demonstrators who are demanding the overthrow of the clerical regime. Protests have spread to even small towns throughout the country and have a potential to grow in size. But there is no obvious leadership. Opposition figures have long been silenced or sent into exile. Even in exile, there is no one opposition figure that commands a large following. Some protesters have been calling for the return of the monarchy and the former shah's son, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, has issued a statement supporting the demonstrations. But there are signs that he is as much in the dark about where these protests are going as anyone else. BBC Persian, which broadcasts on TV, on radio and online from London, is banned in Iran - where staff and their families routinely face harassment and questioning from the authorities. Protests began in the north-eastern city of Mashhad on Thursday and spread to other major cities on Friday. A small demonstration in Tehran grew to several thousand people on Saturday, and students clashed with police. The protests also became violent in several other towns. Among the recent events across Iran: In Abhar, demonstrators set fire to large banners bearing the picture of the supreme leader In Arak, protesters reportedly set fire to the local headquarters of the pro-government Basij militia In Mashhad, protesters burned police motorcycles in a confrontation caught on video The CEO of popular mobile messaging app Telegram said an Iranian account had been suspended,externalfor calling for attacks on police There are numerous reports of people losing internet access on their mobile phones Street protests have been reported in a number of other towns and cities, including Kermanshah, Shahrekord, Bandar Abbas, Izeh, Zanjan, Karaj, Tonekabon and Khorramabad There is also anger at Iran's interventions abroad. In Mashhad, some chanted ""not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran"", a reference to what protesters say is the administration's focus on foreign rather than domestic issues. Iran 'building permanent military base' in Syria Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals Iran is a key provider of military support to the government of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. It is also accused of providing arms to Houthi rebels fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which it denies, and is an ally of Lebanon's powerful Shia movement Hezbollah. The Iranian authorities are blaming anti-revolutionaries and agents of foreign powers for the outbreak. There were fires in Tehran as protests continued Also on Saturday, thousands of pro-government demonstrators turned out for pre-arranged rallies to mark the eighth anniversary of the suppression of the 2009 street protests. The US has led international support for the protesters. President Donald Trump tweeted,external: ""Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. The world is watching!"" Iran's foreign ministry called earlier comments from Mr Trump and other US officials ""opportunistic and deceitful"". Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) was set up shortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution to defend the country's Islamic system. It has since become a major force in the political, economic and military life of the country, with its own ground forces, navy and air force. It controls a volunteer militia of tens of thousands of people - the Basij Resistance Force. The IRGC sometimes works alongside police, and it was announced in December that it would do this again. Its stature says it will co-operate with law enforcement forces ""when necessary"" but there has been some controversy over its scope when dealing with civilians. Clashes erupt in western Iran town.

"Internet companies should face a tax punishment for failing to deal with the threat of terrorism in the UK, security minister Ben Wallace has said. Mr Wallace said firms such as Facebook, Google and YouTube were too slow to remove radical content online, forcing the government to act instead. While tech firms were ""ruthless profiteers"", governments were spending millions policing the web, he added. Facebook said Mr Wallace was wrong to say it put profits before safety. YouTube said violent extremism was a ""complex problem"" and addressing it was a ""critical challenge for us all"". Is pressure on tech giants having any effect? What can tech firms do to fight terror? May warns tech firms over terror content Terror online: Politicians v tech tycoons In an interview with the Sunday Times,external, Mr Wallace said tech giants were failing to help prevent the radicalisation of people online. ""Because content is not taken down as quickly as they could do,"" he claimed, ""we're having to de-radicalise people who have been radicalised. That's costing millions."" He said the refusal of messaging services - such as WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook - to give the security services access to message data was ""turning the internet into an anarchic violent space"". ""Because of encryption and because of radicalisation, the cost of that is heaped on law enforcement agencies,"" Mr Wallace told the newspaper. By Emma Vardy, BBC political correspondent This latest tax idea is a sign ministers are trying to explore all sorts of new ways to put pressure on tech firms. How strong a tool it might be is unclear. Tech giants' revenues are so high, a tax or effectively a fine, may not immediately change the measures they are already taking, although it could play well with the public. Google and Facebook have already stepped up their efforts to identify and take down extremist content, including using artificial intelligence to spot illegal content. But ministers want them to go further. Meanwhile smaller sites like Telegram and WordPress are a more difficult problem. They have done far less to tackle the use of their platforms by extremists. Firms based overseas are almost completely out of reach of any measures imposed by the UK government, and in reality when authorities try to engage with them, they don't get very far. Mr Wallace said ""the time for excuses is at an end"" and the government should look at ""all options"" of incentivising firms - ""including tax"". ""We should stop pretending that because they sit on beanbags in T-shirts they are not ruthless profiteers,"" he said. ""They will ruthlessly sell our details to loans and soft-porn companies but not give it to our democratically elected government."" In September Theresa May called for technology companies to take down terror content within two hours Simon Milner, policy director at Facebook, said Mr Wallace was wrong to say the company put profit before safety, especially in the fight against terrorism. He said millions of pounds had been invested in people and technology to identify and remove terrorist content. Home Secretary Amber Rudd and her European counterparts have welcomed coordinated efforts which were having a significant impact, he added. ""But this is an ongoing battle and we must continue to fight it together, indeed our CEO recently told our investors that in 2018 we will continue to put the safety of our community before profits."" Facebook recently announced that 99% of content relating to so-called Islamic State or al-Qaeda was taken down before users had flagged it up. A YouTube spokesperson told the BBC it was committed to being ""part of the solution"" and was doing more every day to tackle the problem. This year it had invested in machine-learning technology, recruited more reviewers of content and built partnerships with experts and collaborated with other companies, they added. Google has yet to respond to Mr Wallace's remarks. However, speaking in September, Kent Walker, general counsel for Google, said tech firms would not be able to ""do it alone"". ""We need people and we need feedback from trusted government sources and from our users to identify and remove some of the most problematic content out there."" Dr Shiraz Maher, from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at Kings College London, said: ""Mobilisation to terrorism still involves real life, real world contacts so governments can't solely blame tech companies. ""Also there is no easy fix, because what constitutes extremist material is subjective."" Automated take-down systems have in the past led to lots of ""useful"" content being removed by mistake, he added. ""Syrian activists documenting war crimes by the regime and Islamic State have had their videos pulled from YouTube. Those videos will be needed in the future to bring criminals to account in The Hague."" Is pressure on tech giants having any effect? Video, 00:06:35Is pressure on tech giants having any effect?

"George Papadopoulos allegedly shared his knowledge with a diplomat at an upscale London bar The investigation into possible connections between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign began after a tip-off from Australia, the New York Times reports. Trump adviser George Papadopoulos allegedly told Australia's top UK diplomat that Moscow had incriminating ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. The newspaper alleges the revelation came ""during a night of heavy drinking"" in London in May 2016. Australia later informed the FBI. The New York Times report claims that the exchange was the spark for establishing a secret investigation,externalinto possible connections between Russia and the Trump campaign in July 2016. The newspaper's story cites four anonymous American and Australian foreign officials ""with direct knowledge of the Australian's role"" as its source. The BBC has not independently verified the claims. Mr Papadopoulos has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBIabout meetings arranged while he was working with the Trump campaign. The FBI's original investigation has since been handed off to special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, with which Mr Papadopoulos is now cooperating. The White House has attempted to portray him as a ""low-level volunteer""with little influence within the campaign. However, Mr Papadopoulos is known to have attended several meetings with Mr Trump and other senior officials such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as well as meeting a British foreign office official and arranging high-level meetings. Three reasons why Papadopoulos is a key piece of the puzzle Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Mr Papadopoulos was told by a contact with Russian links that Moscow had ""dirt"" on Mr Trump's Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails"" in April 2016 - something revealed earlier this year. But the New York Times now reports that weeks later, in May, Mr Papadopoulos was speaking to Alexander Downer, Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, at an ""upscale London bar"" when he revealed the existence of the Russian information. It is not clear why Mr Papadopoulos chose to share his knowledge with Mr Downer, but the Times reports that the Australian diplomat passed the information to his government. Two months later, when copies of Mrs Clinton's emails began appearing online, the Australian government passed the information to the FBI. Once that happened, the newspaper said, ""the bureau opened an investigation that became one of its most closely guarded secrets"". ""Senior agents did not discuss it at the daily morning briefing, a classified setting where officials normally speak freely about highly sensitive operations."" The newspaper reports that corroborating intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and the Dutch, helped drive the investigation.

"This video can not be played Protesters take to streets venting anger against authorities The US says ""the world is watching"" how Iranian authorities respond to anti-government protests that have broken out in several cities. Thousands of people have joined the protests, with scores arrested. A White House statement said Iranians were fed up with ""the regime's corruption and its squandering of the nation's wealth to fund terrorism"". Meanwhile, authorities urged supporters to turn out for nationwide demonstrations on Saturday. The rallies are commemorating the 2009 demonstrations held in support of the then conservative government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Those demonstrations were in response to protests by reformists over a disputed election which returned him to power. The BBC's Persian Service says thousands of people were likely to have been bussed into a rally in the capital Tehran. ""The Iranian government should respect their people's rights, including their right to express themselves.

First Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri has suggested that government opponents are behind the protests, according to comments reported by state broadcaster IRIB. He said: ""Some incidents in the country these days are on the pretext of economic problems, but it seems there is something else behind them. They think by doing this they harm the government, but it will be others who ride the wave."" Footage posted on social media showed street protests in Kermanshah Earlier, Fars news agency reported that protesters in Kermanshah had destroyed some public property and were dispersed. The governor-general of Tehran said that any such gatherings would be firmly dealt with by the police, who are out in force on the main roads. Hassan Rouhani, the president who moved left Iranians urge Rouhani not to disappoint Officials in Mashhad said the protest was organised by ""counter-revolutionary elements"", and video online showed police using water cannon. The protests started in the north-eastern city of Mashhad- the country's second most-populous - on Thursday. People there took to the streets to express anger at the government over high prices, and vented their fury against President Hassan Rouhani. Fifty-two people were arrested for chanting ""harsh slogans"". The protests spread to other cities on Friday, with thousands turning out in Kermanshah, Rasht, Isfahan and Qom. In Tehran, social media footage showed a heavy police presence. President Hassan Rouhani is blamed by many for the poor state of the economy Some developed into broader demonstrations against the authorities, calling for the release of political prisoners and an end to police beatings. It was the biggest display of public dissent since huge pro-reform rallies in 2009. The protests were initially against economic conditions and corruption but appear to have turned political. Slogans have been chanted against not just Mr Rouhani but Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and clerical rule in general. Demonstrators were reportedly heard yelling slogans like ""The people are begging, the clerics act like God"". Protests have even been held in Qom, a holy city home to powerful clerics. There is also anger at Iran's interventions abroad. In Mashhad, some chanted ""not Gaza, not Lebanon, my life for Iran"", a reference to what protesters say is the administration's focus on foreign rather than domestic issues.

"The soldiers say they would not receive a fair trial in Turkey The Greek government says it has asked the country's judicial authorities to cancel a legal decision granting asylum to a Turkish helicopter pilot. He was one of eight servicemen who fled to Greece last year after a failed coup attempt in Turkey. Turkey has expressed its fury at the asylum decision, saying it would affect ties between the two countries. The foreign ministry in Ankara said Greece had once again showed that it protects and embraces coup plotters. A Greek asylum committee ruled that there was no evidence that the co-pilot who flew seven fellow servicemen to Greece the day after the failed coup was involved in the plot.

"George Papadopoulos allegedly shared his knowledge with a diplomat at an upscale London bar The investigation into possible connections between Russia and Donald Trump's presidential campaign began after a tip-off from Australia, the New York Times reports. Trump adviser George Papadopoulos allegedly told Australia's top UK diplomat that Moscow had incriminating ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton. The newspaper alleges the revelation came ""during a night of heavy drinking"" in London in May 2016. Australia later informed the FBI. The New York Times report claims that the exchange was the spark for establishing a secret investigation,externalinto possible connections between Russia and the Trump campaign in July 2016. The newspaper's story cites four anonymous American and Australian foreign officials ""with direct knowledge of the Australian's role"" as its source. The BBC has not independently verified the claims. Mr Papadopoulos has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBIabout meetings arranged while he was working with the Trump campaign. The FBI's original investigation has since been handed off to special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, with which Mr Papadopoulos is now cooperating. The White House has attempted to portray him as a ""low-level volunteer""with little influence within the campaign. However, Mr Papadopoulos is known to have attended several meetings with Mr Trump and other senior officials such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as well as meeting a British foreign office official and arranging high-level meetings. Three reasons why Papadopoulos is a key piece of the puzzle Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Mr Papadopoulos was told by a contact with Russian links that Moscow had ""dirt"" on Mr Trump's Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in the form of ""thousands of emails"" in April 2016 - something revealed earlier this year. But the New York Times now reports that weeks later, in May, Mr Papadopoulos was speaking to Alexander Downer, Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, at an ""upscale London bar"" when he revealed the existence of the Russian information. It is not clear why Mr Papadopoulos chose to share his knowledge with Mr Downer, but the Times reports that the Australian diplomat passed the information to his government. Two months later, when copies of Mrs Clinton's emails began appearing online, the Australian government passed the information to the FBI. Once that happened, the newspaper said, ""the bureau opened an investigation that became one of its most closely guarded secrets"". ""Senior agents did not discuss it at the daily morning briefing, a classified setting where officials normally speak freely about highly sensitive operations."" The newspaper reports that corroborating intelligence from other friendly governments, including the British and the Dutch, helped drive the investigation.
