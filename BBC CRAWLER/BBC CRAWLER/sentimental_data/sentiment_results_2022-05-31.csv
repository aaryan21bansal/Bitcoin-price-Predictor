"Horizon Europe is the EU's key funding programme for research and innovation Universities have called for an urgent resolution to a row about UK access to a major EU research programme. Universities UK, which represents 140 institutions, fears ministers could be about to abandon the Horizon scheme. In a letter to the European Commission, seen by the BBC, it describes the situation as ""close to the precipice."" The EU has indicated UK participation is tied to the row about post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. Horizon Europe is the EU's key funding programme for research and innovation, with a current budget of â¬95.5bn (Â£81.2bn). The UK's associate membership was agreed in principle under the 2020 Trade and Co-operation Agreement, but ministers have been drawing up alternatives after complaining access was being blocked by Brussels. The EU's ambassador to London, JoÃ£o Vale de Almeida, has described Horizon access as ""collateral damage"" in the impasse over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which governs post-Brexit trading rules for Northern Ireland. He reportedly said that the ""lack of trust"" was having ""a negative impact in other areas"". QUB research funds 'at risk' due to EU-UK row Europe spat will weaken research - science leaders A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Tensions between the EU and UK have escalated since Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said a new law would be introduced to potentially scrap parts of the protocol unilaterally. The EU accepts the post-Brexit treaty, which Boris Johnson's government signed up to, is causing disruption for Northern Ireland but wants changes within the existing agreement. In its letter to European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic, Universities UK says that scientific collaboration should not be compromised by ""unrelated political disputes"". It warns that many of its members have reported researchers being ""forced"" to leave projects. And that the delay is being ""keenly felt"" by both EU and UK institutions, with the situation ""deteriorating every day that the uncertainty drags on"". ""Failure to secure UK association to Horizon Europe would be a lose-lose for health, wealth and wellbeing and would do a disservice to future generations in Europe and beyond,"" the letter adds. Universities UK believes a decision by ministers to abandon association could come within weeks in what it anticipates would be an irreversible move. The UK minister for science, research and innovation, George Freeman, has saidmembership remains the priority,externalbut a plan B is being kept on standby. Scientists and academics have for months raised the alarm that delays in access are creating problems because funding cannot be released to UK collaborators without a formal agreement. And they have expressed concerns that EU researchers will not include UK scientists in their projects. In March the UK government extended a funding guarantee for successful Horizon Europe applicants, until the end of the 2022. Liz Truss has raised UK government concerns over the Northern Ireland Protocol Last year, Cancer Research UK told the BBC that exclusion from Horizon Europe would be a""significant blow"" in efforts to combat cancer.Sir Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust described Horizon as ""the world's biggest international science funding programme"". That programme brings together researchers from industry and academia, with projects ranging from fundamental research to tackling issues such as combating climate change and efforts to find treatments for debilitating diseases. Universities UK's letter, signed by Prof Paul Boyle of Swansea University, requests a meeting between Mr Sefcovic and UK vice-chancellors. A UK government spokesperson said: ""It's hugely disappointing the EU continues to politicise scientific co-operation by delaying our accession to Horizon. ""If the UK is unable to associate soon, and in good time to make full use of the opportunities they offer, we will introduce a comprehensive alternative to promote global science, research and innovation collaboration."" The European Commission said it looked forward to a ""prompt resolution"" and that it recognised ""the mutual benefit in cooperation in science, research and innovation, nuclear research and space"". But it added the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement did not provide for a specific obligation to associate the UK ""at this point in time, nor for a precise deadline to do so"".

"Learners say they have paid more than Â£200 for a test - more than twice the standard fee Driving tests are being bulk booked and resold for profit, as a chronic backlog means learners are otherwise waiting months for a test date. Learner drivers say they have paid more than Â£200 for a practical test - more than twice the standard fee. One operator said it used automated software to book tests, and the BBC has seen evidence encouraging driving instructors to sell tests for profit. The DVSA urged applicants to only book tests via its official website. The demand for driving tests, caused by the pandemic, means in many places - including London, Birmingham and Cardiff - tests aren't available to book online for up to six months. At other centres, the earliest availability is September or October. It has seen many learners turn towards a secondary market. Some are paying a nominal fee to companies which find them cancelled tests. Others are buying from sellers which offer tests for vastly inflated prices. Amelia, not her real name, told the BBC she had paid Â£210 for a cancelled test through her instructor in London. The standard fee is Â£62 for a weekday test and Â£75 for one in an evening, at the weekend or over a bank holiday, if booked through the Driving Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). The DVSA is the official body that carries out driving tests in Great Britain. ""It was very on-the-go,"" 23-year-old Amelia said. ""My driving instructor would call me and say, 'quick, there's a cancellation, do you want it?' The day we booked my test it all happened within a three or four-minute phone call."" She said she'd had to reply with a picture of her provisional licence number, after which she received a reference number allowing her to change the test booking with her own details. Another driver said her instructor had paid Â£235 for her test. A third paid Â£186 - although Â£54 of this was for the car hire and Â£62 for the standard test fee. Some learners face 10-month wait for driving tests Driving tests resume but learners fight for slots 'I can't get a driving test until next year' The BBC has looked into how this is possible. One operator claimed to be using ""AI-powered software"" to scoop up vacant test slots as soon as they became available on the DVSA website. They said they used software that constantly refreshes the agency's booking website, together with VPNs, or virtual private networks, to hide their computer's identity, meaning it avoided being banned. They sent an email - seen by the BBC - to driving instructors, encouraging them to use their service to profit from pupils. An email sent to driving instructors encouraging them to profit from their pupils When we contacted them, they said: ""This softwareâ¦ [is] like if you're pressing on the search button. It just automates your press, or clicks, on the button."" We also found multiple posts on Facebook Marketplace and within some Facebook groups, offering a variety of test times for sale. Behind such posts are people like Alex, who runs a ""short-notice driving exam business"". He posted an advert on Facebook claiming he ""can guarantee exam bookings within three weeks"". The advert said approved driving instructors who work with him ""make upwards of Â£400-Â£600 a week"" by reselling exams to pupils. When contacted, Alex would not reveal how his business booked tests. But the BBC found one way of booking a slot and then transferring it - or potentially selling it - to someone else. An advert on Facebook, which claims instructors can make over Â£400 by reselling tests (ADIs stands for 'approved driving instructors') Learners only have access to the main DVSA booking system, where they have to manually search for available test dates. They can only book one test per person. And if they want to change their test date, they have to find an alternative one manually. However, we registered on the DVSA's site as a fake driving school, giving us access to a different part of the booking system - one that is not available to most learners. The system is intended to allow driving schools to book tests for multiple pupils - using a single contact number and email address. But the BBC found there was little verification to check who was signing up. It took us five minutes to register, with no requirement for official documentation. After receiving a simple verification code by email, we were given access. Once inside we were able to set alerts for when tests became available and could book multiple tests on the account. And while each booking still required a different provisional licence number, the system allowed exams to be swapped between candidates. In effect, anyone with instructors' access, could purchase a test - either one in the distant future, or a cancellation - and then sell it on at a premium by swapping appointments. We also found it was possible to book tests without the provisional licence holder ever knowing. To test the system, we booked a practical driving test, using a BBC email address and the provisional licence number of a learner, who had given us their permission. There was no verification required on the learner drivers' part and the booking confirmation was sent to our email address - meaning the learner would not know about the booking. When challenged on whether the booking system was robust enough, the DVSA said the system was ""imperfect"" as it ""relies on trust"". It said it was only illegal to book a driving test using someone else's details without their consent. Charles Moffat, chairman of the Approved Driving Instructors' National Joint Council, the UK's leading driver instructor association, said the organisation had heard accounts of tests being resold for a profit. ""We abhor such practice and will always report such conduct to the DVSA,"" he added. The DVSA said it would continue to do all it could to provide as many tests as possible, including conducting out-of-hours testing and recruiting more examiners. DVSA chief executive Loveday Ryder said in a statement to the BBC: ""We've already put in place measures to monitor and prevent bots from accessing our systems while also strengthening our firewall to tackle the issue. ""We will continue to work tirelessly to crack down on companies that are exploiting learner drivers. ""We've closed the system to new registrations and will rapidly close down accounts that do not belong to driving instructors and driving schools. We'll also be taking further steps to make sure all future accounts are linked to driving instructors  and those with training businesses.""

"A woman in Cardiff is ""furious"" her father's care home is charging Â£18 an hour to take him to hospital appointments Care home providers have been criticised for charging top up fees to residents for taking them to medical appointments. The Older People's Commissioner Helena Herklots said providers should be open and honest about extra fees and social care should be made free. Sue Simms, whose dad is in a care home, said: ""It feels mean and underhanded."" The Welsh government said care homes were legally required to set out any extra charges. Ms Simms, from Cardiff, cares for her father 78-year-old Peter Faint. Mr Faint, who was a research and development scientist, requires full-time nursing care as he has Parkinson's Disease, vascular dementia and multiple sclerosis. Staff shortage 'putting more people in care homes' Care home owner trying to keep 'head above water' Ms Simms, a nurse, said she was ""astonished and furious"" when his care home told her she would have to start paying Â£18 an hour for every hospital appointment that she could not take her father to. ""I know from my background in A&E that if dad needed an ambulance, you could have a number of hours outside hospital, then 10 or 12 hours inside with an overnight wait for transport home. ""You could come away with a bill of hundreds of pounds,"" she said. Sue Simms says she fears people who do not have family support could face bills they cannot afford Ms Simms said she always tried to take her father to appointments but she worried about other people who may not be able to do the same for their relatives. ""We all think that everybody's got somebody but there are a lot of people who don't have anyone,"" she said. ""A lot of people don't have children and only an elderly spouse at home. A lot of people can't afford it. It feels mean and underhanded."" Ms Simms, who is an only child, has reduced her working hours in order to care for both her mother and father. She said she had no idea about the top-up fees when her father moved into the home more than six months ago. ""It's another unnecessary pressure. Am I going to get a call saying my dad has an appointment and I have to juggle work? It's a pressure on my mum too and she's not well,"" she said. A spokesperson for the home where her dad lives, said: ""We do charge an escort fee for hospital appointments as standard at our home. ""We ask for the fee because when a carer is needed to accompany a resident, it means they are away from the home and the other residents under their care. In some cases, we will need to ensure an extra team member is on shift to cover their duties. ""In Sue's case, we apologise that the escort fees were not communicated to her and her family."" The care home added these fees were paused during the height of the pandemic and when charges restarted this should have been clearly communicated to everyone. The Older People's Commissioner for Wales, Helena Herklots, said that it was not always clear how much extra people might have to pay. She added that some of the examples they had heard were ""extraordinary"". Helena Herklots, the Older People's commissioner, says the Welsh Government should make social care free as soon as possible ""We've heard of one example where someone was being charged to get access to go into the garden. That's at the extreme end,"" she said. She said the worry about extra costs was causing families and older people ""a lot of stress"". ""It's affecting their mental health, it's making them anxious and worried because they're not sure they can afford these additional costs,"" she added. She has called on the Welsh government to reform social care funding to make it free at the point of need as soon as possible. The Welsh government said it was committed to creating a National Care Service. Chief executive of Care Forum Wales, Mary Wimbury, explained that the financial situation for care homes was ""really challenging"". She said that care home fees were not increasing in line with increased costs of food, heating and staffing. ""We've got to have an honest conversation across Wales about how much care costs, how much we're prepared to pay, what we want in terms of standards, in terms of things like staff ratios,"" said Ms Wimbury. She added that accompanying someone for a long hospital visit meant backfill staff would be needed in the home which would cost providers. Care Forum Wales, which represents care homes in Wales, says they are struggling with increased costs ""There's either got to be an additional charge or it's got to be part of the general fee,"" she added. The Welsh government said it expected care home providers to be clear and upfront about the fees they charge. ""They are required by law to set out this information in their written guide for the service as well as an individual's service agreement,"" it said. ""Creating a National Care Service, that is free at the point of need, is a commitment in the Co-operation Agreement between the Welsh Government and Plaid Cymru and we will be setting up an expert group to support this shared ambition."" The Welsh Local Government Association, which represents councils, said social care services needed ""significant and sustainable"" long term investments to make permanent improvements. ""The current cost of living crisis will only further exacerbate some of the current pressures, with social care facing a funding gap for current services, increasing each year due to inflation and other costs. ""This is without considering the immediate need to address unmet and under met need on these overburdened systems. ""Without adequate funding, some councils will face a battle to balance budgets, worsening existing pressures and running the serious risk of impacts on the ability to deliver timely and quality care to those who draw on it.""

"A shortage of GPs has left some areas of England having to cope with half the number of doctors than other areas, an analysis for the BBC has found. TheNuffield Trust data,externalshowed Portsmouth, Brighton, parts of Essex and Hull had the fewest GPs, with fewer than 50 GPs per 100,000 patients. That is the equivalent of more than 2,000 patients for every GP. It comes as patient groups warned access to doctors was becoming one of the biggest problems for the NHS. Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust, said: ""In an NHS founded on the principle of equal treatment, such stark differences represent a serious failing."" The two-fold variation in GPs holds even when the age and health of the local population is taken into account to factor in how often patients are likely to need a GP, the analysis showed. Yolanda Barker has multiple sclerosis. It means she needs more regular GP appointments than most. But she is finding it increasingly difficult to get the help she needs from her local practice in Kent. Yolanda, 50, says she can spend ""days on end"" trying to get through. ""They have an hour in the morning from 8am to 9am when you can make online appointments. If you miss that you have to resort to the phone. I've spent 40 or 50 minutes on hold trying to get through. Sometimes you can't - or you give up. ""I've resorted to looking at the internet to try to self-manage my problems. I've been suffering quite a lot of pain recently and have irritable bowel syndrome. ""But there are other things you need that I can't do myself - it could be that I need a change of medication or physio. ""It is great when you do get a face-to-face appointment, but even then it feels so rushed. It is like a conveyor belt."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England said a quarter of the complaints it handles from patients now relate to GP services. National Director Louise Ansari said: ""People are telling us about difficulties getting through to their local practice, with online booking systems, long waits on the phone and a lack of face-to-face appointments providing them with challenges. ""The lack of easy access puts people's health and wellbeing at risk, and increases demand on overstretched hospitals."" The sentiments were echoed by GPs working in the areas with the fewest doctors. Hull GP Dr Matthew Fortnam said: ""You have the perfect storm where we have the most need but the least capacity to deal with it. It creates inequity and actually perpetuates it."" The Royal College of GPs said there was a shortage of GPs, with increasing numbers walking away from the profession by retiring early or reducing their hours - less than two-thirds of the workforce now work full-time. The trend is undermining the government's efforts to recruit 6,000 extra GPs in England during this parliament, college president Dr Martin Marshall said. Latest data shows the number of qualified GPs has actually fallen slightly in recent years. While this data relates to England, similar pressures are being seen in the rest of the UK. Dr Marshall told the BBC the result was that workloads were growing, and the job was becoming ""undoable"". ""GPs can be seeing up to 50 patients a day. That's potentially unsafe. It's depressing - we know patients are not getting the service they want. The job is no longer enjoyable."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the government was ""working hard to support and grow the workforce"". She pointed out the number of trainee doctors was increasing, while other staff - such as practice nurses, physios and pharmacists - were also being invested in, to work alongside GPs.

"This video can not be played Watch: Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown The Chinese city of Shanghai, the country's economic centre and a global trade hub, has eased Covid curbs after a two-month lockdown. At midnight local time (16:00 GMT Tuesday), restrictions were relaxed to allow most people to move freely around the city of some 25 million people. But at least 650,000 residents will remain confined to their homes. China's overall policy of ""zero Covid"" remains in place and people catching Covid face quarantine or hospital. Their close contacts also face the prospect of removal to quarantine and the area immediately around where they live being locked down again. ""This is a day that we dreamed of for a very long time,"" Shanghai government spokeswoman Yin Xin told reporters. ""Everyone has sacrificed a lot. This day has been hard-won and we need to cherish and protect it, and welcome back the Shanghai we are familiar with and missed."" But new rules have been introduced, with residents required to show a green health code on their smartphone to leave their residential compounds and to enter most places. Those who want to use public transport or enter banks or malls must have a negative PCR test certificate valid in the last 72 hours. And restrictions on leaving Shanghai remain, with anyone travelling to another city facing quarantine of seven to 14 days upon their return. Cinemas, museums and gyms remain closed. Most children will also not return to face-to-face schooling. People travel on a subway in the Jing'an district of Shanghai on the first day after restrictions eased But the rules did little to temper the relief people felt. Cheers and sounds of jubilation rose as the clock struck midnight on Tuesday, signalling the end of the lockdown. Groups of Shanghai residents gathered on street corners, singing and toasting with drinks as they welcomed their newfound freedom. ""We were locked down too many days. We need to celebrate. Not just me - all the Shanghai people here,"" one resident told the BBC. ""All the bad things [have] gone past, so tomorrow will be fine."" ""We are free. I am so happy, I want to work. I want to work tomorrow,"" said another. Chinese state media however downplayed the news of people celebrating because authorities had so far been reluctant to define the restrictions as a ""lockdown"". State media reports instead described Wednesday as ""a new start"" and the day of ""getting back to normal life, work and production"". Most of Shanghai's 25 million residents are now free to leave their homes Cautious signs of life appeared to be returning to the city as a basic service resumed on public transport, and shops opened, with larger ones operating at 75% capacity. Men in buttoned down shirts walked into flashy office towers - but not in the same numbers as before the outbreak, with many firms enforcing a staggered return to work. Joggers, cyclists, skaters and dog walkers defied the muggy heat to take over riverfront parks for a much-awaited breath of fresh air. It was supposed to last just nine days -a staggered lockdown to lessen the impact on Shanghai's economy, state media said. It lasted 65 days. It crippled the city and scarred its people. Restrictions are now being eased as quickly as they were imposed. There's no gradual process over several weeks. Instead there's a big bang - one day when most of the emergency rules and regulations are simply being lifted. The relief is immense - for generations of some families who've lived together behind a locked front door for more than two months; for workers who've lived in tents inside factories where they've carried on working; for the shop and restaurant owners whose livelihood ground to a halt; for the thousands of people forced to leave their homes and sent to quarantine centres. And for the almost 25 million people who live here. Read more here:Relief and caution as Shanghai returns to life The lockdown has seen many residents lose their incomes, struggle to find enough food and cope mentally with prolonged isolation. Manufacturers including Western car makers Volkswagen and Tesla have been particularly impactedby the restrictions as staff were kept away from factories or had to work in ""closed loop"" conditions, where they lived at the plants. The rigidity of the restrictions also caused much frustration in the city. ""Shanghai is such a good placeâ¦ but with all production, all business paused for two months?"" a woman in her 50s from Shanghai told the BBC. ""I hope these will all be resumed soon. I want my prosperous Shanghai city back."" That might take longer as the city reopens cautiously. Speakers were blaring outside an upscale mall, reminding people to wear masks and informing that their temperature would be checked and their health code inspected before they could enter. Only half the shops would open, the manager told the BBC, since some staff were still in quarantine. He said he was not too worried about another outbreak. ""We follow [the] government's rules, we do one major cleaning each day,"" he added. ""We do everything we can."" Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown.

"The megalodon roamed the oceans from about 22 million years to three million years ago A prehistoric food fight may have spelled the end for the megalodon, the largest shark that ever lived. A study of the ocean giant's fossil teeth suggests it had to compete for food with another ferocious predator, the great white shark. The battle for diminishing stocks of whales and other prey may have pushed the megalodon to extinction three million years ago. Environmental pressures, such as sea level changes, also played a role. The extinction of the megalodon has been an enduring mystery. Many different factors have been proposed, from habitat loss due to changes in sea level to reduction of prey. Six-year-old boy finds giant megalodon shark tooth How big was the Megalodon giant shark - really? What did the mysterious Megalodon ACTUALLY look like? Megalodon (left) and great white shark tooth (right) In the latest study, international researchers used zinc isotopes in the teeth of living and extinct sharks as a tool to understand the diet of long-dead animals. Chemical clues in the teeth of living sharks and 13 fossil megalodon teeth suggest the great white shark and the megalodon once had similar positions in the food web and may have competed for the same food, including whales, dolphins and porpoises. This may have been a factor in the demise of the megalodon alongside climate change and other environmental pressures, the scientists said. ""This is a piece in the puzzle of evidence that there was competition between the modern great white and the megalodon on aquatic food resources in the oceans at the time when both were still alive,"" said Prof Thomas Tutken of Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, who led the study. Great white sharks are decreasing in numbers Commenting on the research, published in Nature Communications, Catalina Pimiento of Swansea University said more work was needed to solve the mystery of what happened to the megalodon. The extinction has been studied from many different angles over the last decade, she said, with studies suggesting multiple factors. ""The mystery of what did megalodon eat and the extent to which it competed with other sharks remains,""  she said. The megalodon (Otodus megalodon) was a megatooth shark, which roamed the oceans from about 22 million years ago until about three million years ago. Its name means ""big tooth"". Three times bigger than the great white shark, the megalodon could grow up to 18m (60ft) in length and weigh up to 60 tonnes. The megalodon hit the news recently when a six-year-old boy found a shark tooth belonging to a giant prehistoric megalodon in Suffolk. Sammy Shelton found the 10cm-long (4in) tooth on Bawdsey beach during a bank holiday break. Follow Helen @hbriggs.

"Debi delivers to those who cannot currently afford to feed their animals. A man who is struggling with the cost of living crisis has said: ""I feed my dog before I feed myself."" Steve Roberts said when it comes to eating, his 13-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier Snoop ""takes priority"". He is a user of Pet Food Bank Service, a south Wales charity that said it had seen a 700% increase in hits on its website last month. Founder Debi Emmett said: ""At the moment people are feeding their pets rice."" Steve said the pet foodbank was important to him and Snoop. ""Trying to feed the both of us is hard,"" he said. ""I have gone without in order to feed him first, it takes priority. ""He can't go and get food himself he can't ask for food."" Pet food bank set up to help feed animals Food bank aid highlights pet poverty Why people are setting up pet food banks Debi started delivering food for needy pet owners four years ago when the 'heating or eating' fuel poverty situation was beginning to affect more people across the country. She said demand has escalated dramatically from January onwards. ""We've had a massive rise in demand in pet food... from hundreds of meals to thousands of meals,"" she said. ""Last month, hits to our website went up by 700%, that's people looking for help with pet food. ""We're getting calls from all over Wales and in England as well... asking us to send them food, asking for vouchers for things like that."" Debi Emmett and her Frenchie Ruby delivering pet food parcels by van Debi, who is based in Cardiff, has set up a number of donation points across the city, in supermarkets or doggie day care centres and vets' surgeries, where people can leave a bag of dog or cat food, or any treats. She collects the food in her van, sorts the wet and dry mixtures at home, stores it, and then delivers it to the 12 food banks, or outlets, across south Wales - from Newport to Swansea. Debi delivers to those who cannot currently afford to feed their animals. She does the charity work on her own as well as being a full-time carer for her mum. She said she needs more support, space and money to help those that need it most. ""I'm struggling to get everything done on my own at the moment, so we're looking to raise funds for a warehouse so that we can have volunteers in to help out that way,"" she said. ""I have people ready to offer to volunteer but because the Pet Food Bank service is based at my house I can't have people running around in the front and back garden."" Hers is the only pet foodbank in a 50-mile radius. ""I cover the whole of south Wales, there are a few others in Wales, but we pop up first on Google so everyone comes to us to ask if there's one in their area."" People can also collect donations from a number of locations One food outlet she delivers to is the Llanrumney hall community trust, in Cardiff.

"Money was made available to deal with the backlog, but the NHS was not able to spend it all It may take seven years to get NHS Wales waiting lists of 700,000 back to 2020 levels, Wales' auditor general has said. Thenumber of patients waiting for non-urgent treatment has risen sharplysince February 2020, prior to the Covid pandemic. They include Michael Assender, 74, with severe back pain, one of 70,400 who've spent two years on a waiting list. The Welsh government said it had a plan to deal with backlogs. But Wales' Auditor General Adrian Crompton said: ""Just as the NHS rose to the challenge of the pandemic, it will need to rise to the challenge of tackling a waiting list which has grown to huge proportions. NHS waiting times in Wales hit record high again Patient spent four nights in A&E waiting for a bed ""Concerted action is going to be needed on many different fronts, and some long-standing challenges will need to be overcome."" After struggling with his back, Mr Assender, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, paid Â£1,500 for a private scan, which revealed he had two slipped discs. ""At the moment I'm coping pretty well, taking pills for the pain and trying to stay active,"" he said. ""But something that took me half hour before now takes an hour."" Mr Assender said he knew others waiting for surgery who had become depressed and considered taking their lives, adding: ""A lot of people out there are in a constant pain and I do pity them. ""It's a dire situation really."" The pandemic has exacerbated problems with waiting times in the Welsh NHS According to Mr Crompton's report, more than half those waiting may not even know what they are suffering from because they still have not had their first outpatient appointment. That means their care cannot be effectively prioritised. Mr Crompton called on Welsh Labour ministers to set ""ambitious delivery targets"", make long-term capital investments in NHS infrastructure, create a ""workforce plan"" and manage ""clinical risks and support for those waiting"". The report also included aweb tool,externalwhich allows people to compare waits for different health boards. It showed 701,418 patients waiting for treatment in total, and by March, 380,289 had been on a list for up to 26 weeks, and 168,502 for more than a year. Latest figures also show more than 70,400 waiting more than two years for treatment. Statisticians advise these are ""patient pathways"" and each patient may be on several lists, meaning the actual number of patients affected could be smaller. The report also lists a further 550,000 ""potentially missing"" referrals - higher than the Welsh government's own estimates of half a million - that could find their way back into the system. To tackle the backlog, the Welsh government made an extra Â£200m available to be spent by the end of the 2021/22 financial year, but the Welsh NHS only asked for Â£146m. Of this, Â£12.8m was returned to the Welsh government, as the health service did not have the staff or space to spend it within the timeframe. The Welsh government said: ""Working with health boards, we have set ambitious but realistic targets to tackle the pandemic backlog for planned care. ""This is backed by significant extra long-term funding. ""Our recovery plan, published last month, already sets out our plans to address the five recommendations of this report, including how we will support patients while they wait and create a sustainable workforce with effective leadership."" Health Minister Eluned Morgan toldBBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programmeshe expects to see waiting times decrease. ""We have shown how we want to employ an additional 12,000 people and spend an extra billion pounds,"" she said. ""We are, therefore, confident that we will go in the right direction and will be able to stick to the plan - which is to bring those figures down by the end of this parliament."" Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ""One-off, ring fenced injections of cash that are time limited do not allow the NHS to make necessary long-term investments in staff and capital required to meet the needs of the people of Wales."" He added the workforce is the ""number one limiting factor for NHS capacity"" and recruiting staff was a ""huge focus"". ""It makes for sobering reading and makes clear the enormity of the challenge ahead,"" Mr Hughes toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastwith Claire Summers. ""These are not just numbers, these are individual people's lives."" Surgeons are struggling to deal with growing waiting lists Vice president for Wales of the Royal College of Physicians Dr Olwen Williams said the workforce is a ""key limiting factor"", adding: ""If you can't recruit into the workforce, you can't spend the money."" Welsh Conservatives health spokesman, Russell George, said he hoped the report would be a wake-up call for the government. ""Labour need to get a grip on the NHS and stop breaking all the wrong records,"" he added. Rhun ap Iorwerth MS, Plaid Cymru's health spokesperson, said: ""To see that funds were unspent proves how unsustainable and under-staffed our NHS desperately is."" He added that the NHS ""needs to put on a more sustainable footing and we need a more comprehensive plan that addresses all stages of a patient's journey through the system"".

"A shortage of GPs has left some areas of England having to cope with half the number of doctors than other areas, an analysis for the BBC has found. TheNuffield Trust data,externalshowed Portsmouth, Brighton, parts of Essex and Hull had the fewest GPs, with fewer than 50 GPs per 100,000 patients. That is the equivalent of more than 2,000 patients for every GP. It comes as patient groups warned access to doctors was becoming one of the biggest problems for the NHS. Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust, said: ""In an NHS founded on the principle of equal treatment, such stark differences represent a serious failing."" The two-fold variation in GPs holds even when the age and health of the local population is taken into account to factor in how often patients are likely to need a GP, the analysis showed. Yolanda Barker has multiple sclerosis. It means she needs more regular GP appointments than most. But she is finding it increasingly difficult to get the help she needs from her local practice in Kent. Yolanda, 50, says she can spend ""days on end"" trying to get through. ""They have an hour in the morning from 8am to 9am when you can make online appointments. If you miss that you have to resort to the phone. I've spent 40 or 50 minutes on hold trying to get through. Sometimes you can't - or you give up. ""I've resorted to looking at the internet to try to self-manage my problems. I've been suffering quite a lot of pain recently and have irritable bowel syndrome. ""But there are other things you need that I can't do myself - it could be that I need a change of medication or physio. ""It is great when you do get a face-to-face appointment, but even then it feels so rushed. It is like a conveyor belt."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England said a quarter of the complaints it handles from patients now relate to GP services. National Director Louise Ansari said: ""People are telling us about difficulties getting through to their local practice, with online booking systems, long waits on the phone and a lack of face-to-face appointments providing them with challenges. ""The lack of easy access puts people's health and wellbeing at risk, and increases demand on overstretched hospitals."" The sentiments were echoed by GPs working in the areas with the fewest doctors. Hull GP Dr Matthew Fortnam said: ""You have the perfect storm where we have the most need but the least capacity to deal with it. It creates inequity and actually perpetuates it."" The Royal College of GPs said there was a shortage of GPs, with increasing numbers walking away from the profession by retiring early or reducing their hours - less than two-thirds of the workforce now work full-time. The trend is undermining the government's efforts to recruit 6,000 extra GPs in England during this parliament, college president Dr Martin Marshall said. Latest data shows the number of qualified GPs has actually fallen slightly in recent years. While this data relates to England, similar pressures are being seen in the rest of the UK. Dr Marshall told the BBC the result was that workloads were growing, and the job was becoming ""undoable"". ""GPs can be seeing up to 50 patients a day. That's potentially unsafe. It's depressing - we know patients are not getting the service they want. The job is no longer enjoyable."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the government was ""working hard to support and grow the workforce"". She pointed out the number of trainee doctors was increasing, while other staff - such as practice nurses, physios and pharmacists - were also being invested in, to work alongside GPs.

"Michael Sussman had been charged with lying to the FBI. A lawyer with ties to the US Democratic party has been cleared of lying to the FBI during the frenzied final days of the 2016 presidential campaign. Michael Sussman, 58, had been charged with lying to investigators and concealing his ties to Hillary Clinton's campaign. At the time, Mr Sussman was looking into possible links between Russian officials and the Trump campaign. The FBI looked into the allegations and found nothing suspicious. A former federal prosecutor, Mr Sussman had been charged by special counsel John Durham, a US government attorney appointed by then-President Donald Trump's justice department in 2019 to investigate potential illegalities in the government's handling of investigations into Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. In the first case the Durham team brought to trial, prosecutors told a jury in a District of Columbia federal court that Mr Sussman had concealed his ties to Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign when presenting information to the FBI about what he said were suspicious data transfers - possibly covert communications - between computer servers in Mr Trump's New York business headquarters and Alfa Bank, one of Russia's largest private financial companies. Prosecutors alleged Mr Sussman did so because he knew the FBI would be less likely to investigate if the information came from a partisan source. They also said that Mr Sussman had warned the FBI that a major media outlet (later revealed to be the New York Times) was preparing to report on the matter and that the FBI should investigate before the link became public - without revealing that he was also the source of the information for the Times. They framed this as part of a larger effort by the Clinton campaign to trigger an FBI investigation that could then be cited as evidence of a nefarious relationship between Mr Trump and Russia just weeks before voters headed to the polls. The jurors, however, were apparently swayed by Mr Sussman's lawyers, who argued that the prosecutors were building a vast conspiracy theory around a 30-minute meeting with FBI General Counsel James Baker. The defence team also said that research into political opponents shared with the media and government investigators is a common practice and that Mr Sussman's Democratic ties were public knowledge. To win their case, prosecutors had to prove that Mr Sussman lied and that his lies were relevant to the investigation the FBI launched into the matter. During the trial Mr Baker testified that he would have viewed the information differently if he had known of Mr Sussman's Democratic connections. In court, he offered sometimes contradictory recollections of his meeting with the lawyer during which there were no recorded notes and frequently testified that he could not recall certain details of the conversation. The FBI ultimately decided to investigate Mr Sussman's Alfa Bank claims, but concluded in early 2017 that there was no evidence of illegality. President Trump has long maintained that the Mueller inquiry was biased against him After the verdict was announced, Mr Sussman told reporters outside the court that the jury recognised he had not lied to the FBI. ""Despite being falsely accused,"" he said, ""I am relieved that justice ultimately prevailed in this case."" Mr Durham's office released a statement saying prosecutors were ""disappointed in the outcome of the case"", but that they respected the jury's decision. The Durham investigation has been spotlighted by Mr Trump and his supporters as being pivotal to proving that the investigations into possible ties between Mr Trump and Russia - including Robert Mueller's 2017 special counsel inquiry - were part of a biased and unfounded scheme to derail his 2016 campaign and damage his presidency. They hoped the Sussman prosecution would be the first case in a series of prosecutions that would reach deep into the Clinton campaign. In an interview with Fox News in February, Mr Trump said Mr Durham was exposing ""treason at the highest level"". ""Durham is also coming up with things far bigger than anybody thought possible,"" he said of the case against Mr Sussman. ""Nobody ever thought a thing like this would be even discussed, let alone an act like this committed."" Mr Mueller's probe ended in 2019 with no finding of a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign, although it documented multiple contacts between Russians and members of the Trump team, as well as extensive attempts by the Russian government to undermine Mrs Clinton's Democratic campaign. The Mueller report did not include any discussion of the Alfa Bank data allegations. In addition to his case against Mr Sussman, the Durham investigation reached a plea agreement with former FBI lawyer Kevin Clinsemith, who admitted to altering an email used to obtain a secret FBI surveillance warrant for former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page. The special counsel office has also brought charges against Igor Danchenko, a Russian national living in the US, for lying to the FBI about where he obtained information used in a ""dossier"" of unsubstantiated allegations about Mr Trump produced by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele. That case is set to go to trial in October.

"Kate Forbes said public services in Scotland would have to become more efficient, with the country facing a budget squeeze Scotland must rethink how it delivers its public services in the wake of Covid and Brexit, the finance secretary has said. Kate Forbes said the public sector had grown for years but now needed to ""reset"" and become more efficient. She was speaking as she outlined the government's spending plans for the next five years. The spending review suggested there would be real-terms cuts in several areas of the public sector. These included local government, higher education, the courts service, culture and external affairs. Ms Forbes said spending would be prioritised in areas such as health, education and tackling climate change. Health spending is due to rise from Â£17.1bn to Â£19bn over the next five years, while funding for social security benefits will increase from Â£3.9bn to Â£6.3bn in cash terms. The overall budget for the Scottish government is due to increase from Â£41.8bn to Â£47.5bn. Ms Forbes admitted that the government ""cannot prioritise everything"", adding: ""We do need to reshape and refocus the public sector post-Covid and the spending review calls upon all of the public sector to look creatively at ways to sustainably address that challenge."" 'Difficult decisions' for Kate Forbes LIVE: Scottish ministers have 'limited funds' to help people Ms Forbes also said the government would seek to ensure public sector workers were given ""fair"" pay increases, but warned that it was having to operate with a ""severely limited budget"". Her spending review outlines plans to reduce the overall size of the public sector workforce to pre-Covid levels, with the aim of keeping the total pay bill, as opposed to pay levels, at 2022-23 levels. It said that this should be achieved through ""effective vacancy and recruitment management"" and would allow remaining staff to be given year-on-year pay increases. It also said there should be a renewed focus on wellbeing, with bodies being invited to take part in the four-day working week pilot, as well as continuing to make better use of new technology to allow for hybrid or home working. About a fifth of Scotland's workforce are employed in the public sector - with a pay bill of over Â£21bn per year - and public sector staffing has grown from about 410,000 to about 440,000 over the past five years. The review said that while some growth related to the devolution of new functions to Scotland - such as elements of tax and social security - continued growth was not sustainable. The government said it will now consult with trade unions and workers to ""navigate the challenge"" of a post-pandemic reset. The review said the government could also look at reducing the number of public bodies as well as buildings it owns. Ms Forbes said: ""We are experiencing an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis. Inflation is at a 40-year high of 9% with households facing considerable hardship."" The finance secretary warned that she had limited powers to help, with the Scottish government having to prioritise its response. She accused the UK government of ""sitting on its hands"" in the face of the cost-of-living crisis, adding: ""The chill winds of Tory austerity are blowing when it comes to spending on public services."" TheInstitute for Fiscal Studies has said the Scottish government is facing a Â£3.5bn gap,externalopening up between spending and income as a result of generous spending pledges and revenue from taxes being less than expected. The institute's David Phillips said budgets for local government, the police, justice, universities and rural affairs were due to fall by about 8% in real terms over the next four years, while spending on enterprise, tourism and trade promotion was set to fall by 16%. Although health spending was set to increase by 2.6% in real terms over the next four years, he said this would be ""slower than needed,"" adding: ""Health services could really struggle."" But social security spending is forecast to increase by 48% as new, more generous, Scottish benefits replace UK-wide benefits. Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith highlighted the ""gaping hole"" between projected public spending and tax revenues. She added it was ""the product of incompetence from an SNP government that has no idea how to manage public finances"". Labour finance spokesman Daniel Johnson criticised the lack of detail, and said the government had managed to find Â£20m for a second independence referendum despite freezing spending in other areas. A UK government spokesman said Scotland was benefitting from unprecedented support. He said the Scottish government had been provided with a record Â£41bn per year for the next three years. He added: ""The Scottish government's official figures show being part of the UK is worth more than Â£2,200 every year for each person in Scotland. ""An agreement to review the fiscal framework is under way and we will continue to work with the Scottish government."" STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said the review will ""ring alarm bells for many public sector workers"". In recent days, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned of a potential gap of Â£3.5bn opening up in the Scottish government's finances over the next few years. It is the finance secretary's job to close that gap - to make sure that the books balance and that's what Kate Forbes has tried to do in her spending review. So what's the trick when spending on key priorities like the NHS and social security benefits, including the new child payment, are being protected? There's little or no new cash planned for local government, higher education, the courts and many other areas - which amounts to real terms cuts, the painful details of which are yet to be decided. There are also plans for so-called efficiencies - reducing the overall public sector workforce to pre-Covid levels, reducing the number of government buildings and potentially reducing the number of devolved public bodies. Much could yet change in the public finances before the next Holyrood election and the Scottish government still hopes there will be an independence referendum next year, for which Â£20m has been earmarked.

On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Holiday giant Tui is cancelling more flights as air passengers face ongoing disruption ahead of the Jubilee bank holiday weekend. Tui will cancel six flights a day until the end of June, affecting around 34,000 travellers in all. Other airlines have also cancelled flights, as around two million people prepare to fly over the next few days. One family, whose flight was cancelled with less than two days notice, said their children were ""devastated"". Joanna Chandramani said she, her husband and their seven-year-old twin girls had been set to fly to Turkey on Wednesday, but she got a text on Monday evening telling her their holiday was cancelled. She said Tui had now offered them vouchers but the family did not want to re-book with them so were flying with Jet2 to Mallorca instead. ""We have lost all faith in Tui,"" she added. The Chandramani family say they do not want to book with Tui again Tui said customers affected by cancellations would receive a full refund for their holidays ""as well as an extra gesture of goodwill"". The company said the cancellations represented about 4% of its flights. Tui said it understood the cancellations would be ""disappointing"" but added: ""We believe this is necessary to provide stability and a better customer service at Manchester Airport."" What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Thousands of passengers across the UK have had their flights cancelled or faced delays at airports when checking in and collecting baggage as the half-term break began. Before the Covid pandemic, airports and airlines across Great Britain employed around 140,000 people, according to Airlines UK. However, since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone, due to the restrictions on international travel. The industry has struggled to cope with a surge in flyers as demand picked up again, with many finding it difficult to recruit and train new staff quick enough. Prospect, the union which represents staff across air traffic control and in aviation engineering, warned that things could ""get worse before they get better"". The Airport Operators Association, which represents the industry, said big recruitment campaigns had been under way since before the start of this year and additional staff were now being deployed. It said most passengers were getting through security smoothly and the association would continue to work with the government to be ready for the summer. Have you been affected by travel issues?

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was working with the travel industry to tackle the problems. ""We put in place billions of pounds of support for the travel industry, in particular during the pandemic,"" he said. ""Right now there are conversations happening between the industry and ministers to make sure disruption can be eased."" But Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said: ""The government point to the furlough scheme but ignore that it ended well before the majority of international restrictions on travel came to an end."" Trade unions say airlines are struggling to recruit staff because jobs in the industry are not well-paid or secure enough and training new staff takes time. As a result the problems are likely to continue for some time. Michael Turner, a nurse from Shoreham, is currently on his third attempt to go on holiday with his family to Tenerife. Due to fly from Gatwick last Thursday, Mr Turner was told his EasyJet flight had been cancelled 20 minutes before departure. He re-booked a Tui flight which was all that was available and said he experienced ""absolute chaos"" in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. After boarding the plane, Mr Turner said its pilot called the police as no-one was able to get off for three hours. The family was then escorted to collect their baggage and put on a coach without being told where they were going and are now waiting to be taken back to the airport for a flight this evening. Manchester Airportsaid Tui and Swissport, which provides ground services such as baggage handling, ""are experiencing temporary staff shortages, in common with other aviation and travel companies"". A spokesperson for Swissport apologised for its part in any disruption, adding that the return of demand for flights was ""exacerbating resource challenges across the aviation industry."". A number of other airports reported high traffic on Tuesday. There were queues outside the terminal building at Edinburgh Airport on Tuesday morning Glasgow Airportsaid queues at security were ""longer than usual"" in the morning, though passengers moved through at a ""steady pace"". A spokesperson said the airport was ""busier than it has been for more than two years"" but urged people not to arrive early. AtEdinburgh Airportsome passengers had to wait outside the terminal building to check in luggage. Meanwhile,Stanstedis forecasting 80,000 passengers a day over the next week. Half-term holidays in shreds as flights cancelled Airport passengers urged not to arrive early There were also long waits for Eurostar train services at London's St Pancras station, with queues extending outside the building. Eurostar said one train was taken out of service earlier due to a technical fault, leading to delays of 30 to 60 minutes. A spokeswoman said queues were moving and staff were working hard to ensure check-in was as smooth as possible. Meanwhile, the RAC predicts drivers will make 19.5 million trips by car over the Jubilee bank holiday weekend, potentially clogging the roads. The motoring group said Friday is expected to be the busiest day, with the M25 forecast to be a hotspot. Southbound M5, A303 and A720 Edinburgh city bypass are all also being flagged as roads to watch for potential delays, with transport experts Inrix predicting traffic conditions could be worst in the mornings of the bank holidays. Inrix are advising drivers to start their journeys as early as possible or wait until later in the day to avoid any jams. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today.

Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Francois-Marie Dibon began his world-record breaking attempt on Tuesday morning. A Frenchman who had a fear of heights as a youngster is attempting to break the world record for the number of bungee jumps in 24 hours. Francois-Marie Dibon will do his final jump at Garry Bridge, Killiecrankie, Perthshire, at 10:00 on Wednesday. The record is currently held by Mike Heard, who completed 430 jumps at Auckland Harbour Bridge in May 2017. Mr Dibon, 44, will need to complete a jump every three and a half minutes to break the record. He said: ""I used to be afraid of heights, and bungee jumping is a very good cure. ""I found it's worth the effort to face your fears and overcome them. ""So I decided to put that statement to the test."" Francois-Marie Dibon will have to complete a jump about every 200 seconds to break the record Mr Dibon, an actuary who works in Stockholm, said it would be his ""pleasure to bring the record to Scotland."" He said: ""I love Scotland, and the French love the Scottish people. I have an amazing team here and a beautiful site. ""When you're on the edge and you're going to jump, the scenery is very important, and what I see is just wonderful."" As recently as March, Mr Dibon was suffering the equivalent of sea-sickness, due to the constant motion of going up and down on the elasticated bungee cord. However, he said he overcame this after completing 25 hours a week in the gym, focusing on cardio and core muscle stints, and learning breathing techniques. He said: ""We have been thinking about this for the last five-and-a half years, with ups and downs and some road-blocks on the way. ""Now the karma is good. The stars are aligned."" The Highland Fling Bungee jump-masters are working in four-hour shifts, winching Mr Dibon back up to the platform after every jump. He said: ""When needed, I will rest, we have built this into the plan. ""If there is a slight adjustment required or a bungee cord change, this can take 10 minutes. ""If that happens, I will lie down and take a micro nap.""

"The 79-year-old played Shadrach Dingle in ITV soap Emmerdale for 10 years Actor Andy Devine died as a result of ""hospital-acquired pneumonia"" after a fall, a coroner has concluded. The 79-year-old, who played Shadrach Dingle in Emmerdale for 10 years, died in Southport Hospital in January. The soap star had fallen and lain on the floor for about an hour as he was ""unable to get up until his carers arrived"", Sefton Senior Coroner Julie Goulding said. She said his condition went on to deteriorate ""culminating in his death"". Devine made his Emmerdale debut as Shadrach Dingle, the father of Chas and husband of Faith, in 2000. He made a dramatic exit from the ITV show ten years later when his character was killed off as part of an alcohol abuse storyline. Emmerdale was not his first soap, as he had previously played a photographer in Coronation Street, while he also appeared in Queer As Folk, Where The Heart Is, Cracker and Prime Suspect.

Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian.

The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere

More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A shortage of GPs has left some areas of England having to cope with half the number of doctors than other areas, an analysis for the BBC has found. TheNuffield Trust data,externalshowed Portsmouth, Brighton, parts of Essex and Hull had the fewest GPs, with fewer than 50 GPs per 100,000 patients. That is the equivalent of more than 2,000 patients for every GP. It comes as patient groups warned access to doctors was becoming one of the biggest problems for the NHS. Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust, said: ""In an NHS founded on the principle of equal treatment, such stark differences represent a serious failing."" The two-fold variation in GPs holds even when the age and health of the local population is taken into account to factor in how often patients are likely to need a GP, the analysis showed. Yolanda Barker has multiple sclerosis. It means she needs more regular GP appointments than most. But she is finding it increasingly difficult to get the help she needs from her local practice in Kent. Yolanda, 50, says she can spend ""days on end"" trying to get through. ""They have an hour in the morning from 8am to 9am when you can make online appointments. If you miss that you have to resort to the phone. I've spent 40 or 50 minutes on hold trying to get through. Sometimes you can't - or you give up. ""I've resorted to looking at the internet to try to self-manage my problems. I've been suffering quite a lot of pain recently and have irritable bowel syndrome. ""But there are other things you need that I can't do myself - it could be that I need a change of medication or physio. ""It is great when you do get a face-to-face appointment, but even then it feels so rushed. It is like a conveyor belt."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England said a quarter of the complaints it handles from patients now relate to GP services. National Director Louise Ansari said: ""People are telling us about difficulties getting through to their local practice, with online booking systems, long waits on the phone and a lack of face-to-face appointments providing them with challenges. ""The lack of easy access puts people's health and wellbeing at risk, and increases demand on overstretched hospitals."" The sentiments were echoed by GPs working in the areas with the fewest doctors. Hull GP Dr Matthew Fortnam said: ""You have the perfect storm where we have the most need but the least capacity to deal with it. It creates inequity and actually perpetuates it."" The Royal College of GPs said there was a shortage of GPs, with increasing numbers walking away from the profession by retiring early or reducing their hours - less than two-thirds of the workforce now work full-time. The trend is undermining the government's efforts to recruit 6,000 extra GPs in England during this parliament, college president Dr Martin Marshall said. Latest data shows the number of qualified GPs has actually fallen slightly in recent years. While this data relates to England, similar pressures are being seen in the rest of the UK. Dr Marshall told the BBC the result was that workloads were growing, and the job was becoming ""undoable"". ""GPs can be seeing up to 50 patients a day. That's potentially unsafe. It's depressing - we know patients are not getting the service they want. The job is no longer enjoyable."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the government was ""working hard to support and grow the workforce"". She pointed out the number of trainee doctors was increasing, while other staff - such as practice nurses, physios and pharmacists - were also being invested in, to work alongside GPs.

Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl

""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs

destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external.

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian.

As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed.

"Holiday giant Tui is cancelling more flights as air passengers face ongoing disruption ahead of the Jubilee bank holiday weekend. Tui will cancel six flights a day until the end of June, affecting around 34,000 travellers in all. Other airlines have also cancelled flights, as around two million people prepare to fly over the next few days. One family, whose flight was cancelled with less than two days notice, said their children were ""devastated"". Joanna Chandramani said she, her husband and their seven-year-old twin girls had been set to fly to Turkey on Wednesday, but she got a text on Monday evening telling her their holiday was cancelled. She said Tui had now offered them vouchers but the family did not want to re-book with them so were flying with Jet2 to Mallorca instead. ""We have lost all faith in Tui,"" she added. The Chandramani family say they do not want to book with Tui again Tui said customers affected by cancellations would receive a full refund for their holidays ""as well as an extra gesture of goodwill"". The company said the cancellations represented about 4% of its flights. Tui said it understood the cancellations would be ""disappointing"" but added: ""We believe this is necessary to provide stability and a better customer service at Manchester Airport."" What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Thousands of passengers across the UK have had their flights cancelled or faced delays at airports when checking in and collecting baggage as the half-term break began. Before the Covid pandemic, airports and airlines across Great Britain employed around 140,000 people, according to Airlines UK. However, since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone, due to the restrictions on international travel. The industry has struggled to cope with a surge in flyers as demand picked up again, with many finding it difficult to recruit and train new staff quick enough. Prospect, the union which represents staff across air traffic control and in aviation engineering, warned that things could ""get worse before they get better"". The Airport Operators Association, which represents the industry, said big recruitment campaigns had been under way since before the start of this year and additional staff were now being deployed. It said most passengers were getting through security smoothly and the association would continue to work with the government to be ready for the summer. Have you been affected by travel issues?

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was working with the travel industry to tackle the problems. ""We put in place billions of pounds of support for the travel industry, in particular during the pandemic,"" he said. ""Right now there are conversations happening between the industry and ministers to make sure disruption can be eased."" But Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said: ""The government point to the furlough scheme but ignore that it ended well before the majority of international restrictions on travel came to an end."" Trade unions say airlines are struggling to recruit staff because jobs in the industry are not well-paid or secure enough and training new staff takes time. As a result the problems are likely to continue for some time. Michael Turner, a nurse from Shoreham, is currently on his third attempt to go on holiday with his family to Tenerife. Due to fly from Gatwick last Thursday, Mr Turner was told his EasyJet flight had been cancelled 20 minutes before departure. He re-booked a Tui flight which was all that was available and said he experienced ""absolute chaos"" in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. After boarding the plane, Mr Turner said its pilot called the police as no-one was able to get off for three hours. The family was then escorted to collect their baggage and put on a coach without being told where they were going and are now waiting to be taken back to the airport for a flight this evening. Manchester Airportsaid Tui and Swissport, which provides ground services such as baggage handling, ""are experiencing temporary staff shortages, in common with other aviation and travel companies"". A spokesperson for Swissport apologised for its part in any disruption, adding that the return of demand for flights was ""exacerbating resource challenges across the aviation industry."". A number of other airports reported high traffic on Tuesday. There were queues outside the terminal building at Edinburgh Airport on Tuesday morning Glasgow Airportsaid queues at security were ""longer than usual"" in the morning, though passengers moved through at a ""steady pace"". A spokesperson said the airport was ""busier than it has been for more than two years"" but urged people not to arrive early. AtEdinburgh Airportsome passengers had to wait outside the terminal building to check in luggage. Meanwhile,Stanstedis forecasting 80,000 passengers a day over the next week. Half-term holidays in shreds as flights cancelled Airport passengers urged not to arrive early There were also long waits for Eurostar train services at London's St Pancras station, with queues extending outside the building. Eurostar said one train was taken out of service earlier due to a technical fault, leading to delays of 30 to 60 minutes. A spokeswoman said queues were moving and staff were working hard to ensure check-in was as smooth as possible. Meanwhile, the RAC predicts drivers will make 19.5 million trips by car over the Jubilee bank holiday weekend, potentially clogging the roads. The motoring group said Friday is expected to be the busiest day, with the M25 forecast to be a hotspot. Southbound M5, A303 and A720 Edinburgh city bypass are all also being flagged as roads to watch for potential delays, with transport experts Inrix predicting traffic conditions could be worst in the mornings of the bank holidays. Inrix are advising drivers to start their journeys as early as possible or wait until later in the day to avoid any jams. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?

"This video can not be played Watch: Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown The Chinese city of Shanghai, the country's economic centre and a global trade hub, has eased Covid curbs after a two-month lockdown. At midnight local time (16:00 GMT Tuesday), restrictions were relaxed to allow most people to move freely around the city of some 25 million people. But at least 650,000 residents will remain confined to their homes. China's overall policy of ""zero Covid"" remains in place and people catching Covid face quarantine or hospital. Their close contacts also face the prospect of removal to quarantine and the area immediately around where they live being locked down again. ""This is a day that we dreamed of for a very long time,"" Shanghai government spokeswoman Yin Xin told reporters. ""Everyone has sacrificed a lot. This day has been hard-won and we need to cherish and protect it, and welcome back the Shanghai we are familiar with and missed."" But new rules have been introduced, with residents required to show a green health code on their smartphone to leave their residential compounds and to enter most places. Those who want to use public transport or enter banks or malls must have a negative PCR test certificate valid in the last 72 hours. And restrictions on leaving Shanghai remain, with anyone travelling to another city facing quarantine of seven to 14 days upon their return. Cinemas, museums and gyms remain closed. Most children will also not return to face-to-face schooling. People travel on a subway in the Jing'an district of Shanghai on the first day after restrictions eased But the rules did little to temper the relief people felt. Cheers and sounds of jubilation rose as the clock struck midnight on Tuesday, signalling the end of the lockdown. Groups of Shanghai residents gathered on street corners, singing and toasting with drinks as they welcomed their newfound freedom. ""We were locked down too many days. We need to celebrate. Not just me - all the Shanghai people here,"" one resident told the BBC. ""All the bad things [have] gone past, so tomorrow will be fine."" ""We are free. I am so happy, I want to work. I want to work tomorrow,"" said another. Chinese state media however downplayed the news of people celebrating because authorities had so far been reluctant to define the restrictions as a ""lockdown"". State media reports instead described Wednesday as ""a new start"" and the day of ""getting back to normal life, work and production"". Most of Shanghai's 25 million residents are now free to leave their homes Cautious signs of life appeared to be returning to the city as a basic service resumed on public transport, and shops opened, with larger ones operating at 75% capacity. Men in buttoned down shirts walked into flashy office towers - but not in the same numbers as before the outbreak, with many firms enforcing a staggered return to work. Joggers, cyclists, skaters and dog walkers defied the muggy heat to take over riverfront parks for a much-awaited breath of fresh air. It was supposed to last just nine days -a staggered lockdown to lessen the impact on Shanghai's economy, state media said. It lasted 65 days. It crippled the city and scarred its people. Restrictions are now being eased as quickly as they were imposed. There's no gradual process over several weeks. Instead there's a big bang - one day when most of the emergency rules and regulations are simply being lifted. The relief is immense - for generations of some families who've lived together behind a locked front door for more than two months; for workers who've lived in tents inside factories where they've carried on working; for the shop and restaurant owners whose livelihood ground to a halt; for the thousands of people forced to leave their homes and sent to quarantine centres. And for the almost 25 million people who live here. Read more here:Relief and caution as Shanghai returns to life The lockdown has seen many residents lose their incomes, struggle to find enough food and cope mentally with prolonged isolation. Manufacturers including Western car makers Volkswagen and Tesla have been particularly impactedby the restrictions as staff were kept away from factories or had to work in ""closed loop"" conditions, where they lived at the plants. The rigidity of the restrictions also caused much frustration in the city. ""Shanghai is such a good placeâ¦ but with all production, all business paused for two months?"" a woman in her 50s from Shanghai told the BBC. ""I hope these will all be resumed soon. I want my prosperous Shanghai city back."" That might take longer as the city reopens cautiously. Speakers were blaring outside an upscale mall, reminding people to wear masks and informing that their temperature would be checked and their health code inspected before they could enter. Only half the shops would open, the manager told the BBC, since some staff were still in quarantine. He said he was not too worried about another outbreak. ""We follow [the] government's rules, we do one major cleaning each day,"" he added. ""We do everything we can."" Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown.

"Kate Forbes said public services in Scotland would have to become more efficient, with the country facing a budget squeeze Scotland must rethink how it delivers its public services in the wake of Covid and Brexit, the finance secretary has said. Kate Forbes said the public sector had grown for years but now needed to ""reset"" and become more efficient. She was speaking as she outlined the government's spending plans for the next five years. The spending review suggested there would be real-terms cuts in several areas of the public sector. These included local government, higher education, the courts service, culture and external affairs. Ms Forbes said spending would be prioritised in areas such as health, education and tackling climate change. Health spending is due to rise from Â£17.1bn to Â£19bn over the next five years, while funding for social security benefits will increase from Â£3.9bn to Â£6.3bn in cash terms. The overall budget for the Scottish government is due to increase from Â£41.8bn to Â£47.5bn. Ms Forbes admitted that the government ""cannot prioritise everything"", adding: ""We do need to reshape and refocus the public sector post-Covid and the spending review calls upon all of the public sector to look creatively at ways to sustainably address that challenge."" 'Difficult decisions' for Kate Forbes LIVE: Scottish ministers have 'limited funds' to help people Ms Forbes also said the government would seek to ensure public sector workers were given ""fair"" pay increases, but warned that it was having to operate with a ""severely limited budget"". Her spending review outlines plans to reduce the overall size of the public sector workforce to pre-Covid levels, with the aim of keeping the total pay bill, as opposed to pay levels, at 2022-23 levels. It said that this should be achieved through ""effective vacancy and recruitment management"" and would allow remaining staff to be given year-on-year pay increases. It also said there should be a renewed focus on wellbeing, with bodies being invited to take part in the four-day working week pilot, as well as continuing to make better use of new technology to allow for hybrid or home working. About a fifth of Scotland's workforce are employed in the public sector - with a pay bill of over Â£21bn per year - and public sector staffing has grown from about 410,000 to about 440,000 over the past five years. The review said that while some growth related to the devolution of new functions to Scotland - such as elements of tax and social security - continued growth was not sustainable. The government said it will now consult with trade unions and workers to ""navigate the challenge"" of a post-pandemic reset. The review said the government could also look at reducing the number of public bodies as well as buildings it owns. Ms Forbes said: ""We are experiencing an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis. Inflation is at a 40-year high of 9% with households facing considerable hardship."" The finance secretary warned that she had limited powers to help, with the Scottish government having to prioritise its response. She accused the UK government of ""sitting on its hands"" in the face of the cost-of-living crisis, adding: ""The chill winds of Tory austerity are blowing when it comes to spending on public services."" TheInstitute for Fiscal Studies has said the Scottish government is facing a Â£3.5bn gap,externalopening up between spending and income as a result of generous spending pledges and revenue from taxes being less than expected. The institute's David Phillips said budgets for local government, the police, justice, universities and rural affairs were due to fall by about 8% in real terms over the next four years, while spending on enterprise, tourism and trade promotion was set to fall by 16%. Although health spending was set to increase by 2.6% in real terms over the next four years, he said this would be ""slower than needed,"" adding: ""Health services could really struggle."" But social security spending is forecast to increase by 48% as new, more generous, Scottish benefits replace UK-wide benefits. Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith highlighted the ""gaping hole"" between projected public spending and tax revenues. She added it was ""the product of incompetence from an SNP government that has no idea how to manage public finances"". Labour finance spokesman Daniel Johnson criticised the lack of detail, and said the government had managed to find Â£20m for a second independence referendum despite freezing spending in other areas. A UK government spokesman said Scotland was benefitting from unprecedented support. He said the Scottish government had been provided with a record Â£41bn per year for the next three years. He added: ""The Scottish government's official figures show being part of the UK is worth more than Â£2,200 every year for each person in Scotland. ""An agreement to review the fiscal framework is under way and we will continue to work with the Scottish government."" STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said the review will ""ring alarm bells for many public sector workers"". In recent days, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned of a potential gap of Â£3.5bn opening up in the Scottish government's finances over the next few years. It is the finance secretary's job to close that gap - to make sure that the books balance and that's what Kate Forbes has tried to do in her spending review. So what's the trick when spending on key priorities like the NHS and social security benefits, including the new child payment, are being protected? There's little or no new cash planned for local government, higher education, the courts and many other areas - which amounts to real terms cuts, the painful details of which are yet to be decided. There are also plans for so-called efficiencies - reducing the overall public sector workforce to pre-Covid levels, reducing the number of government buildings and potentially reducing the number of devolved public bodies. Much could yet change in the public finances before the next Holyrood election and the Scottish government still hopes there will be an independence referendum next year, for which Â£20m has been earmarked.

"Holiday giant Tui is cancelling more flights as air passengers face ongoing disruption ahead of the Jubilee bank holiday weekend. Tui will cancel six flights a day until the end of June, affecting around 34,000 travellers in all. Other airlines have also cancelled flights, as around two million people prepare to fly over the next few days. One family, whose flight was cancelled with less than two days notice, said their children were ""devastated"". Joanna Chandramani said she, her husband and their seven-year-old twin girls had been set to fly to Turkey on Wednesday, but she got a text on Monday evening telling her their holiday was cancelled. She said Tui had now offered them vouchers but the family did not want to re-book with them so were flying with Jet2 to Mallorca instead. ""We have lost all faith in Tui,"" she added. The Chandramani family say they do not want to book with Tui again Tui said customers affected by cancellations would receive a full refund for their holidays ""as well as an extra gesture of goodwill"". The company said the cancellations represented about 4% of its flights. Tui said it understood the cancellations would be ""disappointing"" but added: ""We believe this is necessary to provide stability and a better customer service at Manchester Airport."" What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Thousands of passengers across the UK have had their flights cancelled or faced delays at airports when checking in and collecting baggage as the half-term break began. Before the Covid pandemic, airports and airlines across Great Britain employed around 140,000 people, according to Airlines UK. However, since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone, due to the restrictions on international travel. The industry has struggled to cope with a surge in flyers as demand picked up again, with many finding it difficult to recruit and train new staff quick enough. Prospect, the union which represents staff across air traffic control and in aviation engineering, warned that things could ""get worse before they get better"". The Airport Operators Association, which represents the industry, said big recruitment campaigns had been under way since before the start of this year and additional staff were now being deployed. It said most passengers were getting through security smoothly and the association would continue to work with the government to be ready for the summer. Have you been affected by travel issues?

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was working with the travel industry to tackle the problems. ""We put in place billions of pounds of support for the travel industry, in particular during the pandemic,"" he said. ""Right now there are conversations happening between the industry and ministers to make sure disruption can be eased."" But Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said: ""The government point to the furlough scheme but ignore that it ended well before the majority of international restrictions on travel came to an end."" Trade unions say airlines are struggling to recruit staff because jobs in the industry are not well-paid or secure enough and training new staff takes time. As a result the problems are likely to continue for some time. Michael Turner, a nurse from Shoreham, is currently on his third attempt to go on holiday with his family to Tenerife. Due to fly from Gatwick last Thursday, Mr Turner was told his EasyJet flight had been cancelled 20 minutes before departure. He re-booked a Tui flight which was all that was available and said he experienced ""absolute chaos"" in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. After boarding the plane, Mr Turner said its pilot called the police as no-one was able to get off for three hours. The family was then escorted to collect their baggage and put on a coach without being told where they were going and are now waiting to be taken back to the airport for a flight this evening. Manchester Airportsaid Tui and Swissport, which provides ground services such as baggage handling, ""are experiencing temporary staff shortages, in common with other aviation and travel companies"". A spokesperson for Swissport apologised for its part in any disruption, adding that the return of demand for flights was ""exacerbating resource challenges across the aviation industry."". A number of other airports reported high traffic on Tuesday. There were queues outside the terminal building at Edinburgh Airport on Tuesday morning Glasgow Airportsaid queues at security were ""longer than usual"" in the morning, though passengers moved through at a ""steady pace"". A spokesperson said the airport was ""busier than it has been for more than two years"" but urged people not to arrive early. AtEdinburgh Airportsome passengers had to wait outside the terminal building to check in luggage. Meanwhile,Stanstedis forecasting 80,000 passengers a day over the next week. Half-term holidays in shreds as flights cancelled Airport passengers urged not to arrive early There were also long waits for Eurostar train services at London's St Pancras station, with queues extending outside the building. Eurostar said one train was taken out of service earlier due to a technical fault, leading to delays of 30 to 60 minutes. A spokeswoman said queues were moving and staff were working hard to ensure check-in was as smooth as possible. Meanwhile, the RAC predicts drivers will make 19.5 million trips by car over the Jubilee bank holiday weekend, potentially clogging the roads. The motoring group said Friday is expected to be the busiest day, with the M25 forecast to be a hotspot. Southbound M5, A303 and A720 Edinburgh city bypass are all also being flagged as roads to watch for potential delays, with transport experts Inrix predicting traffic conditions could be worst in the mornings of the bank holidays. Inrix are advising drivers to start their journeys as early as possible or wait until later in the day to avoid any jams. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Francois-Marie Dibon began his world-record breaking attempt on Tuesday morning.

The record is currently held by Mike Heard, who completed 430 jumps at Auckland Harbour Bridge in May 2017. Mr Dibon, 44, will need to complete a jump every three and a half minutes to break the record. He said: ""I used to be afraid of heights, and bungee jumping is a very good cure.

""When you're on the edge and you're going to jump, the scenery is very important, and what I see is just wonderful."" As recently as March, Mr Dibon was suffering the equivalent of sea-sickness, due to the constant motion of going up and down on the elasticated bungee cord. However, he said he overcame this after completing 25 hours a week in the gym, focusing on cardio and core muscle stints, and learning breathing techniques.

"A shortage of GPs has left some areas of England having to cope with half the number of doctors than other areas, an analysis for the BBC has found.

"This video can not be played Watch: Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown The Chinese city of Shanghai, the country's economic centre and a global trade hub, has eased Covid curbs after a two-month lockdown. At midnight local time (16:00 GMT Tuesday), restrictions were relaxed to allow most people to move freely around the city of some 25 million people. But at least 650,000 residents will remain confined to their homes. China's overall policy of ""zero Covid"" remains in place and people catching Covid face quarantine or hospital. Their close contacts also face the prospect of removal to quarantine and the area immediately around where they live being locked down again. ""This is a day that we dreamed of for a very long time,"" Shanghai government spokeswoman Yin Xin told reporters. ""Everyone has sacrificed a lot. This day has been hard-won and we need to cherish and protect it, and welcome back the Shanghai we are familiar with and missed."" But new rules have been introduced, with residents required to show a green health code on their smartphone to leave their residential compounds and to enter most places. Those who want to use public transport or enter banks or malls must have a negative PCR test certificate valid in the last 72 hours. And restrictions on leaving Shanghai remain, with anyone travelling to another city facing quarantine of seven to 14 days upon their return. Cinemas, museums and gyms remain closed. Most children will also not return to face-to-face schooling. People travel on a subway in the Jing'an district of Shanghai on the first day after restrictions eased But the rules did little to temper the relief people felt. Cheers and sounds of jubilation rose as the clock struck midnight on Tuesday, signalling the end of the lockdown. Groups of Shanghai residents gathered on street corners, singing and toasting with drinks as they welcomed their newfound freedom. ""We were locked down too many days. We need to celebrate. Not just me - all the Shanghai people here,"" one resident told the BBC. ""All the bad things [have] gone past, so tomorrow will be fine."" ""We are free. I am so happy, I want to work. I want to work tomorrow,"" said another. Chinese state media however downplayed the news of people celebrating because authorities had so far been reluctant to define the restrictions as a ""lockdown"". State media reports instead described Wednesday as ""a new start"" and the day of ""getting back to normal life, work and production"". Most of Shanghai's 25 million residents are now free to leave their homes Cautious signs of life appeared to be returning to the city as a basic service resumed on public transport, and shops opened, with larger ones operating at 75% capacity. Men in buttoned down shirts walked into flashy office towers - but not in the same numbers as before the outbreak, with many firms enforcing a staggered return to work. Joggers, cyclists, skaters and dog walkers defied the muggy heat to take over riverfront parks for a much-awaited breath of fresh air. It was supposed to last just nine days -a staggered lockdown to lessen the impact on Shanghai's economy, state media said. It lasted 65 days. It crippled the city and scarred its people. Restrictions are now being eased as quickly as they were imposed. There's no gradual process over several weeks. Instead there's a big bang - one day when most of the emergency rules and regulations are simply being lifted. The relief is immense - for generations of some families who've lived together behind a locked front door for more than two months; for workers who've lived in tents inside factories where they've carried on working; for the shop and restaurant owners whose livelihood ground to a halt; for the thousands of people forced to leave their homes and sent to quarantine centres. And for the almost 25 million people who live here. Read more here:Relief and caution as Shanghai returns to life The lockdown has seen many residents lose their incomes, struggle to find enough food and cope mentally with prolonged isolation. Manufacturers including Western car makers Volkswagen and Tesla have been particularly impactedby the restrictions as staff were kept away from factories or had to work in ""closed loop"" conditions, where they lived at the plants. The rigidity of the restrictions also caused much frustration in the city. ""Shanghai is such a good placeâ¦ but with all production, all business paused for two months?"" a woman in her 50s from Shanghai told the BBC. ""I hope these will all be resumed soon. I want my prosperous Shanghai city back."" That might take longer as the city reopens cautiously. Speakers were blaring outside an upscale mall, reminding people to wear masks and informing that their temperature would be checked and their health code inspected before they could enter. Only half the shops would open, the manager told the BBC, since some staff were still in quarantine. He said he was not too worried about another outbreak. ""We follow [the] government's rules, we do one major cleaning each day,"" he added. ""We do everything we can."" Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown.

"Holiday giant Tui is cancelling more flights as air passengers face ongoing disruption ahead of the Jubilee bank holiday weekend. Tui will cancel six flights a day until the end of June, affecting around 34,000 travellers in all. Other airlines have also cancelled flights, as around two million people prepare to fly over the next few days. One family, whose flight was cancelled with less than two days notice, said their children were ""devastated"". Joanna Chandramani said she, her husband and their seven-year-old twin girls had been set to fly to Turkey on Wednesday, but she got a text on Monday evening telling her their holiday was cancelled. She said Tui had now offered them vouchers but the family did not want to re-book with them so were flying with Jet2 to Mallorca instead. ""We have lost all faith in Tui,"" she added. The Chandramani family say they do not want to book with Tui again Tui said customers affected by cancellations would receive a full refund for their holidays ""as well as an extra gesture of goodwill"". The company said the cancellations represented about 4% of its flights. Tui said it understood the cancellations would be ""disappointing"" but added: ""We believe this is necessary to provide stability and a better customer service at Manchester Airport."" What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Thousands of passengers across the UK have had their flights cancelled or faced delays at airports when checking in and collecting baggage as the half-term break began. Before the Covid pandemic, airports and airlines across Great Britain employed around 140,000 people, according to Airlines UK. However, since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone, due to the restrictions on international travel. The industry has struggled to cope with a surge in flyers as demand picked up again, with many finding it difficult to recruit and train new staff quick enough. Prospect, the union which represents staff across air traffic control and in aviation engineering, warned that things could ""get worse before they get better"". The Airport Operators Association, which represents the industry, said big recruitment campaigns had been under way since before the start of this year and additional staff were now being deployed. It said most passengers were getting through security smoothly and the association would continue to work with the government to be ready for the summer. Have you been affected by travel issues? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Around 10,000 flights are set to leave the UK between Thursday and Sunday, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was working with the travel industry to tackle the problems. ""We put in place billions of pounds of support for the travel industry, in particular during the pandemic,"" he said. ""Right now there are conversations happening between the industry and ministers to make sure disruption can be eased."" But Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said: ""The government point to the furlough scheme but ignore that it ended well before the majority of international restrictions on travel came to an end."" Trade unions say airlines are struggling to recruit staff because jobs in the industry are not well-paid or secure enough and training new staff takes time. As a result the problems are likely to continue for some time. Michael Turner, a nurse from Shoreham, is currently on his third attempt to go on holiday with his family to Tenerife. Due to fly from Gatwick last Thursday, Mr Turner was told his EasyJet flight had been cancelled 20 minutes before departure. He re-booked a Tui flight which was all that was available and said he experienced ""absolute chaos"" in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. After boarding the plane, Mr Turner said its pilot called the police as no-one was able to get off for three hours. The family was then escorted to collect their baggage and put on a coach without being told where they were going and are now waiting to be taken back to the airport for a flight this evening. Manchester Airportsaid Tui and Swissport, which provides ground services such as baggage handling, ""are experiencing temporary staff shortages, in common with other aviation and travel companies"". A spokesperson for Swissport apologised for its part in any disruption, adding that the return of demand for flights was ""exacerbating resource challenges across the aviation industry."". A number of other airports reported high traffic on Tuesday. There were queues outside the terminal building at Edinburgh Airport on Tuesday morning Glasgow Airportsaid queues at security were ""longer than usual"" in the morning, though passengers moved through at a ""steady pace"". A spokesperson said the airport was ""busier than it has been for more than two years"" but urged people not to arrive early. AtEdinburgh Airportsome passengers had to wait outside the terminal building to check in luggage. Meanwhile,Stanstedis forecasting 80,000 passengers a day over the next week. Half-term holidays in shreds as flights cancelled Airport passengers urged not to arrive early There were also long waits for Eurostar train services at London's St Pancras station, with queues extending outside the building. Eurostar said one train was taken out of service earlier due to a technical fault, leading to delays of 30 to 60 minutes. A spokeswoman said queues were moving and staff were working hard to ensure check-in was as smooth as possible. Meanwhile, the RAC predicts drivers will make 19.5 million trips by car over the Jubilee bank holiday weekend, potentially clogging the roads. The motoring group said Friday is expected to be the busiest day, with the M25 forecast to be a hotspot. Southbound M5, A303 and A720 Edinburgh city bypass are all also being flagged as roads to watch for potential delays, with transport experts Inrix predicting traffic conditions could be worst in the mornings of the bank holidays. Inrix are advising drivers to start their journeys as early as possible or wait until later in the day to avoid any jams. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?

She said demand has escalated dramatically from January onwards. ""We've had a massive rise in demand in pet food... from hundreds of meals to thousands of meals,"" she said.

She collects the food in her van, sorts the wet and dry mixtures at home, stores it, and then delivers it to the 12 food banks, or outlets, across south Wales - from Newport to Swansea. Debi delivers to those who cannot currently afford to feed their animals. She does the charity work on her own as well as being a full-time carer for her mum. She said she needs more support, space and money to help those that need it most. ""I'm struggling to get everything done on my own at the moment, so we're looking to raise funds for a warehouse so that we can have volunteers in to help out that way,"" she said. ""I have people ready to offer to volunteer but because the Pet Food Bank service is based at my house I can't have people running around in the front and back garden.""

"Money was made available to deal with the backlog, but the NHS was not able to spend it all It may take seven years to get NHS Wales waiting lists of 700,000 back to 2020 levels, Wales' auditor general has said. Thenumber of patients waiting for non-urgent treatment has risen sharplysince February 2020, prior to the Covid pandemic. They include Michael Assender, 74, with severe back pain, one of 70,400 who've spent two years on a waiting list. The Welsh government said it had a plan to deal with backlogs. But Wales' Auditor General Adrian Crompton said: ""Just as the NHS rose to the challenge of the pandemic, it will need to rise to the challenge of tackling a waiting list which has grown to huge proportions. NHS waiting times in Wales hit record high again Patient spent four nights in A&E waiting for a bed ""Concerted action is going to be needed on many different fronts, and some long-standing challenges will need to be overcome."" After struggling with his back, Mr Assender, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, paid Â£1,500 for a private scan, which revealed he had two slipped discs. ""At the moment I'm coping pretty well, taking pills for the pain and trying to stay active,"" he said. ""But something that took me half hour before now takes an hour."" Mr Assender said he knew others waiting for surgery who had become depressed and considered taking their lives, adding: ""A lot of people out there are in a constant pain and I do pity them. ""It's a dire situation really."" The pandemic has exacerbated problems with waiting times in the Welsh NHS According to Mr Crompton's report, more than half those waiting may not even know what they are suffering from because they still have not had their first outpatient appointment. That means their care cannot be effectively prioritised. Mr Crompton called on Welsh Labour ministers to set ""ambitious delivery targets"", make long-term capital investments in NHS infrastructure, create a ""workforce plan"" and manage ""clinical risks and support for those waiting"". The report also included aweb tool,externalwhich allows people to compare waits for different health boards. It showed 701,418 patients waiting for treatment in total, and by March, 380,289 had been on a list for up to 26 weeks, and 168,502 for more than a year. Latest figures also show more than 70,400 waiting more than two years for treatment. Statisticians advise these are ""patient pathways"" and each patient may be on several lists, meaning the actual number of patients affected could be smaller. The report also lists a further 550,000 ""potentially missing"" referrals - higher than the Welsh government's own estimates of half a million - that could find their way back into the system. To tackle the backlog, the Welsh government made an extra Â£200m available to be spent by the end of the 2021/22 financial year, but the Welsh NHS only asked for Â£146m. Of this, Â£12.8m was returned to the Welsh government, as the health service did not have the staff or space to spend it within the timeframe. The Welsh government said: ""Working with health boards, we have set ambitious but realistic targets to tackle the pandemic backlog for planned care. ""This is backed by significant extra long-term funding. ""Our recovery plan, published last month, already sets out our plans to address the five recommendations of this report, including how we will support patients while they wait and create a sustainable workforce with effective leadership."" Health Minister Eluned Morgan toldBBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programmeshe expects to see waiting times decrease. ""We have shown how we want to employ an additional 12,000 people and spend an extra billion pounds,"" she said. ""We are, therefore, confident that we will go in the right direction and will be able to stick to the plan - which is to bring those figures down by the end of this parliament."" Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ""One-off, ring fenced injections of cash that are time limited do not allow the NHS to make necessary long-term investments in staff and capital required to meet the needs of the people of Wales."" He added the workforce is the ""number one limiting factor for NHS capacity"" and recruiting staff was a ""huge focus"". ""It makes for sobering reading and makes clear the enormity of the challenge ahead,"" Mr Hughes toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastwith Claire Summers. ""These are not just numbers, these are individual people's lives."" Surgeons are struggling to deal with growing waiting lists Vice president for Wales of the Royal College of Physicians Dr Olwen Williams said the workforce is a ""key limiting factor"", adding: ""If you can't recruit into the workforce, you can't spend the money."" Welsh Conservatives health spokesman, Russell George, said he hoped the report would be a wake-up call for the government. ""Labour need to get a grip on the NHS and stop breaking all the wrong records,"" he added. Rhun ap Iorwerth MS, Plaid Cymru's health spokesperson, said: ""To see that funds were unspent proves how unsustainable and under-staffed our NHS desperately is."" He added that the NHS ""needs to put on a more sustainable footing and we need a more comprehensive plan that addresses all stages of a patient's journey through the system"".

"This video can not be played Watch: Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown The Chinese city of Shanghai, the country's economic centre and a global trade hub, has eased Covid curbs after a two-month lockdown. At midnight local time (16:00 GMT Tuesday), restrictions were relaxed to allow most people to move freely around the city of some 25 million people. But at least 650,000 residents will remain confined to their homes. China's overall policy of ""zero Covid"" remains in place and people catching Covid face quarantine or hospital. Their close contacts also face the prospect of removal to quarantine and the area immediately around where they live being locked down again. ""This is a day that we dreamed of for a very long time,"" Shanghai government spokeswoman Yin Xin told reporters. ""Everyone has sacrificed a lot. This day has been hard-won and we need to cherish and protect it, and welcome back the Shanghai we are familiar with and missed."" But new rules have been introduced, with residents required to show a green health code on their smartphone to leave their residential compounds and to enter most places. Those who want to use public transport or enter banks or malls must have a negative PCR test certificate valid in the last 72 hours. And restrictions on leaving Shanghai remain, with anyone travelling to another city facing quarantine of seven to 14 days upon their return. Cinemas, museums and gyms remain closed. Most children will also not return to face-to-face schooling. People travel on a subway in the Jing'an district of Shanghai on the first day after restrictions eased But the rules did little to temper the relief people felt. Cheers and sounds of jubilation rose as the clock struck midnight on Tuesday, signalling the end of the lockdown. Groups of Shanghai residents gathered on street corners, singing and toasting with drinks as they welcomed their newfound freedom. ""We were locked down too many days. We need to celebrate. Not just me - all the Shanghai people here,"" one resident told the BBC. ""All the bad things [have] gone past, so tomorrow will be fine."" ""We are free. I am so happy, I want to work. I want to work tomorrow,"" said another. Chinese state media however downplayed the news of people celebrating because authorities had so far been reluctant to define the restrictions as a ""lockdown"". State media reports instead described Wednesday as ""a new start"" and the day of ""getting back to normal life, work and production"". Most of Shanghai's 25 million residents are now free to leave their homes Cautious signs of life appeared to be returning to the city as a basic service resumed on public transport, and shops opened, with larger ones operating at 75% capacity. Men in buttoned down shirts walked into flashy office towers - but not in the same numbers as before the outbreak, with many firms enforcing a staggered return to work. Joggers, cyclists, skaters and dog walkers defied the muggy heat to take over riverfront parks for a much-awaited breath of fresh air. It was supposed to last just nine days -a staggered lockdown to lessen the impact on Shanghai's economy, state media said. It lasted 65 days. It crippled the city and scarred its people. Restrictions are now being eased as quickly as they were imposed. There's no gradual process over several weeks. Instead there's a big bang - one day when most of the emergency rules and regulations are simply being lifted. The relief is immense - for generations of some families who've lived together behind a locked front door for more than two months; for workers who've lived in tents inside factories where they've carried on working; for the shop and restaurant owners whose livelihood ground to a halt; for the thousands of people forced to leave their homes and sent to quarantine centres. And for the almost 25 million people who live here. Read more here:Relief and caution as Shanghai returns to life The lockdown has seen many residents lose their incomes, struggle to find enough food and cope mentally with prolonged isolation. Manufacturers including Western car makers Volkswagen and Tesla have been particularly impactedby the restrictions as staff were kept away from factories or had to work in ""closed loop"" conditions, where they lived at the plants. The rigidity of the restrictions also caused much frustration in the city. ""Shanghai is such a good placeâ¦ but with all production, all business paused for two months?"" a woman in her 50s from Shanghai told the BBC. ""I hope these will all be resumed soon. I want my prosperous Shanghai city back."" That might take longer as the city reopens cautiously. Speakers were blaring outside an upscale mall, reminding people to wear masks and informing that their temperature would be checked and their health code inspected before they could enter. Only half the shops would open, the manager told the BBC, since some staff were still in quarantine. He said he was not too worried about another outbreak. ""We follow [the] government's rules, we do one major cleaning each day,"" he added. ""We do everything we can."" Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown.

"This video can not be played Watch: Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown The Chinese city of Shanghai, the country's economic centre and a global trade hub, has eased Covid curbs after a two-month lockdown. At midnight local time (16:00 GMT Tuesday), restrictions were relaxed to allow most people to move freely around the city of some 25 million people. But at least 650,000 residents will remain confined to their homes. China's overall policy of ""zero Covid"" remains in place and people catching Covid face quarantine or hospital. Their close contacts also face the prospect of removal to quarantine and the area immediately around where they live being locked down again. ""This is a day that we dreamed of for a very long time,"" Shanghai government spokeswoman Yin Xin told reporters. ""Everyone has sacrificed a lot. This day has been hard-won and we need to cherish and protect it, and welcome back the Shanghai we are familiar with and missed."" But new rules have been introduced, with residents required to show a green health code on their smartphone to leave their residential compounds and to enter most places. Those who want to use public transport or enter banks or malls must have a negative PCR test certificate valid in the last 72 hours. And restrictions on leaving Shanghai remain, with anyone travelling to another city facing quarantine of seven to 14 days upon their return. Cinemas, museums and gyms remain closed. Most children will also not return to face-to-face schooling. People travel on a subway in the Jing'an district of Shanghai on the first day after restrictions eased But the rules did little to temper the relief people felt. Cheers and sounds of jubilation rose as the clock struck midnight on Tuesday, signalling the end of the lockdown. Groups of Shanghai residents gathered on street corners, singing and toasting with drinks as they welcomed their newfound freedom. ""We were locked down too many days. We need to celebrate. Not just me - all the Shanghai people here,"" one resident told the BBC. ""All the bad things [have] gone past, so tomorrow will be fine."" ""We are free. I am so happy, I want to work. I want to work tomorrow,"" said another. Chinese state media however downplayed the news of people celebrating because authorities had so far been reluctant to define the restrictions as a ""lockdown"". State media reports instead described Wednesday as ""a new start"" and the day of ""getting back to normal life, work and production"". Most of Shanghai's 25 million residents are now free to leave their homes Cautious signs of life appeared to be returning to the city as a basic service resumed on public transport, and shops opened, with larger ones operating at 75% capacity. Men in buttoned down shirts walked into flashy office towers - but not in the same numbers as before the outbreak, with many firms enforcing a staggered return to work. Joggers, cyclists, skaters and dog walkers defied the muggy heat to take over riverfront parks for a much-awaited breath of fresh air. It was supposed to last just nine days -a staggered lockdown to lessen the impact on Shanghai's economy, state media said. It lasted 65 days. It crippled the city and scarred its people. Restrictions are now being eased as quickly as they were imposed. There's no gradual process over several weeks. Instead there's a big bang - one day when most of the emergency rules and regulations are simply being lifted. The relief is immense - for generations of some families who've lived together behind a locked front door for more than two months; for workers who've lived in tents inside factories where they've carried on working; for the shop and restaurant owners whose livelihood ground to a halt; for the thousands of people forced to leave their homes and sent to quarantine centres. And for the almost 25 million people who live here. Read more here:Relief and caution as Shanghai returns to life The lockdown has seen many residents lose their incomes, struggle to find enough food and cope mentally with prolonged isolation. Manufacturers including Western car makers Volkswagen and Tesla have been particularly impactedby the restrictions as staff were kept away from factories or had to work in ""closed loop"" conditions, where they lived at the plants. The rigidity of the restrictions also caused much frustration in the city. ""Shanghai is such a good placeâ¦ but with all production, all business paused for two months?"" a woman in her 50s from Shanghai told the BBC. ""I hope these will all be resumed soon. I want my prosperous Shanghai city back."" That might take longer as the city reopens cautiously. Speakers were blaring outside an upscale mall, reminding people to wear masks and informing that their temperature would be checked and their health code inspected before they could enter. Only half the shops would open, the manager told the BBC, since some staff were still in quarantine. He said he was not too worried about another outbreak. ""We follow [the] government's rules, we do one major cleaning each day,"" he added. ""We do everything we can."" Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown.

"Kate Forbes said public services in Scotland would have to become more efficient, with the country facing a budget squeeze Scotland must rethink how it delivers its public services in the wake of Covid and Brexit, the finance secretary has said. Kate Forbes said the public sector had grown for years but now needed to ""reset"" and become more efficient. She was speaking as she outlined the government's spending plans for the next five years. The spending review suggested there would be real-terms cuts in several areas of the public sector. These included local government, higher education, the courts service, culture and external affairs. Ms Forbes said spending would be prioritised in areas such as health, education and tackling climate change. Health spending is due to rise from Â£17.1bn to Â£19bn over the next five years, while funding for social security benefits will increase from Â£3.9bn to Â£6.3bn in cash terms. The overall budget for the Scottish government is due to increase from Â£41.8bn to Â£47.5bn. Ms Forbes admitted that the government ""cannot prioritise everything"", adding: ""We do need to reshape and refocus the public sector post-Covid and the spending review calls upon all of the public sector to look creatively at ways to sustainably address that challenge."" 'Difficult decisions' for Kate Forbes LIVE: Scottish ministers have 'limited funds' to help people Ms Forbes also said the government would seek to ensure public sector workers were given ""fair"" pay increases, but warned that it was having to operate with a ""severely limited budget"". Her spending review outlines plans to reduce the overall size of the public sector workforce to pre-Covid levels, with the aim of keeping the total pay bill, as opposed to pay levels, at 2022-23 levels. It said that this should be achieved through ""effective vacancy and recruitment management"" and would allow remaining staff to be given year-on-year pay increases. It also said there should be a renewed focus on wellbeing, with bodies being invited to take part in the four-day working week pilot, as well as continuing to make better use of new technology to allow for hybrid or home working. About a fifth of Scotland's workforce are employed in the public sector - with a pay bill of over Â£21bn per year - and public sector staffing has grown from about 410,000 to about 440,000 over the past five years. The review said that while some growth related to the devolution of new functions to Scotland - such as elements of tax and social security - continued growth was not sustainable. The government said it will now consult with trade unions and workers to ""navigate the challenge"" of a post-pandemic reset. The review said the government could also look at reducing the number of public bodies as well as buildings it owns. Ms Forbes said: ""We are experiencing an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis. Inflation is at a 40-year high of 9% with households facing considerable hardship."" The finance secretary warned that she had limited powers to help, with the Scottish government having to prioritise its response. She accused the UK government of ""sitting on its hands"" in the face of the cost-of-living crisis, adding: ""The chill winds of Tory austerity are blowing when it comes to spending on public services."" TheInstitute for Fiscal Studies has said the Scottish government is facing a Â£3.5bn gap,externalopening up between spending and income as a result of generous spending pledges and revenue from taxes being less than expected. The institute's David Phillips said budgets for local government, the police, justice, universities and rural affairs were due to fall by about 8% in real terms over the next four years, while spending on enterprise, tourism and trade promotion was set to fall by 16%. Although health spending was set to increase by 2.6% in real terms over the next four years, he said this would be ""slower than needed,"" adding: ""Health services could really struggle."" But social security spending is forecast to increase by 48% as new, more generous, Scottish benefits replace UK-wide benefits. Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith highlighted the ""gaping hole"" between projected public spending and tax revenues. She added it was ""the product of incompetence from an SNP government that has no idea how to manage public finances"". Labour finance spokesman Daniel Johnson criticised the lack of detail, and said the government had managed to find Â£20m for a second independence referendum despite freezing spending in other areas. A UK government spokesman said Scotland was benefitting from unprecedented support. He said the Scottish government had been provided with a record Â£41bn per year for the next three years. He added: ""The Scottish government's official figures show being part of the UK is worth more than Â£2,200 every year for each person in Scotland. ""An agreement to review the fiscal framework is under way and we will continue to work with the Scottish government."" STUC general secretary Roz Foyer said the review will ""ring alarm bells for many public sector workers"". In recent days, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned of a potential gap of Â£3.5bn opening up in the Scottish government's finances over the next few years. It is the finance secretary's job to close that gap - to make sure that the books balance and that's what Kate Forbes has tried to do in her spending review. So what's the trick when spending on key priorities like the NHS and social security benefits, including the new child payment, are being protected? There's little or no new cash planned for local government, higher education, the courts and many other areas - which amounts to real terms cuts, the painful details of which are yet to be decided. There are also plans for so-called efficiencies - reducing the overall public sector workforce to pre-Covid levels, reducing the number of government buildings and potentially reducing the number of devolved public bodies. Much could yet change in the public finances before the next Holyrood election and the Scottish government still hopes there will be an independence referendum next year, for which Â£20m has been earmarked.

"Holiday giant Tui is cancelling more flights as air passengers face ongoing disruption ahead of the Jubilee bank holiday weekend. Tui will cancel six flights a day until the end of June, affecting around 34,000 travellers in all. Other airlines have also cancelled flights, as around two million people prepare to fly over the next few days. One family, whose flight was cancelled with less than two days notice, said their children were ""devastated"". Joanna Chandramani said she, her husband and their seven-year-old twin girls had been set to fly to Turkey on Wednesday, but she got a text on Monday evening telling her their holiday was cancelled. She said Tui had now offered them vouchers but the family did not want to re-book with them so were flying with Jet2 to Mallorca instead. ""We have lost all faith in Tui,"" she added. The Chandramani family say they do not want to book with Tui again Tui said customers affected by cancellations would receive a full refund for their holidays ""as well as an extra gesture of goodwill"". The company said the cancellations represented about 4% of its flights. Tui said it understood the cancellations would be ""disappointing"" but added: ""We believe this is necessary to provide stability and a better customer service at Manchester Airport."" What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Thousands of passengers across the UK have had their flights cancelled or faced delays at airports when checking in and collecting baggage as the half-term break began. Before the Covid pandemic, airports and airlines across Great Britain employed around 140,000 people, according to Airlines UK. However, since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone, due to the restrictions on international travel. The industry has struggled to cope with a surge in flyers as demand picked up again, with many finding it difficult to recruit and train new staff quick enough. Prospect, the union which represents staff across air traffic control and in aviation engineering, warned that things could ""get worse before they get better"". The Airport Operators Association, which represents the industry, said big recruitment campaigns had been under way since before the start of this year and additional staff were now being deployed. It said most passengers were getting through security smoothly and the association would continue to work with the government to be ready for the summer. Have you been affected by travel issues?

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was working with the travel industry to tackle the problems. ""We put in place billions of pounds of support for the travel industry, in particular during the pandemic,"" he said. ""Right now there are conversations happening between the industry and ministers to make sure disruption can be eased."" But Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said: ""The government point to the furlough scheme but ignore that it ended well before the majority of international restrictions on travel came to an end."" Trade unions say airlines are struggling to recruit staff because jobs in the industry are not well-paid or secure enough and training new staff takes time. As a result the problems are likely to continue for some time. Michael Turner, a nurse from Shoreham, is currently on his third attempt to go on holiday with his family to Tenerife. Due to fly from Gatwick last Thursday, Mr Turner was told his EasyJet flight had been cancelled 20 minutes before departure. He re-booked a Tui flight which was all that was available and said he experienced ""absolute chaos"" in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. After boarding the plane, Mr Turner said its pilot called the police as no-one was able to get off for three hours. The family was then escorted to collect their baggage and put on a coach without being told where they were going and are now waiting to be taken back to the airport for a flight this evening. Manchester Airportsaid Tui and Swissport, which provides ground services such as baggage handling, ""are experiencing temporary staff shortages, in common with other aviation and travel companies"". A spokesperson for Swissport apologised for its part in any disruption, adding that the return of demand for flights was ""exacerbating resource challenges across the aviation industry."". A number of other airports reported high traffic on Tuesday. There were queues outside the terminal building at Edinburgh Airport on Tuesday morning Glasgow Airportsaid queues at security were ""longer than usual"" in the morning, though passengers moved through at a ""steady pace"". A spokesperson said the airport was ""busier than it has been for more than two years"" but urged people not to arrive early. AtEdinburgh Airportsome passengers had to wait outside the terminal building to check in luggage. Meanwhile,Stanstedis forecasting 80,000 passengers a day over the next week. Half-term holidays in shreds as flights cancelled Airport passengers urged not to arrive early There were also long waits for Eurostar train services at London's St Pancras station, with queues extending outside the building. Eurostar said one train was taken out of service earlier due to a technical fault, leading to delays of 30 to 60 minutes. A spokeswoman said queues were moving and staff were working hard to ensure check-in was as smooth as possible. Meanwhile, the RAC predicts drivers will make 19.5 million trips by car over the Jubilee bank holiday weekend, potentially clogging the roads. The motoring group said Friday is expected to be the busiest day, with the M25 forecast to be a hotspot. Southbound M5, A303 and A720 Edinburgh city bypass are all also being flagged as roads to watch for potential delays, with transport experts Inrix predicting traffic conditions could be worst in the mornings of the bank holidays. Inrix are advising drivers to start their journeys as early as possible or wait until later in the day to avoid any jams. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A shortage of GPs has left some areas of England having to cope with half the number of doctors than other areas, an analysis for the BBC has found. TheNuffield Trust data,externalshowed Portsmouth, Brighton, parts of Essex and Hull had the fewest GPs, with fewer than 50 GPs per 100,000 patients. That is the equivalent of more than 2,000 patients for every GP. It comes as patient groups warned access to doctors was becoming one of the biggest problems for the NHS. Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust, said: ""In an NHS founded on the principle of equal treatment, such stark differences represent a serious failing."" The two-fold variation in GPs holds even when the age and health of the local population is taken into account to factor in how often patients are likely to need a GP, the analysis showed. Yolanda Barker has multiple sclerosis. It means she needs more regular GP appointments than most. But she is finding it increasingly difficult to get the help she needs from her local practice in Kent. Yolanda, 50, says she can spend ""days on end"" trying to get through. ""They have an hour in the morning from 8am to 9am when you can make online appointments. If you miss that you have to resort to the phone. I've spent 40 or 50 minutes on hold trying to get through. Sometimes you can't - or you give up. ""I've resorted to looking at the internet to try to self-manage my problems. I've been suffering quite a lot of pain recently and have irritable bowel syndrome. ""But there are other things you need that I can't do myself - it could be that I need a change of medication or physio. ""It is great when you do get a face-to-face appointment, but even then it feels so rushed. It is like a conveyor belt."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England said a quarter of the complaints it handles from patients now relate to GP services. National Director Louise Ansari said: ""People are telling us about difficulties getting through to their local practice, with online booking systems, long waits on the phone and a lack of face-to-face appointments providing them with challenges. ""The lack of easy access puts people's health and wellbeing at risk, and increases demand on overstretched hospitals."" The sentiments were echoed by GPs working in the areas with the fewest doctors. Hull GP Dr Matthew Fortnam said: ""You have the perfect storm where we have the most need but the least capacity to deal with it. It creates inequity and actually perpetuates it."" The Royal College of GPs said there was a shortage of GPs, with increasing numbers walking away from the profession by retiring early or reducing their hours - less than two-thirds of the workforce now work full-time. The trend is undermining the government's efforts to recruit 6,000 extra GPs in England during this parliament, college president Dr Martin Marshall said. Latest data shows the number of qualified GPs has actually fallen slightly in recent years. While this data relates to England, similar pressures are being seen in the rest of the UK. Dr Marshall told the BBC the result was that workloads were growing, and the job was becoming ""undoable"". ""GPs can be seeing up to 50 patients a day. That's potentially unsafe. It's depressing - we know patients are not getting the service they want. The job is no longer enjoyable.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown The Chinese city of Shanghai, the country's economic centre and a global trade hub, has eased Covid curbs after a two-month lockdown. At midnight local time (16:00 GMT Tuesday), restrictions were relaxed to allow most people to move freely around the city of some 25 million people. But at least 650,000 residents will remain confined to their homes. China's overall policy of ""zero Covid"" remains in place and people catching Covid face quarantine or hospital. Their close contacts also face the prospect of removal to quarantine and the area immediately around where they live being locked down again. ""This is a day that we dreamed of for a very long time,"" Shanghai government spokeswoman Yin Xin told reporters. ""Everyone has sacrificed a lot. This day has been hard-won and we need to cherish and protect it, and welcome back the Shanghai we are familiar with and missed."" But new rules have been introduced, with residents required to show a green health code on their smartphone to leave their residential compounds and to enter most places. Those who want to use public transport or enter banks or malls must have a negative PCR test certificate valid in the last 72 hours. And restrictions on leaving Shanghai remain, with anyone travelling to another city facing quarantine of seven to 14 days upon their return. Cinemas, museums and gyms remain closed. Most children will also not return to face-to-face schooling. People travel on a subway in the Jing'an district of Shanghai on the first day after restrictions eased But the rules did little to temper the relief people felt. Cheers and sounds of jubilation rose as the clock struck midnight on Tuesday, signalling the end of the lockdown. Groups of Shanghai residents gathered on street corners, singing and toasting with drinks as they welcomed their newfound freedom. ""We were locked down too many days. We need to celebrate. Not just me - all the Shanghai people here,"" one resident told the BBC. ""All the bad things [have] gone past, so tomorrow will be fine."" ""We are free. I am so happy, I want to work. I want to work tomorrow,"" said another. Chinese state media however downplayed the news of people celebrating because authorities had so far been reluctant to define the restrictions as a ""lockdown"". State media reports instead described Wednesday as ""a new start"" and the day of ""getting back to normal life, work and production"". Most of Shanghai's 25 million residents are now free to leave their homes Cautious signs of life appeared to be returning to the city as a basic service resumed on public transport, and shops opened, with larger ones operating at 75% capacity. Men in buttoned down shirts walked into flashy office towers - but not in the same numbers as before the outbreak, with many firms enforcing a staggered return to work. Joggers, cyclists, skaters and dog walkers defied the muggy heat to take over riverfront parks for a much-awaited breath of fresh air. It was supposed to last just nine days -a staggered lockdown to lessen the impact on Shanghai's economy, state media said. It lasted 65 days. It crippled the city and scarred its people. Restrictions are now being eased as quickly as they were imposed. There's no gradual process over several weeks. Instead there's a big bang - one day when most of the emergency rules and regulations are simply being lifted. The relief is immense - for generations of some families who've lived together behind a locked front door for more than two months; for workers who've lived in tents inside factories where they've carried on working; for the shop and restaurant owners whose livelihood ground to a halt; for the thousands of people forced to leave their homes and sent to quarantine centres. And for the almost 25 million people who live here. Read more here:Relief and caution as Shanghai returns to life The lockdown has seen many residents lose their incomes, struggle to find enough food and cope mentally with prolonged isolation. Manufacturers including Western car makers Volkswagen and Tesla have been particularly impactedby the restrictions as staff were kept away from factories or had to work in ""closed loop"" conditions, where they lived at the plants. The rigidity of the restrictions also caused much frustration in the city. ""Shanghai is such a good placeâ¦ but with all production, all business paused for two months?"" a woman in her 50s from Shanghai told the BBC. ""I hope these will all be resumed soon. I want my prosperous Shanghai city back."" That might take longer as the city reopens cautiously. Speakers were blaring outside an upscale mall, reminding people to wear masks and informing that their temperature would be checked and their health code inspected before they could enter. Only half the shops would open, the manager told the BBC, since some staff were still in quarantine. He said he was not too worried about another outbreak. ""We follow [the] government's rules, we do one major cleaning each day,"" he added. ""We do everything we can."" Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown.

"A shortage of GPs has left some areas of England having to cope with half the number of doctors than other areas, an analysis for the BBC has found. TheNuffield Trust data,externalshowed Portsmouth, Brighton, parts of Essex and Hull had the fewest GPs, with fewer than 50 GPs per 100,000 patients. That is the equivalent of more than 2,000 patients for every GP. It comes as patient groups warned access to doctors was becoming one of the biggest problems for the NHS. Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust, said: ""In an NHS founded on the principle of equal treatment, such stark differences represent a serious failing."" The two-fold variation in GPs holds even when the age and health of the local population is taken into account to factor in how often patients are likely to need a GP, the analysis showed. Yolanda Barker has multiple sclerosis. It means she needs more regular GP appointments than most. But she is finding it increasingly difficult to get the help she needs from her local practice in Kent. Yolanda, 50, says she can spend ""days on end"" trying to get through. ""They have an hour in the morning from 8am to 9am when you can make online appointments. If you miss that you have to resort to the phone. I've spent 40 or 50 minutes on hold trying to get through. Sometimes you can't - or you give up. ""I've resorted to looking at the internet to try to self-manage my problems. I've been suffering quite a lot of pain recently and have irritable bowel syndrome. ""But there are other things you need that I can't do myself - it could be that I need a change of medication or physio. ""It is great when you do get a face-to-face appointment, but even then it feels so rushed. It is like a conveyor belt."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England said a quarter of the complaints it handles from patients now relate to GP services. National Director Louise Ansari said: ""People are telling us about difficulties getting through to their local practice, with online booking systems, long waits on the phone and a lack of face-to-face appointments providing them with challenges. ""The lack of easy access puts people's health and wellbeing at risk, and increases demand on overstretched hospitals."" The sentiments were echoed by GPs working in the areas with the fewest doctors. Hull GP Dr Matthew Fortnam said: ""You have the perfect storm where we have the most need but the least capacity to deal with it. It creates inequity and actually perpetuates it."" The Royal College of GPs said there was a shortage of GPs, with increasing numbers walking away from the profession by retiring early or reducing their hours - less than two-thirds of the workforce now work full-time. The trend is undermining the government's efforts to recruit 6,000 extra GPs in England during this parliament, college president Dr Martin Marshall said. Latest data shows the number of qualified GPs has actually fallen slightly in recent years. While this data relates to England, similar pressures are being seen in the rest of the UK. Dr Marshall told the BBC the result was that workloads were growing, and the job was becoming ""undoable"". ""GPs can be seeing up to 50 patients a day. That's potentially unsafe. It's depressing - we know patients are not getting the service they want. The job is no longer enjoyable."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the government was ""working hard to support and grow the workforce"". She pointed out the number of trainee doctors was increasing, while other staff - such as practice nurses, physios and pharmacists - were also being invested in, to work alongside GPs.

"Holiday giant Tui is cancelling more flights as air passengers face ongoing disruption ahead of the Jubilee bank holiday weekend. Tui will cancel six flights a day until the end of June, affecting around 34,000 travellers in all. Other airlines have also cancelled flights, as around two million people prepare to fly over the next few days. One family, whose flight was cancelled with less than two days notice, said their children were ""devastated"". Joanna Chandramani said she, her husband and their seven-year-old twin girls had been set to fly to Turkey on Wednesday, but she got a text on Monday evening telling her their holiday was cancelled. She said Tui had now offered them vouchers but the family did not want to re-book with them so were flying with Jet2 to Mallorca instead. ""We have lost all faith in Tui,"" she added. The Chandramani family say they do not want to book with Tui again Tui said customers affected by cancellations would receive a full refund for their holidays ""as well as an extra gesture of goodwill"". The company said the cancellations represented about 4% of its flights. Tui said it understood the cancellations would be ""disappointing"" but added: ""We believe this is necessary to provide stability and a better customer service at Manchester Airport."" What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Thousands of passengers across the UK have had their flights cancelled or faced delays at airports when checking in and collecting baggage as the half-term break began. Before the Covid pandemic, airports and airlines across Great Britain employed around 140,000 people, according to Airlines UK. However, since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone, due to the restrictions on international travel. The industry has struggled to cope with a surge in flyers as demand picked up again, with many finding it difficult to recruit and train new staff quick enough. Prospect, the union which represents staff across air traffic control and in aviation engineering, warned that things could ""get worse before they get better"". The Airport Operators Association, which represents the industry, said big recruitment campaigns had been under way since before the start of this year and additional staff were now being deployed. It said most passengers were getting through security smoothly and the association would continue to work with the government to be ready for the summer. Have you been affected by travel issues? Email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Around 10,000 flights are set to leave the UK between Thursday and Sunday, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was working with the travel industry to tackle the problems. ""We put in place billions of pounds of support for the travel industry, in particular during the pandemic,"" he said. ""Right now there are conversations happening between the industry and ministers to make sure disruption can be eased."" But Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said: ""The government point to the furlough scheme but ignore that it ended well before the majority of international restrictions on travel came to an end."" Trade unions say airlines are struggling to recruit staff because jobs in the industry are not well-paid or secure enough and training new staff takes time. As a result the problems are likely to continue for some time. Michael Turner, a nurse from Shoreham, is currently on his third attempt to go on holiday with his family to Tenerife. Due to fly from Gatwick last Thursday, Mr Turner was told his EasyJet flight had been cancelled 20 minutes before departure. He re-booked a Tui flight which was all that was available and said he experienced ""absolute chaos"" in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. After boarding the plane, Mr Turner said its pilot called the police as no-one was able to get off for three hours. The family was then escorted to collect their baggage and put on a coach without being told where they were going and are now waiting to be taken back to the airport for a flight this evening. Manchester Airportsaid Tui and Swissport, which provides ground services such as baggage handling, ""are experiencing temporary staff shortages, in common with other aviation and travel companies"". A spokesperson for Swissport apologised for its part in any disruption, adding that the return of demand for flights was ""exacerbating resource challenges across the aviation industry."". A number of other airports reported high traffic on Tuesday. There were queues outside the terminal building at Edinburgh Airport on Tuesday morning Glasgow Airportsaid queues at security were ""longer than usual"" in the morning, though passengers moved through at a ""steady pace"". A spokesperson said the airport was ""busier than it has been for more than two years"" but urged people not to arrive early. AtEdinburgh Airportsome passengers had to wait outside the terminal building to check in luggage. Meanwhile,Stanstedis forecasting 80,000 passengers a day over the next week. Half-term holidays in shreds as flights cancelled Airport passengers urged not to arrive early There were also long waits for Eurostar train services at London's St Pancras station, with queues extending outside the building. Eurostar said one train was taken out of service earlier due to a technical fault, leading to delays of 30 to 60 minutes. A spokeswoman said queues were moving and staff were working hard to ensure check-in was as smooth as possible. Meanwhile, the RAC predicts drivers will make 19.5 million trips by car over the Jubilee bank holiday weekend, potentially clogging the roads. The motoring group said Friday is expected to be the busiest day, with the M25 forecast to be a hotspot. Southbound M5, A303 and A720 Edinburgh city bypass are all also being flagged as roads to watch for potential delays, with transport experts Inrix predicting traffic conditions could be worst in the mornings of the bank holidays. Inrix are advising drivers to start their journeys as early as possible or wait until later in the day to avoid any jams. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?

"Money was made available to deal with the backlog, but the NHS was not able to spend it all It may take seven years to get NHS Wales waiting lists of 700,000 back to 2020 levels, Wales' auditor general has said. Thenumber of patients waiting for non-urgent treatment has risen sharplysince February 2020, prior to the Covid pandemic. They include Michael Assender, 74, with severe back pain, one of 70,400 who've spent two years on a waiting list. The Welsh government said it had a plan to deal with backlogs. But Wales' Auditor General Adrian Crompton said: ""Just as the NHS rose to the challenge of the pandemic, it will need to rise to the challenge of tackling a waiting list which has grown to huge proportions. NHS waiting times in Wales hit record high again Patient spent four nights in A&E waiting for a bed ""Concerted action is going to be needed on many different fronts, and some long-standing challenges will need to be overcome."" After struggling with his back, Mr Assender, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, paid Â£1,500 for a private scan, which revealed he had two slipped discs. ""At the moment I'm coping pretty well, taking pills for the pain and trying to stay active,"" he said. ""But something that took me half hour before now takes an hour."" Mr Assender said he knew others waiting for surgery who had become depressed and considered taking their lives, adding: ""A lot of people out there are in a constant pain and I do pity them. ""It's a dire situation really."" The pandemic has exacerbated problems with waiting times in the Welsh NHS According to Mr Crompton's report, more than half those waiting may not even know what they are suffering from because they still have not had their first outpatient appointment. That means their care cannot be effectively prioritised. Mr Crompton called on Welsh Labour ministers to set ""ambitious delivery targets"", make long-term capital investments in NHS infrastructure, create a ""workforce plan"" and manage ""clinical risks and support for those waiting"". The report also included aweb tool,externalwhich allows people to compare waits for different health boards. It showed 701,418 patients waiting for treatment in total, and by March, 380,289 had been on a list for up to 26 weeks, and 168,502 for more than a year. Latest figures also show more than 70,400 waiting more than two years for treatment. Statisticians advise these are ""patient pathways"" and each patient may be on several lists, meaning the actual number of patients affected could be smaller. The report also lists a further 550,000 ""potentially missing"" referrals - higher than the Welsh government's own estimates of half a million - that could find their way back into the system. To tackle the backlog, the Welsh government made an extra Â£200m available to be spent by the end of the 2021/22 financial year, but the Welsh NHS only asked for Â£146m. Of this, Â£12.8m was returned to the Welsh government, as the health service did not have the staff or space to spend it within the timeframe. The Welsh government said: ""Working with health boards, we have set ambitious but realistic targets to tackle the pandemic backlog for planned care. ""This is backed by significant extra long-term funding. ""Our recovery plan, published last month, already sets out our plans to address the five recommendations of this report, including how we will support patients while they wait and create a sustainable workforce with effective leadership."" Health Minister Eluned Morgan toldBBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programmeshe expects to see waiting times decrease. ""We have shown how we want to employ an additional 12,000 people and spend an extra billion pounds,"" she said. ""We are, therefore, confident that we will go in the right direction and will be able to stick to the plan - which is to bring those figures down by the end of this parliament."" Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ""One-off, ring fenced injections of cash that are time limited do not allow the NHS to make necessary long-term investments in staff and capital required to meet the needs of the people of Wales."" He added the workforce is the ""number one limiting factor for NHS capacity"" and recruiting staff was a ""huge focus"". ""It makes for sobering reading and makes clear the enormity of the challenge ahead,"" Mr Hughes toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastwith Claire Summers. ""These are not just numbers, these are individual people's lives."" Surgeons are struggling to deal with growing waiting lists Vice president for Wales of the Royal College of Physicians Dr Olwen Williams said the workforce is a ""key limiting factor"", adding: ""If you can't recruit into the workforce, you can't spend the money."" Welsh Conservatives health spokesman, Russell George, said he hoped the report would be a wake-up call for the government. ""Labour need to get a grip on the NHS and stop breaking all the wrong records,"" he added. Rhun ap Iorwerth MS, Plaid Cymru's health spokesperson, said: ""To see that funds were unspent proves how unsustainable and under-staffed our NHS desperately is."" He added that the NHS ""needs to put on a more sustainable footing and we need a more comprehensive plan that addresses all stages of a patient's journey through the system"".

"This video can not be played Watch: Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown The Chinese city of Shanghai, the country's economic centre and a global trade hub, has eased Covid curbs after a two-month lockdown. At midnight local time (16:00 GMT Tuesday), restrictions were relaxed to allow most people to move freely around the city of some 25 million people. But at least 650,000 residents will remain confined to their homes. China's overall policy of ""zero Covid"" remains in place and people catching Covid face quarantine or hospital. Their close contacts also face the prospect of removal to quarantine and the area immediately around where they live being locked down again. ""This is a day that we dreamed of for a very long time,"" Shanghai government spokeswoman Yin Xin told reporters. ""Everyone has sacrificed a lot. This day has been hard-won and we need to cherish and protect it, and welcome back the Shanghai we are familiar with and missed."" But new rules have been introduced, with residents required to show a green health code on their smartphone to leave their residential compounds and to enter most places. Those who want to use public transport or enter banks or malls must have a negative PCR test certificate valid in the last 72 hours. And restrictions on leaving Shanghai remain, with anyone travelling to another city facing quarantine of seven to 14 days upon their return. Cinemas, museums and gyms remain closed. Most children will also not return to face-to-face schooling. People travel on a subway in the Jing'an district of Shanghai on the first day after restrictions eased But the rules did little to temper the relief people felt. Cheers and sounds of jubilation rose as the clock struck midnight on Tuesday, signalling the end of the lockdown. Groups of Shanghai residents gathered on street corners, singing and toasting with drinks as they welcomed their newfound freedom. ""We were locked down too many days. We need to celebrate. Not just me - all the Shanghai people here,"" one resident told the BBC. ""All the bad things [have] gone past, so tomorrow will be fine."" ""We are free. I am so happy, I want to work. I want to work tomorrow,"" said another. Chinese state media however downplayed the news of people celebrating because authorities had so far been reluctant to define the restrictions as a ""lockdown"". State media reports instead described Wednesday as ""a new start"" and the day of ""getting back to normal life, work and production"". Most of Shanghai's 25 million residents are now free to leave their homes Cautious signs of life appeared to be returning to the city as a basic service resumed on public transport, and shops opened, with larger ones operating at 75% capacity. Men in buttoned down shirts walked into flashy office towers - but not in the same numbers as before the outbreak, with many firms enforcing a staggered return to work. Joggers, cyclists, skaters and dog walkers defied the muggy heat to take over riverfront parks for a much-awaited breath of fresh air. It was supposed to last just nine days -a staggered lockdown to lessen the impact on Shanghai's economy, state media said. It lasted 65 days. It crippled the city and scarred its people. Restrictions are now being eased as quickly as they were imposed. There's no gradual process over several weeks. Instead there's a big bang - one day when most of the emergency rules and regulations are simply being lifted. The relief is immense - for generations of some families who've lived together behind a locked front door for more than two months; for workers who've lived in tents inside factories where they've carried on working; for the shop and restaurant owners whose livelihood ground to a halt; for the thousands of people forced to leave their homes and sent to quarantine centres. And for the almost 25 million people who live here. Read more here:Relief and caution as Shanghai returns to life The lockdown has seen many residents lose their incomes, struggle to find enough food and cope mentally with prolonged isolation. Manufacturers including Western car makers Volkswagen and Tesla have been particularly impactedby the restrictions as staff were kept away from factories or had to work in ""closed loop"" conditions, where they lived at the plants. The rigidity of the restrictions also caused much frustration in the city. ""Shanghai is such a good placeâ¦ but with all production, all business paused for two months?"" a woman in her 50s from Shanghai told the BBC. ""I hope these will all be resumed soon. I want my prosperous Shanghai city back."" That might take longer as the city reopens cautiously. Speakers were blaring outside an upscale mall, reminding people to wear masks and informing that their temperature would be checked and their health code inspected before they could enter. Only half the shops would open, the manager told the BBC, since some staff were still in quarantine. He said he was not too worried about another outbreak. ""We follow [the] government's rules, we do one major cleaning each day,"" he added. ""We do everything we can."" Cheers and beers as Shanghai eases lockdown.

"More than five million people across England are unable to book an appointment with a GP outside of working hours. BBC analysis of official data shows 10% of registered patients live in areas where there is no access to GPs on evenings and at weekends. Labour has accused the government of ""breaking its promises"". NHS England said it was still on target to provide access to extended care for all patients by 1 October. Our analysis shows: More than 22 million people - or 40% of patients registered with GPs - now have ""seven-day 8am to 8pm"" access to GPs - defined as full provision by NHS England Just over half the population have access to partial provision. This is when a GP practice can offer the minimum of ninety minutes of bookable appointments once a week Only two areas offer full provision to GPs for all patients Some 5.4 million people - or 10% of patients - had no access to GPs outside of normal working hours Former Prime Minister David Cameron made a promise everyone in England would have access to GP services seven-days a week by 2020,at the Conservative party conference in 2014.. The plans have since been brought forward.  From October, it will be mandatory for all Clinical Commissioning Groups to put in place arrangements for extended access to general practice. The latest data - from March and collated bi-annually from surveys filled out by GPs - shows widespread regional variation. In Sefton in Merseyside, for example, two thirds of patients had no access to GPs outside of working hours, the highest percentage in England. That compares to Herefordshire and Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, where every patient had access to full provision. A spokesman for NHS South Sefton CCG said extended access to general practice was ""not compulsory"", but it was ""undertaking a procurement exercise"" to roll services out from October. Self-employed, mother of three, Pragya Agarwal is registered at a GP practice commissioned by NHS Southport and Formby CCG. No practices provide a full 8am-8pm service, but 94% of patients have access to some form of partial provision. Pragya said it was often impossible to access a doctor's appointment. She said ""You call in the morning to make an appointment at literally one minute to 8am and it's impossible to get through, the lines are jammed straight away, everyone is trying to call at the same time and there just aren't enough appointments in the day. ""Then usually you're offered an appointment a week, eight to ten days aheadâ¦ the access to appointments is very limited. It's really difficult unless you sound really, really urgent."" Pragya said ""I hate to malign the NHS in any way, everyone works incredibly hard. Our local GP seems under a lot of pressure to meet deadlines, so when you do see someone for five to 10 minutes it's very rushed."" Olivia Djouadi, 46, from Bromley in south London, where 94% of patients have full access to extended hours appointments.  She is self-employed and cares for a disabled teenage son. ""I call for an appointment at 8 o'clock on a Monday morning and can be given an appointment for a couple of weeks time. ""At 8 o'clock, it seems they've booked all the slots for the day. If you are even slightly late, like 8.15, there is no chance of seeing someone that day. ""I've often been given an appointment for a couple of weeks time. I have diabetes and lots of medical needs so I can't really wait a couple of weeks. If I'm concerned, I will often go to the in-house GP at A&E ... and I sit and wait. ""I have a teenager in a wheelchair and work full-time, so I'd have to cancel his school day if I have to wait at A&E to see someone because I might not be back when his transport brings him home from school."" A spokesperson for NHS Rushcliffe CCG said it was proud of the extended hours service it provides, through '""vanguard funding"". In 2015, it became one of fifty 'vanguard' sites createdand funded by the NHS. The purpose was to bring together hospitals, community services, GPs and care homes to provide extended care. NHS Herefordshire CCG has been able to offer full extended access, through the GP Access Fund. Originally called the Prime Minister's Challenge Fund, it became one of twenty-one pilot areas funded in 2015 to provide extended GP hours. That has enabled Herefordshire to commission a GP Federation to provide three hub sites across the county, to provide seven-day a week service. Christine Price from Healthwatch Herefordshire, the independent champion for people who use health services in the county, said though people want convenience of care, how to get to services for those living in rural communities is an issue. Christine said ""People thought their own local GP would be open as part of extended access, but it's not realistic with twenty-four practices across the whole county. ""With limited transport between market towns and rural areas, the reality is not everyone can access services. ""If all patients wanted to use it, it wouldn't have the capacity for them to use it. ""People without money, friends and family nearby struggle to access services outside of their immediate area. It's not there for everyone in reality."" Doctors' groups have questioned the government's priority of extended access at a time when there is a critical shortage of GPs. In the recent British Medical Association's paper, Dr Richard Vautrey, its GP Committee chair, said the government should address ""increased demand and unmanageable GP workloads"". The Royal College of GPs said it wants to give patients access to services they need but states there are not enough GPs to provide this. Its chair, Helen Stokes-Lampard, has called for funding for an extra GP in every practice in England. Labour's Shadow Secretary of Health and Social Care, Jonathan Ashworth MP has been critical of the handling of the extended access scheme. He said ""This is yet more evidence that the Tories have broken their promises on access to GPs seven days a week. ""The truth is that years of austerity has taken its toll on general practice. We need a serious long term investment plan for primary care."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it had invested an extra Â£2.4bn a year into general practice by 2021. It said alternative data, recorded in May 2018, sourced monthly from Clinical Commissioning Groups, suggests 55% of the population now had access to 8am-8pm GP services.  NHS England has declined to release this data. A spokesman for NHS England said: ""The NHS is investing at least Â£258m this year to offer improved access to general practice, including evening and weekend appointments. This is ahead of schedule with appointments available to more than half the country now, and they will be available across the whole country by October this year."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it wants everyone to have access to evening and weekend GP appointments and ""already millions have benefitted"" from the plans. The BBC also analysed similar data from Wales and Scotland.  In Northern Ireland, there was no comparable data available. In Wales, five out of seven Health Boards provided no out-of-hours appointments after 18:30, in data provided by the Welsh government. GPs chose whether to provide 24-hour care for their patients or to transfer responsibility to local Health Boards. The Welsh government said its figures ""show more appointments are available for people at more convenient times"". In Scotland, 3% of patients are registered at a GP practice that has opted in to provide out-of-hours services, in data provided by the Information Services Division (ISD) on behalf of the Scottish Government. A Scottish Government spokesman said GPs were not contractually required to provide care, and it was the responsibility of local Health Boards. ""Everyone in Scotland has access to out-of-hours services - regardless of where they live,"" he added.

"Francois-Marie Dibon began his world-record breaking attempt on Tuesday morning. A Frenchman who had a fear of heights as a youngster is attempting to break the world record for the number of bungee jumps in 24 hours. Francois-Marie Dibon will do his final jump at Garry Bridge, Killiecrankie, Perthshire, at 10:00 on Wednesday. The record is currently held by Mike Heard, who completed 430 jumps at Auckland Harbour Bridge in May 2017. Mr Dibon, 44, will need to complete a jump every three and a half minutes to break the record. He said: ""I used to be afraid of heights, and bungee jumping is a very good cure. ""I found it's worth the effort to face your fears and overcome them. ""So I decided to put that statement to the test."" Francois-Marie Dibon will have to complete a jump about every 200 seconds to break the record Mr Dibon, an actuary who works in Stockholm, said it would be his ""pleasure to bring the record to Scotland."" He said: ""I love Scotland, and the French love the Scottish people. I have an amazing team here and a beautiful site. ""When you're on the edge and you're going to jump, the scenery is very important, and what I see is just wonderful."" As recently as March, Mr Dibon was suffering the equivalent of sea-sickness, due to the constant motion of going up and down on the elasticated bungee cord. However, he said he overcame this after completing 25 hours a week in the gym, focusing on cardio and core muscle stints, and learning breathing techniques. He said: ""We have been thinking about this for the last five-and-a half years, with ups and downs and some road-blocks on the way. ""Now the karma is good. The stars are aligned."" The Highland Fling Bungee jump-masters are working in four-hour shifts, winching Mr Dibon back up to the platform after every jump. He said: ""When needed, I will rest, we have built this into the plan. ""If there is a slight adjustment required or a bungee cord change, this can take 10 minutes. ""If that happens, I will lie down and take a micro nap.""

"A shortage of GPs has left some areas of England having to cope with half the number of doctors than other areas, an analysis for the BBC has found. TheNuffield Trust data,externalshowed Portsmouth, Brighton, parts of Essex and Hull had the fewest GPs, with fewer than 50 GPs per 100,000 patients. That is the equivalent of more than 2,000 patients for every GP. It comes as patient groups warned access to doctors was becoming one of the biggest problems for the NHS. Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust, said: ""In an NHS founded on the principle of equal treatment, such stark differences represent a serious failing."" The two-fold variation in GPs holds even when the age and health of the local population is taken into account to factor in how often patients are likely to need a GP, the analysis showed. Yolanda Barker has multiple sclerosis. It means she needs more regular GP appointments than most. But she is finding it increasingly difficult to get the help she needs from her local practice in Kent. Yolanda, 50, says she can spend ""days on end"" trying to get through. ""They have an hour in the morning from 8am to 9am when you can make online appointments. If you miss that you have to resort to the phone. I've spent 40 or 50 minutes on hold trying to get through. Sometimes you can't - or you give up. ""I've resorted to looking at the internet to try to self-manage my problems. I've been suffering quite a lot of pain recently and have irritable bowel syndrome. ""But there are other things you need that I can't do myself - it could be that I need a change of medication or physio. ""It is great when you do get a face-to-face appointment, but even then it feels so rushed. It is like a conveyor belt."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England said a quarter of the complaints it handles from patients now relate to GP services. National Director Louise Ansari said: ""People are telling us about difficulties getting through to their local practice, with online booking systems, long waits on the phone and a lack of face-to-face appointments providing them with challenges. ""The lack of easy access puts people's health and wellbeing at risk, and increases demand on overstretched hospitals."" The sentiments were echoed by GPs working in the areas with the fewest doctors. Hull GP Dr Matthew Fortnam said: ""You have the perfect storm where we have the most need but the least capacity to deal with it. It creates inequity and actually perpetuates it."" The Royal College of GPs said there was a shortage of GPs, with increasing numbers walking away from the profession by retiring early or reducing their hours - less than two-thirds of the workforce now work full-time. The trend is undermining the government's efforts to recruit 6,000 extra GPs in England during this parliament, college president Dr Martin Marshall said. Latest data shows the number of qualified GPs has actually fallen slightly in recent years. While this data relates to England, similar pressures are being seen in the rest of the UK. Dr Marshall told the BBC the result was that workloads were growing, and the job was becoming ""undoable"". ""GPs can be seeing up to 50 patients a day. That's potentially unsafe. It's depressing - we know patients are not getting the service they want. The job is no longer enjoyable."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the government was ""working hard to support and grow the workforce"". She pointed out the number of trainee doctors was increasing, while other staff - such as practice nurses, physios and pharmacists - were also being invested in, to work alongside GPs.

"This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris French authorities and Uefa blamed late arrivals and fraudulent tickets for chaotic scenes outside the Stade de France before Saturday's Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid. But Liverpool fans who spoke to the BBC described organisational failures, overcrowding and heavy-handed policing. On Monday, Uefacommissioned an independent reportinto the decision-making, responsibility and behaviour of all parties involved in the final. Here is what we know so far about how events unfolded. Michael Carter was among tens of thousands of Liverpool supporters gathered in a fan zone in the south-west of Paris ahead of the Champions League final. He recalled a ""top class"" atmosphere, without any trouble. As early evening approached, he and others with tickets travelled to the Stade de France in the north of the city, ahead of the scheduled kick-off at 21:00. Fans had been warned to get there early and Merseyside police, who had officers deployed as observers, would later describe the behaviour of most as ""exemplary"", saying they arrived in plenty of time and queued as directed. One of the train lines serving the stadium, the RER B, was not working, meaning many fans had to take the RER D. This meant they ended up at a single checkpoint at the perimeter outside the stadium. Mr Carter said the trouble started to begin when fans leaving the station were ""squeezed"" into a ""narrow alley"". Thegates opened at 18:00 local time(17:00 BST) but Liverpool fan Suzanne Gower, who arrived at 18:15, told the BBC that crowds were already so big it took them 35 minutes to move 100 metres (328 feet) at this point. The route from the Stade de France-St Denis RER stop to the stadium involves crossing two motorways, cramming fans into narrow underpasses. Some fans said they were searched multiple times, further adding to the delays, while police vans blocked part of the route to funnel supporters towards a ticket stop. Liverpool fan Matt Lomas said he saw people without tickets turned away at this point, but it took two hours to move 40 yards (36m). Michael Carter told the BBC that people further back in the queue ""were lifting each other up and over the walls because they were being crushed"". By the time he got to the police barricade, there were ""no ticket checks, they were just letting people through"" - including local youths who had been trying to snatch fans' bags and other possessions, he said. Thousands of fans were crammed into underpasses, taking hours to reach the stadium Mr Carter said at one point, people at this checkpoint were doused indiscriminately in what was thought to be pepper spray, causing the crowd to stampede backwards and leaving some of them vomiting as others rushed for water from neighbouring bars to ease the pain. Real Madrid fans on social media also reported long queues before kick-off, as well as disruption by local youths and an overwhelmed police force. When they finally reached the gates, fans described more chaotic scenes. Mr Carter said people were being manhandled through the turnstile without their tickets being scanned as the crowd pressed in on them, while videos showed others trying to jump the barriers. It got to the point where staff were pulling out women and children from the crowd to prevent them being crushed, he said. ""It shouldn't have to be 'save the women and children first' at a football match,"" Mr Carter said. Gates X and Y, two of the main entrances for Liverpool fans, were closed altogether at one point, said BBC News reporter Nick Parrott, who was at the stadium as a fan. He said about 1,500 to 2,000 people were waiting outside each gate. This video can not be played BBC reporter describes his experience entering the stadium for Champions League final Some people tried to get through gates A and B, but locals without tickets tried to force their way in at the same time, he said. He saw police punch one fan, who did not react, while using the spray on others. ""The safest place was to be in the ground, that's why the fans were trying to get in so much,"" Mr Parrott said. ""The police just seemed to go after anyone who moved."" While eyewitnesses felt police tactics were heavy-handed, a spokesperson for a police union said officers on the ground were overwhelmed. But Mathieu Valet, from senior police officers' union the SICP, told the BBC's Newshour the main issue was not ticketless fans or fake tickets, but ""three or four hundred French and undocumented delinquents who were there on the concourse of the Stade de France"". ""It's clear that we needed more police - we didn't have enough on the ground,"" Mr Valet said. A police officer is photographed spraying a cannister towards a Liverpool fan outside the gates He confirmed the use of tear gas, saying it ""unfortunately does not discriminate"". ""It's clear that families, children, mainly English supporters, were inconvenienced by tear gas, I know it's not part of your culture but it allows us to repel attackers,"" he said. Liverpool fans also said many of the crowd troubles were caused by locals, describing gangs of young people who tried to steal from the travelling football fans and rush the gates. Steve Rotherham, mayor of Liverpool City Region, was one of their victims. ""Like too many others, I had my phone and other belongings stolen by dippers [pickpockets] on the approach to the stadium,"" he said on Monday. Some eyewitnesses described gangs of young people hanging around outside the station after the match, saying they were mugging people and assaulting them without being challenged by police. Others said local trouble-makers made it inside the stadium. Mr Carter said that inside the Stade de France, several French youths attempted to steal Liverpool fans' seats. Inside the stadium, Suzanne Gower had arrived with nearly two hours to go before kick-off. ""The Liverpool side had no fans and the Madrid end was really full so you know something outside was happening,"" she said. Five minutes before kick-off was due,at 20:55 local time, Uefa announced that the start of the match was delayed""for security reasons"" until 21:15. Inside the stadium, signs said the delay was ""due to the late arrival of fans at the stadium"". Notices inside the stadium blamed the late arrival of fans for the delayed kick-off Thenat 21:14 Uefa announced a further delayto kick-off. Eventually,the match got underway at 21:36. Even then, there were many empty seats in the Liverpool end, with some fans reporting they were not able to get into the stadium until half-time. Liverpool fans say police lined up in front of them before the final whistle - but ignored the Real Madrid supporters' section. Chaos erupted again when the exit gates were opened, with Mr Carter saying local youths rushed the gates, while police fired what appeared to be tear gas into the crowd. Riot police lined up in front of Liverpool fans before the final whistle French interior minister Gerard Darmanin said the disruption was due to ""thousands of British 'supporters', without tickets or with counterfeit tickets"" who ""forced entry and sometimes assaulted the stewards"". But Ms Gower, a lawyer who worked on the inquests intothe Hillsborough disaster, said: ""The way this event was being policed was all wrong and incredibly dangerous."" And fan Adrian Tempanyreflected later,external: ""My experience at Stade de France on Saturday was the 2nd worst I've had at a football match, after Hillsborough."" ""In my opinion, French police and Uefa nearly caused a disaster,"" he added. The French government has suggested there were between 30,000 and 40,000 ticketless Liverpool fans who attempted to gain entry to the stadium. Mr Darmanin described it as ""massive, industrial-level ticket fraud"". There were several reports of legitimate tickets failing to scan or being rejected at the turnstiles, however. Peter Hooton, singer of Liverpool band The Farm, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he was attending as a guest of broadcaster BT Sport in a neutral part of the ground, where French, Spanish and British attendees all saw their mobile tickets repeatedly rejected. Uefa declined to give details of the anti-fraud measures used on the tickets at the Champions League final, saying: ""Tickets contain a number of security features and the design is different for every single competition."" But Prof Clifford Stott from Keele University, an expert in crowds and policing, cast doubt on the French authorities' claim. He said on Monday there was no apparent evidence for what would have been ""the largest-ever criminal conspiracy to produce and supply forged tickets at football"".

Debi delivers to those who cannot currently afford to feed their animals. She does the charity work on her own as well as being a full-time carer for her mum. She said she needs more support, space and money to help those that need it most.

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"A shortage of GPs has left some areas of England having to cope with half the number of doctors than other areas, an analysis for the BBC has found. TheNuffield Trust data,externalshowed Portsmouth, Brighton, parts of Essex and Hull had the fewest GPs, with fewer than 50 GPs per 100,000 patients. That is the equivalent of more than 2,000 patients for every GP. It comes as patient groups warned access to doctors was becoming one of the biggest problems for the NHS. Billy Palmer, of the Nuffield Trust, said: ""In an NHS founded on the principle of equal treatment, such stark differences represent a serious failing.""

Yolanda Barker has multiple sclerosis. It means she needs more regular GP appointments than most.

"""We rise together,"" reads a slogan over some of Wrexham's shopping streets Traders and residents have their fingers crossed that Wrexham can secure the UK's City of Culture 2025 title as it could lead to a major investment. There has been amixed responseabout what its new city status means as part of the Queen'sPlatinum Jubilee. But people told BBC Wales theculture crown finalistneeded to fill empty shop units if it was to lift prospects. It has generated more thanÂ£170mfor Coventry since it took the title in 2021. Could Wrexham be next? Wrexham FC has been creating one of the biggest dramas locally since Hollywood owners, actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, bought it in 2021, leading to new money, improved performances andmore fans,external. The team lost anine-goal thrilleron Saturday, stalling hopes of a fairy-tale ending with a return to the Football League after 14 years. Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds took control of Wrexham FC in February 2021 Wrexham looking to emulate City of Culture success Watch: Wrexham's old police station demolished The new city with a football stadium at its heart Away from the pitch, the City of Culture title ""would be a massive thing"" for wider Wrexham, according to local tour guide Phil Phillips. ""We know that it brings in a huge amount of money, not just for Wrexham but for the region,"" he said. Radio production student Alice Mitchell said despite a big student population from nearby Glyndwr University, the ""town"" had become quieter over the last three years so she hoped its cultural aspirations ""may bring more people here"". ""There is definitely a bigger buzz about the football stadium,"" she said. Having their say.... Alice Mitchell, Phil Phillips, Kerry Evans and John Griffin Wrexham's retail and leisure offering has long been in competition with neighbours Chester and Shrewsbury for visitors. More recently, it has also been competing against fellow City of Culture finalists Bradford, County Durham and Southampton, with the winner set to be announced soon. Wrexham born and bred John Griffin, 88, said its shopping streets have seen better days. ""I don't use the town very often,"" he said. ""It is a bit down, with a lot shops closing."" One of Wrexham's main shopping streets, busy with people He watched his first Wrexham match in 1944, aged 10. And he said he hoped the team would make it back into the Football League, prompting more regular crowds of 9,000-plus as seen this season. But that is still a far cry the day he and more than 34,000 other supporters cheered from the Racecourse stadium when Wrexham hosted Manchester United's Busby Babes in aFA Cup 4th round clash in 1957,external. ""It was a great day,"" he recalled, despite Wrexham's 0-5 thumping. Wrexham FC was founded in 1864, making it one of the oldest in the world, but it is not just the so-called beautiful game that has drawn people to the area. Muhammed Anwar (left): ""This is where I made my bread and butter"" Muhammed Anwar, who has been a market trader in Wrexham for 53 years, decided to settle here because it was ""nice and beautiful"". ""I always say 'I've got two mothers; one who gave birth to me, that's India, and the one who feeds me is Wales',"" he said. ""This is where I made my bread and butter. This is where my children grew up."" Kerry Evans, disability liaison officer at Wrexham FC, said: ""We've got a lot to be looking forward to in Wrexham. ""City of Culture is very, very exciting. ""I think it will be amazing for the town, now city, of Wrexham."" At Wrexham Bus Station, college student Tigan said the City of Culture tag ""could lift the area"" if it led to more investment, but she had more pressing concerns. ""Town is OK but there is an increasing amount of drug addicts,"" she said. ""Some come up to me and ask if I have any."" As well as its football stadium, Wrexham has other attractions such as Thomas Telford's toweringPontycysyllte Aqueduct, a world heritage site, with officialslooking at ways to attract more visitors. Pontcysyllte Aqueduct carries Llangollen Canal across the River Dee Wrexham's Carlsberg-Tetley brewery site has become a retail park but the old office remains Bosses reflect on Coventry's City of Culture year Wrexham 'so proud' to make City of Culture final And the newly crowned city centre has seen a number of infrastructure investments and redevelopments, with hopes for more, including anational football museum,external. The sprawling Carlsberg-Tetley brewery site - a major landmark in Wrexham - wasshut in 2000 and later flattened,external, as part of a new wave of edge-of-town retail developments including Island Green and Eagles Meadow. They were all watched over by the former high rise police station which was itselfdemolished in 2020, making way for another supermarket a stone's throw from two others. Eagles Meadow opened only a five or 10 minute walk from Wrexham's pedestrianised shopping streets in 2008. M&S relocated into one of the new retail units next to restaurants and a cinema complex. Wrexham's Debenhams store has since closed at Eagles Meadow Signage on closed shops promote the City of Culture bid Debenhams became a key unit until itsdemisea decade later.

Walking around Wrexham, visitors can spot empty retail units covered in promotion for City of Culture, with slogans such as ""We rise together"". Beauty store assistant Vicki Murt has seen the move to online shopping and said she was concerned Wrexham could still be on a ""slippery slope"" due to the empty units and a drop in customers. ""I'm not feeling much hope at the moment,"" she said. Mixed opinions... Barry Williams, Kyle Willis, Morgan Thomas and Vicki Murt Wrexham'shistoric indoor markets,externalhave also felt the pinch, which prompted a multimillion poundrethink. The former People's Market became Ty Pawb - Welsh for ""Everybody's House"" - with arts, food and entertainment, as well as shops and market stalls. Shop assistant and Wrexham FC supporter Kyle Willis said there was a good community spirit in Ty Pawb but the wider town centre ""needs something like the football club - it needs money"". Stallholder Imtiaz Hussain, who sells confectionary, said Saturday was usually ""heaving"" in Ty Pawb with live music drawing in customers, but other days could still be quiet. Morgan Thomas, events co-ordinator at Ty Pawb, said it was a pivotal part of Wrexham council's ""wider agenda to bring arts and culture to Wrexham, to regenerate the town centre, create jobs, attract tourism"".

"The pandemic, supply chain problems and the war in Ukraine have all had an impact on rising prices A Primark executive has told the BBC he ""regrets"" raising prices, as the fashion firm battles with rising costs. John Bason, finance director at Primark's parent company Associated British Foods, also warned some people might spend less as budgets are squeezed by the higher living costs. Primark is hiking prices across some of its range from this autumn. But Mr Bason said the company is still committed to ""affordability for everyone"". Across the UK economy, firms have been passing on higher energy, shipping and oil costs to customers. High Street chains including Next, Greggs and Superdry have all said they are raising prices. Primark to cut 400 store management jobs Next warns prices to rise by more than expected Why are prices rising so quickly? Primark hadpromised not to raise prices,externalfor its spring and summer collection. But while it is keeping that pledge, ABF recently announced that it will implement ""selective price increases"" across some of Primark's autumn and winter stock as it tackles spiralling costs. ""I do regret that we have to put some prices up,"" Mr Bason said. ""It is a reflection of the scale of the inflation that we're seeing."" Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -is at a 40-year-high. The pandemic, the supply chain disruption as the global economy rebounded, and the war in Ukraine have all impacted on rising prices. John Bason, finance director for Primark's parent company ABF, says costs are currently 'very high' ""Obviously Russia's invasion of Ukraine has really changed the economic environment and inflation in particular,"" Mr Bason said. ""We've worked hard to ensure that our prices stay where they are, but at some point the inflationary pressures is such that you do have to do something about it."" Mr Bason would not say how much prices will go up. However, he insisted that Primark was still ""the best value clothing fashion retailer"" in the UK. And said that, in an environment where other retailers were also raising prices, the gap - compared with others - could be maintained. Retail expert Jonathan de Mello said tightening household budgets due to the rising costs of food, fuel and energy are a huge problem for high street retailers. ""The cost of living crisis has achieved the dubious accolade of replacing Covid as the main concern for consumers currently, and as real incomes start to fall and prices rise further, retailers face yet another major headwind,"" he said. Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise Who is to blame for soaring prices? Mr de Mello added: ""These price increases will certainly impact less affluent consumers buying from Primark, who have already seen real incomes fall due to a combination of significantly higher energy prices, and food price inflation."" Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark does not sell its products online Mr Bason said: ""There are some consumers who would normally be spending more and probably would come into Primark, and I think there would be those that have very, very constrained budgets and probably would shop less with us as a result of this."" So far, however, Mr Bason said Primark is not seeing ""any major impact"" from the tightening of budgets. ""The footfall and the like-for-like sales that we're seeing in the UK have been on a strongly improving trend this year and that really is more about recovery from the pandemic,"" he said. ""People are travelling, people are going back to the office although probably not back to where it was, and people are socialising. So we're seeing a big pick up in sales relating to those activities."" Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark does not sell its products online. As a result,the business was hit hard by Covid restrictionswhile stores were closed. The group has recently revamped its website to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can browse the full collection and check availability before coming into stores. But Mr Bason said he is confident that the high street does have a future. Primark shopper numbers 'back to pre-Covid levels' Primark says stock woes could persist until 2023 ""Even though we were closed probably six months for the two main years of the pandemic, our customers have come back to us. That I think is very very striking,"" he added. ""So no, I think the demise of the high street is way overstated, but it is changing. There's no doubt over it."" Mr Bason is also confident that fast fashion can be green, with the chainannouncing new sustainability pledges last year. The pledges included a commitment to making Primark's clothes using recycled or ""more sustainably sourced materials"" by 2030. Mr Bason said that the soaring energy prices, fuelled by the Ukraine war, could act as a catalyst to greater energy efficiency as suppliers look to reduce their costs.

"The head of the European Commission rushed to Hungary earlier this month in a bid to unblock the oil proposal EU leaders meet on Monday for an extraordinary summit, but as one diplomat put it: ""What are we going to talk about?"" There are serious issues on the agenda, centred around the war in Ukraine. But it's doubtful the major, unresolved matter will specifically be up for discussion. That is the EU's beleaguered attempts to ban imports of Russian oil. It's now nearly a month since European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced her proposals. ""This will be a complete import ban on all Russian oil, seaborne and pipeline, crude and refined,"" she told the European Parliament. This video can not be played Watch: EU ban on Russian oil will not be easy, says von der Leyen It was to be an ""orderly"" transition, phasing out Russian crude within six months and refined products by the end of 2022. But resistance, notably from Hungary, has held up the EU's troubled sixth package of sanctions. Other landlocked countries, such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, have also asked for more time due to their dependence on Russian oil. Bulgaria, already cut off from Russian gas by Gazprom, has likewise sought opt-outs. But Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Hungarian government, which has compared an oil ban to dropping a nuclear bomb on its economy, is seen as the ultimate obstacle. He wrote to the European Council to say he didn't even want to discuss it next week. Diplomats are getting frustrated but they also concede that, with soaring energy prices, some countries may not be entirely unhappy that a decision is being blocked. More hard-line nations are clear that Europe must stop handing Russia billions in what they see as ""blood money"". However, there's also a feeling that Ursula von der Leyen has mishandled things, announcing plans before doing the necessary groundwork. Nevertheless, both she and the head of the European Council this week suggested a deal on oil might happen within days. That was ""absolutely bonkers"", remarked one EU diplomat: ""Charles Michel is setting his own European Council up for failure."" Little time is left with leaders gathering in Brussels on Monday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has voiced his anger at the delays: ""Of course, I am grateful to our friends who are promoting new sanctions,"" he said in Thursday's late night address. ""But where did those who block the sixth package get so much power? Why are they still allowed to have so much power, including in intra-European procedures?"" While sanctions are signed off at ambassador level, rather than at big EU summits, there had been hopes that the European Council might focus minds and force the issue. The extraordinary council was originally called, in part, because the pre-scheduled June summit felt a long way away, in the midst of a war on European soil. But items actually on the agenda, say diplomats, are principally things that are already bubbling along without the need for a major meeting. Officially up for discussion are financial support for Ukraine, food security, defence procurement and broader issues on the EU's energy transition. Draft conclusions, seen by the BBC, do refer to the phase-out of Russian fossil fuels while glossing over the specific issue of oil sanctions. ""Avoiding a debate is not very realistic,"" suggested one senior diplomat. The odds are that someone will bring it up: elephants in the room have ways of making themselves heard. The question is whether a debate turns into a bust-up. There is frustration that this delay is preventing other measures from going forward, given that the sixth sanctions package isn't just about oil. It also proposes expanding export controls and the list of individuals subject to asset freezes, as well as targeting Russia's majority state-owned Sberbank. Member states quickly signed off the other sanctions packages, including a phased embargo on Russian coal. Officials had talked proudly about how the EU had defied the old narratives about sluggish, tortured EU decision-making. And they had, until now. But in his letter this week the Hungarian leader warned Charles Michel that discussing the oil embargo would ""only highlight our internal divisions"". Phasing out Russian oil, he argued, would require ""a complete rearrangement of our refinery capacities"". Hungary argues it will need billions of euros to wean itself off Russian oil In other words, it's going to cost a lot of money, which has made some suspicious that Mr Orban is ultimately angling for more cash. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola is optimistic that Hungary is essentially adopting a ""negotiating stance"". However, funds recently earmarked to help with the EU's energy transition come from a pot of money that Hungary does not yet have access to. It's all part of a financial tug-of-war between Brussels and Budapest, over accusations that the Orban government is presiding over an erosion of democratic standards. His supporters argue Hungary is maligned for forging its own path and quite justified in resisting a ruinous oil ban without sufficient guarantees. Various ideas have been floated, such as putting price caps or tariffs on Russian oil to squeeze the Kremlin's revenues. Another recent proposal was cutting seaborne supplies first and leaving pipelines until later. But while it is widely accepted that some countries will need more time and support, each compromise brings its complications. EU ambassadors gather for a preparatory meeting on the eve of the summit. Most think this troubled sanctions package will get over the line at some point but this has been an embarrassing episode for the European Commission. How far it will have to water it down will dictate any further level of embarrassment.

"Oil prices have hit fresh highs after European Union leaders agreed on a plan to block more than two-thirds of Russian oil imports. Brent crude rose above $123 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest it has been for two months. Prices for oil and gas have soared in recent months, fuelled by the lifting of lockdowns and the Ukraine war. Rising energy costs are putting pressure on consumers, making it more expensive to heat homes and drive. Petrol hit a new record of 173.02p a litre on Monday, according to the AA. At the same time, the average price of diesel in the UK rose to 182.58p a litre, it said. Filling a typical 55-litre tank of a dieselnow costs more than Â£100. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Why can't the US stop soaring oil and gas prices? EU clinches compromise deal on banning Russian oil The war in Ukraine has pushed countries in the West to shun Russian energy supplies. Russia currently supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil and 40% of its gas. The EU pays Russia around â¬400bn (Â£341bn) a year in return. The ban agreed by EU leaders will see animmediate ban on Russian oil being transported into the bloc by sea. Two-thirds of Russian oil arrives by sea. However, the deal, which followed weeks of wrangling, includes a temporary exemption for pipeline oil following opposition from Hungary. Pledges by Poland and Germany to stop importing pipeline oil by the end of this year will raise coverage of the ban to 90% of Russian imports. Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil prices, has risen more than 70% over the past year. Oil prices climbed again on news of the EU embargo, with Brent crude reaching its highest level since March. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said confirmation that the EU will cut its purchases of Russian oil by the end of 2022 is pushing up prices because European countries now need to find alternative sources of supply. ""It is not feasible to replace that amount of energy with other fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass or nuclear, in such a short space of time, so the EU needs to find oil and gas from somewhere,"" Mr Mould said. Households to get hundreds off energy bills EU's awkward summit: Don't mention Russian oil ban ""This will not be easy because existing global output may well be on contract already, so competition for what is not on contract will now be hotter."" Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the upwards trajectory of oil prices may continue until Western countries outline clearly how supply is going to be sourced. ""It's possible this could get tougher before it gets better,"" she said. ""We know that rising energy costs are a particular challenge for households which already have severe pressure on their incomes, but smaller businesses shouldn't be left out of the equation either - this is a tough time to be heating offices, and at a time when it's meant to be about rebuilding resilience after the pandemic."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the compromise as a ""big step forward"" European Council chief Charles Michel said the deal cut off ""a huge source of financing"" for the Russian war machine. It is part of a sixth package of sanctions approved at a summit in Brussels, which all 27 member states have had to agree on. So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen. EU members spent hours struggling to resolve their differences over the ban on Russian oil imports. Hungary, which imports 65% of its oil from Russia through pipelines, resisted the new round of sanctions. The cost of living crisis being felt across Europe has not helped either. Sky-rocketing energy prices - among other things - have curtailed some EU countries' appetite for sanctions which could also hurt their own economies.

"The European Commission has given more details on how it plans to end Europe's dependence on Russian fossil fuels. Russia supplies 40% of the EU's natural gas and 27% of its imported oil. The EU sends the country roughly â¬400 billion a year in return. Now the EU plans to speed up its shift to green energy but says it must also invest in pipelines in other countries. It has been accused of helping fund the war in Ukraine through its use of Russian energy. TheREPowerEU strategy was first announced in Marchwith the stated aim of reducing Russian gas imports by two thirds in 2022. Rising energy costs have also put financial pressure on consumers and businesses in Europe now facing higher bills. The updated proposals outline not just how the EU plans to negotiate both the immediate gas crisis, but also deliver on promises to completely wean itself off Russian energy by 2030. The strategy focuses on three key topic areas. Improving energy efficiency, expanding the use of renewable energy and securing non-Russian suppliers of oil and gas. ""We are taking our ambition to yet another level,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said as she presented the update at a briefing in Brussels, Belgium. How reliant is the world on Russia for oil and gas? Can Africa replace Russian gas supplies to Europe? Why are prices rising so quickly? The REPowerEU plan is estimated to cost â¬210 billion (Â£178 billion) over the next five years. The Commission report highlights energy saving as the ""cheapest, safest and cleanest"" way to reduce dependence on Russian fuel. It wants to improve how buildings of insulated, as well as encourage consumers to be more aware of energy use. It also plans to speed up the transition from fossil fuel burning boilers to electric heat pumps (a device that absorbs heat from the air, ground or water around a building) Plans to reduce energy consumption in the EU have also made more ambitious, from the original plan of a 9% cut to 13% cut by 2030. The bloc has earmarked â¬113 billion for a ""massive scale up in renewables"" and new hydrogen infrastructure. New EU legislation is being proposed to make it easier to build solar and wind farms. ""Whenever we talk about rapid deployment of renewables, there is an elephant in the room-  getting a permit,"" said Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission. ""It might take as long as nine years for wind and up to four years for solar projects, so this is time that we do not have and we have to speed things up,"" he added. The Commission has proposed specially designated ""go-to"" areas where permission can be given in just one year. Certain new buildings could also be required to have solar panels installed on the roof. The EU target for renewable energy has also been more raised. The goal is for green energy to provide 45% of energy needs by 2030, up from 40%. Even if they are fast-tracked in special zones, new wind and solar plants will still take time. To quickly diversify from Russian fossil fuels, the EU is investing up to â¬12 billion in pipelines and Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) terminals to improve access to gas and oil from other countries including Egypt, Israel and Nigeria. Some environmental groups have criticised the news. Instead they want to see a decisive break with fossil fuels. ""The European Commission's latest strategy gives with one hand and takes with the other,"" said Eilidh Robb, an anti-fossil fuels campaigner at Friends of the Earth. ""So-called REPowerEU contains useful and necessary strides towards renewable solutions but it simultaneously enables almost 50 fossil fuel infrastructure projects and expansions,"" she added.

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external.

"This video can not be played Watch: EU plans to ban 90% of all Russian oil imports by 2023 - Ursula von der Leyen EU leaders say they will block most Russian oil imports by the end of 2022 to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine. The EU-wide ban will affect oil that arrives by sea - around two-thirds of imports - but not pipeline oil, following opposition from Hungary. Poland and Germany have also pledged to end pipeline imports, meaning a total of 90% of Russian oil will be blocked. European Council chief Charles Michel said the deal cut off a huge source of financing for the Russian war machine. It is part of a sixth package of sanctions approved at a summit in Brussels, which all 27 member states have had to agree on. Russia currently supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil and 40% of its gas. The EU pays Russia around â¬400bn ($430bn, Â£341bn) a year in return. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen. The UK - which gets 8% of its oil needs from Russia - has pledged to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Oil prices climbed on news of the EU embargo, withBrent crude rising above $123 a barrel, its highest level since March. Russian seaborne oil to be banned by the end of the year, with a temporary exemption for pipeline oil. Two-thirds of Russian oil arrives by sea Pledges by Poland and Germany to stop importing pipeline oil will raise coverage of the ban to 90% of Russian imports Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, to be cut off from the Swift payment system, which allows the rapid transfer of money across borders Three more Russian state-owned broadcasters banned More restrictions on ""individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine"" EU members spent hours struggling to resolve their differences over the ban on Russian oil imports. Hungary, which imports 65% of its oil from Russia through pipelines, was its main opponent. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The compromise followed weeks of wrangling until it was agreed there would be ""a temporary exemption for oil that comes through pipelines to the EU"", Mr Michel told reporters. Because of this, the immediate sanctions will affect only Russian oil being transported into the EU over sea - two-thirds of the total imported from Russia. But in practice, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the scope of the ban would be wider, because Germany and Poland have volunteered to wind down their own pipeline imports by the end of this year. Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Can Africa replace Russian gas supplies to Europe? ""Left over is around 10-11% that is covered by the southern Druzhba,"" Ms Von der Leyen said, referring to the Russian pipeline supplying oil to Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The European Council would revisit this exemption ""as soon as possible"", she added. A senior EU official confirmed that the three landlocked countries were given an additional guarantee that they could obtain supplies of seaborne Russian oil in the event of an interruption to pipeline supply. The Russian ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, said Brussels had ""already approached the limits of what is possible in terms of sanctions"". Speaking to Russian state TV, he predicted ""serious problems"" if the EU were to try to agree on a gas embargo. The ban on Russian oil imports was initially proposed by the European Commission - which develops laws for member states - a month ago. But resistance, notably from Hungary, held up the EU's troubled latest round of sanctions. Mr Orban declared the agreement a victory for his country, telling Hungarians they could sleep soundly - protected from expensive fuel costs that the embargo would bring to the rest of Europe. ""We succeeded in defeating the proposal of the European Council which would have forbidden Hungary from using Russian oil,"" he said in a Facebook video. Other landlocked countries, such as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, also asked for more time due to their dependence on Russian oil. Bulgaria, already cut off from Russian gas by Gazprom, had likewise sought opt-outs. The cost of living crisis being felt across Europe has not helped either. Sky-rocketing energy prices - among other things - have curtailed some EU countries' appetite for sanctions which could also hurt their own economies. The EU's oil agreement is a compromise deal - but it's also an important one. Moscow is heavily reliant on its energy exports, and the EU says this deal will cut more than 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of the year. But considering all the sabre-rattling and anti-Western rhetoric we've been hearing from Vladimir Putin in recent weeks, I suspect the Russian leader is more likely to say to Europe: ""Get ready for some more economic pain because of this embargo. Let's see how long your support for Ukraine lasts."" The Kremlin is aware of the differences of opinion within the EU over what to do about Russia - and you can be sure that Putin is going to try to exploit them. Russia will look for new markets, but in terms of oil that's not a quick fix. The infrastructure isn't in place to reorient oil exports from Europe to Asia, for example. And if it does sell to Asia - it will have to do so at a discounted price. There's also the question of Russian gas - an embargo on that could be discussed next. This video can not be played Watch: The BBCâs Steve Rosenberg examines what Russian papers are saying about sanctions Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who dialled into the summit, urged EU countries to stop their internal ""quarrels,"" stating that they only helped Moscow. ""All quarrels in Europe must end, internal disputes that only encourage Russia to put more and more pressure on you,"" Mr Zelensky said via video-link. Latvia's Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said member countries should not get ""bogged down"" in their own personal interests. ""It's going to cost us more. But it's only money. The Ukrainians are paying with their lives,"" he said. Russia cut off gas supplies to Dutch firm GasTerra on Tuesday for refusing to pay for supplies in roubles. The EU has said paying in Russian currency breaches sanctions and Gazprom has already cut supplies to Poland, Finland and Bulgaria. MILITARY STATUS:What might swing the Ukraine war?

Other airlines have also cancelled flights, as around two million people prepare to fly over the next few days. One family, whose flight was cancelled with less than two days notice, said their children were ""devastated"". Joanna Chandramani said she, her husband and their seven-year-old twin girls had been set to fly to Turkey on Wednesday, but she got a text on Monday evening telling her their holiday was cancelled. She said Tui had now offered them vouchers but the family did not want to re-book with them so were flying with Jet2 to Mallorca instead. ""We have lost all faith in Tui,"" she added. The Chandramani family say they do not want to book with Tui again Tui said customers affected by cancellations would receive a full refund for their holidays ""as well as an extra gesture of goodwill"". The company said the cancellations represented about 4% of its flights. Tui said it understood the cancellations would be ""disappointing"" but added: ""We believe this is necessary to provide stability and a better customer service at Manchester Airport."" What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Thousands of passengers across the UK have had their flights cancelled or faced delays at airports when checking in and collecting baggage as the half-term break began. Before the Covid pandemic, airports and airlines across Great Britain employed around 140,000 people, according to Airlines UK. However, since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone, due to the restrictions on international travel. The industry has struggled to cope with a surge in flyers as demand picked up again, with many finding it difficult to recruit and train new staff quick enough. Prospect, the union which represents staff across air traffic control and in aviation engineering, warned that things could ""get worse before they get better"". The Airport Operators Association, which represents the industry, said big recruitment campaigns had been under way since before the start of this year and additional staff were now being deployed. It said most passengers were getting through security smoothly and the association would continue to work with the government to be ready for the summer. Have you been affected by travel issues?

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was working with the travel industry to tackle the problems. ""We put in place billions of pounds of support for the travel industry, in particular during the pandemic,"" he said. ""Right now there are conversations happening between the industry and ministers to make sure disruption can be eased."" But Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said: ""The government point to the furlough scheme but ignore that it ended well before the majority of international restrictions on travel came to an end."" Trade unions say airlines are struggling to recruit staff because jobs in the industry are not well-paid or secure enough and training new staff takes time. As a result the problems are likely to continue for some time. Michael Turner, a nurse from Shoreham, is currently on his third attempt to go on holiday with his family to Tenerife. Due to fly from Gatwick last Thursday, Mr Turner was told his EasyJet flight had been cancelled 20 minutes before departure. He re-booked a Tui flight which was all that was available and said he experienced ""absolute chaos"" in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. After boarding the plane, Mr Turner said its pilot called the police as no-one was able to get off for three hours. The family was then escorted to collect their baggage and put on a coach without being told where they were going and are now waiting to be taken back to the airport for a flight this evening. Manchester Airportsaid Tui and Swissport, which provides ground services such as baggage handling, ""are experiencing temporary staff shortages, in common with other aviation and travel companies"". A spokesperson for Swissport apologised for its part in any disruption, adding that the return of demand for flights was ""exacerbating resource challenges across the aviation industry."". A number of other airports reported high traffic on Tuesday. There were queues outside the terminal building at Edinburgh Airport on Tuesday morning Glasgow Airportsaid queues at security were ""longer than usual"" in the morning, though passengers moved through at a ""steady pace"". A spokesperson said the airport was ""busier than it has been for more than two years"" but urged people not to arrive early. AtEdinburgh Airportsome passengers had to wait outside the terminal building to check in luggage. Meanwhile,Stanstedis forecasting 80,000 passengers a day over the next week. Half-term holidays in shreds as flights cancelled Airport passengers urged not to arrive early There were also long waits for Eurostar train services at London's St Pancras station, with queues extending outside the building. Eurostar said one train was taken out of service earlier due to a technical fault, leading to delays of 30 to 60 minutes. A spokeswoman said queues were moving and staff were working hard to ensure check-in was as smooth as possible. Meanwhile, the RAC predicts drivers will make 19.5 million trips by car over the Jubilee bank holiday weekend, potentially clogging the roads. The motoring group said Friday is expected to be the busiest day, with the M25 forecast to be a hotspot. Southbound M5, A303 and A720 Edinburgh city bypass are all also being flagged as roads to watch for potential delays, with transport experts Inrix predicting traffic conditions could be worst in the mornings of the bank holidays. Inrix are advising drivers to start their journeys as early as possible or wait until later in the day to avoid any jams. What are my rights if my flight is cancelled or delayed?

"One in five pupils in England are eligible for free school meals, according to the most recent data More children should be given free school meals to help tackle the ""devastating reality"" of the cost of living crisis in England, teachers say. All children from families who receive universal credit should be eligible as part of an ""urgent"" expansion of the scheme, 11 educational groups said in a letter seen by the BBC. Around one in five pupils - 1.7 million children - receive free school meals. The government said it recognised households were struggling. It said it had expanded access to the meals more than any other government in recent decades. Warning over shrinking school meals as prices rise Budget pasta prices jump 50% as food staples rise How many children need free meals? The prices of food, fuel and other goods have surged in recent months in the UK, pushing inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to a 40-year high. Measures the government have announced to try to tackle the rising cost of living includea Â£400 energy bill discount for every household. But the joint letter, sent to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi by education unions and other organisations claiming to represent one million school staff in England, said vulnerable children not receiving free school meals were facing a ""real barrier to learning"". ""We see the devastating reality of children coming to school unable to afford to buy lunch, because their family circumstances means they fall outside the restrictive free school meal eligibility criteria,"" it said. In England, all infant state school pupils up to Year Two can get free school meals during term time. For English pupils in Year Three and above, those living in households on income-related benefits (such as universal credit) are eligible, as long as their annual household income does not exceed Â£7,400 after tax. That figure does not include welfare payments. In Northern Ireland the cap is set at Â£14,000 a year. ScotlandandWaleshave recently committed to rolling out free school meal provision to all primary pupils. Rachel Bresnahan runs a free holiday club in Stockport, to help children stay well-fed during half-term The latest call for change follows footballerMarcus Rashford's successful campaignto extend free school meal vouchers into school holidays during the pandemic. An estimated 2.6 million children in the UK live in households that missed meals or struggled to access healthy food during April, according to data from the Food Foundation charity. Rachel Bresnahan, who works for a community group in Stockport, the Cherry Tree Project, told BBC News many people who rely on the project live in food poverty, but their children are not eligible for free school meals. ""Our food banks have always run in the mornings, and suddenly people are asking if they can come at night - because people who are working full-time still can't make ends meet,"" she said. Emma, who wants to remain anonymous, says she and her husband were both on universal credit, but their eight-year-old son does not qualify for free school meals. The mother-of-three, from Kent, says she hasn't eaten three meals a day for months because she wants to make sure she can afford food for her son and other younger, pre-school children. ""A few weeks back my eight-year-old got two bowls out for breakfast and I said: 'Don't have two bowls, that is just being greedy,' and he said: 'They're not both for me mum, one of them is for you as I haven't seen you eat in days.',"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Emma, who currently has three jobs, says she pays Â£70 every six weeks to cover the cost of school dinners for her son: ""It is expensive and with all the other price increases that we are facing now, it is just one big headache."" How will I get the Â£400 promised for energy bills? All primary school kids in Wales to get free school meals Rashford and top chefs demand school meals review Dr Nick Capstick, head teacher of Drove Primary School in Wiltshire and a signatory to the letter, says children are missing more school because of ""illness and poor oral hygiene caused by inadequate diet"". Dr Capstick, who is also chairman of an independent working group, the School Food Review, told the Today programme: ""It's increasingly common that children will come in having not eaten from the night before and also being quite confused, disorientated, and really lacking in energy to have a really productive day at school. ""Universal free schools meals is a simple way of eradicating this situation."" Other signatories to the letter include leaders of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), the National Education Union (NEU), the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) and the teachers' union, NASUWT as well as Teach First and the Confederation of School Trusts. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise that millions of households across the UK are struggling to make their incomes stretch to cover the rising cost of living, which is why, in addition to the over Â£22bn announced previously, we are providing over Â£15bn in further support, targeted particularly at those with the greatest need. ""The holiday activities and food programme runs during major school holidays, and wider welfare support is available through the household support fund, which helps vulnerable families in need with essentials, such as food and utility bills.""

"This video can not be played Watch: EU ban on Russian oil will not be easy, says von der Leyen The EU has proposed some of its toughest measures yet against Russia, including a total ban on oil imports and sanctions on war crimes suspects. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the package was aimed at maximising pressure on Russia while minimising damage to Europe. Russian crude oil would be phased out within six months, she said. Hungary has rejected the proposal as unacceptable and the Czech and Slovak governments want a transition period. The EU has been focusing for weeks on how to wean itself off Russian oil and gas. It has already pledged to reduce gas imports by two-thirds by the end of 2022 and now plans to phase out crude oil over six months and refined products by the end of 2022. ""We will make sure that we phase out Russian oil in an orderly fashion,"" the Commission president said. The package first has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. But Hungarian government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said his country would veto it in its current form: ""They exactly know that what they are proposing is against Hungarian interests... and if we do that we are completely going to ruin the Hungarian economy."" Slovakia as well as Hungary currently relies on Russian oil and under the initial proposal would be given until the end of 2023 to find alternative suppliers. Slovakia's economy minister said his country wanted a three-year transition period, while Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said he would also seek a two-to-three year exemption to tackle problems with pipeline capacity. Last year, Russia supplied the EU with a quarter of its oil imports, and the Netherlands and Germany were the biggest buyers. The Dutch government has said it wants to halt all Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of this year and Germany has drastically reduced its reliance on Russian oil imports, down from 35% to 12%. The UK, which is no longer in the EU, is already phasing out Russian oil, which accounts for 8% of its imports. German Economics Minister Robert Habeck has said the six-month transition period gives Berlin long enough to make the change. The problem for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic is that they are all landlocked and rely on their neighbours for fuel supplies. Czech special envoy for energy security Vaclav Bartuska told the BBC that Europe was currently trying to redraw the map of energy supplies as fast as it could: ""We want to get rid of Russian crude once and for all and we want to be absolutely sure there'll be no need to go back and ask Russia again."" How Germany is getting rid of Russian oil Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow was working on various options in response to the planned embargo. Sanctions were a double-edged sword for the Europeans and others, he said, as the cost for European citizens would increase every day. Oil prices rose by 5% on news of the EU plan to $110 a barrel of Brent Crude. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a video briefing on social media thatthe gradual EU ban on oil was ""better than nothing"",external. Any country that opposed the oil embargo was complicit in Russia's crimes in Ukraine, he said, whatever their arguments. As well as seeking a ban on Russian oil, the EU Commission president announced that sanctions would be imposed on military officers involved in suspected war crimes in Bucha and Mariupol. ""This sends another important signal to all perpetrators of the Kremlin's war: We know who you are, and you will be held accountable,"" Ms von der Leyen told the European Parliament on Wednesday. There are plans for a broad ban on three of the biggest Russian state-run broadcasters. ""We have identified these TV channels as mouthpieces that amplify Putin's lies and propaganda aggressively,"" Ms von der Leyen said. Although the three networks were not named, they are thought to include the widely watched Russian-language Rossiya and RTR Planeta channels of state-owned operator VGTRK. The EU has already suspended two networks, RT and Sputnik, that broadcast in English, German and Spanish. A ban would also be imposed on providing European services to Russian companies through accountants, lawyers and spin-doctors, she said. Earlier sanctions have already hit Russian banks but the biggest bank of all, Sberbank, has been left off the list because it was considered necessary for paying for Russian gas. Sberbank makes up over a third of Russia's banking sector and is now set to be removed from the SWIFT global financial messaging system. Two other Russian banks are included in the proposals. Previous sanctions packages have also targeted a number of individuals linked to the Kremlin and the invasion, and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, is said to be on the latest list. He has given his full support to the war, prompting Pope Francis to warn him not to become ""Putin's altar boy"". KYIV:Ukrainian villages haunted by the vanished ENERGY:EU divided over how to step away from Russian energy WATCH:The southern villages holding back the Russians READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external The Commission president also gave details of plans to help Ukraine tackle the vast costs of the war and the impact on its economy. Explaining Europe's ""very special responsibility towards Ukraine"", she said Ukraine needed to fund the dramatic fall in its economic output and wider reconstruction. A recovery package would be drawn up that could tackle weaknesses in the Ukrainian economy and help fight corruption, she said. ""We want Ukraine to win this war, but we also want to set the conditions for Ukraine's success in the aftermath of the war."" In a separate move, the EU also promised to increase military aid to neighbouring Moldova, which is under threat from Russian soldiers based in the breakaway Moldova region of Transnistria.  ""We will continue to deepen our partnership with you to bring your country closer to the EU,"" European Council President Charles Michel told Moldova's pro-EU president, Maia Sandu, in Chisinau.

"Fashion brand Missguided has appointed administrators after suppliers filed to shut it down over unpaid debts. The retailer with about 330 staff has asked Teneo Financial Advisory to sell its business and assets. Missguided has been hit by supply chain costs, rising inflation and ""softening"" consumer confidence in an increasingly tough market, Teneo said. One marketing expert said rival brands were better, cheaper and faster and shoppers now care about sustainability. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Get Savvy marketing agency added: ""The fast fashion shopper is growing up, spending elsewhere and in new categories."" Teneo said Missguided would continue to trade while it looked for a buyer. Gavin Maher from Teneo said there was ""a high level of interest from a number of strategic buyers"". Rival fast fashion brand Boohoo is rumoured to be among potential suitors. Mr Maher thanked Missguided staff and other key stakeholders for their ""support at this difficult time"". Missguided issued with a winding-up petition by creditors The Manchester-based business was founded by Nitin Passi in 2009. It grew to become one of the UK's biggest online fashion players. But in the last few years, it has struggled to make a profit and was rescued last autumn by the finance firm Alteri Investors. Mr Passi stepped down as CEO in April and this administration comes after supplier JSK Fashions issued a winding up petition on 10 May. Last week,a report in the i newspaper,externalsaid that three of Missguided's suppliers warned they were at risk of going under due to outstanding payments. ""It's a saying that cash is king in business and if reports are to be believed then that's a factor in Missguided's troubles,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at insolvency firm Begbies Traynor. ""If true, tales of suppliers being asked to give discounts, or struggling to extract payment, point to a company facing a cash flow crisis,"" she said. The cost-of-living crisis means shoppers are reining in spending on non-essentials like the fast fashion Missguided offers, she said. ""While Missguided boomed when we were locked down with no opportunity to spend wages going out, the harsh realities of post-pandemic life are becoming clear,"" she said. ""Rising inflation and worries about the potential for a recession mean that people just aren't willing to spend on what they don't need. ""Hopefully a buyer will see the potential in this company that means its suppliers continue to find an outlet for their products."" Missguided has previously provided outfits for Love Island but this year the show has partnered with eBay to source second-hand clothes Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive of Get Savvy marketing agency, said the fast-fashion industry as a whole was under huge cost pressures. But it was also having to work harder to engage with shoppers who were increasingly focused on sustainability. ""The cost-of-living squeeze is starting to make a difference to younger shoppers meaning they are going out less, and spending less on clothing they just aren't engaging with fast fashion brands in the way they used to be."" She added: ""The bottom line is that Missguided were up against other players who are simply better, cheaper and faster in this space - notably Boohoo."" Online-only retailer Boohoo bought up swathes of High Street stores that collapsed during the pandemic. Among the many brands it owns are PrettyLittleThing, NastyGal and MissPap, which contribute to the increasing competition faced by Missguided. But fashion business educator Maria Malone told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money there was also a shift away from throwaway fashion. ""It had a phenomenal rise, sponsoring cultural icons like Love Island,"" she said. ""This year the show is featuring pre-owned clothing. Turning its back on fast fashion, that's the problem really, the customer has changed. ""Its rivals have diversified, Missguided stuck with fast fashion, there's now a movement away from that. At every level of society people are questioning fashion, there's a massive market now in slow fashion, sustainability, up cycling and repairing.""

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will govern with a majority in the House of Representatives Australia's new Labor government has secured a majority in parliament, election analysts say. The centre-left party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, defeated Scott Morrison's conservative coalition in an election on 21 May. A record vote for independents and minor parties had made it uncertain whether Mr Albanese would govern in his own right. But he now has the 76 lower house seats needed, after victories in tight races. It is a different story in the Senate, where Mr Albanese's government will need crossbench support to pass laws. About a third of Australians voted for candidates outside the major parties, with support surging for the Greens and independents running on climate platforms. Mr Albanese has promised a ""constructive relationship"" with the expanded crossbench, despite not needing to rely on their votes in the House of Representatives. Two seats there remain undecided. He will announce his cabinet on Tuesday. Albanese vows unity after election win Meet Australia's new prime minister The moment that changes Australia The veteran politician, who heads Australia's first Labor government in almost a decade, has promised to adopt more ambitious emissions reduction targets. However, he has so far refused calls to phase out coal use or to block the opening of new coal mines. Mr Albanese flew to Tokyo last week for a summit with the leaders of Japan, India and the US, known as the Quad. His government is also aiming to shore up ties in the Pacific in the face of growing Chinese influence. Foreign Minister Penny Wong made a trip to Fiji within days of being sworn in. Her visit came as China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi embarked on a tour of small Pacific nations, hoping to secure trade and security deals. Last month, China and the Solomon Islands agreed a security pact that sparked fears in Australia and the US that Beijing could build a naval base in the region.

"People in Severodonetsk are warned not to leave bomb shelters and to prepare masks to protect against toxic fumes after a nitric acid tank is hit, the regional governor says Serhiy Haidai says much of the eastern Ukrainian city is now controlled by Russians Nearly all critical infrastructure and 90% of its housing is destroyed, he says There's been a shutdown of all communications in southern Kherson, officials say But in his nightly address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says forces have had some success there, and are advancing around Kharkiv EU leaders reach agreement to ban 90% of oil imports from Russia but are split over gas imports They met for a two-day summit in Brussels to discuss sanctions against Russia Moscow now occupies almost all of the Luhansk region, as it focuses on seizing the whole of Donbas in the east Edited by Claire Heald Thank you for joining our live coverage today. We'll leave you with the latest developments in the war in Ukraine:  Todayâs live page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owens,
Claire Heald and Tiffany Wertheimer. The writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Gareth
Evans, Jack Burgess, James Harness, Sam Hancock and Victoria Lindrea. Join us tomorrow. General David Petraeus Over 20,000 Russian troops may have been killed during the Ukraine conflict, says retired US General David Petraeus. This is ""many multiples of what they lost in nine years in
Afghanistan"", he says. Russia's last estimate of its troop losses was 1,351, given on 25 March. This war is approaching 100 days duration. Speaking to the BBC, he says he's not surprised by Ukraine's ability to repel Russian forces. Ukraine ""performed above even the highest of expectations most of us had"". On Russia's effectiveness in the war, Petraeus is very critical: ""No one predicted Russia's sheer incompetence, at every single level,"" he says. However, on Severodonetsk he is less upbeat about Ukraine's situation: ""At some point, the Ukrainians may have to withdraw to fight another day."" And Russia seizing the city would be significant in the psychological ""war of ideas"", says Petraeus. He is sceptical about Russia's offer to escort cargo ships of wheat out of Ukrainian ports. ""They said they would do that if we lift the sanctions
and there's no way that we're going to lift the sanctions,"" he says. And any idea of Western forces sending in ships to force a way through the Black Sea is ""dead on arrival"", he says, because "" you're going to sail into a direct conflict with Russia"". James WaterhouseReporting from Poltava Hlib Stryzhko suffered a broken pelvis and jaw when he came under attack from a Russian tank Hlib Stryzhko endured psychological torture and was denied medical treatment for a broken pelvis and jaw. Yet somehow, he made it home. In a hospital bed in the Ukrainian city of Poltava, he tried to sit up. The 25-year-old soldier's pelvis was supported by metal scaffolding - one of his many injuries sustained while trying to defend Mariupol, nearly 500km (310 miles) to the south. As his mother Olesya helped him he grimaced with pain, but seemed eager to share his story nevertheless. ""Turning my head, I saw that a tank was aimed at me,"" he recalled. ""When a tank fires, there is no time between exit and arrival. It happens instantaneously. I saw a bright flash."" Read the full story here. Ukrainian President Zelensky visiting frontline positions in Kharkiv on Sunday Ukraine's forces have had some success near the southern city of Kherson and are advancing in parts of the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, Reuters reports. Zelensky praised his military's ""utmost courage"" and says they ""remain masters of the situation at the front"". The Ukrainian president did however say Russian forces have a ""significant advantage"" in terms or equipment and numbers. Ukrainian officials are reporting a ""shutdown of all communications"" in the Russian-occupied southern region of Kherson, Reuters reports. An unspecified intrusion ""by the occupation regime"" has taken place, with equipment powered down and cables disconnected, Ukraine's State Service for Special Communication and Information Protection has said, according to Reuters. This has left residents ""without Ukrainian mobile communication and Internet access"" and ""no means to make national and international phone calls using landline phone devices,"" the agency has reportedly said. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. Smoke over Severodonetsk on Monday The 97th day of the war saw Ukrainian and Russian forces battling for control of the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which is said to be divided between the two sides. Up to 15,000 people may still be trapped there, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said. Both sides are suffering heavy casualties and the Ukrainian command may decide a tactical retreat would better serve their medium-term interests. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,""Ukrainian former Defence Minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk has told the BBC. Russia now occupies almost all of Luhansk, as it focuses on seizing it and neighbouring Donetsk.At least 3,052 of its soldiers have been killedsince the invasion began on 24 February, according to a list of names compiled by BBC News Russian. Read more on this story here. Anna HolliganBBC News, The Hague Today was described as âa
momentous dayâ by the International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutor, Karim
Khan. He was referring to
three new countries - Estonia,
Latvia and Slovakia -joining the joint investigation team (JIT), and what that represents for the
pursuit of justice. Khan was speaking at the
Eurojust â the EU agency for criminal justice â a lesser-known international
organisation at The Hague. Eurojust will ensure all
the evidence - from witness statements to forensic data - will be translated
into a language that will make it accessible for all prosecution teams. Khan told a news conference: We must join hands in the common interest of humanity.   And when Iryna Venediktova, Ukraineâs chief prosecutor, told journalists ""we are fighting for European values"", Khan interjected. ""These aren't European values we're protecting,â he said. âIt's important to emphasize the ICC is fighting for basic human standards in the 21st century."" The Azovstal steel plant was bombarded for months by Russian forces For months Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol's Azovstal steelworksprevented Russian forcesfrom taking full control of the besieged southern port city. BBC Monitoring reports Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, has rejected a Russian statement claiming about 150 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found rigged with explosives at the steel plant. Andryushchenko has said the head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin, earlier reported some Ukrainian fighters were found alive at Azovstal. The Russian Defence Ministry said 152 dead Ukrainian soldiers were found in an inoperative refrigerated van and four mines were planted under the bodies. According to the ministry's spokesman, Igor Konashenkov, Ukrainian POWs from the Azov regiment said the van was set up on orders from Kyiv. The Russian side plans to hand over the bodies to Ukraine in the near future, Konashenkov has been quoted as saying by the separatist website Donetsk News Agency. This video can not be played Russia's Defence Ministry released video of a cargo ship leaving Mariupol's port Russian naval vessels have escorted the first cargo ship to leave the Port of Mariupol since Russia took control of the area. In footage released by the Russian Defence Ministry, artillery boats can be seen flanking the ship as it left the port, reportedly carrying metal in its hold. It's the first ship to enter and then leave the port, on the Sea of Azov, since the fighting in Mariupol ended. Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the Russian Navy is ready to provide safe passage to ships transporting grain currently stuck in Ukraine's ports - if Ukraine clears coastal waters of mines. Lavrov said: ""If this de-mining problem is solved... the Russian Federation will ensure the unhindered passage of these ships to the Mediterranean Sea and further to their destinations."" The explosion of a nitric acid container in Severodonetsk is thought to have been caused by an airstrike, Luhansk's regional governor Serhiy Haidai says. âThere
was allegedly an airstrike on the chemical plant in Severodonetsk which hit
the tank with the remains of nitric acid"", he says. He tells the BBC toxic fumes were released into the air. Based on a previous chemical leak, he predicts there might be a threat to people within a 400-metre range of the explosion. Outside of that range, people might experience some eye irritation, he says. At the moment there is no possibility of evacuating any of the 15,000 residents who remain in Severodonetsk - as it comes under sustained attack from Russians, he says. ""Russians provide no humanitarian corridors,"" he says. ""Seventy to eighty percent of the city is controlled by the Russian army. The neighbouring city of Lysychansk is
under the full control of Ukraineâ, he adds. Smoke rises in Severodonetsk during heavy fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops The head of the Severodonetsk state district, in the Luhansk region, says the city is ""the hottest spot in Ukraine right now"". Speaking to the BBC, Roman Vlasenk says Russia has ""thrown everything at it"". Delays to military aid from Europe and the US, such as anti-tank weapons, is a particular problem, he adds, with civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery impossible. In terms of personnel on the ground, Vlasenko says they have parity with Russia. However, he says Russia ""has more aviation and artillery"" which is preventing them from being able to defend against Russian forces or launch counter-offensives. More now on reports of a chemical explosion in Severodonetsk. A container with
chemicals has been blown up at the Azot chemical works in the city, the Russian news agency TASS says. It quotes the âambassadorâ of the self-proclaimed Luhansk Peopleâs Republic Rodion Miroshnik, writing on his Telegram channel, that a container ""has been blown up"", and the plant ""is still controlled by the Ukrainian regimeâs armed units"". The plant is one of Ukraineâs biggest chemical works, and pre-war, it has been employing around 7,000 people, according to TASS. It's thought to manufacture acetic acid, methanol and vinyl
acetate. Pictures posted to Serhiy Haidai's Telegram appear to show a large pink cloud over the city Local residents in the frontline city of Severodonetsk, in Luhansk, have been warned not to leave bomb shelters and urged to prepare masks to protect themselves against toxic fumes. A nitric acid tank has been hit by a Russian airstrike, Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai has said on messaging app Telegram. He also posted photos of a large pink cloud over residential buildings in the city. The key eastern city of Severodonetsk has seen intense fighting in recent days as Russian forces attempt to capture the city. Itâs
just gone 8pm in Severodonetsk, the eastern Ukrainian city in the Donbas region
that is coming under extreme bombardment by Russian forces. In
Tuesday's evening report, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forceswrote on Facebook,externalthat âthe battle continuesâ. âThe enemy is trying to establish complete
control overâ¦ Severodonetsk and surround [Ukrainian forces]â, the post reads.â The region's military administration head, Serhiy Haidai, also gave an update. ""Most of Severodonetsk is controlled by the
Russians. The city is not surrounded,"" hewrote on Telegram,external. ""The city's critical infrastructure has been
destroyed by almost 100%, 90% of the housing stock has been damaged, 60% of
which is critical, ie. it cannot be restored,"" he said. Earlier, he told the BBC that the
evacuation of civilians has been halted because of the heavy shelling and
up to 15,000 people may still be trapped in the city. Getting humanitarian aid in is also ""impossible"" he said. Read more on the relentless attack on Severodonetsk here. Ukrainian soldier with anti-tank weapon A former defence minister to Ukraine has said his country can win the war with more weapons from the West. ""As soon as we can get more weapons, particularly those artillery weapons which are being shipped right now from the West, we can go to counter-offensive,"" Andriy Zagorodnyuk told the BBC. He said Russian forces were ""at maximum capacity"" and were throwing everything at the fight in the Donbas. ""They're bringing all their equipment and so on - and so currently they are at maximum of their capacity, maximum of their capability."" ""Ukraine is definitely not changing our strategy. We are absolutely determined to win. We know that we can. We know that our army is much more efficient and effective than Russia's. ""The only thing we need is to re-equip ourselves with additional weapons and we can do this."" Damien McGuinnessReporting from Berlin German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced his country will allow modern German-made tanks to backfill Soviet-era tanks sent from Greece to Ukraine. Berlin already has similar deals with a number of countries that have Soviet-era tanks, which can be used by Ukrainian soldiers straight away without training. So far, Germany has struck such deals with Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland. Germany is also training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany on modern heavy weapons, which will then be delivered to Ukraine. German ministers say Berlin is delivering a lot of weapons to Ukraine and dispute the impression abroad that Germany is not doing enough. But some ministers and leading politicians within the government accept deliveries are slower and more complicated than originally hoped. There is growing pressure in Germany for deliveries to be sped up, to be more transparent and better organised. Ukraine's prosecutor-general Iryna Venediktova (L) held a news conference earlier alongside Khan (R) Earlier we told you that Ukraine's chief prosecutor had said her officials had identified more than 600 Russian war crime suspects and had started prosecuting around 80 of them. Iryna Vanediktova had been meeting the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan, and the pair gave a news briefing afterwards. Karim described Ukraine as a crime scene, and said the tribunal was carrying out its largest ever investigation there, with plans to open an office in Kyiv in the next few weeks. As things currently stand, the ICC canât prosecute the crime of aggression because neither Russia nor Ukraine are in its list of members. However, the court is taking part in a joint investigation alongside Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. Russia withdrew from - and stopped recognising - the ICC in 2016 after the court published a report classifyingthe annexation of Crimea, in Ukraine, as an occupation. Nearly seven million people have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, latest figures show. More than half of them - 3.6 million - have fled to neighbouring Poland, while nearly one million have relocated to Romania and Russia respectively. Some of those who fled Ukraine, have returned home or to different parts of their country. By Olga Ivshina and Olga Prosvirova, BBC News Russian UK intelligence estimates 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in the conflict so far BBC News Russian has compiled a list naming 3,052 Russian soldiers who have been killed in the current war in Ukraine. The list is part of an ongoing investigation into the number and nature of Russian losses and is based on open sources, as well conversations with the families of those killed. BBC journalists discovered fresh graves at 11 cemeteries located in different parts of Russia. Not all of them were marked as soldiers who died fighting in Ukraine, but the photographs of men in uniform, as well as wreaths bearing ribbons inscribed with 'From the Ministry of Defence' are tell-tale signs. There is a continuing trend of a high proportion of officers among those killed - around 20%. The findings match claims made by UK intelligence services, who stated this week that Russia was bearing âcrushing lossesâ among junior and senior officers. Russia's most recent casualty figures, released by Moscow on 25 March, claim 1,351 soldiers have been killed so far in the conflict. Meanwhile UK intelligence estimates that, by the end of May, Russia had lost around 15,000 soldiers, while Ukraine puts the figure at around 30,000 killed. As we've been reporting, the European Union has agreed to block all imports of Russian oil arriving by sea by the end of the year. However, the EU will continue temporarily to allow imports by pipeline because Hungary imports 65% of oil via Russian pipelines and says its economy could not take the hit if that stopped. Two other countries which import large amounts of Russian oil by pipeline, Germany and Poland, say they will stop doing so by the end of this year. The EU says, overall, the new measures will cut oil imports from Russia by up to 90%. Russia accounted for just8% of UK oil imports in 2020,external. The UK is to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. Read more about the world's reliance on Russian oil and gashere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"One in five pupils in England are eligible for free school meals, according to the most recent data More children should be given free school meals to help tackle the ""devastating reality"" of the cost of living crisis in England, teachers say. All children from families who receive universal credit should be eligible as part of an ""urgent"" expansion of the scheme, 11 educational groups said in a letter seen by the BBC. Around one in five pupils - 1.7 million children - receive free school meals. The government said it recognised households were struggling. It said it had expanded access to the meals more than any other government in recent decades. Warning over shrinking school meals as prices rise Budget pasta prices jump 50% as food staples rise How many children need free meals? The prices of food, fuel and other goods have surged in recent months in the UK, pushing inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to a 40-year high. Measures the government have announced to try to tackle the rising cost of living includea Â£400 energy bill discount for every household. But the joint letter, sent to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi by education unions and other organisations claiming to represent one million school staff in England, said vulnerable children not receiving free school meals were facing a ""real barrier to learning"". ""We see the devastating reality of children coming to school unable to afford to buy lunch, because their family circumstances means they fall outside the restrictive free school meal eligibility criteria,"" it said. In England, all infant state school pupils up to Year Two can get free school meals during term time. For English pupils in Year Three and above, those living in households on income-related benefits (such as universal credit) are eligible, as long as their annual household income does not exceed Â£7,400 after tax. That figure does not include welfare payments. In Northern Ireland the cap is set at Â£14,000 a year. ScotlandandWaleshave recently committed to rolling out free school meal provision to all primary pupils. Rachel Bresnahan runs a free holiday club in Stockport, to help children stay well-fed during half-term The latest call for change follows footballerMarcus Rashford's successful campaignto extend free school meal vouchers into school holidays during the pandemic. An estimated 2.6 million children in the UK live in households that missed meals or struggled to access healthy food during April, according to data from the Food Foundation charity. Rachel Bresnahan, who works for a community group in Stockport, the Cherry Tree Project, told BBC News many people who rely on the project live in food poverty, but their children are not eligible for free school meals. ""Our food banks have always run in the mornings, and suddenly people are asking if they can come at night - because people who are working full-time still can't make ends meet,"" she said. Emma, who wants to remain anonymous, says she and her husband were both on universal credit, but their eight-year-old son does not qualify for free school meals. The mother-of-three, from Kent, says she hasn't eaten three meals a day for months because she wants to make sure she can afford food for her son and other younger, pre-school children. ""A few weeks back my eight-year-old got two bowls out for breakfast and I said: 'Don't have two bowls, that is just being greedy,' and he said: 'They're not both for me mum, one of them is for you as I haven't seen you eat in days.',"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Emma, who currently has three jobs, says she pays Â£70 every six weeks to cover the cost of school dinners for her son: ""It is expensive and with all the other price increases that we are facing now, it is just one big headache."" How will I get the Â£400 promised for energy bills? All primary school kids in Wales to get free school meals Rashford and top chefs demand school meals review Dr Nick Capstick, head teacher of Drove Primary School in Wiltshire and a signatory to the letter, says children are missing more school because of ""illness and poor oral hygiene caused by inadequate diet"". Dr Capstick, who is also chairman of an independent working group, the School Food Review, told the Today programme: ""It's increasingly common that children will come in having not eaten from the night before and also being quite confused, disorientated, and really lacking in energy to have a really productive day at school. ""Universal free schools meals is a simple way of eradicating this situation."" Other signatories to the letter include leaders of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), the National Education Union (NEU), the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) and the teachers' union, NASUWT as well as Teach First and the Confederation of School Trusts. A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise that millions of households across the UK are struggling to make their incomes stretch to cover the rising cost of living, which is why, in addition to the over Â£22bn announced previously, we are providing over Â£15bn in further support, targeted particularly at those with the greatest need. ""The holiday activities and food programme runs during major school holidays, and wider welfare support is available through the household support fund, which helps vulnerable families in need with essentials, such as food and utility bills.""

"Money was made available to deal with the backlog, but the NHS was not able to spend it all It may take seven years to get NHS Wales waiting lists of 700,000 back to 2020 levels, Wales' auditor general has said. Thenumber of patients waiting for non-urgent treatment has risen sharplysince February 2020, prior to the Covid pandemic. They include Michael Assender, 74, with severe back pain, one of 70,400 who've spent two years on a waiting list. The Welsh government said it had a plan to deal with backlogs. But Wales' Auditor General Adrian Crompton said: ""Just as the NHS rose to the challenge of the pandemic, it will need to rise to the challenge of tackling a waiting list which has grown to huge proportions. NHS waiting times in Wales hit record high again Patient spent four nights in A&E waiting for a bed ""Concerted action is going to be needed on many different fronts, and some long-standing challenges will need to be overcome."" After struggling with his back, Mr Assender, from Cwmbran, Torfaen, paid Â£1,500 for a private scan, which revealed he had two slipped discs. ""At the moment I'm coping pretty well, taking pills for the pain and trying to stay active,"" he said. ""But something that took me half hour before now takes an hour."" Mr Assender said he knew others waiting for surgery who had become depressed and considered taking their lives, adding: ""A lot of people out there are in a constant pain and I do pity them. ""It's a dire situation really."" The pandemic has exacerbated problems with waiting times in the Welsh NHS According to Mr Crompton's report, more than half those waiting may not even know what they are suffering from because they still have not had their first outpatient appointment. That means their care cannot be effectively prioritised. Mr Crompton called on Welsh Labour ministers to set ""ambitious delivery targets"", make long-term capital investments in NHS infrastructure, create a ""workforce plan"" and manage ""clinical risks and support for those waiting"". The report also included aweb tool,externalwhich allows people to compare waits for different health boards. It showed 701,418 patients waiting for treatment in total, and by March, 380,289 had been on a list for up to 26 weeks, and 168,502 for more than a year. Latest figures also show more than 70,400 waiting more than two years for treatment. Statisticians advise these are ""patient pathways"" and each patient may be on several lists, meaning the actual number of patients affected could be smaller. The report also lists a further 550,000 ""potentially missing"" referrals - higher than the Welsh government's own estimates of half a million - that could find their way back into the system. To tackle the backlog, the Welsh government made an extra Â£200m available to be spent by the end of the 2021/22 financial year, but the Welsh NHS only asked for Â£146m. Of this, Â£12.8m was returned to the Welsh government, as the health service did not have the staff or space to spend it within the timeframe. The Welsh government said: ""Working with health boards, we have set ambitious but realistic targets to tackle the pandemic backlog for planned care. ""This is backed by significant extra long-term funding. ""Our recovery plan, published last month, already sets out our plans to address the five recommendations of this report, including how we will support patients while they wait and create a sustainable workforce with effective leadership."" Health Minister Eluned Morgan toldBBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast programmeshe expects to see waiting times decrease. ""We have shown how we want to employ an additional 12,000 people and spend an extra billion pounds,"" she said. ""We are, therefore, confident that we will go in the right direction and will be able to stick to the plan - which is to bring those figures down by the end of this parliament."" Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ""One-off, ring fenced injections of cash that are time limited do not allow the NHS to make necessary long-term investments in staff and capital required to meet the needs of the people of Wales."" He added the workforce is the ""number one limiting factor for NHS capacity"" and recruiting staff was a ""huge focus"". ""It makes for sobering reading and makes clear the enormity of the challenge ahead,"" Mr Hughes toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastwith Claire Summers. ""These are not just numbers, these are individual people's lives."" Surgeons are struggling to deal with growing waiting lists Vice president for Wales of the Royal College of Physicians Dr Olwen Williams said the workforce is a ""key limiting factor"", adding: ""If you can't recruit into the workforce, you can't spend the money."" Welsh Conservatives health spokesman, Russell George, said he hoped the report would be a wake-up call for the government. ""Labour need to get a grip on the NHS and stop breaking all the wrong records,"" he added. Rhun ap Iorwerth MS, Plaid Cymru's health spokesperson, said: ""To see that funds were unspent proves how unsustainable and under-staffed our NHS desperately is."" He added that the NHS ""needs to put on a more sustainable footing and we need a more comprehensive plan that addresses all stages of a patient's journey through the system"". NHS waiting times in Wales hit record high again Patient spent four nights in A&E waiting for a bed Record NHS waiting times in Wales for 18th month Omicron peak could see 'one in six' NHS staff off A&E and ambulance performance worst ever - again Â£551m extra funding for NHS and social services Should we cut back on Covid stats this Christmas?

"The pandemic, supply chain problems and the war in Ukraine have all had an impact on rising prices A Primark executive has told the BBC he ""regrets"" raising prices, as the fashion firm battles with rising costs. John Bason, finance director at Primark's parent company Associated British Foods, also warned some people might spend less as budgets are squeezed by the higher living costs. Primark is hiking prices across some of its range from this autumn. But Mr Bason said the company is still committed to ""affordability for everyone"". Across the UK economy, firms have been passing on higher energy, shipping and oil costs to customers. High Street chains including Next, Greggs and Superdry have all said they are raising prices. Primark to cut 400 store management jobs Next warns prices to rise by more than expected Why are prices rising so quickly? Primark hadpromised not to raise prices,externalfor its spring and summer collection. But while it is keeping that pledge, ABF recently announced that it will implement ""selective price increases"" across some of Primark's autumn and winter stock as it tackles spiralling costs. ""I do regret that we have to put some prices up,"" Mr Bason said. ""It is a reflection of the scale of the inflation that we're seeing."" Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -is at a 40-year-high. The pandemic, the supply chain disruption as the global economy rebounded, and the war in Ukraine have all impacted on rising prices. John Bason, finance director for Primark's parent company ABF, says costs are currently 'very high' ""Obviously Russia's invasion of Ukraine has really changed the economic environment and inflation in particular,"" Mr Bason said. ""We've worked hard to ensure that our prices stay where they are, but at some point the inflationary pressures is such that you do have to do something about it."" Mr Bason would not say how much prices will go up. However, he insisted that Primark was still ""the best value clothing fashion retailer"" in the UK. And said that, in an environment where other retailers were also raising prices, the gap - compared with others - could be maintained. Retail expert Jonathan de Mello said tightening household budgets due to the rising costs of food, fuel and energy are a huge problem for high street retailers. ""The cost of living crisis has achieved the dubious accolade of replacing Covid as the main concern for consumers currently, and as real incomes start to fall and prices rise further, retailers face yet another major headwind,"" he said. Bank chief in 'apocalyptic' warning on food prices Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise Who is to blame for soaring prices? Mr de Mello added: ""These price increases will certainly impact less affluent consumers buying from Primark, who have already seen real incomes fall due to a combination of significantly higher energy prices, and food price inflation."" Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark does not sell its products online Mr Bason said: ""There are some consumers who would normally be spending more and probably would come into Primark, and I think there would be those that have very, very constrained budgets and probably would shop less with us as a result of this."" So far, however, Mr Bason said Primark is not seeing ""any major impact"" from the tightening of budgets. ""The footfall and the like-for-like sales that we're seeing in the UK have been on a strongly improving trend this year and that really is more about recovery from the pandemic,"" he said. ""People are travelling, people are going back to the office although probably not back to where it was, and people are socialising. So we're seeing a big pick up in sales relating to those activities."" Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark does not sell its products online. As a result,the business was hit hard by Covid restrictionswhile stores were closed. The group has recently revamped its website to give more details of in-store ranges, so customers can browse the full collection and check availability before coming into stores. But Mr Bason said he is confident that the high street does have a future. Primark shopper numbers 'back to pre-Covid levels' Primark says stock woes could persist until 2023 ""Even though we were closed probably six months for the two main years of the pandemic, our customers have come back to us. That I think is very very striking,"" he added. ""So no, I think the demise of the high street is way overstated, but it is changing. There's no doubt over it."" Mr Bason is also confident that fast fashion can be green, with the chainannouncing new sustainability pledges last year. The pledges included a commitment to making Primark's clothes using recycled or ""more sustainably sourced materials"" by 2030. Mr Bason said that the soaring energy prices, fuelled by the Ukraine war, could act as a catalyst to greater energy efficiency as suppliers look to reduce their costs.
