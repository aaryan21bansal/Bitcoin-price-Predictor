"The Bank of England has held interest rates at 4.75% in December - following two falls in 2024. Interest rates affect the mortgage, credit card and savings rates for millions of people across the UK. Some analysts predict another cut when the Bank meets in February, although borrowing costs remain high for many. An interest rate tells you how much it costs to borrow money, or the reward for saving it. The Bank of England's base rate is what it charges other lenders to borrow money. This influences what they charge their customers for loans such as mortgages, as well as the interest rate they pay on savings accounts. The Bank moves rates up and down in order to control UK inflation - which is theincrease in the price of something over time. When inflation is high, it may decide to raise rates to bring inflation back down towards its 2% target. The idea is to encourage people to spend less and reduce demand. Once inflation is at or near the target, the Bank may hold rates, or cut them. In August 2024,the Bank rate fell to 5%after many months at 5.25% - which was the highest level for 16 years. It was the first drop in more than four years. In November,a second cut took rates to 4.75%. However, interest rates were significantly above this for much of the 1980s and 1990s, and up to the 2008 financial crisis, after hitting17% in November 1979,external. Inflation is also now far below the peak of 11.1% reached in October 2022. The main inflation measure, CPI,was 2.5% in the 12 months to December 2024, down slightly from 2.6% in November. Despite the drop, inflation remains above the Bank's target. But generally, prices are rising at a much slower rate than in 2022 and 2023. The Bank also considers other measures of inflation when deciding how to change rates, such as price rises in different parts of the economy like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers. It has to balance the need to slow price rises against the risk of damaging the economy, and avoid cutting rates only to have to raise them again shortly afterwards. It is difficult to predict exactly what will happen to interest rates as it depends whether inflation remains consistently at or below the Bank's target. The spending and borrowing plans set out inChancellor Rachel Reeves' October's Budgetchanged expectations, in particular an increase inthe minimum wageandthe amount of National Insurance paid by employers. Financial markets and the Bank itself now expect rates to be cut more slowly than previously anticipated. The OECD think tank has also predicted thatrates will be higher for longer due to the Budget. Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential race could have an impact on prices globally because of his plans to introduce tariffs on imports. Someestimates suggest this could cost the UK billions, the risk of which is likely to influence the Bank of England's decision-making in the coming months. Similarly some retailers have suggestedprices could rise and jobs are at riskas a result of the National Insurance changes. Announcingthe December rate decision, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said: ""We think a gradual approach to future interest rate cuts remains right."" But he said due to heightened uncertainty in the economy the Bank ""could not commit to when or by how much we will cut rates in the coming year"". The next interest rate announcement is in February. Some economists believe the drop in inflation in December strengthens the case for a further cut. Chancellor Reeves vows action on growth amid rising debt costs Chris Mason: Political heat ramps up over the economy Mortgage rates Just under a third of households have a mortgage, according tothe government's English Housing Survey,external. About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that ""tracks"" the Bank of England's rate, so a base rate change has an immediate impact on monthly repayments. But more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments aren't immediately affected, future deals are. Mortgage rates are still much higher than they have been for much of the past decade. The average two-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.49%, according to financial information company Moneyfacts, and a five-year deal is 5.27%. It means many homebuyers and those remortgaging are having to pay a lot more than if they had borrowed the same amount a few years ago. About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages with an interest rate of 3% or below are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027. A hold in interest rates may have relatively little impact on pricing of fixed-rate mortgages in the short-term. The outlook is complicated at the moment as the markets, and lenders, consider the impact of the Budget and other global events.

Five ways to save money on your mortgage Credit cards and loans Bank of England interest rates also influence the amount charged on credit cards, bank loans and car loans. Lenders can decide to reduce their own interest rates if decisions by the Bank of England make borrowing costs cheaper. However, this tends to happen very slowly. Savings The Bank of England interest rate also affects how much savers earn on their money. A falling base rate is likely see a reduction in the returns offered to savers by banks and building societies. The current average rate for an easy access account is about 3% a year. Any cut could particularly affect those who take the interest from savings to top up their income. In recent years, the UK has had one of the highest interest rates in the G7 - the group representing the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies. In June 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) started to cut its main interest rate for the eurozone from an all-time high of 4%. After a series of cuts it now stands at 3%. In the US, the central bank - the Federal Reserve - has cut interest rates for three meetings in a row, meaning its key lending ratehas a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. However  the Fed has indicated that it will cut rates at a slower pace in 2025.

"Arkady Rotenberg Sanctioned Russian oligarchs from Vladimir Putin's inner circle exploited a UK secrecy loophole left open by the government. Arkady and Boris Rotenberg - judo partners of the Russian president - used a type of company that was not required to identify its real owners. Ministers have acknowledged concerns that these companies, known as English Limited Partnerships (ELPs), have also been abused by criminals. A joint investigation by the BBC andFinance Uncovered,externalhas discovered evidence linking a number of ELPs to fraud, terrorism and money laundering. In 2016 and 2017, the government introduced measures that forced almost all UK companies to identify their real owners. ELPs were not covered by these new transparency laws. Since then, more than 4,500 of them have been set up. The BBC has worked with Finance Uncovered to analyse leaked documents and thousands of company records that show how ELPs have become a route to dodge anti-money laundering laws requiring the real owners, or persons of significant control, of UK companies to be disclosed. ELPs are legitimately used in real estate, investment and pension funds - they have tax advantages, for example, and the amount investors risk is limited. Unlike most companies, ELPs do not have a separate legal identity. The government says that means they cannot own assets, do not have a beneficial owner, and cannot legally open bank accounts in their own right. But our investigation has found documents identifying beneficial owners of ELPs, and evidence of their use to open bank accounts and to facilitate financial crime. According to Graham Barrow, an expert in financial crime, they are also ""vulnerable to misuse"" because of how little information about their activity they are required to make public. Our data shows the number of new ELPs being set up has gone up by 53% since 2017. ""I wish I could be shocked about the scale of this, but I'm absolutely not. I'm just depressed and frustrated,"" says Helena Wood, head of the UK Economic Crime Programme at the Royal United Services Institute. The investigation also reveals: Leaked documents show ELPs were marketed as an ""alternative solution"" to avoid transparency laws Just five companies, known as formation agencies, have been responsible for 1,500 ELPs, with hundreds listed at registered addresses including one above a burrito bar in central London A 71-year-old Swiss ceramic artist used in official paperwork to hide the real owners of UK companies was a signatory for more than 160 ELPs FBI agents investigating the Boston marathon bombing probed an ELP registered at an address currently home to a barber shop in Bristol. More than 4,500 ELPs have been created in the five years since the new transparency laws came into effect. In the five years to 2017, 2,950 were set up. We have established that among those to take advantage of the secrecy of ELPs are members of President Putin's inner circle. Arkady Rotenberg and Vladimir Putin These are brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg who were the subject of an investigation by a US Senate committee in 2020. It said they had exploited a global web of shell companies to evade US sanctions imposed following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. These companies were used to buy millions of dollars worth of art. One of these companies was an ELP. Sinara Company LP was set up in January 2017 and listed its principal place of business at an address a stone's throw from London's Oxford Circus. It claimed to be involved in ""tourism and ticketing services"". Between July 2017 and June 2018, it sent ""14 wire transfers in $9,500 increments totalling $133,000"" (Â£109,000) to an art adviser who the Senate report said ""facilitated purchases for the Rotenbergs"". Under UK law, there is no requirement to disclose who was behind Sinara, which was dissolved in 2019. ""It's a scandal that people like the Rotenbergs who have been sanctioned in America for years have still been able to use British corporate structures to bring their money out of Russia through these structures and then spend it at will,"" says Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who chairs a parliamentary group on tax and corruption. The BBC tried to contact the Rotenbergs, but have not received a response. Most limited partnerships are set up by so-called company formation agents - or presenters - who provide a registered address and administrative support. The BBC and Finance Uncovered found that of the 4,500 ELPs formed since 2017, one in four were created by just five UK-based agencies. These agencies have track records in creating anonymous UK companies for clients in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Some of those companies they incorporated have also been linked to financial crimes including money laundering. Corporate records show the most prolific of these agencies is LAS, run by Elena Dovzhik, an Anglo-Russian accountant, and her Latvian business partner Ineta UtinÄne. The UK-based businesswomen have made millions from LAS, the activities of which include forming and administering hundreds of anonymous British companies for clients based across Eastern Europe and Central Asia. A number of companies associated with LAS have subsequently been involved in crime. One, Always Efficient LLP, a firm registered to a London address provided by LAS, was found to be behind BTC-e, the largest Russian-language bitcoin exchange. The exchange wasshut down,externalin 2017 by the US Justice Department in relation to allegations of money laundering. And last year thefazze.com website, which used a LAS contact address, was alleged to have run a Russian-coordinated vaccine disinformation campaign, spreading claims that the AstraZeneca vaccine would turn recipients into chimpanzees. LAS told the BBC that they ""terminated"" their services to Always Efficient LLP ""in 2017 due to their breach of our Terms & Conditions"". In relation to fazze.com, LAS say: ""This could be an illegal and unauthorised use of our address services as we do not hold exact or similar details in our historic database."" LAS was also responsible for setting up huge numbers of another type of UK company called Scottish Limited Partnerships (SLPs). A2017 investigation by Bellingcat,external, found that LAS was the ""single most prolific presenter of SLPs between 2015 and 2017"". SLPs at the time did not have to disclose their real owners. But after they were repeatedly linked to major international money laundering scandals, the UK government changed the law so they had to provide information about those who ultimately owned or controlled them. Almost immediately the number of registrations fell by almost half. After this change in the law around SLPs, leaked documents seen by the BBC show LAS switched its attention to ELPs. In an emailed update to clients dated 18 May 2017, under the heading ""Alternative Solutions"", LAS proposed ELPs as, ""a way out and as a substitute for Scottish Partnerships"". The document, discovered in thePandora Papers, a data leak obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), continued: ""For the time being, the privileges of this type of partnership are that they are not and will not be subject to the laws of the disclosure of information about the controlling persons."" Now our investigation has discovered the involvement of a number of ELPs associated with LAS in alleged criminal activity. They include companies, owned by ELP Donnea Business LP, which have been accused of evading tax in Ukraine and another ELP called  Cosalima Trade LP controlled by a Russian businessman wanted by the authorities in Russia in relation to a Â£5m fraud. LAS boss Elena Dovzhik said: ""We are aware that many years ago we filed registration documents for some companies that eventually were accused in unlawful activities, but such information was not available to us prior (to) registration."" ""We (have) never been involved in any business activities of our former clients and only assisted our corporate clients with their company's formation process, mail-forwarding services, (and) statutory filings. ""We never supported any kind of fraud or illegal activities."" She explained that her firm had ""enhanced due diligence for all international clients"" and ""if any of our clients was ever reported to us as being under suspicion of being involved in unlawful activitiesâ¦ services were terminated with immediate effect"". Both Donnea Business LP and Cosalima Trade LP were registered to addresses provided by LAS in London. Cosalima Trade LP was registered at the second floor of 6 Market Place, in premises above an unrelated burrito bar in Fitzrovia, central London. This address is home to around 800 active companies. It's one of the most frequently used addresses for ELPs in the country. Over the past five years, more than 240 ELPs have been registered here. A scrap of paper inserted into a button on the intercom lists just one company at the address - 1000 Apostilles Ltd, which is owned by LAS's Ineta UtinÄne. LAS says its ""lease for 6 Market Place expired during this year"". Another popular address for ELPs is not in London but in Bristol. 1 Straits Parade in the Fishponds area of the city is now a Turkish barber shop. It has also been an address used by Arran, another formation agent, to set up UK companies including 197 ELPs. Companies registered at the address have been linked to bribery, fraud and other financial crimes. Our investigation has discovered that Rivelham LP, an ELP that was registered there in 2013, was also flagged during the FBI inquiry into the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing in the US. Rivelham LP was identified in suspicious activity reports produced by Deutsche Bank and handed to federal agents as part of the investigation into financial transactions associated with those responsible for the bombing. The reports, from a leak of suspicious activity reports filed with the US Treasury known asthe FinCEN Files, do not identify who owned the ELP, but they record its involvement in 116 suspicious transactions totalling over $7.3m (Â£6m) in just one month between December 2012 and January 2013. The BBC tried to contact the owners of Arran but received no response. While addresses like 1 Straits Parade and 6 Market Place may indicate which formation agency has been involved with an ELP, they give little clue as to who is really behind them. While names of the partners of the ELP can be found on paperwork submitted to Companies House, more often than not, the names will be of anonymous companies incorporated in countries including Belize and the Seychelles. And even the real people signing paperwork for those companies are unlikely to be the true owners. Typically they are nominee, or proxy signatories, paid to sign documents and they usually know nothing about what the company is doing. One prolific proxy signatory is Ruth Neidhart, a 71-year-old from Switzerland who lives in Cyprus. She also works as a ceramic artist making porcelain dolls and jewellery, sometimes arranging pottery painting sessions for children's birthday parties. Our analysis of Company House filings has found since 2016, she has signed paperwork for more than 160 ELPs set up by the company formation agency she has worked for, IOS. Mrs Neidhart did not respond to the BBC's invitation to comment. The investigation has also found one of the LAS's most prolific nominees is Alexandru Terna, a Romanian national in his early 30s who lives in London. Mr Terna has signed Companies House paperwork for at least 306 ELPs created by LAS for clients. Responding to written questions from the BBC,  Mr Terna says his involvement was ""arranged through LAS International"" or a related company, ""for and on behalf of owners of all individual companies, with whom we had trustee/nominee service agreements"". He adds: ""We have never been involved in the control or management of any company, mentioned in your letters."" Campaigners say the BBC's revelations about ELPs show that reform of the UK's legal structures is long overdue. ""We've been warning the government about these problems with these opaque legal structures for years,"" says Helena Wood of the Royal United Services Institute think tank. ""Transparency is the best disinfectant they say, and we need a bucket load of it with these English Limited Partnerships."" The failure of successive British governments to shut down major loopholes in anti-money laundering laws stands in contrast to promises made by senior politicians. As long ago as 2014 the government considered acting on ELPs but failed to do so. The following year the prime minister at the time, David Cameron, declared he was determined the UK would not become ""a safe haven for corrupt money around the world"". The government acknowledged in 2018 that there were risks posed by limited partnerships and ""concerns that they are being abused by criminals following large-scale money laundering scandals"". After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""open up the Matryoshka doll of Russian-owned companies"" to reveal their true owners. The government says it does not have any evidence of significant misuse of ELPs. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK already has some of the strongest controls in the world to combat money laundering, and it's vital that we continue to upgrade our governance to crack down on criminals abusing UK corporate entities. ""That's why we are modernising the law governing UK Limited Partnerships through our forthcoming Economic Crime Bill which will tighten registration requirements and improve transparency - ensuring that only those acting within the law can remain on the UK register."" But those proposals do not appear to include closing the ELP loophole requiring the disclosure of the real owners, or persons of significant control behind the companies.

"Marks & Spencer has stopped selling disposable barbecues in its stores across the UK. The supermarket said it wanted ""to help protect open spaces and reduce the risk of fires"". London Fire Brigade, which has been calling for a ban on the sale of disposable barbecues, said the move was ""good news"". It comes after the UK experienced its hottest day ever, with 40C exceeded for the first time. Dozens of locations saw temperatures above the previous record of 38.7C, and 15 fire services declared major incidents because of a surge in blazes. Ban disposable BBQs, London Fire Brigade urges Fires blaze after UK passes 40C for first time An M&S spokesperson told the BBC the move came into effect earlier this week. The supermarket said: ""We'd already stopped selling disposable barbecues near national parks and in London but given the unusually hot and dry conditions, we've taken the precautionary step of removing them from sale across the UK."" London Fire Brigade had already warned people against using barbecues in open spaces, grassland or balconies, particularly after the recent heatwave. Last week, its commissioner Andy Roe called for disposable barbecues to be taken off the shelves across Britain. It came after theLondon Fire Brigade experienced its busiest day since World War Two, dealing with multiple blazes in the record-breaking temperatures. Welcoming the decision by M&S, London Fire Brigade said: ""We want to work with retailers to stop the sale of disposable barbecues and reduce the risk of dangerous grass fires."" Retail analyst Jonathan de Mello said he expected similar announcements to follow from other supermarkets. ""This move by M&S will put pressure on their retail peers to follow suit,"" he said. ""With multiple grass fires caused by these barbecues given the unprecedented hot weather we have seen in the past few weeks, M&S have rightly decided to put public safety first,"" he added. ""M&S are often seen as a bellwether for UK retailers, and hopefully other retailers will follow their lead."" The supermarket Aldi stopped selling disposable barbecues in March. Other retailers have halted the sale of the items in selected stores, while not taking a nationwide approach. A Co-op spokesperson told the BBC that since June 2021 it had stopped selling disposable barbecues in shops located in or nearby national parks. A Sainsbury's spokesperson said: ""We offer customers choice and all our disposable BBQ packaging includes advice on safe use and disposal which customers are encouraged to follow.""

"The piece of space debris. Picture: Dr Brad Tucker When Mick Miners, a farmer in New South Wales, Australia, first saw a large black object sticking out of the ground in a remote part of his land, he thought it was a dead tree. But on closer inspection - and verification from experts - he learned it had fallen from space. The Australian Space Agency (ASA) later said it came from a SpaceX capsule. Experts described the discovery as ""rare"" and ""exciting"" - but said such events may become more common. The object landed on 9 July in a large area of fields, but was not discovered by Mr Miners until several weeks later. Two other pieces were later found nearby, and the ASA asked anyone who came across further items to contact a debris hotline set up by SpaceX. Dr Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at the Australian National University, was called to examine the object. He is often called to similar discoveries - the vast majority of which turn out not to be space debris. ""This has been super exciting to see this all up close, I've never seen a piece of space junk fall like this,""he said in a video shared online,external. Don Pollacco, a professor of astrophysics at the UK's Warwick University, agreed that it was very rare for space debris to hit land. While objects fall from space to Earth every day, the vast majority land in the oceans covering most of the planet, he said. What's more, the only recorded case of a person being hit was Lottie Williams, who was unhurt when a piece of space debris landed on her shoulder in Oklahoma, US, in 1997. Other incidents include damage to buildings in Ivory Coast in 2020, from pieces of a Chinese rocket. However, discoveries on land may become more common - especially as the number of rockets sent to space has hugely increased in recent years. The Sun is also moving into a cycle of being more active, Prof Pollacco added, a knock-on effect of which may be more debris falling to Earth. Perhaps more worrying is astudy from Canada's University of British Columbia,external, published in July, which found there was a 10% chance of one or more people being killed by space debris in the next decade. But Prof Pollacco still says the chance of an individual being hurt is ""almost zero"", adding: ""I don't think people need to be frightened, the likelihood of them getting hit is unbelievably small."" SpaceX did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.

"A Chinese military helicopter by Pingtan island across the Taiwan Strait from Taiwan on Thursday China is kicking off its biggest-ever military exercises in the seas around Taiwan following US politician Nancy Pelosi's visit. The live fire drills began at 12:00 local time (04:00 GMT) and in several areas were due to take place within 12 miles of the island. Taiwan said China was trying to change the status quo in the region. Ms Pelosi made a brief but controversial visit to Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province. The drills are Beijing's main response, although it has also blocked some trade with the island. The exercises are due to take place in busy waterways and will include long-range live ammunition shooting, Beijing says. Taiwan says it amounts to a sea and air blockade while the US said the drills were irresponsible and could spiral out of control. Analyst Bonnie Lin told the BBC that the Taiwanese military would react cautiously but there was still a risk of confrontation. ""For example, if China decides to fly planes over Taiwan's airspace, there is a chance that Taiwan might try to intercept them. And we could see a mid air collision, we could see a lot of different scenarios playing out,"" she said. Taiwan said it scrambled jets to warn off Chinese warplanes on Wednesday and its military fired flares to drive away unidentified aircraft over the Kinmen islands, located close to the mainland. Several ministries have suffered cyber-attacks in recent days, the Taiwanese government said. Taiwan has also asked ships to take different routes and is negotiating with Japan and the Philippines to find alternative aviation routes. Japan has also expressed concern to China over the areas covered by the military drills, which it says overlaps with its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). In response, Chinese government spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing did not accept the ""so-called"" Japan EEZ. On Wednesday, China detained a suspected Taiwanese separatist in the coastal Zhejiang province on suspicion of endangering national security, according to local media reports. Meanwhile China's Ambassador to France Lu Shaye told French TV that after ""reunification"" with Taiwan, Beijing would focus on ""re-education"". China has previously used the term ""re-education"" to refer to its detention of mostly-Muslim minorities in its north-western Xinjiang region, where human rights groups say more than a million people have been incarcerated. By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes, BBC News, Taiwan In the Taiwanese capital the situation remains calm but Taiwan is being forced to reroute a huge amount of air and sea traffic around the exclusion zones declared by Beijing. Meanwhile a US aircraft that can track ballistic missiles in flight has taken off from Japan and is heading towards Taiwan. Analysts say one scenario is that China is preparing to fire ballistic missiles - to splash down in the exclusion zones, very close to Taiwan's coast. That is what China did back in 1996, the last time tensions between Beijing and Taipei got this bad. But this time the exclusion zones are much closer to Taiwan. There is also concern that one of the exclusion zones is to the east of Taiwan in the Pacific ocean. Analysts say it is possible China is preparing to fly a missile over the top of Taiwan - to splash down in that zone. That would be considered a major violation of Taiwan's airspace. Mrs Pelosi, the most senior US politician to visit Taiwan in 25 years, made the trip as part of a wider Asian tour. China had warned her not to travel to the island. What is the 'One China' policy? Taiwan puts the ball firmly in Xi Jinping's court Accusing the US of ""violating China's sovereignty under the guise of so-called democracy"", Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said: ""Those who play with fire will not come to a good end and those who offend China will be punished."" In a statement after the visit, Ms Pelosi said China cannot ""prevent world leaders or anyone from travelling to Taiwan to pay respect to its flourishing democracy, to highlight its many successes and to reaffirm our commitment to continued collaboration"". After leaving Taiwan, Ms Pelosi travelled to South Korea, where she met her counterpart Kim Jin-pyo. She is due to visit the Joint Security Area near the border between the two Koreas, patrolled by the US-led UN command and North Korea. The US walks a diplomatic tightrope with its Taiwan policy. On the one hand, it abides by the ""One China"" policy, which recognises only one Chinese government, giving it formal ties with Beijing and not Taiwan. On the other, it maintains a ""robust unofficial"" relationship with the island, which includes selling weapons for Taiwan to defend itself.

"China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province that will eventually be under Beijing's control - and has not ruled out the use of force to take the island. But Taiwan sees itself as distinct from the Chinese mainland, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders. Taiwan has strong links to China, its biggest trading partner. And many Taiwanese have business and family connections across the strait. But over time, polls show that the number of people who identify as Taiwanese, as opposed to Chinese, has gone up. The island, which is roughly 100 miles from the coast of south-east China, has been home to various indigenous tribes for centuries. Historical sources suggest it first came under the full control of a Chinese empire in the 17th Century. It became a Japanese colony in 1895, after the Qing empire lost the first Sino-Japanese war. Then in 1945, after Japan lost World War Two, China took the island but now a nationalist government, led by General Chiang Kai-shek, was in power. This was at the height of a decades-long conflict between Chiang's forces and Mao Zedong's Communist Party. When the communists won in 1949, Chiang and what was left of the nationalist party, known as the Kuomintang or KMT, fled to Taiwan, where they ruled for several decades. They called this the Republic of China, a name Taiwan has retained. The Chinese Communist Party points to this history to claim Taiwan. But the Taiwanese point to the same history to argue that they were not part of the modern Chinese state that was first formed after the revolution in 1911 - or the People's Republic of China that was established under Mao in 1949. Today, only 12 countries (plus the Vatican) officially recognise Taiwan. The US decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979 was the turning point. And a richer, more powerful China exerts pressure so more countries do not recognise Taiwan or lend it support. But America remains the island's strongest ally, sells arms to it and has vowed to help in case of a Chinese attack. China has spoken of ""peaceful reunification"" - a long-term goal to win over the island's population through soft power and CCP-sponsored messaging that shows unification in a positive light. But Beijing has also used threats. President Xi Jinping has said ""reunification"" with the island must be fulfilled and is believed to have a deadline. In a military confrontation, China's armed forces would dwarf those of Taiwan. China is the second-biggest spender on defence after the US and could draw on a huge range of capabilities, from naval power to missile technology, aircraft and cyber attacks. Some Western experts predict that Taiwan could at best aim to slow a Chinese attack, try to prevent a shore landing by amphibious forces, and mount guerrilla strikes while waiting for outside help. And that help could come from the US. But for decades Washington has walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Taipei - and has been deliberately unclear about whether or how it would defend Taiwan in the event of an attack. US-China ties have, however, soured in recent years. And Beijing often accuses the US of reneging on its ""One-China"" policy, which recognises only one Chinese government, in Beijing. But Washington denies this, saying the status quo has not changed. Taiwan sits in the so-called ""first island chain"", which includes a list of US-friendly territories that are crucial to Washington's foreign policy in the region. China's increasinglyaggressive behaviour in the South China Seahas also made Taiwan more significant to US calculations. Taiwan's economy is another factor. Much of the world's electronics - from phones to electric cars - are powered by computer chips made in Taiwan. By one measure, a single Taiwanese company - the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC - has over half of the world's market. So if China takes the island, it could be freer to project power in the western Pacific and rival the US. Beijing would also have control over an industry that drive the global economy. But China insists that its intentions are peaceful - and accuses the US of encircling it with military bases that stretch from Australia in the south to Japan in the north.

"She has been at the top of US politics for decades and is one of the leading female voices in a male-dominated Congress. But Nancy Pelosi has announced that she will no longer lead the Democrats in the House of Representatives, saying the time had come ""for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus"". She will remain in the House as a member, representing California's 12th district. Mrs Pelosi is the first woman in US history to serve as speaker of the House and has played a critical role in advancing - or thwarting - the agendas of multiple presidents. Her legislative acumen, her ability to keep a restless party united when it matters, and her instinct for political theatre have made her a force on Capitol Hill, as well as a lightning rod for criticism from her detractors. Mrs Pelosi grew up in a political family, the youngest of seven children in the East Coast city of Baltimore, Maryland, where her father was once mayor. She went to college in nearby Washington DC, where she met and eventually married financier Paul Pelosi. They first moved to Manhattan, and then San Francisco, where Mrs Pelosi started as a housewife. She had five children - four daughters and a son - in the space of six years. In 1976, she became involved in politics, using her old family connections to help California Governor Jerry Brown win the Maryland primary as he ran for president. This video can not be played Testy exchanges between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer in the Oval Office She then rose through the ranks of the state's Democratic Party, eventually becoming its chair and then winning a seat in Congress in 1987. In 2001, she ran for House minority whip - her party's vote-counter and second-in-command in the House of Representatives - and won a narrow victory. The next year she moved up to minority leader, the title held by the person leading the opposition in the House. Mrs Pelosi was one of the highest-profile, most outspoken opponents of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. This stand was vindicated and paid dividends in 2006 when the Democrats took control of the House for the first time in 12 years. She was elected by her party to be speaker of the House, becoming the first woman in that role in US history. Congresswoman Pelosi watches on as President Bill Clinton signs an executive order in 1993 Speaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. After the vice-president, it is next in line. Its massive office, in the Capitol rotunda, reflects the prestige of the job, with its own balcony looking out toward the Washington Monument. The majority party in the House has virtually unfettered control over the legislative process. The speaker and her deputies and committee chairs determine what bills are considered and voted on. They set the agenda and decide the rules governing debate. Mrs Pelosi was in the role for four years, until Democrats lost control of the lower chamber of Congress. Despite the setback, Mrs Pelosi defeated several challenges within her own ranks, to take the gavel once more at the helm of a resurgent party in 2018. Mrs Pelosi faced very different circumstances when she returned to the speaker's chair in 2018. By then she was a lightning rod for Republican anger - in their eyes, representing the coastal elites pushing a big-spending, radical platform. The remarkable comeback of America's most powerful woman During the 2018 midterms campaign, for example, Republican incumbent Virginia Congressman David Brat mentioned Nancy Pelosi and her ""liberal agenda"" 21 times in one debate. The move backfired for him - and his party - as Democrats swept to a historic win in the House. But this time she had President Donald Trump as well as the wily Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as obstacles. So any bills her party got through the House didn't go any further. In viral terms, her big moment was her sarcastic #PelosiClap during Mr Trump's State of the Union speech a month after she took office. It still lives on as a popular gif. This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the president's speech at the end of his address Most controversially, 12 months later she ripped up Mr Trump's speech in front of the TV cameras. Accused of disrespect, she later defended the move, calling his words a ""manifesto of mistruths"". Mrs Pelosi was initially reluctant to lead only the third ever impeachment of a US president. But as more emerged in 2019 of Mr Trump's dealings with Ukraine, she eventually said it was an abuse of power that could not be ignored. He was accused of pressing Ukraine to dig up damaging information on Joe Biden, and using military aid as leverage - but was acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate. In her fourth term as speaker, after Mr Biden took office, she has been able to shepherd much of the president's legislative agenda through her chamber despite the razor-thin margins. In less than two years, Democrats in the House passed a Covid relief bill, a bipartisan infrastructure spending package, a multi-trillion-dollar environment and social spending programme, and legislation protecting gay marriage. That she was able to pull this off, when losing more than a vote or two would have meant failure, is testament to her ability to keep her party's liberal and centrist members in the fold. More recently, she enraged China by becoming the most senior US lawmaker to visit Taiwan in 25 years. China views the island as its own, and punished the US with military drills and the curtailing of diplomatic relations in the aftermath of her trip. The trip may have been means to burnish her political legacy, in the twilight of her long political career, says the BBC's Anthony Zurcher. It was a historic trip to end her tenure - setting down a marker for democracy over autocracy, as she has framed it - and could have been her way of exiting the stage with a flourish. ""I never would have thought that someday I would go from homemaker to House speaker,"" Mrs Pelosi said in the House chamber as she announced she was standing down.

"Dr Rowan Williams was Archbishop of Canterbury for almost ten years, stepping down in December 2012 Devolution ""is not being given serious attention"" in Westminster, the former Archbishop of Canterbury has said. Dr Rowan Williams believes the UK government ""is a problem for us here in Wales"". As co-chairman ofa commission looking into the constitutional future,externalof Wales, he was participating in a panel discussion on Wednesday. The UK government said devolution remained ""a priority"" and was putting funds in ""the hands of local leaders"". Dr Williams also said he believed Wales was now in a position where more, rather than less, devolution was likely. Independence to be considered by commission Welsh independence: How worried should UK ministers be? ""The commission's task isn't to decide on the future but to discuss options - such as independence or devolution - the questions are open,"" he said. ""From where I stand, more devolution is most probable."" Independence marches have attracted large crowds recently He was also asked about comments from Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss thatNicola Sturgeon ""should be ignored"". ""Of course, the Westminster government is a problem for us here in Wales,"" he said. ""What will transpire in Westminster, I don't know, but of course I hope the devolution will get serious treatment in Westminster.

Liz Truss is vying with Rishi Sunak to replace Boris Johnson as the leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister Originally from Swansea, Dr Williams was Archbishop of Canterbury between February 2003 and December 2012. He has criticised Prime Minister Boris Johnson on several occasions, including recently overthe Partygate scandaland the Westminster government'spolicy of sending refugees to Rwanda. With a new prime minister to be elected by Conservative Party members in the coming weeks, Dr Williams was asked whether he thought there would be better moral leadership under either Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss. He responded: ""It is difficult for me to believe there could be less moral leadership than under Boris Johnson. I hope things will improve there."" The UK government said: ""Devolution remains a priority which is why we are working closely with devolved administrations and ensuring the Welsh government is resourced to play its part.

"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been answering questions from Tory party members at a hustings event in Cardiff They were grilled on topics including tax and how they would tackle the cost-of-living crisis Truss said she had a bold plan to increase economic growth, first by ditching all EU laws still in place by 2023 She also insisted her proposal to link public sector pay to local living costs, scrapped shortly after it was announced, was ""misinterpreted"" by ""the media"" Sunak welcomed her U-turn, saying it would have meant ""almost half a million workers in Wales getting a pay cut"" He also stressed that he was the better candidate to ""smash"" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer, saying only he could win the Tories a fifth general election Meanwhile, in a boost for Truss, former health secretary Sajid Javid threw his support behind her Edited by Chris Giles That's it for this evening, thanks for joining us. Tomorrow night at 8pm both candidates will go head-to-head in a special programme for Sky News â join us for full coverage of that. Meanwhile, the next hustings will take place in Eastbourne on Friday. Our coverage was brought to you by Adam Durbin, Dulcie Lee, James FitzGerald, Nathan Williams and Chris Giles. The finalists in the Tory leadership contest, Liz Truss and
Rishi Sunak, have been answering questions from Tory members in Cardiff. They were grilled on topics including their tax plans and how to
tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Hereâs a quick look back at some of what was said. Liz Truss Rishi Sunak  What happened earlier? Rajdeep SandhuWestminster correspondent If Liz Truss becomes prime minister she will have to build
relations with the first ministers of Wales and Scotland. She was asked if she
would ignore them, after previously saying she's would ignore Nicola Sturgeon. Her claim that the ""entire resources of the Scottish
government are being used to run essentially an independence campaign""
will be challenge by those in the SNP. So will the claim that Scottish government
wasn't delivering for people. It will do nothing to reduce tensions between the two, but
of course her focus at the moment is the Conservative membership. Liz Truss has described Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford as a ""low-energy version of Jeremy Corbyn"" days after criticising Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon. She called Sturgeon ""an attention seeker"" who is ""best ignored"" during Monday's hustings in Exeter. Truss lambasted Drakeford for his ""negativity"" over a 2019 decision to drop the M4 relief road. There was no immediate response from Drakeford or Welsh Labour to Truss's comments. Earlier in the week, Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney described Truss's attack on Sturgeon as ""completely and utterly unacceptable"". David DeansBBC Wales politics reporter If your question was whether Rishi Sunak will devolve more powers to the Welsh Parliament as prime minister, it seems clear he will not. He told Tory members that âonward devolutionâ had not improved things in health and education, and intimated that he would get more involved in Welsh affairs. Would he intervene in health and education? There was nothing concrete â but he said he would be an âactivistâ prime minister â the suggestion was there. Sunak walked into the All Nations Centre with what sounded like a plan to win over sceptical Welsh Tory voters, many of whom are often assumed to be devo-sceptics. But there was no arms race on the subject with front runner Liz Truss. She had little to say when it came to the constitution of Wales - the nearest she got to the subject was a comment that she said it was right that the Welsh government run the NHS â which it has since 1999 and is only interesting because of the comments of her rival. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Let's take a closer look at the candidates' stance on policies which often split opinion among Conservative Party members - who, of course, are key to winning this contest. Housing targets- The manifesto promised 300,000 new homes every year by the middle of the decade.Bothcandidates would abandon the target. New grammar schools- Opening new grammar schools in England is banned - but current ones can be expanded. Both candidates support the selective schools.Sunakbacks expanding existing ones.Trusshasn't explicitly said sheâd change the law to allow new grammars - but hinted at it. Net migration targets- For years, the government wanted to get yearly net migration under 100,000. That target was dropped in the 2019 manifesto and neither candidate has suggested they would bring it back. Third Heathrow runway- Neither candidate would give us a yes or no answer. Read more - from stop and search to banning foie gras -here. Rajdeep SandhuWestminster correspondent Rishi Sunak seems to have had a change of heart on his
onshore wind policy. The government was keen to allow for more onshore wind
where local communities were happy with it. But Rishi Sunak was against that
idea. He said he would scrap plans to relax a ban on onshore wind. Tonight when asked if he would be ""bold"" enough to scrap the embargo of onshore
wind in England. He replied, ""Yes in a nutshell... we are open to that where
we can do it with local communities."" That would revert back to the
current government policy. But it seems to be the opposite of what he has said before. ""I was an environmentalist before it was fashionable,"" says Liz Truss, when she's asked about her green credentials. She says she was campaigning to protect the ozone layer in the 90s, adding: ""We cannot let green issues be owned by the left"". Truss says she wants to hit the net zero target - that's the government's pledge to balance the greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere with those which are being removed - by 2050. But she wants a temporary moratorium on the green levy and wants use more gas in the short term. Truss is asked how she would continue to fund social care, given that she has pledged to reverse a rise in national insurance that was announced by her government in April. She insists she is ""still committed"" to funding for both social care and the NHS. But the money would come from ""general taxation"", Truss explains. She adds that she would prioritise social care ahead of the NHS, because ""councils are struggling"". She claims issues with social care are having a knock-on effect, by keeping people stuck in NHS hospital beds. This campaign has seen mudslinging and ""patronising mansplaining"", one Tory member says, asking Truss what she'll do to repair the damage before the next election. Truss says she agrees that there have been some ""unfortunate occurrences"". She says she wouldn't have so many debates again: ""I think it's better if we're talking to each other within the Conservative Party, rather than airing our dirty linen in public."" As prime minister, she says she'd appoint trusted and competent people who don't spend their time ""leaking and briefing"", which she says will help the party win against Labour. Truss also gets the quickfire treatment, and her answer to how her friends would describe her is ""determined, loyal and fun"". On what makes her nervous, she opts for a topical reference and says when the Lionesses were 2-1 with 10 minutes to go in extra time before their recent Euro 2022 win. She also says she ""doesn't like jumping over large caverns and things like that"". Asked why she would be a better candidate than Sir Keir Starmer at the next general election, Truss says recent evidence shows she would be more popular than the Labour leader. She adds that the reality is the Tories must deliver on their 2019 manifesto and says she is someone who is trusted and who delivers. We've just heard that one of Liz Truss's favourite songs is the theme from the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, sung by Dame Shirley Bassey. It's in reply to a question from host Hannah Vaughan Jones, who wonders what Wales means to Truss. The answer turns out to be lamb and beef, childhood holidays and the music of Dame Shirley. Following another exchange with Vaughan Jones, she jokes: ""I thought you were going to ask me to sing Goldfinger [...] some people have heard it."" Liz Truss is asked if she would increase the slice of the UK government's money which is given to Wales. She doesn't give a direct answer. When pushed, she says spending ""automatically follows"" from the Barnet formula, which is used to calculate how much money the devolved nations receive from the UK government. But she doesn't say whether she'd tweak the formula. Unsurprisingly, the first question to Liz Truss is about her swiftly scrapped plans for regional pay boards for public servants. Asked if it was actually a misrepresented policy, she says it was misinterpreted by the media and was never intended to apply to nurses, doctors and teachers. Truss adds she wanted to clear up the policy right away and that they are not going ahead with it. Pressed on where the predicted Â£8.8bn savings her campaign said it would save will come from instead, Truss says its ""not part of my central costings"" to pay for her planned Â£30bn of tax cuts. She says her reversal of the NI rise, keeping corporation tax low and a temporary moratorium on green energy levies will be paid for from general taxation. ""We'll still be able to get the debt falling within three years,"" she adds. Truss says the policy in question was a much longer term plan, but then repeats it isn't going ahead anyway. She concludes that she is someone ""when things are misinterpreted, when mistakes are made I'm honest about that"". Rishi's Q&A session concludes with the former chancellor promising he can ""smash"" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer at the next general election if the Tory faithful make him their leader. His questioner had pointed out that Sir Keir appears to be neck-and-neck with Sunak according to national polling - but that Truss is consistently ahead of Sunak in polls of Tory members. ""Thank you - I think - for highlighting the stats,"" says Sunak. He suggests Tory members should seek the opinions of others in their community before voting in the leadership contest. Only Tory members can vote in the leadership contest. It's important that the party ""provide[s] a leader who can lead the entire country,"" he explains. Sunak is asked how he will boost renewable energy â and whether he'll be ""bold"" enough to scrap the de facto ban on new on-shore wind turbines. ""Yes, in a nutshell,"" he replies. Sunak says he's already said he's open to that where it can be done with local communities. He admits that it's proven difficult, but with different economic incentives, he says it might be possible to get it to work. The same goes for fracking, he says. In the short term, he says the government needs to help people insulate their homes better, which will also improve the country's energy security. Sunak is also asked how he would cut the size of the civil service and ensure civil servants ""return to their desks"" He says one of his final acts as chancellor was to start a process asking departments to come back with a plan to cut the number of civil servants by a ""significant amount"" and reduce the size of government. Sunak adds the previous coalition government deserves credit for being ""tough on this"", but says subsequent governments ""four of five years ago slightly took our foot off the gas and the numbers have creeped up"". He says this can be achieved by ""reforming the public services more generally"" to reduce the size of the state and tax burden. Sunak concludes civil service cuts alone will not deliver tax cuts and that the government needs to ""think boldly and differently across the board"" in finding savings. He also argues that ""radical thinking"" about reforming the NHS is key to making savings and improving public services generally. A curveball for Rishi Sunak, whoâs asked by an audience member
to say why he thinks a Tory member should vote not for him â but for Liz Truss. Sunak greets the challenge with a chuckle â saying the two are
members of the same âfamilyâ who share values. He says heâs confident his leadership rival will ""also give
her all"" at beating Labour in a general election. ""If you think sheâs the best person, so be it,"" he
says. We've got our first audience question â and Rishi Sunak is asked about the war in Ukraine. Two things need to be done, Sunak says: strengthen Ukraine and weaken Russia. And he says he's played an ""instrumental part"" in weakening Russia. ""If you think about how we're attacking Russia at the moment â it's not with our direct arms, it's not through diplomacy, it's through economic sanctions,"" he says. The former chancellor adds that he won't give an ""arbitrary target"" for defence spending, but promises to invest ""whatever it takes to keep all of you and everyone else in our country safe"". Quickfire questions for Sunak now, who is asked first how his friends would describe him in three words? ""Loyal, honest and hardworking"", is the answer. On what makes him nervous, after some appropriately nervous laughter he concludes it is his ""wife and two kids"" - an answer which may not be best received at home in Yorkshire. His third question is: Why should people like him? To which Sunak replies that people make their own judgements based on his record as chancellor in the last few years. Â© 2025 BBC.

He told Tory members that âonward devolutionâ had not improved things in health and education, and intimated that he would get more involved in Welsh affairs. Would he intervene in health and education? There was nothing concrete â but he said he would be an âactivistâ prime minister â the suggestion was there. Sunak walked into the All Nations Centre with what sounded like a plan to win over sceptical Welsh Tory voters, many of whom are often assumed to be devo-sceptics. But there was no arms race on the subject with front runner Liz Truss. She had little to say when it came to the constitution of Wales - the nearest she got to the subject was a comment that she said it was right that the Welsh government run the NHS â which it has since 1999 and is only interesting because of the comments of her rival. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Let's take a closer look at the candidates' stance on policies which often split opinion among Conservative Party members - who, of course, are key to winning this contest. Housing targets- The manifesto promised 300,000 new homes every year by the middle of the decade.Bothcandidates would abandon the target. New grammar schools- Opening new grammar schools in England is banned - but current ones can be expanded. Both candidates support the selective schools.Sunakbacks expanding existing ones.Trusshasn't explicitly said sheâd change the law to allow new grammars - but hinted at it. Net migration targets- For years, the government wanted to get yearly net migration under 100,000. That target was dropped in the 2019 manifesto and neither candidate has suggested they would bring it back. Third Heathrow runway- Neither candidate would give us a yes or no answer. Read more - from stop and search to banning foie gras -here. Rajdeep SandhuWestminster correspondent Rishi Sunak seems to have had a change of heart on his
onshore wind policy. The government was keen to allow for more onshore wind
where local communities were happy with it. But Rishi Sunak was against that
idea. He said he would scrap plans to relax a ban on onshore wind. Tonight when asked if he would be ""bold"" enough to scrap the embargo of onshore
wind in England. He replied, ""Yes in a nutshell... we are open to that where
we can do it with local communities."" That would revert back to the
current government policy. But it seems to be the opposite of what he has said before. ""I was an environmentalist before it was fashionable,"" says Liz Truss, when she's asked about her green credentials. She says she was campaigning to protect the ozone layer in the 90s, adding: ""We cannot let green issues be owned by the left"". Truss says she wants to hit the net zero target - that's the government's pledge to balance the greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere with those which are being removed - by 2050. But she wants a temporary moratorium on the green levy and wants use more gas in the short term. Truss is asked how she would continue to fund social care, given that she has pledged to reverse a rise in national insurance that was announced by her government in April. She insists she is ""still committed"" to funding for both social care and the NHS. But the money would come from ""general taxation"", Truss explains. She adds that she would prioritise social care ahead of the NHS, because ""councils are struggling"". She claims issues with social care are having a knock-on effect, by keeping people stuck in NHS hospital beds. This campaign has seen mudslinging and ""patronising mansplaining"", one Tory member says, asking Truss what she'll do to repair the damage before the next election. Truss says she agrees that there have been some ""unfortunate occurrences"". She says she wouldn't have so many debates again: ""I think it's better if we're talking to each other within the Conservative Party, rather than airing our dirty linen in public."" As prime minister, she says she'd appoint trusted and competent people who don't spend their time ""leaking and briefing"", which she says will help the party win against Labour. Truss also gets the quickfire treatment, and her answer to how her friends would describe her is ""determined, loyal and fun"". On what makes her nervous, she opts for a topical reference and says when the Lionesses were 2-1 with 10 minutes to go in extra time before their recent Euro 2022 win. She also says she ""doesn't like jumping over large caverns and things like that"". Asked why she would be a better candidate than Sir Keir Starmer at the next general election, Truss says recent evidence shows she would be more popular than the Labour leader. She adds that the reality is the Tories must deliver on their 2019 manifesto and says she is someone who is trusted and who delivers. We've just heard that one of Liz Truss's favourite songs is the theme from the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, sung by Dame Shirley Bassey. It's in reply to a question from host Hannah Vaughan Jones, who wonders what Wales means to Truss. The answer turns out to be lamb and beef, childhood holidays and the music of Dame Shirley. Following another exchange with Vaughan Jones, she jokes: ""I thought you were going to ask me to sing Goldfinger [...] some people have heard it."" Liz Truss is asked if she would increase the slice of the UK government's money which is given to Wales. She doesn't give a direct answer. When pushed, she says spending ""automatically follows"" from the Barnet formula, which is used to calculate how much money the devolved nations receive from the UK government. But she doesn't say whether she'd tweak the formula. Unsurprisingly, the first question to Liz Truss is about her swiftly scrapped plans for regional pay boards for public servants. Asked if it was actually a misrepresented policy, she says it was misinterpreted by the media and was never intended to apply to nurses, doctors and teachers. Truss adds she wanted to clear up the policy right away and that they are not going ahead with it. Pressed on where the predicted Â£8.8bn savings her campaign said it would save will come from instead, Truss says its ""not part of my central costings"" to pay for her planned Â£30bn of tax cuts. She says her reversal of the NI rise, keeping corporation tax low and a temporary moratorium on green energy levies will be paid for from general taxation. ""We'll still be able to get the debt falling within three years,"" she adds. Truss says the policy in question was a much longer term plan, but then repeats it isn't going ahead anyway. She concludes that she is someone ""when things are misinterpreted, when mistakes are made I'm honest about that"". Rishi's Q&A session concludes with the former chancellor promising he can ""smash"" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer at the next general election if the Tory faithful make him their leader. His questioner had pointed out that Sir Keir appears to be neck-and-neck with Sunak according to national polling - but that Truss is consistently ahead of Sunak in polls of Tory members. ""Thank you - I think - for highlighting the stats,"" says Sunak. He suggests Tory members should seek the opinions of others in their community before voting in the leadership contest. Only Tory members can vote in the leadership contest. It's important that the party ""provide[s] a leader who can lead the entire country,"" he explains. Sunak is asked how he will boost renewable energy â and whether he'll be ""bold"" enough to scrap the de facto ban on new on-shore wind turbines. ""Yes, in a nutshell,"" he replies. Sunak says he's already said he's open to that where it can be done with local communities. He admits that it's proven difficult, but with different economic incentives, he says it might be possible to get it to work. The same goes for fracking, he says. In the short term, he says the government needs to help people insulate their homes better, which will also improve the country's energy security. Sunak is also asked how he would cut the size of the civil service and ensure civil servants ""return to their desks"" He says one of his final acts as chancellor was to start a process asking departments to come back with a plan to cut the number of civil servants by a ""significant amount"" and reduce the size of government. Sunak adds the previous coalition government deserves credit for being ""tough on this"", but says subsequent governments ""four of five years ago slightly took our foot off the gas and the numbers have creeped up"". He says this can be achieved by ""reforming the public services more generally"" to reduce the size of the state and tax burden. Sunak concludes civil service cuts alone will not deliver tax cuts and that the government needs to ""think boldly and differently across the board"" in finding savings. He also argues that ""radical thinking"" about reforming the NHS is key to making savings and improving public services generally. A curveball for Rishi Sunak, whoâs asked by an audience member
to say why he thinks a Tory member should vote not for him â but for Liz Truss. Sunak greets the challenge with a chuckle â saying the two are
members of the same âfamilyâ who share values. He says heâs confident his leadership rival will ""also give
her all"" at beating Labour in a general election. ""If you think sheâs the best person, so be it,"" he
says. We've got our first audience question â and Rishi Sunak is asked about the war in Ukraine. Two things need to be done, Sunak says: strengthen Ukraine and weaken Russia. And he says he's played an ""instrumental part"" in weakening Russia. ""If you think about how we're attacking Russia at the moment â it's not with our direct arms, it's not through diplomacy, it's through economic sanctions,"" he says. The former chancellor adds that he won't give an ""arbitrary target"" for defence spending, but promises to invest ""whatever it takes to keep all of you and everyone else in our country safe"". Quickfire questions for Sunak now, who is asked first how his friends would describe him in three words? ""Loyal, honest and hardworking"", is the answer. On what makes him nervous, after some appropriately nervous laughter he concludes it is his ""wife and two kids"" - an answer which may not be best received at home in Yorkshire. His third question is: Why should people like him? To which Sunak replies that people make their own judgements based on his record as chancellor in the last few years. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tomorrow night at 8pm both candidates will go head-to-head in a special programme for Sky News â join us for full coverage of that. Meanwhile, the next hustings will take place in Eastbourne on Friday. Our coverage was brought to you by Adam Durbin, Dulcie Lee, James FitzGerald, Nathan Williams and Chris Giles. The finalists in the Tory leadership contest, Liz Truss and
Rishi Sunak, have been answering questions from Tory members in Cardiff. They were grilled on topics including their tax plans and how to
tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Hereâs a quick look back at some of what was said. Liz Truss Rishi Sunak  What happened earlier? Rajdeep SandhuWestminster correspondent If Liz Truss becomes prime minister she will have to build
relations with the first ministers of Wales and Scotland. She was asked if she
would ignore them, after previously saying she's would ignore Nicola Sturgeon. Her claim that the ""entire resources of the Scottish
government are being used to run essentially an independence campaign""
will be challenge by those in the SNP. So will the claim that Scottish government
wasn't delivering for people. It will do nothing to reduce tensions between the two, but
of course her focus at the moment is the Conservative membership. Liz Truss has described Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford as a ""low-energy version of Jeremy Corbyn"" days after criticising Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon. She called Sturgeon ""an attention seeker"" who is ""best ignored"" during Monday's hustings in Exeter. Truss lambasted Drakeford for his ""negativity"" over a 2019 decision to drop the M4 relief road. There was no immediate response from Drakeford or Welsh Labour to Truss's comments. Earlier in the week, Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney described Truss's attack on Sturgeon as ""completely and utterly unacceptable"".

Sunak adds the previous coalition government deserves credit for being ""tough on this"", but says subsequent governments ""four of five years ago slightly took our foot off the gas and the numbers have creeped up"". He says this can be achieved by ""reforming the public services more generally"" to reduce the size of the state and tax burden. Sunak concludes civil service cuts alone will not deliver tax cuts and that the government needs to ""think boldly and differently across the board"" in finding savings. He also argues that ""radical thinking"" about reforming the NHS is key to making savings and improving public services generally. A curveball for Rishi Sunak, whoâs asked by an audience member
to say why he thinks a Tory member should vote not for him â but for Liz Truss. Sunak greets the challenge with a chuckle â saying the two are
members of the same âfamilyâ who share values. He says heâs confident his leadership rival will ""also give
her all"" at beating Labour in a general election. ""If you think sheâs the best person, so be it,"" he
says. We've got our first audience question â and Rishi Sunak is asked about the war in Ukraine. Two things need to be done, Sunak says: strengthen Ukraine and weaken Russia. And he says he's played an ""instrumental part"" in weakening Russia. ""If you think about how we're attacking Russia at the moment â it's not with our direct arms, it's not through diplomacy, it's through economic sanctions,"" he says. The former chancellor adds that he won't give an ""arbitrary target"" for defence spending, but promises to invest ""whatever it takes to keep all of you and everyone else in our country safe"". Quickfire questions for Sunak now, who is asked first how his friends would describe him in three words? ""Loyal, honest and hardworking"", is the answer. On what makes him nervous, after some appropriately nervous laughter he concludes it is his ""wife and two kids"" - an answer which may not be best received at home in Yorkshire. His third question is: Why should people like him? To which Sunak replies that people make their own judgements based on his record as chancellor in the last few years. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Refuse workers in Glasgow took strike action in November 2021 Only a ""significantly improved"" pay offer will stop thousands of Scotland's council workers going on strike, a union has warned. Staff at schools, nurseries and waste and recycling centresvoted to strike after rejecting a 2% pay offer. The Scottish government and local authority body Cosla met on Wednesday to discuss the dispute. But GMB Scotland has warned workers expect a better pay deal or they will take action. Deputy First Minister John Swinney later described the talks as ""constructive"" and said the Scottish government, despite having no formal role in pay negotiations, was working with Cosla to ""explore all options available"". He added: ""Local government workers play a crucial role in our communities and are integral to our recovery from the pandemic. ""I would urge all parties to continue a dialogue and reach a resolution which avoids industrial action."" No alternative to 'all-out' council strike - Unite Council workers in Scotland vote for strike action Will rows over pay lead to more industrial action in Scotland? Council leaders are set to discuss whether they can make an improved pay offer on Friday but, unless there is hope of a deal, unions are likely to announce strike dates in the next few days. Pay settlements for council workers - apart from teachers - are the responsibility of Cosla and it is meeting with the Scottish government to discuss its demand for more money for the deal. The Scottish government has urged all parties to find a resolution to avoid industrial action. Keir Greenaway, a senior organiser with the GMB Scotland, toldBBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland: ""There is the possibility of a resolution if the Scottish government can find more money for Cosla. ""I wouldn't say we we're confident, we haven't had a meeting with Cosla around pay since March. ""Our members are incredibly angry, they are seeing double digit inflation and were supposed to see a pay rise in April. ""Our members need a significantly improved offered or they are are falling into working poverty."" Strike action could result in rubbish piling up Mr Greenaway claimed the 2% offer was the lowest across the whole of the UK public sector. The strike ballot of about 25,000 council workers from the Unison, Unite and GMB unions was said to be the largest in more than a decade. Unions have said the strike action could happen after pupils return from the summer break in August, with hundreds of schools affected. It is estimated that more than half of Scotland's 250,000 council workers earn less than Â£25,000 a year for a 37-hour week. Cosla has said discussions with trade unions would continue in order to ""reach an agreement and avoid strike action.""

"It is the first visit to Wales for either candidate since the contest began Tory leadership contenders Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have vowed to hold the Welsh government to account ahead of an event in Cardiff. The pair are facing questions from party members at the only Welsh hustings of the leadership contest. Mr Sunak pledged to hold Labour ministers accountable for the NHS and schools in Wales. Meanwhile Ms Truss accused First Minister Mark Drakeford of letting Wales down. The Labour-run Welsh government declined to comment. Wednesday's event in Cardiff marks the first time either has visited Wales since the contest began. The new Conservative leader will be declared on 5 September, and will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. Of the contenders Mr Sunak has wider support among MPs and MSs in Wales. Backers include former Welsh Secretary Simon Hart, Brecon and Radnorshire MP Fay Jones, Montgomeryshire MP Craig Williams and Senedd Tory chief whip Darren Millar. Ms Truss, who is foreign secretary, is supported by Clwyd West MP David Jones and Senedd members Janet Finch Saunders and Laura Anne Jones. Security fears delay Tory leadership ballot papers Rishi Sunak backs Wales-only Covid inquiry What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Mr Sunak told BBC Wales' Walescast podcast the performance of the Welsh NHS was ""far worse"" than was the case with England's health service and said schools in Wales were funded ""far less"" than they were across the border, despite Wales receiving more public funding. The most recent analysis by theInstitute for Fiscal Studies,external, however, concluded spending per pupil was similar in both countries. Last month, the Education Policy Institute said poorer pupils in Wales werefurther behind their peersthan was the case in England, based on their GCSE results, with Welsh ministers saying they would try to close the ""attainment gap"". This video can not be played Rishi Sunak pledged to invest in Wales if he becomes prime minister The former chancellor said: ""I support devolution, of course I do, and I want to work constructively with the Welsh government, but I do think it's also right to hold them accountable. ""I think it's right that we have schools that are properly funded in Wales. ""I think it's right that we hold the Welsh government to account for the state of the NHS in Wales, with waiting times which are worse than anywhere else in the UK."" He said there should be an ""answer to the question of why NHS performances Wales is far worse than it is elsewhere in the UK"". ""I think the Welsh people deserve answers to those questions and I think it's perfectly reasonable for the prime minister of the United Kingdom to have a conversation about that and that's what I would like to do."" Rishi Sunak was greeted on arrival by Michael Howard and a group of Welsh politicians Protesters gathered in Cardiff ahead of the event Mr Sunak also announced he would make sure Wales would have two freeports, following an announcement in May that it would haveat least oneafter an agreement was reached between the UK and Welsh governments. Freeport status allows firms to import goods and then export them outside normal tax and customs rules. ""It's a policy which I created, it's an opportunity we have because of Brexit and it's working across the UK, bringing jobs and investment into areas,"" he said. ""People really want it and I'd be delighted as prime minister to make sure that Wales has not one but two freeports to bring jobs and investment.""Â This video can not be played Liz Truss says she âcancelledâ her public sector pay policy to make sure doctors and teachers ""werenât worriedâ. BBC Wales requests for an interview with Liz Truss have been declined. In a clip shared among broadcasters, she said Mark Drakeford ""has not delivered for the people of Wales and I will be holding him to account"". She said: ""The reality is that Wales has been let down by 20 years of Labour rule. ""What I am about is about making sure we bring opportunity, investment to Wales, that we back Wales' fantastic farmers, and that's what I'm going to be talking about in the hustings tonight."" In a pre-hustings article forWalesOnline,externalshe promised to ""level up Wales in a Conservative way"" The foreign secretary said the UK ""has the potential to be a high-growth and highly productive powerhouse, with Wales at its heart"" and promised ""full-fat freeports"". Ms Truss said she would work with the Labour Welsh government ""and local communities to identify areas which are ripe for transformation as part of a new investment zone"". Welsh Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens welcomed the pair to Cardiff, but said: ""Neither Liz Truss nor Rishi Sunak has had anything to say about Wales during this campaign, but their record of 12 years of Tory neglect tells us all we need to know: a high-tax, low-growth economy and the biggest drop in living standards since records began."" The hustings comes a day after Ms Truss initially announced proposals to link public sector pay to local living costs, before later scrapping them. The plan had faced criticism from some Conservatives, including Simon Hart, who claimed 430,000 workers in Wales faced a ""near Â£3,000 pay cut"". ""I never had any intention of changing the terms and conditions of teachers and nurses,""she said.

The unusual move follows a change in leadership after Warner Bros merged with Discovery in May 2021, with David Zaslav its new CEO. According to theHollywood Reporter,external, Zaslav has prioritised cost-cutting measures and refocusing the company on creating theatrical films rather than projects for streaming. Analysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter Films run into all kinds of issues while they're being made. Projects jump from one studio to another, directors and actors come and go, and scripts often get stuck in what's known as ""development hell"" for years before the cameras even start rolling. But what's happened with Batgirl is much more unusual. When a film is already in the can, and $70m (Â£58m) has been spent, it's extremely rare for it not to see the light of day. The film reportedly had not tested well with audiences in early screenings. To a certain extent, this isn't unusual for a big action movie - the special effects often aren't finished at the time the test screenings take place, which reduces viewers' enthusiasm. But a film company will still have a sense of whether or not they're on to a winner. In this case, it seems Batgirl was caught in the middle - not thought to be worthy of a cinema release, but equally not financially viable to release only for streaming subscribers. Shelving it means the company won't have to carry the losses on its books. There is also a strategic change at parent company Warner Discovery, which has decided it will no longer produce big-budget blockbusters solely for HBO Max, the streaming service it owns. That's a significant change from the ""day and date"" strategy adopted by the previous WarnerMedia CEO, which saw big blockbusters released on streaming at the same time as in cinemas. That might have made sense following the pandemic, but some industry figures are now starting to push back. Reverting to the traditional theatrical window makes more sense for many, particularly in a summer where films such as Top Gun: Maverick have been taking huge amounts of money at the box office, while enjoying the cultural relevance a cinema release brings with it. Batgirl was offered Â£150,000 by Glasgow City Council as an incentive to film in the area but it has not been paid. At the time Screen Scotland said any production given public money was expected to hire locally. Filming began at the end of 2021 and continued until March. Glasgow goes Gotham for Batgirl filming Does Scotland benefit when Hollywood comes to town? A spokesman for the local authority said the filming of Batgirl had brought a very significant economic benefit to the city - including 450 Glasgow-based crew jobs, about 1,300 Scottish supporting artists and many subcontractors working as tradespeople and in traffic management and security.

"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have been answering questions from Tory party members at a hustings event in Cardiff They were grilled on topics including tax and how they would tackle the cost-of-living crisis Truss said she had a bold plan to increase economic growth, first by ditching all EU laws still in place by 2023 She also insisted her proposal to link public sector pay to local living costs, scrapped shortly after it was announced, was ""misinterpreted"" by ""the media"" Sunak welcomed her U-turn, saying it would have meant ""almost half a million workers in Wales getting a pay cut"" He also stressed that he was the better candidate to ""smash"" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer, saying only he could win the Tories a fifth general election Meanwhile, in a boost for Truss, former health secretary Sajid Javid threw his support behind her Edited by Chris Giles That's it for this evening, thanks for joining us. Tomorrow night at 8pm both candidates will go head-to-head in a special programme for Sky News â join us for full coverage of that. Meanwhile, the next hustings will take place in Eastbourne on Friday. Our coverage was brought to you by Adam Durbin, Dulcie Lee, James FitzGerald, Nathan Williams and Chris Giles. The finalists in the Tory leadership contest, Liz Truss and
Rishi Sunak, have been answering questions from Tory members in Cardiff. They were grilled on topics including their tax plans and how to
tackle the cost-of-living crisis. Hereâs a quick look back at some of what was said. Liz Truss Rishi Sunak  What happened earlier? Rajdeep SandhuWestminster correspondent If Liz Truss becomes prime minister she will have to build
relations with the first ministers of Wales and Scotland. She was asked if she
would ignore them, after previously saying she's would ignore Nicola Sturgeon. Her claim that the ""entire resources of the Scottish
government are being used to run essentially an independence campaign""
will be challenge by those in the SNP. So will the claim that Scottish government
wasn't delivering for people. It will do nothing to reduce tensions between the two, but
of course her focus at the moment is the Conservative membership. Liz Truss has described Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford as a ""low-energy version of Jeremy Corbyn"" days after criticising Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon. She called Sturgeon ""an attention seeker"" who is ""best ignored"" during Monday's hustings in Exeter. Truss lambasted Drakeford for his ""negativity"" over a 2019 decision to drop the M4 relief road. There was no immediate response from Drakeford or Welsh Labour to Truss's comments. Earlier in the week, Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney described Truss's attack on Sturgeon as ""completely and utterly unacceptable"". David DeansBBC Wales politics reporter If your question was whether Rishi Sunak will devolve more powers to the Welsh Parliament as prime minister, it seems clear he will not. He told Tory members that âonward devolutionâ had not improved things in health and education, and intimated that he would get more involved in Welsh affairs. Would he intervene in health and education? There was nothing concrete â but he said he would be an âactivistâ prime minister â the suggestion was there. Sunak walked into the All Nations Centre with what sounded like a plan to win over sceptical Welsh Tory voters, many of whom are often assumed to be devo-sceptics. But there was no arms race on the subject with front runner Liz Truss. She had little to say when it came to the constitution of Wales - the nearest she got to the subject was a comment that she said it was right that the Welsh government run the NHS â which it has since 1999 and is only interesting because of the comments of her rival. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Let's take a closer look at the candidates' stance on policies which often split opinion among Conservative Party members - who, of course, are key to winning this contest. Housing targets- The manifesto promised 300,000 new homes every year by the middle of the decade.Bothcandidates would abandon the target. New grammar schools- Opening new grammar schools in England is banned - but current ones can be expanded. Both candidates support the selective schools.Sunakbacks expanding existing ones.Trusshasn't explicitly said sheâd change the law to allow new grammars - but hinted at it. Net migration targets- For years, the government wanted to get yearly net migration under 100,000. That target was dropped in the 2019 manifesto and neither candidate has suggested they would bring it back. Third Heathrow runway- Neither candidate would give us a yes or no answer. Read more - from stop and search to banning foie gras -here. Rajdeep SandhuWestminster correspondent Rishi Sunak seems to have had a change of heart on his
onshore wind policy. The government was keen to allow for more onshore wind
where local communities were happy with it. But Rishi Sunak was against that
idea. He said he would scrap plans to relax a ban on onshore wind. Tonight when asked if he would be ""bold"" enough to scrap the embargo of onshore
wind in England. He replied, ""Yes in a nutshell... we are open to that where
we can do it with local communities."" That would revert back to the
current government policy. But it seems to be the opposite of what he has said before. ""I was an environmentalist before it was fashionable,"" says Liz Truss, when she's asked about her green credentials. She says she was campaigning to protect the ozone layer in the 90s, adding: ""We cannot let green issues be owned by the left"". Truss says she wants to hit the net zero target - that's the government's pledge to balance the greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere with those which are being removed - by 2050. But she wants a temporary moratorium on the green levy and wants use more gas in the short term. Truss is asked how she would continue to fund social care, given that she has pledged to reverse a rise in national insurance that was announced by her government in April. She insists she is ""still committed"" to funding for both social care and the NHS. But the money would come from ""general taxation"", Truss explains. She adds that she would prioritise social care ahead of the NHS, because ""councils are struggling"". She claims issues with social care are having a knock-on effect, by keeping people stuck in NHS hospital beds. This campaign has seen mudslinging and ""patronising mansplaining"", one Tory member says, asking Truss what she'll do to repair the damage before the next election. Truss says she agrees that there have been some ""unfortunate occurrences"". She says she wouldn't have so many debates again: ""I think it's better if we're talking to each other within the Conservative Party, rather than airing our dirty linen in public."" As prime minister, she says she'd appoint trusted and competent people who don't spend their time ""leaking and briefing"", which she says will help the party win against Labour. Truss also gets the quickfire treatment, and her answer to how her friends would describe her is ""determined, loyal and fun"". On what makes her nervous, she opts for a topical reference and says when the Lionesses were 2-1 with 10 minutes to go in extra time before their recent Euro 2022 win. She also says she ""doesn't like jumping over large caverns and things like that"". Asked why she would be a better candidate than Sir Keir Starmer at the next general election, Truss says recent evidence shows she would be more popular than the Labour leader. She adds that the reality is the Tories must deliver on their 2019 manifesto and says she is someone who is trusted and who delivers. We've just heard that one of Liz Truss's favourite songs is the theme from the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, sung by Dame Shirley Bassey. It's in reply to a question from host Hannah Vaughan Jones, who wonders what Wales means to Truss. The answer turns out to be lamb and beef, childhood holidays and the music of Dame Shirley. Following another exchange with Vaughan Jones, she jokes: ""I thought you were going to ask me to sing Goldfinger [...] some people have heard it."" Liz Truss is asked if she would increase the slice of the UK government's money which is given to Wales. She doesn't give a direct answer. When pushed, she says spending ""automatically follows"" from the Barnet formula, which is used to calculate how much money the devolved nations receive from the UK government. But she doesn't say whether she'd tweak the formula. Unsurprisingly, the first question to Liz Truss is about her swiftly scrapped plans for regional pay boards for public servants. Asked if it was actually a misrepresented policy, she says it was misinterpreted by the media and was never intended to apply to nurses, doctors and teachers. Truss adds she wanted to clear up the policy right away and that they are not going ahead with it. Pressed on where the predicted Â£8.8bn savings her campaign said it would save will come from instead, Truss says its ""not part of my central costings"" to pay for her planned Â£30bn of tax cuts. She says her reversal of the NI rise, keeping corporation tax low and a temporary moratorium on green energy levies will be paid for from general taxation. ""We'll still be able to get the debt falling within three years,"" she adds. Truss says the policy in question was a much longer term plan, but then repeats it isn't going ahead anyway. She concludes that she is someone ""when things are misinterpreted, when mistakes are made I'm honest about that"". Rishi's Q&A session concludes with the former chancellor promising he can ""smash"" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer at the next general election if the Tory faithful make him their leader. His questioner had pointed out that Sir Keir appears to be neck-and-neck with Sunak according to national polling - but that Truss is consistently ahead of Sunak in polls of Tory members. ""Thank you - I think - for highlighting the stats,"" says Sunak. He suggests Tory members should seek the opinions of others in their community before voting in the leadership contest. Only Tory members can vote in the leadership contest. It's important that the party ""provide[s] a leader who can lead the entire country,"" he explains. Sunak is asked how he will boost renewable energy â and whether he'll be ""bold"" enough to scrap the de facto ban on new on-shore wind turbines. ""Yes, in a nutshell,"" he replies. Sunak says he's already said he's open to that where it can be done with local communities. He admits that it's proven difficult, but with different economic incentives, he says it might be possible to get it to work. The same goes for fracking, he says. In the short term, he says the government needs to help people insulate their homes better, which will also improve the country's energy security. Sunak is also asked how he would cut the size of the civil service and ensure civil servants ""return to their desks"" He says one of his final acts as chancellor was to start a process asking departments to come back with a plan to cut the number of civil servants by a ""significant amount"" and reduce the size of government. Sunak adds the previous coalition government deserves credit for being ""tough on this"", but says subsequent governments ""four of five years ago slightly took our foot off the gas and the numbers have creeped up"". He says this can be achieved by ""reforming the public services more generally"" to reduce the size of the state and tax burden. Sunak concludes civil service cuts alone will not deliver tax cuts and that the government needs to ""think boldly and differently across the board"" in finding savings. He also argues that ""radical thinking"" about reforming the NHS is key to making savings and improving public services generally. A curveball for Rishi Sunak, whoâs asked by an audience member
to say why he thinks a Tory member should vote not for him â but for Liz Truss. Sunak greets the challenge with a chuckle â saying the two are
members of the same âfamilyâ who share values. He says heâs confident his leadership rival will ""also give
her all"" at beating Labour in a general election. ""If you think sheâs the best person, so be it,"" he
says. We've got our first audience question â and Rishi Sunak is asked about the war in Ukraine. Two things need to be done, Sunak says: strengthen Ukraine and weaken Russia. And he says he's played an ""instrumental part"" in weakening Russia. ""If you think about how we're attacking Russia at the moment â it's not with our direct arms, it's not through diplomacy, it's through economic sanctions,"" he says. The former chancellor adds that he won't give an ""arbitrary target"" for defence spending, but promises to invest ""whatever it takes to keep all of you and everyone else in our country safe"". Quickfire questions for Sunak now, who is asked first how his friends would describe him in three words? ""Loyal, honest and hardworking"", is the answer. On what makes him nervous, after some appropriately nervous laughter he concludes it is his ""wife and two kids"" - an answer which may not be best received at home in Yorkshire. His third question is: Why should people like him? To which Sunak replies that people make their own judgements based on his record as chancellor in the last few years. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The film was based on the DC Comics character Barbara Gordon - or Batgirl - played by Leslie Grace The new Batgirl movie has been scrapped by Warner Bros Discovery months before its planned release. Reportedly budgeted at more than $70m (Â£58m), it was due to be shown in cinemas and on the streaming service HBO Max later this year. The New York Post reported that the decision had followed apoor reaction to test screenings.,external However, Warner Bros said the move reflected its ""leadership's strategic shift"". The production was filmed entirely in Glasgow and the local council said it had brought a significant economic benefit to the city. The film was based on the DC Comics character Barbara Gordon - or Batgirl - played by Leslie Grace. She appeared alongside Michael Keaton as Batman, Brendan Fraser as villain Firefly and JK Simmons as Commissioner James Gordon. Actress Leslie Grace was spotted in Glasgow in January Scene dressers brought the DC Comics universe alive in Glasgow city centre Warner Bros also confirmed that Scoob! Holiday Haunt would be scrapped. A spokesperson for the firm said: ""The decision to not release Batgirl reflects our leadership's strategic shift as it relates to the DC universe and HBO Max. ""Leslie Grace is an incredibly talented actor and this decision is not a reflection of her performance. ""We are incredibly grateful to the filmmakers of Batgirl and Scoob! Holiday Haunt and their respective casts and we hope to collaborate with everyone again in the near future."" The unusual move follows a change in leadership after Warner Bros merged with Discovery in May 2021, with David Zaslav its new CEO. According to theHollywood Reporter,external, Zaslav has prioritised cost-cutting measures and refocusing the company on creating theatrical films rather than projects for streaming. Analysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter Films run into all kinds of issues while they're being made. Projects jump from one studio to another, directors and actors come and go, and scripts often get stuck in what's known as ""development hell"" for years before the cameras even start rolling. But what's happened with Batgirl is much more unusual. When a film is already in the can, and $70m (Â£58m) has been spent, it's extremely rare for it not to see the light of day. The film reportedly had not tested well with audiences in early screenings. To a certain extent, this isn't unusual for a big action movie - the special effects often aren't finished at the time the test screenings take place, which reduces viewers' enthusiasm. But a film company will still have a sense of whether or not they're on to a winner. In this case, it seems Batgirl was caught in the middle - not thought to be worthy of a cinema release, but equally not financially viable to release only for streaming subscribers. Shelving it means the company won't have to carry the losses on its books. There is also a strategic change at parent company Warner Discovery, which has decided it will no longer produce big-budget blockbusters solely for HBO Max, the streaming service it owns. That's a significant change from the ""day and date"" strategy adopted by the previous WarnerMedia CEO, which saw big blockbusters released on streaming at the same time as in cinemas. That might have made sense following the pandemic, but some industry figures are now starting to push back. Reverting to the traditional theatrical window makes more sense for many, particularly in a summer where films such as Top Gun: Maverick have been taking huge amounts of money at the box office, while enjoying the cultural relevance a cinema release brings with it. Batgirl was offered Â£150,000 by Glasgow City Council as an incentive to film in the area but it has not been paid. At the time Screen Scotland said any production given public money was expected to hire locally. Filming began at the end of 2021 and continued until March. Glasgow goes Gotham for Batgirl filming Does Scotland benefit when Hollywood comes to town? A spokesman for the local authority said the filming of Batgirl had brought a very significant economic benefit to the city - including 450 Glasgow-based crew jobs, about 1,300 Scottish supporting artists and many subcontractors working as tradespeople and in traffic management and security. He added: ""Any decision on the release of the production is very much a matter for Warner Bros.  The Â£150,000 grant support has not been paid, and discussions continue with the producers."" Superman Lives: Director of cult film Clerks, Kevin Smith, tells a story in his stand-up shows about when he was commissioned to write a version of Superman in the late 90s - with the condition the protagonist had to fight a giant spider. It was one of many ideas put forward for the film, with Smith's script thrown out by director Tim Burton - who also chose Nicolas Cage to be the film's leading man. More than $10m (Â£7.18m) of pre-production money was invested in Superman Lives but Warner Broscancelled the operation three weeks before shootingwas due to begin - one documentary suggested it was because of a series of big-budget flops that the company made in 1997. 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea: The Australian government had offered $20m to secure the production of a remake of Jules Verne's classic story. Years of work was put into the film before director David Fincher (Fight Club, Se7en) left the project in 2013. He had been courting Brad Pitt to play the lead role of Ned Land, but Pitt officially turned the role down earlier that year. Yellow Submarine: In 2009, Disney and director Robert Zemeckis announced a remake of the Beatles' 1968 musical comedy, due for release in 2012. According to theHollywood Reporter,external, this was down to the ""disastrous"" $6.9m opening for Zemeckis' $150m Mars Needs Moms movie in 2011 - though it adds the film faced a number of issues including budget problems beforehand.

"This video can not be played Drug abuse: 'It grips you straight away', says recovering addict There has been a sharp increase in the rate of deaths from drug misuse in Wales, according to new figures. There were 210 deaths recorded in 2021, compared with 149 in 2020 - an increase of 41% - Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed. The figure was also the highest since records began in 1993, with the previous record being 208 in 2018. The Welsh government said every death was a tragedy and it would be investigating the increase. The number of deaths per million people was higher in Wales than in England, which saw a far smaller rise in deaths. However, due to backlogs in coroners' courts during the Covid-19 pandemic, some of the reported deaths would have been from the year before. Waterloo Road star reveals heroin addiction battle 'I was a heroin addict - but ended up guarding the palace' Charities working on the front line said the data showed old approaches to drugs are not working, and called for an urgent rethink of Wales' strategies. Wales is currently pioneering new treatments, which recovering drug addicts said have had a positive impact on their condition. One of those was Cullan Mais, who was addicted to heroin at 19, but has been taking a drug called Buvidal, which stopped him feeling the intense symptoms of withdrawal. ""Your confidence comes back, that ambition comes back,"" Cullan said. Cullan, who started smoking cannabis as a teenager before becoming addicted to crack cocaine and heroin, said drugs were a way for him to control his OCD, anxiety and ADHD, all of which went undiagnosed until he went to prison. Cullan Mais went to prison 11 times while funding his drug use He funded his drug addiction through shoplifting, after stealing from family and friends, eventually going to prison 11 times. Now 30, he described his first stint in HMP Birmingham as a ""real eye opener"". ""I thought that was going to be my only time in prison and it did genuinely scare me,"" he said. ""But when drugs like heroin come into play, it's never the only time."" Cullan Mais during a detox from his drug addiction Cullan was caught in a cycle of reoffending and reusing drugs, but everything changed when his friend died from an overdose and he ended up in hospital. It was then he was offered Buvidal. ""It was probably the first time I was really scared of losing my life,"" he said. While Cullan acknowledges Buvidal is not a ""silver bullet"" for everyone, it helped him. He now has a girlfriend, a family, a home, and a podcast on which he has interviewed First Minister Mark Drakeford about drugs policy. 'Stop saying junkie' plea to end addiction stigma Woman describes internet-fuelled drug addiction The Welsh government first approved the use of Buvidal in September 2019. It is a new, injectable form of the drug buprenorphine, and can help users stop using heroin or methadone. Unlike methadone or traditional buprenorphine, Buvidal injections can last for one month. After funding was initially provided for 26 patients in Wales, that number rose to 740 in a year and has now exceeded 1,300, according to Dr Jan Melichar, visiting professor at University of South Wales. Charities in Wales said Buvidal was one of the ways Wales was starting to change its approach to drug addiction. Newport-based Kaleidoscope said instead of punishing people for taking drugs, the focus was on reducing the harm to the drug user. Martin Blakebrough, from the charity, said drugs need to be treated as a ""public health issue"" in Wales, ""reducing the stigma of criminalising everyone who has a drug issue"". ""Workers in Wales are taught to recognise those who have serious problems with drugs often has extreme trauma in their lives,"" he said. Wales will become the first UK nation to have a nationwide peer-to-peer Naloxone programme,a drug which rapidly reverses an opioid overdose. In 2021, the Welsh government and Gwent alcohol and drug service funded an eight-week pilot to train people with lived experience of addiction to give Naloxone to those at risk of overdosing. The pilot was so successful, the training has been extended across Wales. Leighton said being able to help other drug users who had overdosed meant he was ""saving someone's life"" Leighton is one of the volunteers who has been involved with the project since the beginning. Before he volunteered, he was still using drugs. ""I was going round in circles constantly, getting clean, relapsing, getting clean, relapsing,"" he said. Now Leighton has broken that cycle. ""You're saving someone's son, someone's daughter, someone's father - it puts a smile on your face,"" he said. George Charlton said Wales was leading the way, and everywhere else needed to catch up George Charlton is also a former drug user, who is now known as ""the Naloxone man"" because of his work training people to use the drug. ""Typically, we don't see the good in people who use drugs,"" he said. ""This project reframes all of that and what we tell people is that their lived experience absolutely matters - that they've got like a qualification that nobody wants - they've got a street degree right and their street degree is involved in pain and trauma. ""And I would argue that when it comes to the peer led approach, Wales is definitely leading the way, so everyone's got to catch up."" Commenting on the rise in drug related deaths, the Welsh government said the latest increase was of ""deep concern"" and officials would be investigating the reasons behind the increase. ""Until now drug misuse deaths had fallen to the lowest level since 2014,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are working with the NHS, police and charities to tackle substance misuse and investing over Â£63m a year."" Meanwhile, a spokesperson from the UK government said its drug strategy would help rebuild drug treatment and recovery services in England, as well asÂ tacklingÂ the criminal supply chains which fuel illegal drug markets. ""ThisÂ will help toÂ prevent nearlyÂ 1,000 deaths, deliverÂ over 54,500 newÂ treatment places, -Â a 19% increase on current numbersÂ - andÂ supportÂ 24,000 more people into recovery from substance dependency,"" they said.

"Higher fuel prices are driving the cost of living higher The world's biggest oil producers have agreed to raise production slightly in a bid help ease high prices. Members of oil producers' group Opec+ - which includes Russia - agreed on Wednesday to add 100,000 more barrels per day to the market from September. The latest production output increase is at a much slower pace than in recent months. The decision is a blow to leaders who had called for production to be ramped up. They include US President Joe Biden, who travelled to Saudi Arabia in a bid to personally convince the country to pump more oil to help cool soaring prices. Crude has consistently traded at more than $100 a barrel since February, driving up the cost of living in many countries. Opec, which has 13 core members, was formed in 1960 as a cartel, with the aim of fixing the worldwide supply of oil and its price. Saudi Arabia is the biggest single producer in the cartel and after meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, President Biden said he expected supply to increase. Saudi officials stressed any decision to increase supplies would be done in consultation with Opec+. For July and August, Opec+ had agreed to add more than 600,000 barrels a day to the market. But after the latest meeting, Opec+ decided it would raise oil output by just 100,000 barrels per day from September in what some analysts described as an insult. ""That is so little as to be meaningless. From a physical standpoint it is a marginal blip. As a political gesture it is almost insulting,"" said Raad Alkadiri, managing director for energy, climate, and sustainability at Eurasia Group. Opec+ is a wider group of 23 oil-exporting countries including Russia, which meets every month in Vienna to decide how much crude oil to sell on the world market. Opec members Angola, Nigeria and Malaysia are already faltering on existing monthly supply targets Back in April 2020, Opec+ introduced a series of cuts that continued throughout the coronavirus pandemic as demand dropped. Since 2021 it has slowly been restoring this missing supply. At the group's last gathering Opec+ decided to increase the number of barrels it produces a little during the month of August. But just turning the taps on full may not be all that easy. At least on paper, several members of the cartel, like Angola, Nigeria and Malaysia are already struggling to meet their existing monthly supply targets. Simultaneously, Russian supplies have also dropped due to western sanctions. Moscow, meanwhile, has ramped up its shipments tocustomers in Asia like China and India. Could the world survive without Russian oil and gas? Lynchpin, Saudi Arabia, and neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, are the only two major players with some spare capacity. Saudi's production target for August, however, is 11 million barrels of oil per day, which energy experts suggest is already at a very high level, leaving little wiggle room for more increases. Perhaps weighing more heavily on the pair's decision though, may be uncertainty over energy demand in the coming months. Rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and looming recession in many western countries, could all seriously dent demand. Experts think these factors are making the group cautious and unwilling to increase their output dramatically. ""The concern for Saudi Arabia and Opec+ is that there are so many unknowns. No one knows where the oil markets will be six months from now, or next year,"" said Karen Young, senior fellow at Middle East Institute in Washington DC. She added this means the Saudis and United Arab Emirates will want to use their spare supplies judiciously. ""They don't want to be in a situation where they utilise their limited spare capacity to ramp-up production, and then suddenly, if demand shoots up or goes down in the future ...they are left with no room to make adjustments,"" she added. Before the invasion of Ukraine, Russia was the world's third largest producer of oil, behind the US and Saudi Arabia. It accounted for 8-10% of global oil supply. Market analysts have suggested President Vladimir Putin wants to sustain high oil prices in order to keep paying for the Ukraine war and stave off the impact of crippling western economic sanctions. For Saudi Arabia, unity among the Opec+ group is paramount, and it would avoid any decision that could jeopardise that. Polls suggest Joe Biden's approval ratings have fallen as gasoline prices at the pumps soar Opec itself is forecasting thatglobal oil demand will rise in 2023,externalalbeit at a slower pace than this year. Its analysts say this will be driven in part by progress in containing the coronavirus in China. Estimates from the International Energy Agency and the US Energy Information Administration meanwhile suggest oil demand will continue rising strongly, despite growing fears over inflation in multiple countries and weakening economic growth. This means that oil producers may find themselves having to pump oil at the fastest pace in five years to balance out supply and demand - a tall order, given capacity constraints and the lack of investment in downstream and refining. ""There is a lot of volatility in the markets but not many people expect a sustained drop below $100 a barrel,"" said Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Gasoline prices in the United States have already touched a 13-year high this year. The US has been releasing about one million barrels per day from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) since April - as part of its plan to add some 180 million barrels to the market over a six-month period finishing at the end of October. However, Mr Cahill warned once this roll-out stops supplies will become even tighter, putting greater pressure on prices. ""We still haven't seen any signs of major investments towards increasing production. So, if demand goes up, we won't have sufficient supplies to balance the markets"" he added.

"Tenants whose bills are included in their rent could miss out on the government's Â£400 energy rebate because it is paid to their landlord, charities have warned. Housing charity Shelter said this group were ""at the mercy of their landlord passing on this much-needed support"". An estimated 585,000 households,external- 13% of private renters - have energy bills included in their rent. The government said it expected landlords to pass on the discount. The National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) also said that where tenants incurred the cost of increased energy bills, the discount should be passed on to them by their landlord. However, a spokesperson pointed out there would be cases where all-inclusive rents had been set without reflecting the recent surge in energy costs. ""The government needs to ensure that its scheme recognises such cases where it is the landlord who is ultimately paying the cost of increased bills, rather than the tenant,"" the spokesperson added. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? The typical household energy bill could hit Â£3,615 a year in January, up from Â£1,400 a year in October 2021,according to a forecast from consultancy Cornwall Insight. The government has announced a package of measures to help households with the rising cost of living, including a Â£400 discount on energy bills. Last week the government revealed detailsof how people in England, Scotland and Wales would receive the payment. The Treasury is still in discussion with Stormont ministers about how to make the payment to households in Northern Ireland. The money will be paid in six instalments, with a discount of Â£66 applied to energy bills in October and November, and Â£67 a month from December to March 2023. How the money is received will depend on how you pay your bill. However, for tenants whose energy bills are included in their rent, their landlord would receive the discount as they are the bill payer. Helen, 25, rents a room in a four-bed house in Leicester with bills included. She is worried that if she asks her landlord to pass the Â£400 payment on to her he will increase her rent when her contract is up for renewal later this year. ""I'm leaning towards not rocking the boat because I'm dreading that conversation about renewing and what my new rent will be for the next six months,"" she told the BBC. Helen, who did not want to give her surname, is a PhD student and her stipend will increase by just 2% in September - well below the rate prices are rising, with UK inflation hitting 9.4% in June. If her rent increased she said it would be ""a real stretch"" to cover her other living costs. As she shares a house with strangers, Helen said it was also difficult to discuss the situation with her housemates, who she would have to share the payment with. She did not know if they would feel the same as her. When it comes to utility bills,government guidance,externalstates that landlords who have a domestic electricity contract with a licensed supplier and then resell the electricity to their tenant, based on usage, must comply with maximum resale price rules. This means landlords are not allowed to make a profit on energy they are reselling. Landlords with a domestic electricity connection where a fixed cost for energy is included in the rent ""should also be passing on the discounted payments to tenants"", the government said. But charities have raised concerns that landlords will not pass on the saving to their tenants. Are you a renter worried about missing out on the Â£400 energy rebate? Please email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch viaWhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,externalandTwitter:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external ""There's no specific legal obligation for landlords to pass on this support but they aren't allowed to overcharge tenants for the energy they've used or make a profit on it,"" Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said. ""This could be the case if they pocket the government support and continue to charge the same rate for utilities."" ""Landlords can only charge for energy used, the standing charge and VAT. So, it's worth making a note of how much energy you're using to make sure you're not paying more than you should,"" she added. Ms Neate said it was ""unfair that those at the sharp end of this crisis could miss out on this much-needed support"" and urged the government to make sure it went ""to the people who need it the most"". Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said there was no clear guidance on how landlords should pass on the discount ""or any law to make sure they do"". ""We're worried that renters could fall through the cracks and miss out on extra cash,"" she added. Dan Wilson Craw, deputy director of campaign group Generation Rent, said: ""A lot of landlords have already raised the rent to take account of higher energy bills and there's no easy way for tenants to ask them to pass on the Â£400 grant if they don't want to - threatening to move out is one approach but that is difficult when rent on a new property could be much higher."" He suggested tenants could ask their landlord to take into account the Â£400 rebate the next time they tried to increase their rent.

"Tenants whose bills are included in their rent could miss out on the government's Â£400 energy rebate because it is paid to their landlord, charities have warned. Housing charity Shelter said this group were ""at the mercy of their landlord passing on this much-needed support"". An estimated 585,000 households,external- 13% of private renters - have energy bills included in their rent. The government said it expected landlords to pass on the discount. The National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) also said that where tenants incurred the cost of increased energy bills, the discount should be passed on to them by their landlord. However, a spokesperson pointed out there would be cases where all-inclusive rents had been set without reflecting the recent surge in energy costs. ""The government needs to ensure that its scheme recognises such cases where it is the landlord who is ultimately paying the cost of increased bills, rather than the tenant,"" the spokesperson added. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? The typical household energy bill could hit Â£3,615 a year in January, up from Â£1,400 a year in October 2021,according to a forecast from consultancy Cornwall Insight. The government has announced a package of measures to help households with the rising cost of living, including a Â£400 discount on energy bills. Last week the government revealed detailsof how people in England, Scotland and Wales would receive the payment. The Treasury is still in discussion with Stormont ministers about how to make the payment to households in Northern Ireland. The money will be paid in six instalments, with a discount of Â£66 applied to energy bills in October and November, and Â£67 a month from December to March 2023. How the money is received will depend on how you pay your bill. However, for tenants whose energy bills are included in their rent, their landlord would receive the discount as they are the bill payer. Helen, 25, rents a room in a four-bed house in Leicester with bills included. She is worried that if she asks her landlord to pass the Â£400 payment on to her he will increase her rent when her contract is up for renewal later this year. ""I'm leaning towards not rocking the boat because I'm dreading that conversation about renewing and what my new rent will be for the next six months,"" she told the BBC. Helen, who did not want to give her surname, is a PhD student and her stipend will increase by just 2% in September - well below the rate prices are rising, with UK inflation hitting 9.4% in June. If her rent increased she said it would be ""a real stretch"" to cover her other living costs. As she shares a house with strangers, Helen said it was also difficult to discuss the situation with her housemates, who she would have to share the payment with. She did not know if they would feel the same as her. When it comes to utility bills,government guidance,externalstates that landlords who have a domestic electricity contract with a licensed supplier and then resell the electricity to their tenant, based on usage, must comply with maximum resale price rules. This means landlords are not allowed to make a profit on energy they are reselling. Landlords with a domestic electricity connection where a fixed cost for energy is included in the rent ""should also be passing on the discounted payments to tenants"", the government said. But charities have raised concerns that landlords will not pass on the saving to their tenants. Are you a renter worried about missing out on the Â£400 energy rebate?

You can also get in touch viaWhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,externalandTwitter:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external ""There's no specific legal obligation for landlords to pass on this support but they aren't allowed to overcharge tenants for the energy they've used or make a profit on it,"" Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said. ""This could be the case if they pocket the government support and continue to charge the same rate for utilities."" ""Landlords can only charge for energy used, the standing charge and VAT. So, it's worth making a note of how much energy you're using to make sure you're not paying more than you should,"" she added. Ms Neate said it was ""unfair that those at the sharp end of this crisis could miss out on this much-needed support"" and urged the government to make sure it went ""to the people who need it the most"". Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said there was no clear guidance on how landlords should pass on the discount ""or any law to make sure they do"". ""We're worried that renters could fall through the cracks and miss out on extra cash,"" she added. Dan Wilson Craw, deputy director of campaign group Generation Rent, said: ""A lot of landlords have already raised the rent to take account of higher energy bills and there's no easy way for tenants to ask them to pass on the Â£400 grant if they don't want to - threatening to move out is one approach but that is difficult when rent on a new property could be much higher."" He suggested tenants could ask their landlord to take into account the Â£400 rebate the next time they tried to increase their rent. But he added that until Parliament passed the Renters Reform Bill, tenants could still be evicted without reason if they complained.

"It is the first visit to Wales for either candidate since the contest began Tory leadership contenders Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have vowed to hold the Welsh government to account ahead of an event in Cardiff. The pair are facing questions from party members at the only Welsh hustings of the leadership contest. Mr Sunak pledged to hold Labour ministers accountable for the NHS and schools in Wales. Meanwhile Ms Truss accused First Minister Mark Drakeford of letting Wales down. The Labour-run Welsh government declined to comment. Wednesday's event in Cardiff marks the first time either has visited Wales since the contest began. The new Conservative leader will be declared on 5 September, and will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister. Of the contenders Mr Sunak has wider support among MPs and MSs in Wales. Backers include former Welsh Secretary Simon Hart, Brecon and Radnorshire MP Fay Jones, Montgomeryshire MP Craig Williams and Senedd Tory chief whip Darren Millar. Ms Truss, who is foreign secretary, is supported by Clwyd West MP David Jones and Senedd members Janet Finch Saunders and Laura Anne Jones. Security fears delay Tory leadership ballot papers Rishi Sunak backs Wales-only Covid inquiry What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? Mr Sunak told BBC Wales' Walescast podcast the performance of the Welsh NHS was ""far worse"" than was the case with England's health service and said schools in Wales were funded ""far less"" than they were across the border, despite Wales receiving more public funding. The most recent analysis by theInstitute for Fiscal Studies,external, however, concluded spending per pupil was similar in both countries. Last month, the Education Policy Institute said poorer pupils in Wales werefurther behind their peersthan was the case in England, based on their GCSE results, with Welsh ministers saying they would try to close the ""attainment gap"". This video can not be played Rishi Sunak pledged to invest in Wales if he becomes prime minister The former chancellor said: ""I support devolution, of course I do, and I want to work constructively with the Welsh government, but I do think it's also right to hold them accountable. ""I think it's right that we have schools that are properly funded in Wales. ""I think it's right that we hold the Welsh government to account for the state of the NHS in Wales, with waiting times which are worse than anywhere else in the UK."" He said there should be an ""answer to the question of why NHS performances Wales is far worse than it is elsewhere in the UK"". ""I think the Welsh people deserve answers to those questions and I think it's perfectly reasonable for the prime minister of the United Kingdom to have a conversation about that and that's what I would like to do."" Rishi Sunak was greeted on arrival by Michael Howard and a group of Welsh politicians Protesters gathered in Cardiff ahead of the event Mr Sunak also announced he would make sure Wales would have two freeports, following an announcement in May that it would haveat least oneafter an agreement was reached between the UK and Welsh governments. Freeport status allows firms to import goods and then export them outside normal tax and customs rules. ""It's a policy which I created, it's an opportunity we have because of Brexit and it's working across the UK, bringing jobs and investment into areas,"" he said. ""People really want it and I'd be delighted as prime minister to make sure that Wales has not one but two freeports to bring jobs and investment.""Â This video can not be played Liz Truss says she âcancelledâ her public sector pay policy to make sure doctors and teachers ""werenât worriedâ. BBC Wales requests for an interview with Liz Truss have been declined. In a clip shared among broadcasters, she said Mark Drakeford ""has not delivered for the people of Wales and I will be holding him to account"". She said: ""The reality is that Wales has been let down by 20 years of Labour rule. ""What I am about is about making sure we bring opportunity, investment to Wales, that we back Wales' fantastic farmers, and that's what I'm going to be talking about in the hustings tonight."" In a pre-hustings article forWalesOnline,externalshe promised to ""level up Wales in a Conservative way"" The foreign secretary said the UK ""has the potential to be a high-growth and highly productive powerhouse, with Wales at its heart"" and promised ""full-fat freeports"". Ms Truss said she would work with the Labour Welsh government ""and local communities to identify areas which are ripe for transformation as part of a new investment zone"". Welsh Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens welcomed the pair to Cardiff, but said: ""Neither Liz Truss nor Rishi Sunak has had anything to say about Wales during this campaign, but their record of 12 years of Tory neglect tells us all we need to know: a high-tax, low-growth economy and the biggest drop in living standards since records began."" The hustings comes a day after Ms Truss initially announced proposals to link public sector pay to local living costs, before later scrapping them. The plan had faced criticism from some Conservatives, including Simon Hart, who claimed 430,000 workers in Wales faced a ""near Â£3,000 pay cut"".

"Women whose pictures were used without permission in a ""beach body"" ad campaign have criticised the Spanish government's explanation that it didn't know they were ""real people"". The Spain's Women's Institute campaign uses an image of five diverse women of different shapes and sizes. But three women have since said they've not consented to images being used. Sian Green-Lord, whose prosthetic leg was edited out of the image, says she's ""not buying it - not at all"". The advert by Spain's equality ministryaimed to encourage women to go to the beach, regardless of how they look. The Spanish government, which hadn't commented until now, has told Radio 1 Newsbeat: ""We would like to make it clear that at no point was it aware that the women in the images were actual real people.

"Many Taiwanese see their island as separate nation China has launched major military drills around Taiwan for the second time this year, simulating a full-scale attack on the island - just days after the Taiwanese President William Lai delivered his first National Day speech. They come months after drills held, days after Lai was sworn in. The exercises reinforce what is at the heart of the issue: China's claim over self-governed Taiwan. Beijing sees the island as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it. Taiwan's first known settlers were Austronesian tribal people, believed to have come from modern day southern China. Chinese records appear to first mention the island in AD239, when an emperor dispatched an expeditionary force to it - a fact Beijing uses to back its territorial claim. After a relatively brief spell as a Dutch colony, Taiwan was administered by China's Qing dynasty, before it was ceded to Tokyo after Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War. After World War Two, Japan surrendered and relinquished control of territory it had taken from China. Afterwards, Taiwan was officially considered occupied by the Republic of China (ROC), which began ruling with the consent of its allies, the US and UK. But in the next few years a civil war broke out in China, and then-leader Chiang Kai-shek's troops were defeated by Mao Zedong's Communist army. Chiang, the remnants of his Kuomintang (KMT) government and their supporters - about 1.5m people -  fled to Taiwan in 1949. Chiang established a dictatorship that ruled Taiwan until the 1980s. Following his death, Taiwan began a transition to democracy and held its first elections in 1996. There is disagreement about the status of Taiwan. It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces. Chiang's ROC government-in-exile at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China's seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government. Chiang Kai-shek, once the leader in China, fled with his supporters to Taiwan But by the 1970s some countries began to argue that the Taipei government could no longer be considered a genuine representative of the people living in mainland China. In 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing.  Once China began opening up its economy in 1978, the US recognised opportunities for trade and the need to develop relations. It formally established diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1979. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government has fallen drastically with only 12 countries recognising the island today. China exerts considerable diplomatic pressure on other countries not to recognise Taiwan. Relations started improving in the 1980s as Taiwan relaxed rules on visits to and investment in China. In 1991, the ROC proclaimed that the war with the People's Republic of China was over. China proposed the so-called ""one country, two systems"" option, which it said would allow Taiwan significant autonomy if it agreed to come under Beijing's control. This system underpinned Hong Kong's return to China in 1997 and the manner in which it was governed until recently, when Beijing has sought to increase its influence. Taiwan rejected the offer, leading Beijing to insist the Taiwan's ROC government was illegitimate - but unofficial representatives from China and Taiwan still held limited talks. Then in 2000, Taiwan elected Chen Shui-bian as president, much to Beijing's alarm. Chen and his party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), had openly backed Taiwan ""independence"". A year after Chen was re-elected in 2004, China passed a so-called anti-secession law, declaring China's right to use ""non-peaceful means"" against Taiwan if it tried to ""secede"" from China. Chen was later succeeded by the KMT, which favours closer relations with the PRC. In 2016,Tsai Ing-wen,from the DPP, was elected to the presidency. Under her, cross-strait relations have soured. China also cut off official communications with Taiwan after Ms Tsai took over, saying it was because of her refusal to endorse the concept of a single Chinese nation. Tsai has never said she will formally declare Taiwan's independence, insisting that it is already independent. Under Ms Tsai, cross-Straits relations soured again But Tai's term also coincided with that of Xi Jinping, under whom Chinese claims have grown more aggressive. He has reiterated the message that China will ""surely be reunified"" with Taiwan, and has set 2049 as a target date for ""achieving the Chinese dream"". In January 2024, Taiwan elected Tsai's vice-president, William Lai, as president - a man China has branded a ""separatist"". China's drills- dubbed Joint Sword 2024A - came in his first week in office - which Beijing said were a ""strong punishment"" for ""separatist acts"". It also singled out Lai as the ""worst of all"" DPP presidents so far. The second round of drills - titled Joint Sword 2024B - came days after Lai pledged to uphold Taiwan's self-governing status during a national day speech on 10 October. The US maintains official ties with Beijing, and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its ""One China policy"" - but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and US President Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily - breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity. The island has long been one of the most contentious issue in US-China relations, with Beijing condemning any perceived support from Washington for Taipei. In 2022, after a visit to Taiwan by US Speaker Nancy Pelosi, China responded with an unprecedented show of force, carrying out military exercises around Taiwan in retaliation. Under President Xi, China hasramped up this ""grey zone warfare""- sending record numbers of Chinese fighter jets near Taiwan and holding military drills in response to political exchanges between the US and Taiwan. In 2022, China's warplane incursions into Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) nearly doubled. The results of the elections will shape the course of US-China relations - and no matter who walks away the winner, will have an indelible impact on the delicate relationship between the US, China and Taiwan.

"US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi is second in line for the presidency US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has arrived in Taiwan, defying warnings from China and concerns from the White House. But she has a long history of criticising the Chinese government. Most famously in 1991, two years after large-scale protests in Beijing were crushed by the Chinese government, she visited Tiananmen Square and displayed a banner honouring the deceased demonstrators. For its part, the Chinese government has made no secret of its disdain for Ms Pelosi, once labelling her ""full of lies and disinformation"". China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province, and has not ruled out using force to unify it. It deploys significant pressure to dissuade other countries from recognising Taiwan's independence. Before her visit, China warned of serious consequences if Ms Pelosi went to Taiwan. China and Taiwan: A really simple guide She is second in line for the presidency after Vice-President Kamala Harris, and would be the most senior US politician to travel to the island since her predecessor Newt Gingrich in 1997. Her plans to visit the island were kept under wraps - however rumours were circulating about the plan, prompting the Chinese warnings. Her Asian tour also includes visits to Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan. This leg of the trip is not backed by US President Joe Biden, and with US-China tensions continuing to run high, even White House officials reportedly tried to dissuade her. Mr Biden recently told reporters ""the military thinks it's not a good idea"". Two years after protestors were crushed by Communist Party forces in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, the then-California representative visited the capital city. Slipping away from her official escorts along with two other members of Congress, she went to the city square without the permission of her Chinese hosts. There, they unfurled a small, hand-painted banner which read: ""To those who died for democracy in China."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The police closed in quickly, roughing up reporters who were covering the event and chasing the lawmakers out of the square. China's Foreign Ministry later denounced the incident as a ""premeditated farce"". Tiananmen Square: What happened in the protests of 1989? Some criticised Ms Pelosi's actions during that visit. Former CNN Beijing bureau chief Mike Chinoy wrote in an op-ed for Foreign Policy that she was the reason he got arrested at the scene. Mr Chinoy said he was not aware of what Ms Pelosi planned to do at the square, and was detained for several hours as the police were unable to target a visiting foreign dignitary. ""It was my first experience with Pelosi's penchant for high-profile gestures designed to poke China's communist rulers in the eye - regardless of the consequences,"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Pelosi, who also helped lead a resolution condemning China's actions in 1989, has continued to speak out about the ""massacre"" of demonstrators over the years. Most recently, she issued a statement to mark the 33rd anniversary of the protests this year, calling the demonstrations ""one of the greatest acts of political courage"" and slamming the Communist Party's ""oppressive regime"". At a meeting with then-Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao in 2002, Ms Pelosi tried to pass him four letters expressing concern over the detention and imprisonment of activists in China and Tibet, and calling for their release. Mr Hu refused to accept the letters. Seven years later, Ms Pelosi reportedly hand-delivered another letter to him - by then President of China - calling for the release ofpolitical prisoners including prominent dissident Liu Xiaobo. Liu was named the winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize but was not allowed to travel to Norway to accept the award. He died of cancer in 2017 while still in Chinese custody. Ms Pelosi has opposed China's bids to host the Olympic Games as far back as 1993 on the basis of its alleged human rights abuses. She was one of the lawmakers that unsuccessfully urged then-US President George W Bush to boycott China's Summer Olympics opening ceremony in 2008. This year, the Speaker of the House again led calls for a""diplomatic boycott""of Beijing's 2022 Winter Olympics over the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China. ""For heads of state to go to China in light of a genocide that is ongoing - while you're sitting there in your seat - really begs the question, what moral authority do you have to speak again about human rights any place in the world?"" she said. In response, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington said US politicians were in no position to make ""wanton groundless criticism"" against China. Over the years, Ms Pelosi has also pushed for China's trade status to be linked to its human rights record, and to attach conditions to China's entry to the World Trade Organization. The policy has been controversial: Mr Bush vetoed legislation related to this several times, while former President Bill Clinton initially supported but later abandoned it, saying broader American strategic interests justified the reversal.

"Paying for tickets by bank transfer offers fans very little fraud protection Football fans have been urged to be wary of ticket scams. Fraudsters are using social media to offer fake tickets and trick unsuspecting victims out of their cash - the average loss is Â£410, according to Lloyds Bank. The fans pay by bank transfer, which offers no protection to consumers. If you can't pay by credit or debit card, ""that's a big red flag that you're about to get scammed,"" the bank warned. Cases of the scams climbed by more than two-thirds between January and June, according to Lloyds Bank data. This surge was because fraudsters took advantage of people desperate to attend live events after Covid restrictions ended. But the bank warned that the start of the Premier League season this weekend could see another surge in the scams. Screen sharing scams on the rise, warns watchdog It said criminals target the biggest games which are already sold out - such as matches between the top six clubs in England, European games and internationals matches. With major events such as cup finals, Lloyds Bank said it had seen victims losing as much as Â£2,000. Scammers will invent a story to explain why they cannot use their match ticket to make themselves seem more plausible The scammers use social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook, to offer fake tickets to sought-after matches. Top-flight football in particular is popular among criminals, as they take advantage of fans' desperation to watch their team, knowing that many matches will already be sold out, They often use bogus pictures of tickets to fool fans, or publish a made-up story about why they cannot attend the game to sound more legitimate. Once they've snared a victim they demand payment by bank transfer, also known as 'faster payment'. These payments offer no consumer protection and are effectively the electronic equivalent of just handing over your cash to someone in the street. Once the cash is sent, the scammers simply disappear, leaving behind an anonymous, untraceable online identity and an angry fan left out of pocket. ""The vast majority of these scams start on social media, where it's all too easy for fraudsters to use fake profiles and advertise items that simply don't exist,"" said Liz Ziegler, Lloyds Bank's retail fraud and financial crime director. ""Buying directly from the clubs or their official ticket partners is the only way to guarantee you're paying for a real ticket.""

"Local authorities are facing the prospect of strikes unless there is an improved pay offer for workers. The Scottish government says it is working with council body Cosla to explore options for solutions. Recent months have seen several other disputes over pay and conditions. So, is Scotland facing a summer of discontent? Train drivers and signallers, BT telecom and Royal Mail employees, airport workers and cabin crew, supermarket workers, bus drivers and university lecturers, even lawyers in criminal courts - the striker has become a symbol of 2022. Many more could be set to follow in their path, including a wide range oflocal government workers. One of their main unions, Unison, is planning to disrupt schools, early years centres, nurseries and waste and recycling centres across Scotland. Scottish teacherslodged a 10% pay claim, before realising that price inflation could rise even higher. There is union talk of a strike ballot when the summer holiday is over. Firefighters say a 2% pay offer is ""insulting"" and are also talking up strike action, while Scottish nurses close their strike ballot this Thursday. Scottishpolice officerswill have more to say the following day about stepping up their ""withdrawal of goodwill"", while they lack the legal right to strike. Another symbol of this year was thevideo call sacking of P&O ferry crews, with their replacements hired on much weaker contracts. It was a powerful image of the way some employers treat staff, and reinforced public support for trade unions at the very moment that price inflation was about to take off, leaving most pay increases struggling far behind. Price inflation is racing ahead of pay rises The simple answer is pay. Price inflation is racing ahead of pay rises at a rate that few foresaw even in early spring, when many pay deals should have been settled. Workers want to hold on to the spending power of their pay. Government-funded employers have limited flexibility to meet expectations that pay will catch up with inflation. Private sector employers are being hit by rising costs - notably for energy, but they also suffer from disrupted supply chains and shortages of skilled staff. That should give workers a lot of leverage to demand higher wages, and that's what they've been getting in some privately-run sectors, such as haulage. In construction and finance, it's been a bumper year for bonuses. With that backdrop of a tight labour market, trade unions could expect to be in a strong position. They represent slightly more than half of public sector workers. Years of squeezed budgets have seen their earnings eroded, relative to prices and to the private sector. Trade unions represent only around one in six private sector workers, but they are not evenly spread. They are strongest in former nationalised industries and companies, including transport and utilities, but much weaker in sectors with less formal employment structures - often where young people are on lower pay, such as hospitality. So where they have leverage over employers, trade unions are making it clear that they are willing to deploy it over pay, if necessary through strike action. There were strikes across the UK in 1978 and 1979 The term suggests a parallel with the Winter of Discontent in 1978/79. There were thousands of strikes, and around 30 million working days were lost to industrial action. It is etched into folk memory, not least in the minds of newspaper editors. Inflation was running high, although lower than it runs today. Unions represented twice the proportion of workers that they do now. They were frustrated at the pay restraint required of them by the Labour government led by Jim Callaghan. Higher wages had been leading to an upward cycle of higher prices. One consequence of that chaotic winter was Labour's heavy defeat to Margaret Thatcher in 1979. She was elected with a mandate to tear into both price inflation and the trade unions' ability to strike. As that was nearly 44 years ago, you have to be a Baby Boomer to remember it. Other generations have come along who don't share - according to recent opinion polling - as negative a view of trade unions. Those generations may be less likely to know that ""winter of our discontent"" is Shakespearean - the opening line from Richard III. It was, incidentally, to welcome the end of that winter. But it looks as likely that this year will see a more active autumn of discontent, or a deepening of it in winter, as inflation peaks. Some energy analysts are looking to the winter after next, forecasting continuing difficulties. This may come to seem, by comparison, what Shakespeare's Richard called ""glorious summer""â¦ before things turned nasty. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are vying to become the next Conservative leader and prime minister There is politics attached, for sure. As the rail industry moves out of the private sector, rail unions are using leverage with governments at Westminster and Holyrood. It's easier to focus a campaign on a cabinet minister than a faceless chief executive, whose accountability was to shareholders overseas. Also, summoning up the demons of 1978 is a way of mobilising Conservative Party members as they vote for their new leader and prime minister. Facing a series of one-day rail strikes, there has already been a rapidly-enacted change in the law to make it easier to introduce agency workers where union members are striking. We have had warnings about the impact of price and wage increases spiralling, again seeing reference to that problem in the 1970s. The signs from the Tory leadership candidates are of further measures to constrain trade union power - once more evoking the spirit of Margaret Thatcher. For Conservatives, such strikes also provide an opportunity to put political heat under the Labour Party. Strike action means union affiliates of Labour expecting political support, while moderates at Westminster prioritise their mission to look as credible as possible for swing voters at the next election. The recent 5% pay rises recommended by independent pay review bodies affect much of the public sector in England. In Scotland, these cover little more than doctors, dentists, civil servants, judges and the military. However, the review body recommendations influence negotiations in Scotland, at least as a benchmark below which neither Scottish unions nor the Scottish government want to fall. With budgets already tightly stretched to meet commitments for public services and welfare payments, while without further borrowing powers and no appetite for further income tax increases, Scottish ministers see themselves as constrained by spending decisions made at Westminster. So without the funds to match price inflation for Scottish teachers, health service workers, police, firefighters, local government workers and so on, the Scottish government isturning to Westminster- either for help or to blame, depending how you perceive it. Local government unions say that the offer given to English counterparts is far ahead of anything offered so far in Scotland, at least for the lowest-paid workers. Employers have wish lists of changes they would like to see, to improve efficiency and reduce labour costs. Staff do too, more often to improve conditions such as holiday entitlement or pension provision - or unions want to defend existing agreements at risk of erosion. In the case of rail workers, there is a battle being fought over job losses. Employers want to reduce payroll costs and headcount in areas such as train guards or staffed ticket offices. The RMT transport union has a better track record than others at getting its way in such disputes. Partly, that is because it is focussed on a few sectors, while large amalgamated unions such as Unite, GMB or Unison have less focus and depend more on decentralised negotiating, sometimes through inexperienced, under-resourced local officials. An important element of strike action or other disruption to public services is securing public support. The risk unions take is of alienating the public with the inconvenience of cancelled trains, or bins going uncollected. YouGov has published opinion survey data suggesting there is support for the right to strike. Trade unions were seen as playing a positive role in Britain by 32% of those questioned, and a negative role by 26%. Ipsos Mori also has findings on attitudes to unions, which point to sympathies running ahead of strike support. Across the UK, for instance, it finds 71% would sympathise with a nurse's pay campaign, while 60% would support a strike.  For school teachers, 51% would sympathise, and 42% would support a strike. The least sympathy is for barristers, civil servants and academics. There was a weekly round of applause for NHS staff during lockdown in 2020 Unions were widely seen as playing a positive role at the start of the pandemic, cooperating with bosses to apply infection control measures and to support workers who were required to stay at home. Coming out of the pandemic, the changing shape of commuting is one example where unions face a new challenge. With only around three-quarters of the ticket revenue train operators used to have, much of that because of many people continue to work from home, rail services have to be adapted to the routes and journey times people now want. The pandemic also brought support for health and social care workers, including weekly doorstep applause and fund-raising. Train drivers and council workers are also reminding us that they continued to provide vital public services. Such workers hope to turn that into public support for pay campaigns. They have to do so without alienating that support by harming public services.

"Tenants whose bills are included in their rent could miss out on the government's Â£400 energy rebate because it is paid to their landlord, charities have warned. Housing charity Shelter said this group were ""at the mercy of their landlord passing on this much-needed support"". An estimated 585,000 households,external- 13% of private renters - have energy bills included in their rent. The government said it expected landlords to pass on the discount. The National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) also said that where tenants incurred the cost of increased energy bills, the discount should be passed on to them by their landlord. However, a spokesperson pointed out there would be cases where all-inclusive rents had been set without reflecting the recent surge in energy costs. ""The government needs to ensure that its scheme recognises such cases where it is the landlord who is ultimately paying the cost of increased bills, rather than the tenant,"" the spokesperson added. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? The typical household energy bill could hit Â£3,615 a year in January, up from Â£1,400 a year in October 2021,according to a forecast from consultancy Cornwall Insight. The government has announced a package of measures to help households with the rising cost of living, including a Â£400 discount on energy bills. Last week the government revealed detailsof how people in England, Scotland and Wales would receive the payment. The Treasury is still in discussion with Stormont ministers about how to make the payment to households in Northern Ireland. The money will be paid in six instalments, with a discount of Â£66 applied to energy bills in October and November, and Â£67 a month from December to March 2023. How the money is received will depend on how you pay your bill. However, for tenants whose energy bills are included in their rent, their landlord would receive the discount as they are the bill payer. Helen, 25, rents a room in a four-bed house in Leicester with bills included. She is worried that if she asks her landlord to pass the Â£400 payment on to her he will increase her rent when her contract is up for renewal later this year. ""I'm leaning towards not rocking the boat because I'm dreading that conversation about renewing and what my new rent will be for the next six months,"" she told the BBC. Helen, who did not want to give her surname, is a PhD student and her stipend will increase by just 2% in September - well below the rate prices are rising, with UK inflation hitting 9.4% in June. If her rent increased she said it would be ""a real stretch"" to cover her other living costs. As she shares a house with strangers, Helen said it was also difficult to discuss the situation with her housemates, who she would have to share the payment with. She did not know if they would feel the same as her. When it comes to utility bills,government guidance,externalstates that landlords who have a domestic electricity contract with a licensed supplier and then resell the electricity to their tenant, based on usage, must comply with maximum resale price rules. This means landlords are not allowed to make a profit on energy they are reselling. Landlords with a domestic electricity connection where a fixed cost for energy is included in the rent ""should also be passing on the discounted payments to tenants"", the government said. But charities have raised concerns that landlords will not pass on the saving to their tenants. Are you a renter worried about missing out on the Â£400 energy rebate? Please email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch viaWhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,externalandTwitter:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external ""There's no specific legal obligation for landlords to pass on this support but they aren't allowed to overcharge tenants for the energy they've used or make a profit on it,"" Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said. ""This could be the case if they pocket the government support and continue to charge the same rate for utilities."" ""Landlords can only charge for energy used, the standing charge and VAT. So, it's worth making a note of how much energy you're using to make sure you're not paying more than you should,"" she added. Ms Neate said it was ""unfair that those at the sharp end of this crisis could miss out on this much-needed support"" and urged the government to make sure it went ""to the people who need it the most"". Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said there was no clear guidance on how landlords should pass on the discount ""or any law to make sure they do"". ""We're worried that renters could fall through the cracks and miss out on extra cash,"" she added. Dan Wilson Craw, deputy director of campaign group Generation Rent, said: ""A lot of landlords have already raised the rent to take account of higher energy bills and there's no easy way for tenants to ask them to pass on the Â£400 grant if they don't want to - threatening to move out is one approach but that is difficult when rent on a new property could be much higher."" He suggested tenants could ask their landlord to take into account the Â£400 rebate the next time they tried to increase their rent. But he added that until Parliament passed the Renters Reform Bill, tenants could still be evicted without reason if they complained. Landlord Annette Munro hasn't increased the rent on her flat, despite soaring energy costs However, some landlords who have not increased their tenants' rent said they did not think they should have to pass on the Â£400 discount. Annette Munro, 59, rents out a flat in London with bills included and believes landlords should only have to pass on the rebate if they have hiked rents due to rising energy costs. She said the monthly energy bill for her property had increased from Â£90 to Â£267 but she has not put up the rent for several years because her tenants are ""already struggling"". ""If landlords haven't put [the rent] up and have absorbed that cost because they like their tenants and they want to keep them, then I think that they should be able to take the Â£400,"" she told the BBC.

"The refugees minister has appealed to councils to help house 10,500 Afghans currently living in UK hotels at a cost to the taxpayer of Â£1m a day. Lord Harrington told councils the government had fewer than 100 properties available in June, but expects 500 Afghan arrivals each month. Several Afghans said living in hotels had left them unable to settle. ""I know this is costing the British people but for what?"" one refugee told BBC Two's Newsnight. Mohammad, who is in his 40s, said: ""I want to settle and integrate but how can I when we are living in a hotel for months and months? I can't start my life properly."" He worked alongside the British Army in Afghanistan and came to the UK with his wife and two young children after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in August last year. He says his wife of 20 years is struggling after sharing one hotel room between the four of them since September. ""I don't blame her [for struggling] because I know the situation. She is in that room for one year with two kids. These are kids, and she is depressed, so things are not good"", he said. Afghan families are being placed in temporary hotels until social housing can be found, according to the Local Government Association. Once housing is found, the government gives the relevant council more than Â£20,000 per person over three years to help them resettle and integrate in the local community. It is up to councils to find accommodation, but many already face a dwindling housing stock. The Home Office said homes have already been found for more than 7,000 Afghan evacuees. But in his letter, seen by the BBC and dated 27 June, Lord Harrington said they needed another 2,000 properties to house the remaining 10,500 people. A month later the government put the number of Afghans needing accommodation at 9,500. How one Afghan TV presenter became a refugee Refugee help varies 'based on country of origin' 'The UK is my new home, I finally feel safe' Newsnight has been told that the Home Office is negotiating with some local authorities to extend the Afghan hotel scheme into next year, which would mean some residents living there for longer. It is a difficult prospect for Afghans like Munza. She has been in a hotel in the north of England with her parents and younger brother for six months. They are unable to cook in the hotel - and she says they all feel ""so down"". ""Our hotels also are in a very isolated place and far away from the town or any shops with basic necessity items. And with very limited bus services in this area, it makes it even more difficult and frustrating for people based here for now."" Lord Harrington wrote that more than 500 four-bedroom houses were needed to accommodate larger families. He said the government was reaching out to landlords, property developers, and the wider private rented sector, including property listing website Rightmove, to encourage further offers of properties. It is also working with education establishments on converting properties to be used as long-term accommodation, he wrote. The Home Office said it faced a ""challenge"" of insufficient local housing accommodation in the UK - ""not just for Afghans and those in need of protection but also British citizens who are also on a waiting list for homes"". ""While hotels do not provide a long-term solution, they do offer safe, secure and clean accommodation,"" the Home Office added in its statement.

"Assembly members are meeting following a recall petition, spearheaded by the SDLP A third attempt to elect a new Speaker at Stormont and allow the Northern Ireland Assembly to function fully again has failed. Assembly members met following a recall petition, spearheaded by the SDLP, which wanted a debate on the cost of living crisis. The DUP refuses to nominate a Speaker over issues withthe Northern Ireland Protocol. The DUP leader said recalling the assembly would not solve the problem. But the SDLP said ""basic governance"" must return. This video can not be played Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill says the DUP is ""punishing the public"" by its ""refusal to govern"" The Protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. But it means checks on some items which come into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK, creating a trade border in the Irish Sea. Unionist parties are opposed to it, saying it undermines Northern Ireland's position in the UK. ControversialUK government legislationaimed at giving the government powers to override parts of the Protocol is making its way through Westminster. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie nominated party colleague Mike Nesbitt and the SDLP's Matthew O'Toole nominated his colleague Patsy McGlone as Speaker. This video can not be played The DUP's Brian Kingston says the recall of the Stormont assembly ""was stunt politics"" However, both bids failed. Northern Ireland Secretary Shailesh Vara said he was disappointed that the assembly had failed to elect a speaker. Hetweeted,external: ""People expect and deserve the Executive to be formed as soon as possible to address issues affecting everyone in Northern Ireland, including the rising cost of living."" Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said the DUP's ""continued boycott of these institutions and their failure to accept the democratic outcome of the election"" were denying people ""the representation which they are entitled to and which they deserve"". ""It's totally unacceptable, it is untenable and it cannot continue,"" she added. Most politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want the protocol to remain She said the DUP were the ""only party that are blocking and preventing the executive being formed, preventing the executive meeting that would allow us to distribute money to help workers and families"". ""So let me say to you, even at this late hour today, workers need help, families need help, businesses need help and you're continuing to punish the public that we're elected to serve by your continued refusal to govern with the rest of us."" Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) assembly member Brian Kingston dismissed the assembly recall as ""stunt politics"". ""These proceedings are not a genuine attempt by the parties opposite to restore the political institutions, rather they demonstrate a wilful disregard for the views of unionists and the principle of power sharing itself in Northern Ireland,"" he said. Mr Kingston said the Northern Ireland Protocol had caused a ""deep fracture in our politics"". He said the party would be ""condition-led and not calendar-led"". At the same time, he made it clear that when its conditions were met, the DUP would be prepared to nominate a deputy first minister. The Stormont institutions have been in flux since February when the DUPwithdrew from the first minister role in protest over the part of the 2019 Brexit deal known as the protocol. Amid all of the words spoken during the 90-minute debate, one adjective stood out: ""undiminished"". The DUP's Brian Kingston said that if his party was to return to the power-sharing executive at Stormont, the Westminster bill to override the Protocol must emerge from Parliament ""undiminished"", in other words, without any amendments. It is clearly a DUP pre-condition. The other appears to be a commitment from the next prime minister that once he or she gets the power to override the Protocol, it will be used immediately. Diminished means reduced, lessened, made weaker. That is certainly the current state of the assembly, as all eyes now focus on Westminster and Downing Street. Since then, there has been an assembly election and two recall petitions. Sinn FÃ©in became the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly for the first time following May's election, with 27 seats, pushing the DUP into second place. The election cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the Protocol, including Sinn FÃ©in. However, overall unionists still hold the most seats in the assembly. During Wednesday's debate, the SDLP's Matthew O'Toole pointed to the cost of living. ""How long do they [people] have to wait, struggling to put food on the table, struggling to afford the cost of school uniforms and apprehensive about this winter? ""They said the Protocol Bill's passage would lead to a graduated response, it's passed the Commons, what now?"" Unionist parties in Northern Ireland are all opposed to the Northern Ireland Protocol Alliance assembly member Patrick Brown called for reform to ""put an end to ransom politics"". He said it was no longer tenable for one party to be able to block the formation of an assembly and executive. ""Until this place can operate in a mature and democratic fashion, our ability to deal with situations like the cost-of-living crisis will continue to be curtailed,"" he said. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said many assembly members did not want to face ""reality"" that the Protocol was incompatible with Northern Ireland's constitutional position as an ""integral part of the United Kingdom"". ""The very same people who yesterday and in recent days were effusive in respect of Lord David Trimble, consciously and deliberately ignore the very telling of Lord Trimble about the Protocol when he said that the Protocol has ripped the heart out of the Belfast Agreement,"" he said. Stormont uses a system of government known as power sharing People Before Profit's Gerry Carroll said the DUP had shown themselves to be ""completely and utterly self-serving in their approach to politics"". ""They are wilfully ignoring the plight of the vast majority of people here who are struggling to keep their heads above water due to spiralling costs and political inaction,"" he said. Earlier, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he could not provide a timetable on when the Stormont Executive would be restored. ""The sooner we can get to a solution on the Protocol, the sooner we will see the cross-community consensus restored that is necessary to operate the political institutions in Northern Ireland,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster. Sir Jeffrey said he recognised getting a ""fully-functioning executive and assembly was important for everyone in Northern Ireland"" but he wanted to ensure the foundations for that were ""sound"". The comments come as the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said the Northern Ireland Protocolhad given the region's economy a temporary boost. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Northern Ireland Protocol Bill passes Commons An assembly Speaker can only be elected with support from a majority of unionist and nationalist members. Without a Speaker in place, there can be no nomination of first and deputy first ministers, meaning the assembly cannot function. The DUP has previously said it wants to see ""clear progress"" on thegovernment's controversial protocol billin Parliament first, before it would consider supporting the election of a Speaker. The bill passed the House of Commons in July but now must be debated in the House of Lords.

"Renate Nyborg during the Collision 2022 tech conference in Toronto, Canada Tinder chief executive Renate Nyborg is leaving the firm less than a year after becoming the boss of the dating app. Her exit was one of a number of management changes at Tinder announced by parent company Match Group. Tinder's plans to adopt new technology, including virtual currencies and metaverse-based dating, are also being reviewed in the strategic shake-up. The announcements came as Match reported second-quarter results that missed Wall Street expectations. ""Today we're announcing the departure of Tinder CEO Renate Nyborg, and I have made some changes to the management team and structure that I am confident will help deliver Tinder's full potential,"" Match Group chief executive Bernard Kim said ina letter to shareholders,external. Mr Kim will take up the role vacated by Ms Nyborg while the company looks for a permanent chief executive for Tinder.

""After seeing mixed results from testing Tinder Coins, we've decided to take a step back and re-examine that initiative... we also intend to do more thinking about virtual goods,"" Mr Kim added. It came as Match - which also owns the dating apps OkCupid, Hinge and Plenty of Fish - said it expects sales in the three months to the end of September to be between $790m to $800m. That was well below Wall Street expectations and would mean the company would see no sales growth for the period. Mr Kim pointed to the impact of the pandemic on people's willingness to start using dating apps and currency fluctuations for the disappointing figures. ""While people have generally moved past lockdowns and entered a more normal way of life, their willingness to try online dating products for the first time hasn't yet returned to pre-pandemic levels,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Drug abuse: 'It grips you straight away', says recovering addict There has been a sharp increase in the rate of deaths from drug misuse in Wales, according to new figures. There were 210 deaths recorded in 2021, compared with 149 in 2020 - an increase of 41% - Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed. The figure was also the highest since records began in 1993, with the previous record being 208 in 2018. The Welsh government said every death was a tragedy and it would be investigating the increase. The number of deaths per million people was higher in Wales than in England, which saw a far smaller rise in deaths. However, due to backlogs in coroners' courts during the Covid-19 pandemic, some of the reported deaths would have been from the year before. Waterloo Road star reveals heroin addiction battle 'I was a heroin addict - but ended up guarding the palace' Charities working on the front line said the data showed old approaches to drugs are not working, and called for an urgent rethink of Wales' strategies. Wales is currently pioneering new treatments, which recovering drug addicts said have had a positive impact on their condition. One of those was Cullan Mais, who was addicted to heroin at 19, but has been taking a drug called Buvidal, which stopped him feeling the intense symptoms of withdrawal. ""Your confidence comes back, that ambition comes back,"" Cullan said. Cullan, who started smoking cannabis as a teenager before becoming addicted to crack cocaine and heroin, said drugs were a way for him to control his OCD, anxiety and ADHD, all of which went undiagnosed until he went to prison. Cullan Mais went to prison 11 times while funding his drug use He funded his drug addiction through shoplifting, after stealing from family and friends, eventually going to prison 11 times. Now 30, he described his first stint in HMP Birmingham as a ""real eye opener"". ""I thought that was going to be my only time in prison and it did genuinely scare me,"" he said. ""But when drugs like heroin come into play, it's never the only time."" Cullan Mais during a detox from his drug addiction Cullan was caught in a cycle of reoffending and reusing drugs, but everything changed when his friend died from an overdose and he ended up in hospital. It was then he was offered Buvidal. ""It was probably the first time I was really scared of losing my life,"" he said. While Cullan acknowledges Buvidal is not a ""silver bullet"" for everyone, it helped him. He now has a girlfriend, a family, a home, and a podcast on which he has interviewed First Minister Mark Drakeford about drugs policy. 'Stop saying junkie' plea to end addiction stigma Woman describes internet-fuelled drug addiction The Welsh government first approved the use of Buvidal in September 2019. It is a new, injectable form of the drug buprenorphine, and can help users stop using heroin or methadone. Unlike methadone or traditional buprenorphine, Buvidal injections can last for one month. After funding was initially provided for 26 patients in Wales, that number rose to 740 in a year and has now exceeded 1,300, according to Dr Jan Melichar, visiting professor at University of South Wales. Charities in Wales said Buvidal was one of the ways Wales was starting to change its approach to drug addiction. Newport-based Kaleidoscope said instead of punishing people for taking drugs, the focus was on reducing the harm to the drug user. Martin Blakebrough, from the charity, said drugs need to be treated as a ""public health issue"" in Wales, ""reducing the stigma of criminalising everyone who has a drug issue"". ""Workers in Wales are taught to recognise those who have serious problems with drugs often has extreme trauma in their lives,"" he said. Wales will become the first UK nation to have a nationwide peer-to-peer Naloxone programme,a drug which rapidly reverses an opioid overdose. In 2021, the Welsh government and Gwent alcohol and drug service funded an eight-week pilot to train people with lived experience of addiction to give Naloxone to those at risk of overdosing. The pilot was so successful, the training has been extended across Wales. Leighton said being able to help other drug users who had overdosed meant he was ""saving someone's life"" Leighton is one of the volunteers who has been involved with the project since the beginning. Before he volunteered, he was still using drugs. ""I was going round in circles constantly, getting clean, relapsing, getting clean, relapsing,"" he said. Now Leighton has broken that cycle. ""You're saving someone's son, someone's daughter, someone's father - it puts a smile on your face,"" he said. George Charlton said Wales was leading the way, and everywhere else needed to catch up George Charlton is also a former drug user, who is now known as ""the Naloxone man"" because of his work training people to use the drug. ""Typically, we don't see the good in people who use drugs,"" he said. ""This project reframes all of that and what we tell people is that their lived experience absolutely matters - that they've got like a qualification that nobody wants - they've got a street degree right and their street degree is involved in pain and trauma. ""And I would argue that when it comes to the peer led approach, Wales is definitely leading the way, so everyone's got to catch up."" Commenting on the rise in drug related deaths, the Welsh government said the latest increase was of ""deep concern"" and officials would be investigating the reasons behind the increase. ""Until now drug misuse deaths had fallen to the lowest level since 2014,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are working with the NHS, police and charities to tackle substance misuse and investing over Â£63m a year."" Meanwhile, a spokesperson from the UK government said its drug strategy would help rebuild drug treatment and recovery services in England, as well asÂ tacklingÂ the criminal supply chains which fuel illegal drug markets. ""ThisÂ will help toÂ prevent nearlyÂ 1,000 deaths, deliverÂ over 54,500 newÂ treatment places, -Â a 19% increase on current numbersÂ - andÂ supportÂ 24,000 more people into recovery from substance dependency,"" they said.
