"The first thing many people noticed about Dave Prowse was his size. His imposing frame would take the bodybuilder and actor,who has died at 85 after a short illness, to Hollywood - and a galaxy far, far away. As a young man, it took him to the doors at The Glen, the Bristol dance hall where he worked. ""There was never any trouble at The Glen,"" remembers David Warren, who told the BBC he used to visit the venue on Mondays and Fridays. ""I was standing on the edge of the dance floor - it must have been in 1961 - and was conscious of someone standing next to me. I looked down and saw a pair of feet. I have big feet - size 11 - but these were enormous, huge. ""I turned and looked up and up and up. He was a giant."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Yet for many of those who got to know Dave Prowse, it was his generosity and kindness they remembered. ""We lived a few doors away from Dave and his family when I was growing up,"" Sandra Weakner told the BBC. ""Every Sunday morning all the children in the road would have keep fit with Dave and his children in his front room. ""I remember one occasion his daughter and I were told by Dave we were doing better than the boys. It made our day, especially as my brother was also doing it."" Sandra, whose maiden name is Barrett, remembers Prowse travelling to the United States to play his most famous role. ""I remember him going off to America when he was being Darth Vader. We were out in the street waving him off. ""They were such a lovely family."" Marina Grant featured in a 1984 fitness magazine while she was training with Prowse Marina Grant was 14 when she first met Prowse. She lives with a disability and uses callipers to support her legs. ""My father heard Dave on the radio talking about how he used to wear a calliper as a child for his club foot,"" she told the BBC. ""My dad got in touch with Dave and he kindly offered to give me personal training sessions at his gym for free."" They stayed in touch for a time. ""Dave and his wife Norma even came to my wedding in 1989,"" she said. ""He was a lovely man."" Ian Edmed (third from right) trained at a London gym run by Dave Prowse (centre), pictured with bodybuilder Frank Zane Ian Edmed also trained at Prowse's gym, in the 1970s and 1980s. ""My first recollection of him was he was absolutely enormous,"" he told the BBC. ""He set me off on a lifetime in weights. And he was just one of those people who was larger than life. He was an inspiration to everyone who trained at his gym. ""He was an innovator. There weren't many gyms in London at the time and it drew people from quite a way."" Prowse's was not the only famous face Ian recalls recognising there. ""The number of people I met there - Andy Ripley, the England rugby player; [bodybuilder] Frank Zane, Mr Olympia; Peter Davison, who went on to play Doctor Who, and his wife Sandra Dickinson. ""I missed Arnold Schwarzenegger - he turned up one evening. ""Dave was the type of person who people flock to."" Ian moved away, but returned to they gym when his son, Scott, was born. ""Dave signed a photo for him. We've dug out the picture to send to my son today,"" he said. ""For people of my generation, he'll always be remembered as Darth Vader. ""When the mask was finally taken off and it was a different actor underneath he wasn't very happy, I can tell you."" But if there was any resentment - his voice was also dubbed - it didn't stop him from engaging with the legions of Star Wars fans. Derek Reeves is the chairman of the Croydon Symphonic Band, an award-winning amateur community wind band. A few years ago the band was due to perform music from Star Wars at Fairfield Halls. ""We had a phone call out of the blue,"" he told the BBC. ""It was Dave Prowse. Derek Reeves said Dave Prowse was a gentleman happy to have photos taken with audience and band members ""He lived nearby and asked if he could come to the concert. He was a gentleman who was happy to stay behind and sign autographs after the concert and have photographs taken with the audience and band members."" Prowse was a regular fixture at conventions, too. Attendees or exhibitors paying tribute on social media have emphasised his graciousness and generosity. Allow Twitter content?

Mike Sparkes, 51, from Colchester, was at a wrestling reunion in 2010 when he unexpectedly bumped into Prowse. ""Back in the 1970s he trained a lot of the British wrestlers at the time,"" Mike explained. ""He was an absolute gentleman. I grew up knowing him as the Green Cross Code man and he chatted to my then 10-year-old daughters about crossing the road and road safety."" Dave Prowse told Mike Sparke's daughters, Amy and Bracken, then 10, about road safety ""He told them that he had helped your mum and dad learn road safety - meaning myself and my wife Helen - which he did as we grew up with the public information films,"" Mike said. ""It was the only time I met him personally. But it is a really sad day today.""

"Esther Dingley sent this photo last Sunday of her at the top of a mountain Search teams and a helicopter have been out in the Pyrenees looking for a missing British woman who has spent six years on a campervan tour of Europe. Esther Dingley, 37, last messaged her partner Dan Colegate via Whatsapp a week ago, when she was on top of Pic de Sauvegarde on the France-Spain border. She had been due to return from her solo walking trek on Wednesday but has not been seen. French authorities said six search teams had been out looking on Sunday. A helicopter was deployed on the Spanish side of the border and another one is expected to go up on Monday on the French side. The mountain gendarmerie unit in Bagneres-de-Luchon said teams had been out on Sunday in the area between Port de la GlÃ¨re and Port de VÃ©nasque. According to the gendarmerie, witnesses told the Civil Guard in Spain they saw Ms Dingley on Pic de Sauvegarde, which is 2,730m above sea level, last Sunday. Experienced walker Esther has completed solo treks before A spokesperson said: ""The problem is that we are in lockdown here so there aren't that many hikers on the paths. ""Nobody has come forward with any information about her."" On Monday mountain rescue teams are expected to search the more inaccessible areas while the weather remains good. Ms Dingley had been travelling in the couple's camper van while Mr Colegate stayed at a farm in the Gascony area of France. The weekend she set out on the trek,the couple's story about their adventures around Europe in the camper van since 2014 was published by BBC News. Ms Dingley had started walking from Benasque in Spain on Saturday and had planned to spend Sunday night at Refuge de Venasque in France, Mr Colegate said. Mr Colegate, who has gone to the Luchon area to help look for his partner of 18 years, said she had been away for a month and their last conversation had been about ""how excited we were to see each other as this was her last trip before driving back"". The couple had lived in Durham before deciding to pack up their lives and go travelling after Mr Colegate nearly died from an infection.

"The relationship between Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, is covered in series four The culture secretary has said the creators behind TV series The Crown, based on the lives of the Royal Family, need to make clear the show is fiction. ""I fear a generation of viewers who did not live through these events may mistake fiction for fact,"" Oliver Dowdentold the Mail on Sunday,external. He said Netflix's ""beautifully produced work of fiction... should be very clear at the beginning it is just that"". Creator Peter Morgan has called the show ""an act of creative imagination"". Mr Dowden told the paper he intended to write to Netflix this week to express his concerns. The streaming giant declined to comment. The fourth series of the drama, which stars Olivia Colman as the Queen, has attracted criticism from some quarters for its depiction of royal events, in particular the breakdown of the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Mail on Sunday has led calls for a disclaimer to be added to the series. The Crown's new series criticised as 'hatchet job' The Crown: Diana steals the show âââââ The Crown to end with Staunton as Queen Earl Spencer, brother of the late Diana, Princess of Wales, previously told ITV's Lorraine Kelly he was worried some viewers would take the storylines ""as gospel"". ""I think it would help The Crown an enormous amount if, at the beginning of each episode, it stated that: 'This isn't true but it is based around some real events',"" he said. Peter Morgan, the show's creator, has defended the fictionalised account of real-life events, describing the script as a ""constant push-pull"" between research and drama. Actor Josh O'Connor, who plays Prince Charles in the current series,told BBC Breakfast: ""What Peter does so brilliantly is he takes the historical facts... and then paints in between those 'punctuation moments'."" ""Sometimes people will want to believe this is what happened. It's always worth checking in and remembering that we're actors, we're not real and it's not a real story,"" he added. Emma Corrin successfully transforms her character into the glamorous Princess Diana overshadowing Prince Charles, played by O'Connor But former Buckingham Palace press secretary Dickie Arbiter has accused the show of ""stretching dramatic licence to the extreme"". ""It's a hatchet job on Prince Charles and a bit of a hatchet job on Diana,""Mr Arbiter told the BBC. And former royal correspondent Jennie Bondtold the BBC Newscast podcastshe feared some viewers might treat the show ""as a documentary"". What does Dickie Arbiter claim is inaccurate? A meeting where the Prince of Wales's private secretary asks whether Diana was mentally fit enough to go on a solo tour of New York. Mr Arbiter said the meeting ""never happened"". ""I was there. John Riddell, Charles's private secretary at the time, would never have said that,"" he said. The way Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are depicted. ""It's just sensationalising, making Charles and Camilla out to be the villains. Charles is portrayed as vicious. He's not vicious,"" he said. Actor Josh O'Connor's ""stooped"" portrayal of the Prince of Wales: ""Charles never stooped. Look at him now, he's 72 and he's upright."" The presence of the Queen's private secretary Martin Charteris throughout series four - which covers 1977 to 1990 - despite him leaving the post in 1977. It comes after Sarah Horsley, widow of Major Hugh Lindsay, said she was""very upset"" by the depiction of her late husband's death, in 1988, in an avalanche - after she asked for it not to be included in the drama. Mrs Horsley told the Sunday Telegraph last weekend that The Crown's producers replied with ""a very kind letter"", saying ""that they understood my concerns but they hope I will feel that they deal with difficult subject matters with integrity and great sensitivity"".

"Sir Philip Green's retail empire could collapse within hours, as a senior source at Arcadia Group told the BBC they do not expect any last-minute rescue deal. The company, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins,is set to enter administration on Monday. That would put 13,000 jobs at risk. Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has, however, offered a Â£50m loan to Arcadia to try to help the group with its cash-flow problems in the short-term. ""Our offer would allow you to retain employment for many thousands of your staff, reopen hundreds of stores when the current lockdown ends, and protect the financial positions of thousands of members in your pension schemes,"" a letter addressed to Arcadia Group executives seen by the BBC says. The letter also says that the Frasers Group would consider giving out the emergency cash on an unsecured basis - meaning Arcadia would not need to put up collateral, such as property, to guarantee it would be paid back. ""We would urge you to carefully consider this offer,"" it says. But the Arcadia Group insider told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack earlier on Sunday: ""If this was about Â£50m we could find that in five minutes."" The source added: ""This is obviously a sad day, we tried to save it a year ago when Â£200m was put into the business and the pension fund, but it's impossible to operate now. ""You don't know when you'll be open, you don't know what stock to buy."" Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was The 'king of the High Street's' biggest challenge Arcadia's brands once dominated High Street fashion, but its chains have been hit hard by store closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and the strength of online clothing retailers such as Boohoo and Asos. This appears to be the end of the road for Sir Philip's epic retail journey. One that has brought him riches, a knighthood and a government request to use his magic for public sector procurement. It's also brought him infamy, public condemnation and lawsuits settled controversially. He has been branded the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". But to some he is a skilled businessman and shrewd financier who created thousands of jobs. He can also be generous - providing financial assistance and long-term healthcare support for dozens of his employees. Sir Philip doesn't really do humble but I believe he does consider this administration a genuinely sad day for the employees, the business and his own legacy. In the end he was operating in a world of modern retail that required a completely different skill set to the one he undoubtedly possessed. Sir Philipis chairman of the Arcadia group, while his wife Cristina is the majority owner of its parent company Taveta Investments. The couple are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia and paid to his wife in 2005, two years after buying the business. Since Lady Green is a resident in Monaco, it was paid to her tax-free. The BBC understands Sir Philip is on his super-yacht Lionheart, which is docked in Monaco's harbour. He has so far declined requests for an interview. A BBC reporter in the principality said there was no sign of Sir Philip on deck, but crew members were busy cleaning the 90m-long vessel. Sir Philip's superyacht is docked in Monaco Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund. The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee Stephen Timms has called on the Green family to plug the gap. The Labour MP said: ""This is a dreadful time for Arcadia staff to be worrying about their jobs and their pensions."" ""Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund,"" he said. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Mr Timms said he would raise the matter with the Pensions Regulator on Monday. Pensions consultant John Ralfe told the BBC that if Sir Philip chose to use his personal wealth to plug the hole in the Arcadia pension pot, that would ensure workers enrolled in the scheme receive their full pension. But Mr Ralfe said even if the retail magnate did not do that - or if he writes a cheque that is substantially less than Â£350m - Arcadia workers should still receive most of their pension entitlement through the Pension Protection Fund. ""The good news is the government has a lifeboat - the Pension Protection Fund - which is designed to make sure that people get compensation if their company goes bust,"" he said. ""The compensation they get isn't the full 100% of the pension promise they were expecting, but it's not far short."" Sir Philip with his wife Lady Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List Mr Ralfe has previously said Sir Philip seemed to have ""learnt his lesson"" from the pension scandal involving BHS a few years ago. Sir Philip sold the now-defunct department store to businessman Dominic Chappell in 2015 for Â£1, but a year later it collapsed. Around 11,000 people lost their jobs and the company was found to have a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip later reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator - which accused him of selling BHS to avoid responsibility for the deficit - to inject Â£363m into the scheme. Commentators say the situation with Arcadia is very different and point to the fact that last year Lady Green agreed to pump Â£100m into Arcadia's two pension schemes over three years. Labour's Stephen Timms said he will write a letter to the Pensions Regulator on Monday, ""to underline the importance of securing the interests of [Arcadia Group's] pension scheme members"". The Pension Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund are understood to be staying closely informed of decisions affecting Arcadia Group. There are fears Arcadia's expected collapse could affect the future of Debenhams The imminent collapse of Arcadia could also have implications for Debenhams, scuppering a potential sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for around Â£75m of sales. JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year. It has already cut some 6,500 jobs since May. Debenhams now has around 12,000 employees across 124 stores. According to a source close to the JD Sports, the appointment of administrators to Arcadia would give the company ""more to think about"". A final decision is expected within days.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Sturgeon defends handling of pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has defended her government's handling of the pandemic as statistics show Scotland's Covid death rate rose higher than England's in recent weeks. Figures show there were 50.5 deaths per million in Scotland in the week to 15 November, compared to 40.6 in England. The first minister said it was too soon to be comparing statistics while ""still in the teeth of a pandemic"". She told theBBC's Andrew Marr Showthe death toll was unacceptable. ""I have done everything and will continue to do everything I can to try and control the virus to try and keep it as low as possible, to take the tough decisions that have to be taken in order to achieve that and to try to take people of Scotland along in these difficult steps with me as far as I possibly can,"" she said. ""But nobody underestimates the pain, the grief, the suffering that this global pandemic has brought to us."" While the weekly statistics show that Scotland's death rate has been above England's in the last four weeks, Scotland's overall death rate is lower than England and Wales. UK government statistics,externalshow that Scotland's Covid death rate is 94 per 100,000, compared to England's at 101.5 and Wales  at 102.4.  Northern Ireland's death rate is 63.4 per 100,000. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? The people who have died with Covid-19 How Scotland reached 5,000 deaths from Covid-19 The interview came after the SNP leader told her party's virtual conference on Saturday that she had""never been so certain"" that Scotland would become independent. On Sunday the conference backed a plan to pressure the UK government into holding another referendum on the issue - and to explore alternative legal routes if it refuses. Douglas Ross, the leader of Scottish Conservatives, said the SNP's record was ""clear for all to see"" but Ms Sturgeon's priority was ""dragging Scotland through another divisive referendum"". Comparative death rates were presented to the first minister on The Andrew Marr Show. Scotland's death toll surpassed 5,000 earlier this month and the latest National Records of Scotland figures now show 5,380 people have died with the virus in Scotland. The statistics agency records the number of death certificates that mention the virus. In England, using the same measure, more than 57,000 people have died with the virus. Challenged on the death rate in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said that, over the course of the whole pandemic, it has been ""quite significantly lower"" than England and Wales, though it was higher than that of Northern Ireland. ""But across the whole of the UK, across much of Europe, far more people have died from this virus than any of us feel comfortable with,"" she added. The SNP leader was also asked about care home deaths after aUniversity of Stirling report,externalfound that 47% of Scotland's Covid deaths in the first wave were in care homes, compared to 30% in England. ""If you look at excess deaths overall in care homes across the UK, excess deaths in Scotland have actually been lower than in England but a higher proportion of these excess deaths have been attributed to Covid,"" she said. ""So in England more of the excess deaths have been attributed to other things, and certainly not to Covid. That simplistic view that the care home death toll is worse in Scotland perhaps doesn't bear that scrutiny. ""The death toll is unacceptable in Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and across much of Europe."" The Scottish government has introduced five levels of restrictions in a bid to suppress the spread of the virus during the second wave. People in 11 local authorities are currently living under the strictest limits of level four, with restrictions on travel, hospitality and non-essential shopping. Later a Scottish government spokesman said weekly statistics did not accurately portray trends across the whole pandemic and ""can be misleading if looked at in isolation"". ""Deaths from Covid-19 in Scotland have been significantly lower over the course of the pandemic than England and Wales, with over 7% few deaths per 100,000 than England."" Reacting to the interview, the Scottish Conservatives' Douglas Ross said the SNP's record was ""clear to see"". ""Scandalous number of care home deaths, education tumbling down the international league tables and withholding vital advice from the Salmond inquiry. Nicola Sturgeon's priority?  Dragging Scotland through another divisive referendum,""he said on Twitter.,external Meanwhile Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrat, said Ms Sturgeon was ""good at presentation but has repeatedly fallen short on delivery."" He said she ""talks a good game"" but she ""did not use the summer well to to prepare for the second wave of the virus in the autumn"". Labour MP Ian Murray said Ms Sturgeon should be held to account for her ""failings in office"". ""Amid a child poverty crisis, care homes scandal and utter contempt for Holyrood, the first minister's record is one of broken promises to the people of Scotland,"" he added. ""Her only priority is to divide Scotland at a time when we need to bring people together for a period of healing and recovery."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"The 43 farmers were buried on Sunday More than 43 people have been killed in what the Nigerian president has described as an ""insane"" attack in north-east Nigeria on Saturday. The attackers tied up agricultural labourers working in rice fields and slit their throats near Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, reports say. This is one of the worst attacks in recent months in a region where the Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa insurgent groups are active. No-one has yet claimed responsibility. ""I condemn the killing of our hard-working farmers by terrorists in Borno state. The entire country is hurt by these senseless killings. My thoughts are with their families in this time of grief. May their souls rest in peace,"" said President Muhammadu Buhari. Mr Buhari also described ""the terrorist killings as insane"", according to his spokesman Garba Shehu. Allow Twitter content?

""We have recovered 43 dead bodies, all of them slaughtered, along with six others with serious injuries,"" a local militiaman who helped the survivors told the AFP news agency. More bodies were reportedly found later - but the exact number of the victims was not immediately known. Reports also say about 15 women were kidnapped. The victims were labourers from Sokoto state in north-western Nigeria, roughly 1,000 km (600 miles) away, who had travelled to the north-east to find work, another militiaman told AFP. The victims were buried on Sunday, with the state's governor in attendance The governor of Borno state, Babagana Zulum, attended the victims' funerals on Sunday. ""It is disheartening that more than 40 citizens were slaughtered while they were working in their farmlands,"" he told journalists. ""Our people are in very difficult situations, they are in two different extreme conditions: in one side, [if] they stay at home, they may be killed by hunger and starvation; on the other, they go out to their farmlands and risk getting killed by the insurgents. This is very sad."" He called on the federal government to recruit more soldiers and members of other security forces to protect farmers in the region. 'Bomb on donkey' used to ambush Nigeria governor Nigerian soldiers and police killed in IS ambush The farmers ""were attacked because they had on Friday disarmed and arrested a Boko Haram gunman who had been tormenting them"",a member of the local parliament, Ahmed Satomi, told newspaper Premium Times,external. Correspondents say farmers have previously been attacked by militants of the Islamist group Boko Haram, who suspect them of passing on information to the military. Last month, Boko Haram fighters killed 22 farmers working on irrigation fields in two separate incidents. On Sunday, six soldiers were reportedly killed in a jihadist ambush near the town of Baga in Borno State, says the BBC's Chris Ewokor, in Abuja. The soldiers were on their way to the area to boost security at a food distribution depot for people displaced by the conflict. Who are Boko Haram? Nigeria country profile Despite regional efforts to end Boko Haram's campaign of violence, the group has stepped up its attacks in recent months. The Nigerian government has repeatedly claimed that the Islamist militant groups have been technically defeated, correspondents say. President Buhari, who five years ago asserted that Boko Haram had been defeated, said he had given all the support needed to the armed forces to protect Nigeria's population. But the Nigerian military has been unable to quell the insurgency affecting the region, in which tens of thousands have been killed or abducted.

"Pentecostal church pastor Daniel Mateola said the police intervention left him ""deeply shocked"" Police stormed into a church broadcast and incorrectly told a minister he was to be prosecuted for breaking Covid regulations. Officers attended Kingdom Faith Ministries International Church in Milton Keynes last week after reports of loud music. The pastor was told too many staff were running the online service forcing it to stop, a church spokesman said. Thames Valley Police said there was a ""misunderstanding"" and apologised. Rev Daniel Mateola was holding a legal broadcast service in the church to 150 online members of his congregation when two police officers arrived at the building on November 20, the Christian Legal Centre said. The officers claimed there were too many people supporting the broadcast and demanded they leave. The guidelines say ""the numbers or people involved should be kept as small as possible to minimise risks and participants should follow social distancing guidance"" but also states that technical support, musicians and singers are allowed if that is part of the usual form of worship. When the pastor tried to refer police to thegovernment guidelines on the safe use of places of worship during the pandemic,external, and insisted what they were doing was legal, a further seven officers were called, the centre said. Pastor Mateola said officers had ""escalated"" the situation ""unnecessarily"" and the service had to be halted as staff left the building. The Christian Legal Centre said four days later on 24 November officers went to Pastor Mateola's home and informed him he was to be prosecuted for breaking government regulations. An officer told him he had ""broken coronavirus regulationsâ¦the music was blaring out loud"". Pastor Mateola, who is one of a number of church leaders pursuing a judicial review against the English and Welsh government's decision to close churches, said both incidents left him ""deeply shocked"" and that he was ""being treated like a criminal"". Thames Valley Police has apologised and said he will not face prosecution. Ch Supt Robert France, from the force's coronavirus response team, said: ""It appears in this case that there has been a misunderstanding by our officers of the legislation in place in what is an ever-changing and complex area of enforcement. ""There has been a mistake in the issuing of this ticket and I would like to apologise for the distress I know this is likely to have caused.""

"This video can not be played A helicopter crew found the unusual object while conducting a count of big horn sheep in the area A mysterious metal monolith discovered last week in the desert in the US state of Utah has disappeared, officials say. Utah's Bureau of Land Management said it had seen credible reports the object had been removed ""by an unknown party"". Social media images apparently from the site show a pile of rocks and a small piece of metal left behind. The discovery of the 12ft (3.7m) high object sparked a national guessing game as to how it got there, and saw dozens of people pay a visit in recent days. The strange metal object was first spotted on 18 November by a helicopter crew counting big horn sheep from the air, in a remote south-eastern area of Utah. News of its discovery and speculation over its origins quickly went viral on social media, with many observers presuming it was an art installation left by a sculptor. As yet no-one has claimed responsibility for installing the structure. Internet sleuths got there, but the monolith's origins are still a mystery Allow Instagram content?

""Twenty-four hours later, my close friend, who is also a helicopter pilot, flew his family down to see as well and found it taken down,"" he said, adding he would like to know who did it. The state's Bureau of Land Management (BLM) said in a statement it had not removed""the structure which is considered private property"",external. ""We do not investigate crimes involving private property which are handled by the local sheriff's office,"" it added. Several people posted images on social media said to be from the site, posing with what remained of the monolith. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Last week, the Utah Department of Public Safety Aero Bureau released images of the mysterious metal object, but did not disclose its exact location fearing explorers may try to seek it out and ""become stranded"". However, this did not stop dozens - perhaps even hundreds - ofcurious sight-seers from flocking to the site in recent daysafter internet sleuths were able to track down the monolith's GPS co-ordinates. But the mystery of its origins remain. The pilot of the helicopter who made the discovery, Bret Hutchings, speculates the monolith may have been installed by ""some new wave artist"" or a fan of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the 1968 film directed by Stanley Kubrick. Imposing black monoliths created by an unseen alien species appear in the movie, based on the writings of novelist Arthur C Clarke.

"Mairead Philpott was sentenced to 17 years for manslaughter in 2013 for her part in a house fire A mother who was jailed for killing her six children in a fire has been released from prison. Mairead Philpott, 39, was jailed for 17 years in 2013 for the manslaughter of her children at her home in Derby a year before. Jade Philpott, 10, John, nine, Jack, seven, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, died on the morning of the blaze. Duwayne, 13, died three days later. The Ministry of Justice said it cannot comment on individual cases. ""Offenders released on licence face strict conditions and can be returned to prison if they breach them,"" a spokesperson said. The Sun newspaper reported shehas now been released,external, as the sentencing judge said she only had to serve half her term. The children were killed after Mick Philpott, 63, poured petrol on the floor of the house in Victory Road and set it alight on 11 May, while Mairead spoke to emergency services. Jade, John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Duwayne Philpott all died as a result of the fire in Victory Road, Derby, in 2012 Nottingham Crown Court heard he started the fire to frame his former lover and gain custody of her children, but that he did not appreciate how quickly it would spread. Prosecutors said it was a ""plan that went horribly wrong"". In her sentencing remarks, Mrs Justice Thirlwall said it was clear the fire was Mick Philpott's idea. But she said Mairead's children died because she put her husband first. Mick, who was the father of five of the children, has to serve a minimum term of 15 years in prison for his part in the killings. Mairead and Paul Mosley, a family friend who was also sentenced to 17 years, were both told they would have to serve at least half their sentences. This is why she could now be released. The house where the six children died in Victory Road, Derby, has since been demolished Pauline Latham, Conservative MP for Mid Derbyshire, said she would be raising the matter with the Attorney General as she believed she should serve a life sentence for each child and ""never have come out [of jail]"". She added: ""No one in Derby will ever forget the deaths of those six children. ""I'm very shocked she has been released so so quickly. It's not even 18 months per child.""

"The UK is in the ""last leg of negotiations"" with the EU over a post-Brexit trade deal, the foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab told the BBC it was likely the talks were entering the ""last real major week"", and an agreement remained possible if the EU showed ""pragmatism"". He added that the talks now depended on resolving a ""fairly narrow"" set of issues, including fishing rights. Negotiators are racing to reach a deal, with a looming deadline in four weeks. Face-to-face discussions resumed in London over the weekend, after chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier left self-isolation following a colleague's positive Covid-19 test last week. The two sides are trying to strike an agreement to govern their trading relationship after the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Barnier arrives in UK for face-to-face Brexit talks What's happening with Brexit? How close to a Brexit trade deal are we? Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Raab said: ""We're down to really two basic issues, but I think in particular the issue around fisheries. ""I do think this is a very significant week, the last real major week, subject to any further postponement of the goalposts in terms of the timing."" He added that a deal was subject to the EU accepting the ""point of principle"" that the UK would require ""control"" over its fishing grounds after the transition. ""If the EU understand that point of principle and we have some pragmatism, we can get there,"" he said. ""We ought to be able on both sides to resolve fisheries, if you take the context of the wider economic gains and potential downsides of not having a further deal."" Speaking earlier to Sky's Sophy Ridge, he said the UK was prepared to ""talk about transitions and things like that"" on fishing rights, but the ""point of principle"" on control would have to be respected. Michel Barnier has finished self-isolating after a member of his team tested positive for Covid. Ahead of in-person negotiations resuming on Saturday, Mr Barnier said the ""same significant divergences persist"" between the two sides. Negotiators had continued via video-link for the past week or so, after the positive Covid-19 test in a member of the EU negotiating team. Alongside fishing, the Frenchman has for a while said post-Brexit competition rules and how any deal would be enforced remain the most difficult areas. The two sides are continuing to haggle over how much access European fishing boats should have to British waters, and how much they would be allowed to catch from next year. They are also at odds over how closely the UK should have to follow the EU's social, labour, and environmental standards after the transition. The UK left the EU on 31 January, but it is continuing to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year as part of an 11-month transition period. If a trade deal is not agreed by then, trading between the two will default to World Trade Organization rules. The EU and UK can keep negotiating if they want to after this, but the two sides would face import taxes on goods traded between them. The UK would have no access to the EU's energy market, and no agreement on police and judicial co-operation. On Sunday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would decide whether to vote for or abstain on any deal reached, after examining the final agreement. Speaking at an online conference for a party affiliate group, he said: ""This is an important discussion within our party, and I'm obviously listening to a number of different views on it."" ""I don't think there's really much of a case for voting against it, when that would effectively be to vote for no deal,"" he added. Last month the UK's chief negotiator Lord David Frost said he assumed MPs would have to vote on a law to implement ""at least some elements"" of a deal. What's happening with Brexit?

"Santa's grottos will be allowed in all tiers if they're in venues that are permitted to be open, undernew Christmas advice.,external Door-to-door carol singing will also be permitted, it has been confirmed in the government guidance. But if you live in tier three in England, you cannot attend a school nativity play - instead, you will have to live stream it or watch a recording. Rules vary across the different nations of the UK and in different tiers. How to avoid getting Covid at Christmas Who are you allowed to see at Christmas? What you need to know about Christmas travel Nativity playswill have to be performed within existing school bubbles, with no mixing across groups.  Audiences in tier one and tier two areas will be subject to restrictions as well - like social distancing. Santa'sgrottoscan open if they are in venues that are permitted according to the tier that region is in. But ""appropriate Covid-secure measures"" like social distancing have to be in place as well. Some have already made arrangements for Father Christmas to speak to children via video-streaming sites, instead of face to face. Carol singing- and carol services - can take place, as long as those attending adhere to the advice on singing safely, which has been put together with the help of Public Health England. Its advice includes singing in well-ventilated areas and keeping distance from each other. Door-to-door carol singing is allowed too, but in groups of a maximum of six. Special rules have to be in place because singing increases the risk of transmitting the virus through small droplets and aerosols in the air. This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas The number of people at a carol event should be limited as well. Those performing professionally or as part of a supervised activity for under 18s are not limited in number, but should still follow the performing arts guidance - including things like wearing masks and managing capacity. For any indoor events, joining in with singing will not be allowed this year. But people can sing if they are outside. Bishop of London Sarah Mullally welcomed the news about outdoor singing, saying: ""Singing is a very special part of our worship, especially at Advent and Christmas, so I know that the announcement that we will be able to come together for public singing outdoors this Christmas will bring comfort and joy to many. ""Advent and Christmas this year will not be the same as previous years but having outdoor congregational singing and indoor carol services with choirs is a reasonable balance and recognises our duty to protect and care for each other."" Christmas bubbles can be in place from 23 to 27 December, toallow up to three householdsto spend the festive period together.

"Footage of the party at St Peter's Court, Nottingham, was posted on social media A party of 200 people at a halls of residence was broken up by police. The gathering in the courtyard outside St Peter's Court, Radford, which houses University of Nottingham students, stopped after midnight. Nottinghamshire Police said officers were unable to arrest anyone as the crowd dispersed when they arrived, but they were still investigating. It was one of a number of parties the force broke up overnight, prompting a plea to follow the rules. Students across England are being tested next week as part of the government's plan to allow them to return home between 3 and 9 December. Footage seen by the BBC of what appears to be the party shows little regard for social distancing rules Shortly after 21:00 GMT officers handed out five Â£200 fines after responding to reports of a party in a field in Gonalston. They said they were still trying to find the organiser and a driver who crashed into a police car as they fled the scene. At about 22:30 officers were called to a flat in Pilcher Gate, in the city centre, where they gave Â£200 fines to 21 people. Shortly after 23:30 two people were arrested in Valley Road, Carlton, on suspicion of assaulting a police officer who had been at the scene of another illegal gathering. Just after midnight officers broke up a ""large party"" in St Ann's and issued the organiser with a summons to appear in court. Det Supt Andrew Gowan said: ""The very last thing we want to be doing as police officers is to be punishing people for gathering together and having fun. ""However, the current national restrictions are in place to protect the wider public from harm and we will keep enforcing them for as long as we need to. ""It is deeply disappointing that so many needed such an expensive reminder that the rules apply equally to everyone. ""We understand that this is a difficult time but there really are no excuses for this kind of behaviour where people are blatantly ignoring the restrictions in such large numbers.""

""I do think this is a very significant week, the last real major week, subject to any further postponement of the goalposts in terms of the timing."" He added that a deal was subject to the EU accepting the ""point of principle"" that the UK would require ""control"" over its fishing grounds after the transition. ""If the EU understand that point of principle and we have some pragmatism, we can get there,"" he said. ""We ought to be able on both sides to resolve fisheries, if you take the context of the wider economic gains and potential downsides of not having a further deal."" Speaking earlier to Sky's Sophy Ridge, he said the UK was prepared to ""talk about transitions and things like that"" on fishing rights, but the ""point of principle"" on control would have to be respected. Michel Barnier has finished self-isolating after a member of his team tested positive for Covid. Ahead of in-person negotiations resuming on Saturday, Mr Barnier said the ""same significant divergences persist"" between the two sides. Negotiators had continued via video-link for the past week or so, after the positive Covid-19 test in a member of the EU negotiating team. Alongside fishing, the Frenchman has for a while said post-Brexit competition rules and how any deal would be enforced remain the most difficult areas. The two sides are continuing to haggle over how much access European fishing boats should have to British waters, and how much they would be allowed to catch from next year. They are also at odds over how closely the UK should have to follow the EU's social, labour, and environmental standards after the transition. The UK left the EU on 31 January, but it is continuing to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year as part of an 11-month transition period. If a trade deal is not agreed by then, trading between the two will default to World Trade Organization rules. The EU and UK can keep negotiating if they want to after this, but the two sides would face import taxes on goods traded between them. The UK would have no access to the EU's energy market, and no agreement on police and judicial co-operation. On Sunday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would decide whether to vote for or abstain on any deal reached, after examining the final agreement. Speaking at an online conference for a party affiliate group, he said: ""This is an important discussion within our party, and I'm obviously listening to a number of different views on it."" ""I don't think there's really much of a case for voting against it, when that would effectively be to vote for no deal,"" he added. Last month the UK's chief negotiator Lord David Frost said he assumed MPs would have to vote on a law to implement ""at least some elements"" of a deal. What's happening with Brexit?

"Santa's grottos will be allowed in all tiers if they're in venues that are permitted to be open, undernew Christmas advice.,external Door-to-door carol singing will also be permitted, it has been confirmed in the government guidance. But if you live in tier three in England, you cannot attend a school nativity play - instead, you will have to live stream it or watch a recording. Rules vary across the different nations of the UK and in different tiers. How to avoid getting Covid at Christmas Who are you allowed to see at Christmas? What you need to know about Christmas travel Nativity playswill have to be performed within existing school bubbles, with no mixing across groups.  Audiences in tier one and tier two areas will be subject to restrictions as well - like social distancing. Santa'sgrottoscan open if they are in venues that are permitted according to the tier that region is in. But ""appropriate Covid-secure measures"" like social distancing have to be in place as well. Some have already made arrangements for Father Christmas to speak to children via video-streaming sites, instead of face to face. Carol singing- and carol services - can take place, as long as those attending adhere to the advice on singing safely, which has been put together with the help of Public Health England. Its advice includes singing in well-ventilated areas and keeping distance from each other. Door-to-door carol singing is allowed too, but in groups of a maximum of six. Special rules have to be in place because singing increases the risk of transmitting the virus through small droplets and aerosols in the air. This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas The number of people at a carol event should be limited as well. Those performing professionally or as part of a supervised activity for under 18s are not limited in number, but should still follow the performing arts guidance - including things like wearing masks and managing capacity. For any indoor events, joining in with singing will not be allowed this year. But people can sing if they are outside. Bishop of London Sarah Mullally welcomed the news about outdoor singing, saying: ""Singing is a very special part of our worship, especially at Advent and Christmas, so I know that the announcement that we will be able to come together for public singing outdoors this Christmas will bring comfort and joy to many. ""Advent and Christmas this year will not be the same as previous years but having outdoor congregational singing and indoor carol services with choirs is a reasonable balance and recognises our duty to protect and care for each other."" Christmas bubbles can be in place from 23 to 27 December, toallow up to three householdsto spend the festive period together. People, in all tiers, can attendplaces of worshipfor services from 2 December, but the rules on who you attend with depends on which tier you live in, with no indoor mixing allowed outside of tier one. However, people in the same Christmas bubble can attend together. Christmasvolunteering- which can be a key part of the season for many - is allowed, but it is recommended you do this from home. You can volunteer outside the home but follow social distance guidance andadvice on helping safely,external. The rules onshoppingdepend on whether the shop is indoors or an outdoor market - and on the tier you live in.

"Esther Dingley sent this photo of her at the top of a mountain on Sunday A British woman who has spent six years on a campervan tour of Europe has gone missing while walking in the Pyrenees. Esther Dingley, 37, last spoke to her partner Dan Colegate via Whatsapp last Sunday, when she was atop Pic de Sauvegarde on the France Spain border. She had been due to end her solo trek on Wednesday but has not been seen. Frenchauthorities confirmed they were searching,externalfor Ms Dingley, and Mr Colegatesaid he was ""broken"" and ""shattered"",externalby her disappearance. Ms Dingley had been travelling in the couple's camper van while Mr Colegate stayed at a farm in the Gascony area of France. On the weekend she set out on the trek,the couple's story about exploits around Europe in the camper van since 2014 was published by BBC News. Esther had been walking in the area around Pic Sauvegarde Mr Colegate said she had been away for a month and their last conversation had been about ""how excited we were to see each other as this was her last trip before driving back"". Her last known location was on top of the mountain at about 16:00 GMT on 22 November. Ms Dingley had started walking from Benasque in Spain on Saturday and had a plan to spend Sunday night at Refuge Venasque in France, Mr Colegate said. He said searches had yielded ""no sign at all"" and temperatures were dropping with light snow fall in the area. Experienced walker Esther has completed solo treks before She has previously completed solo treks, and Mr Colegate said: ""She always tried to keep in touch but sometimes on her hikes was out of contact for a couple of days. ""This is not looking good."" The couple had lived in Durham before deciding to pack up their lives and go travelling after Mr Colegate nearly died from an infection. In a post on Facebook, the Peloton de Gendarmerie de Haute Montagne, said it was ""actively looking"" for Ms Dingley. Mr Colegate, who has gone to the Luchon area to help look for his partner of 18 years, said helicopters and dogs have been involved in the search but have so far found ""no trace"".

"This video can not be played Prof Peter Openshaw on vaccine developments: ""We're all very excited about this as scientists"" The UK would be making a ""terrible mistake"" to relax Covid measures just months before vaccines are expected to take effect, a leading scientist said. Prof Peter Openshaw, a government adviser, said the nation should not ""take the brakes off"" at this stage ""when the end is in sight"". He said infection rates, numbers in hospital and deaths were all too high. But he said recent trial results showed ""for sure that this is a virus we can defeat with vaccination"". Prof Openshaw, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) who works at Imperial College London, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""We scientists are very concerned indeed about relaxation of precautions at this stage. ""The rates are still too high, there's too many cases coming into hospitals, too many people dying."" England's lockdown is ending this week, when it will enter a three-tier system of restrictions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the tier system would be givenan expiry date of 3 February. Covid tiers could have 3 February finish, says PM When will a vaccine be ready? Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? Elsewhere in the UK, Scotland is usinga five-level system of restrictionswhile Northern IrelandÂ has beguna two-week circuit-breaker lockdown. In Wales, the hospitality industry is due to be placed under stricter rules - not yet finalised - from 4 December. Prof Openshaw said: ""If we take the brakes off at this stage, just when the end is in sight, I think we would be making a huge mistake."" He said it was ""extremely difficult"" to decide on the right measures against the virus but said he thought it was important to ""keep this under control and just behave very, very sensibly"". ""We've all sacrificed so much, everyone has sacrificed enormously in order to get the transmission rate down. With only a few months to go until vaccines start to have an effect I think it would just be a terrible mistake,"" the professor said. He welcomed the initial data published showing several vaccines had high levels of effectiveness at preventing infections. ""Several trials are reporting very good efficacy and that I think means for sure that is a virus we can defeat with vaccination,"" he said. Prof Openshaw said more data was needed to explain why the Oxford vaccine showed different levels of effectiveness in one part of the trial, in which volunteers were mistakenly given a half-dose followed by a full dose later. The lower initial dose resulted in a 90% effectiveness rate among a smaller sample of volunteers aged under 55, while the intended regime of two full doses was 62% effective. But he said: ""I would personally be happy to have any vaccine that's been through the regulatory scrutiny that these trials are currently undergoing. ""If my GP rings me and says I've got an approved vaccine, I really don't care which one it is."" THREE TIERS:How will the system work? VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? The UK government has purchased another two million doses of a vaccine from US biotech firm Moderna, bringing its total to seven million - enough for abut 3.5 million people. That vaccine was shown to be 95% effective. It has also pre-ordered 40 million doses of a vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech, with 10 million expected by the end of the year. Initial data suggests it is 95% effective, with Pfizer saying it found similar results in the vulnerable over-65 population. AstraZeneca, which is producing the Oxford vaccine, is said to have four million doses ready for the UK by the end of the year, with 40 million expected by March. The government has 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine ordered in total. Prof Openshaw said he would be ""surprised"" if reports that the Pfizer vaccine could be approved and in use next week turned out to be true, but he said there could be an announcement in the next fortnight.

"This video can not be played Covid in Scotland: Sturgeon defends handling of pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has defended her government's handling of the pandemic as statistics show Scotland's Covid death rate rose higher than England's in recent weeks. Figures show there were 50.5 deaths per million in Scotland in the week to 15 November, compared to 40.6 in England. The first minister said it was too soon to be comparing statistics while ""still in the teeth of a pandemic"". She told theBBC's Andrew Marr Showthe death toll was unacceptable. ""I have done everything and will continue to do everything I can to try and control the virus to try and keep it as low as possible, to take the tough decisions that have to be taken in order to achieve that and to try to take people of Scotland along in these difficult steps with me as far as I possibly can,"" she said. ""But nobody underestimates the pain, the grief, the suffering that this global pandemic has brought to us."" While the weekly statistics show that Scotland's death rate has been above England's in the last four weeks, Scotland's overall death rate is lower than England and Wales. UK government statistics,externalshow that Scotland's Covid death rate is 94 per 100,000, compared to England's at 101.5 and Wales  at 102.4.  Northern Ireland's death rate is 63.4 per 100,000. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? The people who have died with Covid-19 How Scotland reached 5,000 deaths from Covid-19 The interview came after the SNP leader told her party's virtual conference on Saturday that she had""never been so certain"" that Scotland would become independent. On Sunday the conference backed a plan to pressure the UK government into holding another referendum on the issue - and to explore alternative legal routes if it refuses. Douglas Ross, the leader of Scottish Conservatives, said the SNP's record was ""clear for all to see"" but Ms Sturgeon's priority was ""dragging Scotland through another divisive referendum"". Comparative death rates were presented to the first minister on The Andrew Marr Show. Scotland's death toll surpassed 5,000 earlier this month and the latest National Records of Scotland figures now show 5,380 people have died with the virus in Scotland. The statistics agency records the number of death certificates that mention the virus. In England, using the same measure, more than 57,000 people have died with the virus. Challenged on the death rate in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said that, over the course of the whole pandemic, it has been ""quite significantly lower"" than England and Wales, though it was higher than that of Northern Ireland. ""But across the whole of the UK, across much of Europe, far more people have died from this virus than any of us feel comfortable with,"" she added. The SNP leader was also asked about care home deaths after aUniversity of Stirling report,externalfound that 47% of Scotland's Covid deaths in the first wave were in care homes, compared to 30% in England. ""If you look at excess deaths overall in care homes across the UK, excess deaths in Scotland have actually been lower than in England but a higher proportion of these excess deaths have been attributed to Covid,"" she said. ""So in England more of the excess deaths have been attributed to other things, and certainly not to Covid. That simplistic view that the care home death toll is worse in Scotland perhaps doesn't bear that scrutiny. ""The death toll is unacceptable in Scotland, England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and across much of Europe."" The Scottish government has introduced five levels of restrictions in a bid to suppress the spread of the virus during the second wave. People in 11 local authorities are currently living under the strictest limits of level four, with restrictions on travel, hospitality and non-essential shopping. Later a Scottish government spokesman said weekly statistics did not accurately portray trends across the whole pandemic and ""can be misleading if looked at in isolation"". ""Deaths from Covid-19 in Scotland have been significantly lower over the course of the pandemic than England and Wales, with over 7% few deaths per 100,000 than England."" Reacting to the interview, the Scottish Conservatives' Douglas Ross said the SNP's record was ""clear to see"". ""Scandalous number of care home deaths, education tumbling down the international league tables and withholding vital advice from the Salmond inquiry. Nicola Sturgeon's priority?  Dragging Scotland through another divisive referendum,""he said on Twitter.,external Meanwhile Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrat, said Ms Sturgeon was ""good at presentation but has repeatedly fallen short on delivery."" He said she ""talks a good game"" but she ""did not use the summer well to to prepare for the second wave of the virus in the autumn"". Labour MP Ian Murray said Ms Sturgeon should be held to account for her ""failings in office"". ""Amid a child poverty crisis, care homes scandal and utter contempt for Holyrood, the first minister's record is one of broken promises to the people of Scotland,"" he added. ""Her only priority is to divide Scotland at a time when we need to bring people together for a period of healing and recovery."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"The H5N8 strain of avian influenza was found at a turkey fattening premises near Northallerton All 10,500 turkeys will be culled at a farm in North Yorkshire after bird flu was confirmed at the site. The H5N8 strain of avian influenza was found at a turkey fattening premises near Northallerton on Saturday. The birds will be humanely culled to stop the disease spreading, the Department for Rural Affairs (Defra) said, as it investigates the source. Risk to public health from the virus is very low, Public Health England (PHE) added. A temporary control zone is currently in place - a 3km (1.9-mile) protection zone immediately around the location of the outbreak and a 10km (6.2-mile) surveillance zone around that. More Yorkshire stories Defra's chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: ""We are urgently looking for any evidence of disease spread associated with this farm to control and eliminate it. ""Bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises."" The disease can spread to poultry and other captive birds when wild birds migrate from mainland Europe during winter, Defra added. Routine health advice is being offered to those working on the farm. Dr Gavin Dabrera, consultant in Acute Respiratory Infections at PHE, said the World Health Organisation has never confirmed any cases of H5N8 in humans to date. The Food Standards Agency said properly-cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, remain safe to eat.

"Sir Philip Green's retail empire could collapse within hours, as a senior source at Arcadia Group told the BBC they do not expect any last-minute rescue deal. The company, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins,is set to enter administration on Monday. That would put 13,000 jobs at risk. Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has, however, offered a Â£50m loan to Arcadia to try to help the group with its cash-flow problems in the short-term. ""Our offer would allow you to retain employment for many thousands of your staff, reopen hundreds of stores when the current lockdown ends, and protect the financial positions of thousands of members in your pension schemes,"" a letter addressed to Arcadia Group executives seen by the BBC says. The letter also says that the Frasers Group would consider giving out the emergency cash on an unsecured basis - meaning Arcadia would not need to put up collateral, such as property, to guarantee it would be paid back. ""We would urge you to carefully consider this offer,"" it says. But the Arcadia Group insider told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack earlier on Sunday: ""If this was about Â£50m we could find that in five minutes."" The source added: ""This is obviously a sad day, we tried to save it a year ago when Â£200m was put into the business and the pension fund, but it's impossible to operate now. ""You don't know when you'll be open, you don't know what stock to buy."" Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was The 'king of the High Street's' biggest challenge Arcadia's brands once dominated High Street fashion, but its chains have been hit hard by store closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and the strength of online clothing retailers such as Boohoo and Asos. This appears to be the end of the road for Sir Philip's epic retail journey. One that has brought him riches, a knighthood and a government request to use his magic for public sector procurement. It's also brought him infamy, public condemnation and lawsuits settled controversially. He has been branded the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". But to some he is a skilled businessman and shrewd financier who created thousands of jobs. He can also be generous - providing financial assistance and long-term healthcare support for dozens of his employees. Sir Philip doesn't really do humble but I believe he does consider this administration a genuinely sad day for the employees, the business and his own legacy. In the end he was operating in a world of modern retail that required a completely different skill set to the one he undoubtedly possessed. Sir Philipis chairman of the Arcadia group, while his wife Cristina is the majority owner of its parent company Taveta Investments. The couple are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia and paid to his wife in 2005, two years after buying the business. Since Lady Green is a resident in Monaco, it was paid to her tax-free. The BBC understands Sir Philip is on his super-yacht Lionheart, which is docked in Monaco's harbour. He has so far declined requests for an interview. A BBC reporter in the principality said there was no sign of Sir Philip on deck, but crew members were busy cleaning the 90m-long vessel. Sir Philip's superyacht is docked in Monaco Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund. The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee Stephen Timms has called on the Green family to plug the gap. The Labour MP said: ""This is a dreadful time for Arcadia staff to be worrying about their jobs and their pensions."" ""Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund,"" he said. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Mr Timms said he would raise the matter with the Pensions Regulator on Monday. Pensions consultant John Ralfe told the BBC that if Sir Philip chose to use his personal wealth to plug the hole in the Arcadia pension pot, that would ensure workers enrolled in the scheme receive their full pension. But Mr Ralfe said even if the retail magnate did not do that - or if he writes a cheque that is substantially less than Â£350m - Arcadia workers should still receive most of their pension entitlement through the Pension Protection Fund. ""The good news is the government has a lifeboat - the Pension Protection Fund - which is designed to make sure that people get compensation if their company goes bust,"" he said. ""The compensation they get isn't the full 100% of the pension promise they were expecting, but it's not far short."" Sir Philip with his wife Lady Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List Mr Ralfe has previously said Sir Philip seemed to have ""learnt his lesson"" from the pension scandal involving BHS a few years ago. Sir Philip sold the now-defunct department store to businessman Dominic Chappell in 2015 for Â£1, but a year later it collapsed. Around 11,000 people lost their jobs and the company was found to have a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip later reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator - which accused him of selling BHS to avoid responsibility for the deficit - to inject Â£363m into the scheme. Commentators say the situation with Arcadia is very different and point to the fact that last year Lady Green agreed to pump Â£100m into Arcadia's two pension schemes over three years. Labour's Stephen Timms said he will write a letter to the Pensions Regulator on Monday, ""to underline the importance of securing the interests of [Arcadia Group's] pension scheme members"". The Pension Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund are understood to be staying closely informed of decisions affecting Arcadia Group. There are fears Arcadia's expected collapse could affect the future of Debenhams The imminent collapse of Arcadia could also have implications for Debenhams, scuppering a potential sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for around Â£75m of sales. JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year. It has already cut some 6,500 jobs since May. Debenhams now has around 12,000 employees across 124 stores. According to a source close to the JD Sports, the appointment of administrators to Arcadia would give the company ""more to think about"". A final decision is expected within days.

"This video can not be played Diego Maradona's doctor gave a tearful interview after the footballer's death Argentine prosecutors are investigating Diego Maradona's doctor for possible manslaughter following the footballing legend's death four days ago. Police in Buenos Aires have searched the house and private clinic of Leopoldo Luque as they try to establish if there was negligence in Maradona's treatment following surgery. The 60-year-old died of a heart attack at his home where he was recuperating. Dr Luque has not been charged. He denies any wrongdoing. Maradona had a successful operation on a brain blood clot earlier in November and had been due to be treated for alcohol dependency. Maradona dies aged 60 - tributes and reaction 'To be Maradona was incredibly beautiful, but also hard' His daughters have pressed for details about their father's medication. Some 30 police officers raided 39-year-old Dr Luque's house on Sunday morning - with another 20 going into his clinic in the capital Buenos Aires. Officers are looking into records into the treatment of the football legend The raids were ordered by prosecutors trying to build a picture of Maradona's last days at home. They retrieved computers, mobile phones and medical notes, officials say. There are suspicions that the star's convalescence at home might not have met the conditions of his discharge from the clinic, such as a 24-hour team of nurses ""specialised in substance abuse"", the on-call presence of doctors and a stand-by ambulance equipped with a defibrillator. Officials want to know about Dr Luque's involvement in Maradona's recovery arrangements at the late star's house. In an emotional press conference on Sunday, Dr Luque - who has been described as the footballer's personal physician  - cried, saying he had done all he could to save the life of a friend. He said Maradona had been very sad lately. At one point, the doctor shot back at reporters: ""You want to know what I am responsible for? For having loved him, for having taken care of him, for having extended his life, for having improved it to the end."" The doctor said he had done ""everything he could, up to the impossible"". Then addressing some of the concerns authorities are looking into, Dr Luque cast doubt on what his role actually was. ''If you ask me, I'm a neurosurgeon and my job ended. I was done with him,"" he said referring to November's surgery - and insisting Maradona's convalescence at home was not his responsibility. This video can not be played Diego Maradona ""will live in our heart forever"" ""He [Maradona] should have gone to a rehabilitation centre. He didn't want to,"" Dr Luque said, calling the late star ""unmanageable"". He also said he did not know why there was no defibrillator or who was responsible for the fact that there was no ambulance outside Maradona's house. And he added: Diego ""was very sad, he wanted to be alone, and it's not because he didn't love his daughters, his family, or those around him"". Diego Maradona was captain when Argentina won the 1986 World Cup, scoring the famous ""Hand of God"" goal against England in the quarter-finals. Obituary - Argentina's flawed football icon An extraordinary life in pictures Maradona played for Barcelona and Napoli during his club career, winning two Serie A titles with the Italian side. He started his career with Argentinos Juniors, also playing for Sevilla, and Boca Juniors and Newell's Old Boys in his homeland. He scored 34 goals in 91 appearances for Argentina, representing them in four World Cups. This video can not be played Diego Maradona: Argentina legend Maradona explains his infamous 'Hand of God' goal Maradona led his country to the 1990 final in Italy, where they were beaten by West Germany, before captaining them again in the United States in 1994, but was sent home after failing a drugs test for ephedrine. During the second half of his career, Maradona struggled with cocaine addiction and was banned for 15 months after testing positive for the drug in 1991. He retired from professional football in 1997, on his 37th birthday, during his second stint at Argentine giants Boca Juniors. Having briefly managed two sides in Argentina during his playing career, Maradona was appointed head coach of the national team in 2008 and left after the 2010 World Cup, where his side were beaten by Germany in the quarter-finals. He subsequently managed teams in the United Arab Emirates and Mexico and was in charge of Gimnasia y Esgrima in Argentina's top flight at the time of his death.

"A fresh inquest into the death of an asthmatic nine-year-old girl starts on Monday, after a medical report suggested a direct link between her illness and poor air quality near her home, not far from a busy road. Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah could now become the first person in the UK - and possibly in the world - to have ""air pollution"" listed as a cause of death. Ever since Ella became ill, 10 years ago, Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah has been asking questions. Why did her daughter, so vibrant and healthy, suddenly become so unwell? What was causing the asthma attacks and seizures? ""She was sitting there and she would suddenly have an attack and I wanted to know why? If your asthma is that bad, someone should be able to tell a parent, what is triggering it."" The next 10 days may finally give her some answers, but it will be a terrible ordeal. ""I'm not sure how I'm going to get through it all but I will somehow,"" she says. ""I've held my promise to my late daughter to try to find out why she became so ill."" Rosamund will have to recall in detail the three years that her daughter was unwell. The times - she's lost count of how many - that Ella lay lifeless in the house and she had to resuscitate her. The blue-light ambulance journeys, almost 30 of them, to five different hospitals across London. Seeing her child's slender body hooked to a ventilator four times; being advised by doctors to try to talk to her through the induced comas, to help her recover. Ella died in February 2013. The cause given on the death certificate was acute respiratory failure. The inquest in 2014 concluded it had perhaps been triggered by ""something in the air"". Until that time no-one had talked about air pollution as a cause of Ella's illness and Rosamund says she became determined to find out what that ""something"" was. Rosamund's tone is amiable, she laughs frequently, but it is also forceful and insistent. She used to be head of sixth form at a London school, teaching psychology and philosophy. Sometimes she can be quite intelligent, she says with a cackle. She was born in North London, but she describes her children as being ""born and bred in Lewisham"" in south-east London. Ella was the eldest of three. The twins are now 13. They still live in the same house and they like to keep her room as it was, with planes stuck on the wall and the ceiling painted blue like the sky, because the children's big sister wanted to be a pilot in the RAF. On a nice day they cycle up to the cemetery to think about her. ""They hate it when Ella is called 'tragic',"" says Rosamund. ""She was not. She was very wise."" Ella wearing an RAF pilot's clothing - later she decided she wanted to fly an air ambulance Gifted - remarkable - exceptional. These are words that could be applied to Ella by anyone, not just a proud parent. Ella was in the top 10% of her school and by the time she was nine years old she had a reading age of 14. In the weeks before she died she was devouring Jane Eyre. ""She loved mental games,"" says Rosamund. Her favourite was chess, and few could beat her at Connect 4. ""She would pretend not to see a pattern and then when she felt you were getting too far ahead she would beat you."" She played almost a dozen musical instruments and was an excellent swimmer. She was also very caring. ""Reading and writing came naturally to her. So when she met a child that couldn't read or write - as long as the teacher allowed it - after finishing her own work, Ella would sit with her and try to help her."" More pollution expected from stay-home workers Can London work as a national park city? Silvertown tunnel Thames crossing plans approved During her many spells in hospital she didn't want to sit on her bed and ""vegetate."" She convinced her doctors to let her go to school with a bandage tied over the cannula in her hand. She was given the teaching she craved, but the more carefree things, like PE, or going for sleepovers, were out of bounds. She would wake up on the ward, her mother would arrive to take her to school and, at the end of the day, would take her back to her hospital bed. ""How she fought,"" Rosamund says. ""Goodness me, she really did fight. And if she can fight and she was so young, she definitely inspired me. I still hear her voice, and many of our conversations. She always wanted to know why she had become so ill. She used to ask me."" Ella as a young child Their house - she doesn't want to reveal the address - was just a few dozen metres from the South Circular, one of London's most notoriously congested roads. School was a half-hour walk away, mostly on the pavement beside nose-to-tail traffic. The first time she knew something was wrong was when Ella was seven. It was 2010, October half term. ""We were doing the Great Fire of London at school and we went to see the Monument. Ella had a cold and she was climbing up the stairs. I remember her voice saying to me, 'I can no longer climb,' and me saying, as mothers do, 'You've only got a cold, what's stopping you?' I still feel really bad about that."" Ella, a child with as much determination as her mother, got to the top. But on the train home, unusually, she fell fast asleep. Not long afterwards she developed a cough with a specific sound, like a smoker's cough. A few weeks later, just after Christmas, doctors put her in a coma for the first time."" The next 28 months were worse than anyone can imagine, Rosamund says. Ella had tests for cystic fibrosis and epilepsy, eventually getting a diagnosis of severe asthma. In the beginning Ella didn't know how ill she was, Rosamund says, but as time went on, she realised. ""I'm still incredibly sad about how much she suffered,"" she says. ""She suffered greatly. That is something I cannot erase from my memory at all."" The seizures happened most often at night. She would stop breathing. Rosamund would have to use what she calls ""magical skills"" - resuscitation - to keep her daughter alive until the ambulance got there. ""I learned from the first time that screaming and running around was not going to help her. The hospital trained me. Maybe it is a skill we should all acquire. It's something I hope never to have to use again."" Ella was treated in Lewisham Hospital, King's College Hospital, Great Ormond Street, St George's, St Thomas's. She regularly spent 14 days at a time being given intravenous antibiotics. She took steroids and always carried inhalers. ""There was one time when she was in intensive care, and the doctor said we have done everything we can now, it's up to her to fight back,"" Rosamund says. ""There's this hopelessness as a parent, when everything has been done. There's nothing you can do, and you just sit by their bed. One thing the doctors said to do is to talk to her. I don't know how we got through it. Afterwards, we never spoke about it."" Rosamund remembers the last evening they spent together at home in the sitting room. ""Her last night was Valentine's night. The final thing I read to her was Beethoven's Love Letters,"" she says. A few hours later she stopped breathing and Rosamund made what would be the final 999 call. Ella had a seizure in the ambulance and died in hospital in the early hours of 15 February 2013. ""I read the last one of those love letters at her funeral. You know the one that goes 'Ever thine ever mine'â¦ I don't ever look it up now. I can't."" Rosamund asked Great Ormond Street to take tissue samples of her daughter's body ""from top to toe"". She still isn't sure why she did it. ""It makes me sound like I'm really bright,"" she laughs. ""But there were just so many questions. I think it was because I'd heard about bodies having to be exhumed and I didn't want that to happen."" She got legal advice and spoke to anyone who would listen - and listened to anyone who could help. In 2015, Prof (now Sir) Stephen Holgate, a government adviser and one of the UK's leading experts on asthma and air pollution, read an article about Ella, and got in touch. Rosamund gave him access to the tissue samples and he considered Ella's medical records. This enabled him to confirm the type and severity of Ella's asthma. He examined all the data, including readings from pollution monitors close to the family home, andconcluded that there was a direct linkbetween Ella's condition and levels of toxic gases, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and harmful airborne particles. Unknown to the residents of Lewisham, on the night she died this part of London was covered by an invisible, but dense, poisonous mist of traffic fumes and other pollutants. There was, Stephen Holgate wrote a ""real prospect that without unlawful levels of air pollution, Ella would not have died."" ""I was very angry when I read that report,"" says Rosamund. ""No-one had ever said anything to us about pollution before. We were looking for a medical answer. And this was an environmental answer. But he said he was 97% certain. And he's been doing this for 40 years."" It was very hard to break the news to the twins, she says. And it has left her fearful: whenever one of them coughs, it sets off an alarm bell. The fresh inquest will look at all the evidence, including Stephen Holgate's report, and decide whether illegal levels of pollution killed their sister. It will also look at whether the central and local government should have been doing more to keep the people of Lewisham safe. The government estimates the number of people killed by long-term exposure to air pollution in the UK to be as high as 30,000 a year. However, no direct link to an individual death has ever been made. Is it little Ella who will provide one? Rosamund stresses that she isn't trying to blame the original coroner or any of the healthcare professionals who cared for her daughter. She also doesn't want to predict what the ruling will be. However, it's no secret what result she and her team want. If Ella becomes the first person - perhaps in the world - whose cause of death is listed as air pollution, it could lead to seismic change. Article two of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to life. Ella could set a precedent, helping those forced to breathe unlawful levels of dirty air to hold the authorities to account, and demand action. What's been called the ""invisible killer"" has also been legally invisible, Rosamund's lawyer Jocelyn Cockburn says. This inquest could make it impossible to ignore. When the coroner has made his decision, when the media interviews have been done, when the lawyers have gone home, what then? For Rosamund, the sadness will remain. ""I look at what her siblings are doing, and I realise what she has missed,"" she says. ""Even if we get the verdict we would like to get, there is no happy ever after is there? Because we will not get her back."" Will they move? She will talk to the twins, she says, and she will see how bad the traffic is, though as a full-time campaigner now, rather than a teacher, she's not sure they would be able to afford it. ""But if we have to move we will damn well move."" She wants to thank the people who write to her, telling her about their experiences. They encourage her to carry on. Just as Ella herself did. ""She didn't want to be forgotten by her siblings and her friends. She was only here for a short while but I hope she's left her mark. She's brought about discussion [and shown] it can happen to anyone. ""And if we get the result we want, my other daughter is going to say, 'Unless you do something mum, other children are going to die.'"" Every year, mental health trusts spend millions of pounds employing lawyers to represent them at inquests, where they could be found to be at fault. The relatives of those who have died, however, often get no legal aid and have to stand up and face those lawyers alone. Becky Montacute describes her bid to ensure that the lessons from her mother's death were learned.

"The first thing many people noticed about Dave Prowse was his size. His imposing frame would take the bodybuilder and actor,who has died at 85 after a short illness, to Hollywood - and a galaxy far, far away. As a young man, it took him to the doors at The Glen, the Bristol dance hall where he worked. ""There was never any trouble at The Glen,"" remembers David Warren, who told the BBC he used to visit the venue on Mondays and Fridays. ""I was standing on the edge of the dance floor - it must have been in 1961 - and was conscious of someone standing next to me. I looked down and saw a pair of feet. I have big feet - size 11 - but these were enormous, huge. ""I turned and looked up and up and up. He was a giant."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Yet for many of those who got to know Dave Prowse, it was his generosity and kindness they remembered. ""We lived a few doors away from Dave and his family when I was growing up,"" Sandra Weakner told the BBC. ""Every Sunday morning all the children in the road would have keep fit with Dave and his children in his front room. ""I remember one occasion his daughter and I were told by Dave we were doing better than the boys. It made our day, especially as my brother was also doing it."" Sandra, whose maiden name is Barrett, remembers Prowse travelling to the United States to play his most famous role. ""I remember him going off to America when he was being Darth Vader. We were out in the street waving him off. ""They were such a lovely family."" Marina Grant featured in a 1984 fitness magazine while she was training with Prowse Marina Grant was 14 when she first met Prowse. She lives with a disability and uses callipers to support her legs. ""My father heard Dave on the radio talking about how he used to wear a calliper as a child for his club foot,"" she told the BBC. ""My dad got in touch with Dave and he kindly offered to give me personal training sessions at his gym for free."" They stayed in touch for a time. ""Dave and his wife Norma even came to my wedding in 1989,"" she said. ""He was a lovely man."" Ian Edmed (third from right) trained at a London gym run by Dave Prowse (centre), pictured with bodybuilder Frank Zane Ian Edmed also trained at Prowse's gym, in the 1970s and 1980s. ""My first recollection of him was he was absolutely enormous,"" he told the BBC. ""He set me off on a lifetime in weights. And he was just one of those people who was larger than life. He was an inspiration to everyone who trained at his gym. ""He was an innovator. There weren't many gyms in London at the time and it drew people from quite a way."" Prowse's was not the only famous face Ian recalls recognising there. ""The number of people I met there - Andy Ripley, the England rugby player; [bodybuilder] Frank Zane, Mr Olympia; Peter Davison, who went on to play Doctor Who, and his wife Sandra Dickinson. ""I missed Arnold Schwarzenegger - he turned up one evening. ""Dave was the type of person who people flock to."" Ian moved away, but returned to they gym when his son, Scott, was born. ""Dave signed a photo for him. We've dug out the picture to send to my son today,"" he said. ""For people of my generation, he'll always be remembered as Darth Vader. ""When the mask was finally taken off and it was a different actor underneath he wasn't very happy, I can tell you."" But if there was any resentment - his voice was also dubbed - it didn't stop him from engaging with the legions of Star Wars fans. Derek Reeves is the chairman of the Croydon Symphonic Band, an award-winning amateur community wind band. A few years ago the band was due to perform music from Star Wars at Fairfield Halls. ""We had a phone call out of the blue,"" he told the BBC. ""It was Dave Prowse. Derek Reeves said Dave Prowse was a gentleman happy to have photos taken with audience and band members ""He lived nearby and asked if he could come to the concert. He was a gentleman who was happy to stay behind and sign autographs after the concert and have photographs taken with the audience and band members."" Prowse was a regular fixture at conventions, too. Attendees or exhibitors paying tribute on social media have emphasised his graciousness and generosity. Allow Twitter content?

Mike Sparkes, 51, from Colchester, was at a wrestling reunion in 2010 when he unexpectedly bumped into Prowse. ""Back in the 1970s he trained a lot of the British wrestlers at the time,"" Mike explained. ""He was an absolute gentleman.

"This video can not be played Lizo Mzimba looks back at the career of Dave Prowse Dave Prowse, the Bristolian former bodybuilder best known for playing Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy, has died aged 85. Prowse was cast as Vader for his imposing physique, even though the role was voiced by James Earl Jones. But the weightlifter-turned-actor was most proud of playing the Green Cross Code Man. The role, promoting road safety in the UK, earned him an MBE. ""May the force be with him, always!"" said his agent Thomas Bowington. ""Though famous for playing many monsters - for myself, and all who knew Dave and worked with him, he was a hero in our lives."" Prowse, a personal trainer, and his brother were responsible for starting some of the first gyms in England Mr Bowington called the actor's death, after a short illness, ""a truly and deeply heart-wrenching loss for us and millions of fans all over the world"". Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars movies, said he was ""so sad"" to hear the news. ""He was a kind man and much more than Darth Vader,""Hamill said on Twitter,external. ""He loved his fans as much as they loved him."" 'My first recollection of him was he was enormous' Star Wars co-star - and fellow Briton - Anthony Daniels, who has played C-3PO in 11 of the 12 Star Wars instalments, paid tribute to Prowse's contribution to the epic series. ""Dave's iconic figure dominated the finished film in '77 and has done so ever since,""he wrote on Twitter,externalon Sunday. The family of the late actor Peter Mayhew, who played Chewbacca alongside Prowse's Vader, posted a picture of the pair with R2-D2 actor Kenny Baker, who died in 2016: ""I hope you're up there sharing a pint and a story with the boys,"" said the tweet posted by the Peter Mayhew Foundation.

Doctor Who star John Barrowman recalled how Prowse ""got me into shape"" for a stage role in the musical Matador. ""Dave was a huge part of our #confamily - his smile will be missed,""he added,external, referring to the star's popular presence at fan conventions. Meanwhile, Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees hailed Prowse's Bristol roots and his legacy: ""A Bristol man and along with #WhyDon'tYou and #GrangeHill, part of our 70s and 80s childhoods,""he wrote,external. Prowse's career as an actor spanned 50 years, but it was his role as the Sith Lord in Star Wars that brought him international fame. Unfortunately, his West Country accent was not deemed suitable for the part of a menacing Hollywood villain and his lines were dubbed. However, Prowse was a definitive presence in all three of the early films, thanks to his hulking 6ft 6in (1.98 m) frame, honed by the weightlifting skills which saw him represent England at the Commonwealth Games in the early 1960s. During this period, he reportedly became close friends with rival bodybuilding competitors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno (later better known as TV's Incredible Hulk) - long before their on-screen fame. Prowse claimed he was unaware the voice of Darth Vader would be dubbed by another actor Prowse made his film debut in 1967 James Bond spoof Casino Royale playing Frankenstein's Creature, a part he was asked to play again in two films from the iconic Hammer film series, 1970's Horror Of Frankenstein and 1974's Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell. He also regularly featured on cult series such as The Saint, Space 1999 and Doctor Who, in which he was cast as a minotaur in the 1972 episode The Time Monster, opposite Jon Pertwee. Behind the scenes in Hollywood circles, Prowse prepared the late Christopher Reeve for the physical demands of his role as Superman, as the actor's personal trainer. Spotted by director George Lucas in the 1971 film Clockwork Orange, in which he played a bodyguard, Prowse was invited to audition for the roles of Darth Vader and Chewbacca in 1977's Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. He later told the BBC's Tanya Beckett, he chose Vader over Chewbacca because ""you always remember the bad guys"". With the success of Star Wars, Prowse became a regular on the fan circuit and attended conventions around the world for almost 40 years, but he was rumoured to have later fallen out with director Lucas and was banned from official events in 2010. Despite the enduring clamour for Star Wars, the actor always maintained that playing the Green Cross Code Man, which he first portrayed in 1975, was the ""best job I ever had"". Dressed in a distinctive green and white superhero suit, he became the face of British road safety for more than a decade, known for his catchphrase ""Stop, look and listen"". Brought up in Bristol, he spent his later years living in Croydon ""a loving husband, father and grandfather"". His autobiography Straight from the Force's Mouth was published in 2011.

"Esther Dingley sent this photo of her at the top of a mountain on Sunday A British woman who has spent six years on a campervan tour of Europe has gone missing while walking in the Pyrenees. Esther Dingley, 37, last spoke to her partner Dan Colegate via Whatsapp last Sunday, when she was atop Pic de Sauvegarde on the France Spain border. She had been due to end her solo trek on Wednesday but has not been seen. Frenchauthorities confirmed they were searching,externalfor Ms Dingley, and Mr Colegatesaid he was ""broken"" and ""shattered"",externalby her disappearance. Ms Dingley had been travelling in the couple's camper van while Mr Colegate stayed at a farm in the Gascony area of France. On the weekend she set out on the trek,the couple's story about exploits around Europe in the camper van since 2014 was published by BBC News. Esther had been walking in the area around Pic Sauvegarde Mr Colegate said she had been away for a month and their last conversation had been about ""how excited we were to see each other as this was her last trip before driving back"". Her last known location was on top of the mountain at about 16:00 GMT on 22 November. Ms Dingley had started walking from Benasque in Spain on Saturday and had a plan to spend Sunday night at Refuge Venasque in France, Mr Colegate said. He said searches had yielded ""no sign at all"" and temperatures were dropping with light snow fall in the area. Experienced walker Esther has completed solo treks before She has previously completed solo treks, and Mr Colegate said: ""She always tried to keep in touch but sometimes on her hikes was out of contact for a couple of days. ""This is not looking good."" The couple had lived in Durham before deciding to pack up their lives and go travelling after Mr Colegate nearly died from an infection. In a post on Facebook, the Peloton de Gendarmerie de Haute Montagne, said it was ""actively looking"" for Ms Dingley. Mr Colegate, who has gone to the Luchon area to help look for his partner of 18 years, said helicopters and dogs have been involved in the search but have so far found ""no trace"".

"Sir Philip Green's retail empire could collapse within hours, as a senior source at Arcadia Group told the BBC they do not expect any last-minute rescue deal. The company, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins,is set to enter administration on Monday. That would put 13,000 jobs at risk. Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has, however, offered a Â£50m loan to Arcadia to try to help the group with its cash-flow problems in the short-term. ""Our offer would allow you to retain employment for many thousands of your staff, reopen hundreds of stores when the current lockdown ends, and protect the financial positions of thousands of members in your pension schemes,"" a letter addressed to Arcadia Group executives seen by the BBC says. The letter also says that the Frasers Group would consider giving out the emergency cash on an unsecured basis - meaning Arcadia would not need to put up collateral, such as property, to guarantee it would be paid back. ""We would urge you to carefully consider this offer,"" it says. But the Arcadia Group insider told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack earlier on Sunday: ""If this was about Â£50m we could find that in five minutes."" The source added: ""This is obviously a sad day, we tried to save it a year ago when Â£200m was put into the business and the pension fund, but it's impossible to operate now. ""You don't know when you'll be open, you don't know what stock to buy."" Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was The 'king of the High Street's' biggest challenge Arcadia's brands once dominated High Street fashion, but its chains have been hit hard by store closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and the strength of online clothing retailers such as Boohoo and Asos. This appears to be the end of the road for Sir Philip's epic retail journey. One that has brought him riches, a knighthood and a government request to use his magic for public sector procurement. It's also brought him infamy, public condemnation and lawsuits settled controversially. He has been branded the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". But to some he is a skilled businessman and shrewd financier who created thousands of jobs. He can also be generous - providing financial assistance and long-term healthcare support for dozens of his employees. Sir Philip doesn't really do humble but I believe he does consider this administration a genuinely sad day for the employees, the business and his own legacy. In the end he was operating in a world of modern retail that required a completely different skill set to the one he undoubtedly possessed. Sir Philipis chairman of the Arcadia group, while his wife Cristina is the majority owner of its parent company Taveta Investments. The couple are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia and paid to his wife in 2005, two years after buying the business. Since Lady Green is a resident in Monaco, it was paid to her tax-free. The BBC understands Sir Philip is on his super-yacht Lionheart, which is docked in Monaco's harbour. He has so far declined requests for an interview. A BBC reporter in the principality said there was no sign of Sir Philip on deck, but crew members were busy cleaning the 90m-long vessel. Sir Philip's superyacht is docked in Monaco Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund. The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee Stephen Timms has called on the Green family to plug the gap. The Labour MP said: ""This is a dreadful time for Arcadia staff to be worrying about their jobs and their pensions."" ""Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund,"" he said. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Mr Timms said he would raise the matter with the Pensions Regulator on Monday. Pensions consultant John Ralfe told the BBC that if Sir Philip chose to use his personal wealth to plug the hole in the Arcadia pension pot, that would ensure workers enrolled in the scheme receive their full pension. But Mr Ralfe said even if the retail magnate did not do that - or if he writes a cheque that is substantially less than Â£350m - Arcadia workers should still receive most of their pension entitlement through the Pension Protection Fund. ""The good news is the government has a lifeboat - the Pension Protection Fund - which is designed to make sure that people get compensation if their company goes bust,"" he said. ""The compensation they get isn't the full 100% of the pension promise they were expecting, but it's not far short."" Sir Philip with his wife Lady Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List Mr Ralfe has previously said Sir Philip seemed to have ""learnt his lesson"" from the pension scandal involving BHS a few years ago. Sir Philip sold the now-defunct department store to businessman Dominic Chappell in 2015 for Â£1, but a year later it collapsed. Around 11,000 people lost their jobs and the company was found to have a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip later reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator - which accused him of selling BHS to avoid responsibility for the deficit - to inject Â£363m into the scheme. Commentators say the situation with Arcadia is very different and point to the fact that last year Lady Green agreed to pump Â£100m into Arcadia's two pension schemes over three years. Labour's Stephen Timms said he will write a letter to the Pensions Regulator on Monday, ""to underline the importance of securing the interests of [Arcadia Group's] pension scheme members"". The Pension Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund are understood to be staying closely informed of decisions affecting Arcadia Group. There are fears Arcadia's expected collapse could affect the future of Debenhams The imminent collapse of Arcadia could also have implications for Debenhams, scuppering a potential sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for around Â£75m of sales. JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year. It has already cut some 6,500 jobs since May. Debenhams now has around 12,000 employees across 124 stores. According to a source close to the JD Sports, the appointment of administrators to Arcadia would give the company ""more to think about"". A final decision is expected within days.

"Plans have been made for a public information campaign about the vaccine A mass Covid-19 vaccination programme will need the full support of the executive in order to be delivered, the Ulster Unionist Party leader has said. Steve Aiken urged the first and deputy first ministers to present a united front on the importance of the vaccine. Mr Aiken said Northern Ireland was moving to ""a critical stage"" of the pandemic. On Sunday, the Department of Health reported three more coronavirus-related deaths and 351 new cases in NI. It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test, to 986. GPs in NI arepreparing for a mass vaccination programme to begin next month. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Politics Mr Aiken said: ""All of the executive should be working together and getting the same message out. Mr Aiken called on Stormont to focus on recovering the economy and dealing with the pandemic ""Now is not the time for backbiting but what we must be doing is supporting [Robin Swann] because we must support our health service to get through this stage."" Mr Aiken said he would ""love"" the first and deputy first ministers to ""keep coherent with the message they have come out with in the past week"", saying ""they must do that because we're moving to a critical stage"" of the pandemic. Speaking about the vaccines, Mr Aiken said: ""I really do hope that the various vaccines, their efficacy will be proved and they will be given the approval for their rollout to start."" He called on Stormont to focus on helping the economy to recover and dealing with the pandemic in the new year. Plan for Covid vaccinations to begin in December Covid vaccines: Who decides if they are safe? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? ""We need to be doing this to be able to make sure we can come out the other side and make sure our health service isn't overwhelmed,"" he said. The UUP leader added that the ""most important thing"" for the people of Northern Ireland to doing was to support the health minister. On Saturday, the Department of Health reported nine more coronavirus-related deaths and 315 new cases of the virus in Northern Ireland. It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test - to 983. Meanwhile, it emerged that GPs in Northern Ireland are planning to deliver Covid-19 vaccines for people aged over 80 who do not live in care homes from 4 January. Vaccine approval is expected in the next two weeks Doctors have been advised to ""assume"" the GP vaccination programme will begin on that date. Approval is anticipated for two vaccines in the coming weeks. The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) group will decide on who should be first in line to receive it, but it has been widely reported that care home residents and health and social care workers will be the first priority groups. GPs will be central to the programme's roll-out, with Northern Ireland relying on them along with health trusts to ""urgently"" begin administering the doses once the drugs are licensed, according to a letter from the Health and Social Care Board sent to GP practices. The initiative is a ""major undertaking"" by GP practices to ""help bring the pandemic under control"" according to the head of general medical services at the HSCB, Dr Margaret O'Brien. ""Whilst clarity is still required on a number of issues, including the date of approval and delivery of the vaccine, the exact storage requirements and priority groups, the situation is developing at pace and there is a need to plan for the earliest possible commencement of the vaccination programme,"" said Dr O'Brien. ""We do however have enough information to be able to start to plan for a Covid-19 vaccination programme."" Plans from the executive include a public information campaign to encourage take up of the vaccine among the public ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel that so many of us have been waiting for,"" said Dr Alan Stout, chair of the GP committee at the British Medical Association. Dr Stout said the intention is ""to get started this side of Christmas"" but acknowledged the rollout will be ""massively challenging"". Health and social care frontline workers areexpected to be vaccinated in the first phase, followed by residents and staff of care homes and the clinically vulnerable. Without regulatory approval, plans for vaccine delivery are at this stage provisional. The vaccination programme will be on a phased basis, and will run well into 2021, according to the Department of Health. Plans include a public information campaign to encourage take up among the public. What happens when you break Covid-19 restrictions?

"England's new Covid tier system has a ""sunset"" expiry date of 3 February, Boris Johnson has told MPs in a bid to prevent a Commons rebellion. The current lockdown ends on Wednesday, and many Tory MPs are unhappy with the toughened tiers that will replace it. MPs will vote on the system on Tuesday, with Labour undecided on its stance. In a letter to MPs, the PM said rules could be eased in December, MPs could vote again in January, and the tier system could end in February. And writing separately in theMail on Sunday,external, Mr Johnson said he believed Easter would mark a ""real chance to return to something like life as normal"". He warned, however, there would be ""disastrous consequences"" for the NHS if the government did not introduce the new tiered system when lockdown ends. Has England's lockdown worked? Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? England's new system will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. In a bid to quell MPs' concerns, Mr Johnson wrote to them outlining a timeline of when - and how - the tiered approach will end. In his letter, Mr Johnson said: Regulations have a ""sunset"" clause - or expiry date - of 3 February Tiers will be reviewed every two weeks, and areas can move down the tiers from 16 December At the end of January, MPs will have another vote on the tiered approach and decide whether measures stay in place until the end of March The government will publish the circumstances that need to change for an area to move down a tier In his letter to the public, the prime minister urged people to support the new system and ""work together"" with tiering, testing and vaccines. He said: ""We can't blow it now. We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight. ""We have worked too hard, lost too many, sacrificed too much, just to see our efforts incinerated in another volcanic eruption of the virus."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr that having a tiered approach ""allows us to have these localised restrictions"". He said there was a ""risk"" of a third wave ""if we don't get the balance right."" Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News whether the government was looking at breaking counties into smaller areas for the tiers, given differences in rates of the virus within tier areas, Mr Raab said the measures would be reviewed every two weeks. ""But the problem is you've got to get the geographic size sufficiently effective that you don't find the smaller enclaves of lower level virus shooting up because they are not subject to the restrictions in the high levels around them,"" he said. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr that her party's support of the government's coronavirus restrictions was ""not unconditional"" and they ""will act in the public interest"". ""We need to know first of all that these measures are tough enough to get control of the virus, otherwise what we are asking businesses to do is go through significant pain, people laid off, some businesses at risk of collapsing, without being able to show that this is worth it."" She added that there also needed to be ""proper support"" in place. Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Irelandhas begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotlandeach area has been placed in one of five tiers. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and barswill be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas.They will come into force from Friday, 4 December. Conservative rebels were increasingly confident that they could demolish Boris Johnson's majority of 80 on Tuesday when the Commons votes on the proposed three tiers of restrictions in England. That would make the PM reliant on Labour votes to get his measures through - and the opposition hasn't yet committed to backing him. So, on Saturday night, there was a dramatic intervention to try to defuse the revolt. In the letter to his MPs, Mr Johnson - in effect - pleads with them to give him the benefit of the doubt this week, in return for a new vote on the restrictions at the end of January. If the government were to lose that vote, restrictions would end on 3 February. He also seeks to reassure them that the review of restrictions on 16 December will be genuine, so it's possible some areas could move down a tier before Christmas But one potential rebel, the former minister Tim Loughton told the BBC that the PM would have to do more to win him over. He said: ""We asked for a lot of information and that letter doesn't contain it. So unless we get it by Tuesday... then it doesn't change anything I'm afraid."" It's still possible Mr Johnson's new promises will sway some waverers, though a major rebellion may simply be postponed rather than avoided entirely. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Conservative Damian Green, MP for Ashford in Kent - a tier 3 area - said he would vote against the restrictions on Tuesday. He said that in Kent there was ""an extraordinary divergence in Covid rates"" and there was ""no logic"" in putting the whole county in the same tier. ""The new approach punishes rural areas next to large towns or cities and is bound to reduce public acceptance of these restrictions,"" he said. Tory MP Steve Baker said he wanted to see the data the government was basing its new system on. Hetweeted,externalthat MPs were ""glad to share in the burden of decision"", but added: ""That's why we need the information necessary to show the government's restrictions will do more good than harm, in full and in time."" Butwriting in the Sunday Times,external, England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries warned: ""If we relax our guard and the virus spreads too quickly then all the hard-won progress will be undone."" She said that once the lockdown ends in England ""there is no other way to keep the virus under control"", urging people to ""hold on a little longer"". On Saturday, a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

Meanwhile, the government has secured a further two million doses of a coronavirus vaccine from US firm Moderna, which has shown to be 95% effective in trials. This brings the UK's Moderna order to seven million - enough for around 3.5 million people. Separately, the UK has placed orders for 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine, and 40 million doses of the jab from Pfizer and BioNTech, which has also been shown to be 95% effective.

"England could face a third wave of coronavirus if ministers do not ""get the balance right"" with restrictions, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says. He defended the move to a tiered approach when England's lockdown ends on Wednesday, saying the curbs are needed to ""bear down"" on the pandemic. MPs will vote on the system on Tuesday, with Labour undecided on its stance. The PM has told MPs the restrictions will expire on 3 February in a bid to stop a Commons rebellion. In a letter to all MPs and peers, Boris Johnson said rules could be eased in December, MPs could vote again in January and the tier system could end in February. But Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said her party's support was ""not unconditional"" and they were seeking ""clarity"" about the tier system. It comes as a further 12,155 people have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the UK total to 1,617,327. There have been another 215 deaths of people who had tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days, the total under that measure now being 58,245. Has England's lockdown worked?

This morning, the foreign secretary went for the more reassuring approach and piled on the domestic diplomacyâ¦. ""We are listening"", he said. One Tory MP told me this morning that the letter was ""nice"" but he still hadn't decided how to vote.

"This video can not be played Lizo Mzimba looks back at the career of Dave Prowse Dave Prowse, the Bristolian former bodybuilder best known for playing Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy, has died aged 85. Prowse was cast as Vader for his imposing physique, even though the role was voiced by James Earl Jones. But the weightlifter-turned-actor was most proud of playing the Green Cross Code Man. The role, promoting road safety in the UK, earned him an MBE. ""May the force be with him, always!"" said his agent Thomas Bowington. ""Though famous for playing many monsters - for myself, and all who knew Dave and worked with him, he was a hero in our lives."" Prowse, a personal trainer, and his brother were responsible for starting some of the first gyms in England Mr Bowington called the actor's death, after a short illness, ""a truly and deeply heart-wrenching loss for us and millions of fans all over the world"". Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars movies, said he was ""so sad"" to hear the news. ""He was a kind man and much more than Darth Vader,""Hamill said on Twitter,external. ""He loved his fans as much as they loved him."" 'My first recollection of him was he was enormous' Star Wars co-star - and fellow Briton - Anthony Daniels, who has played C-3PO in 11 of the 12 Star Wars instalments, paid tribute to Prowse's contribution to the epic series. ""Dave's iconic figure dominated the finished film in '77 and has done so ever since,""he wrote on Twitter,externalon Sunday. The family of the late actor Peter Mayhew, who played Chewbacca alongside Prowse's Vader, posted a picture of the pair with R2-D2 actor Kenny Baker, who died in 2016: ""I hope you're up there sharing a pint and a story with the boys,"" said the tweet posted by the Peter Mayhew Foundation.

Doctor Who star John Barrowman recalled how Prowse ""got me into shape"" for a stage role in the musical Matador. ""Dave was a huge part of our #confamily - his smile will be missed,""he added,external, referring to the star's popular presence at fan conventions. Meanwhile, Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees hailed Prowse's Bristol roots and his legacy: ""A Bristol man and along with #WhyDon'tYou and #GrangeHill, part of our 70s and 80s childhoods,""he wrote,external. Prowse's career as an actor spanned 50 years, but it was his role as the Sith Lord in Star Wars that brought him international fame. Unfortunately, his West Country accent was not deemed suitable for the part of a menacing Hollywood villain and his lines were dubbed. However, Prowse was a definitive presence in all three of the early films, thanks to his hulking 6ft 6in (1.98 m) frame, honed by the weightlifting skills which saw him represent England at the Commonwealth Games in the early 1960s. During this period, he reportedly became close friends with rival bodybuilding competitors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno (later better known as TV's Incredible Hulk) - long before their on-screen fame. Prowse claimed he was unaware the voice of Darth Vader would be dubbed by another actor Prowse made his film debut in 1967 James Bond spoof Casino Royale playing Frankenstein's Creature, a part he was asked to play again in two films from the iconic Hammer film series, 1970's Horror Of Frankenstein and 1974's Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell. He also regularly featured on cult series such as The Saint, Space 1999 and Doctor Who, in which he was cast as a minotaur in the 1972 episode The Time Monster, opposite Jon Pertwee. Behind the scenes in Hollywood circles, Prowse prepared the late Christopher Reeve for the physical demands of his role as Superman, as the actor's personal trainer. Spotted by director George Lucas in the 1971 film Clockwork Orange, in which he played a bodyguard, Prowse was invited to audition for the roles of Darth Vader and Chewbacca in 1977's Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. He later told the BBC's Tanya Beckett, he chose Vader over Chewbacca because ""you always remember the bad guys"". With the success of Star Wars, Prowse became a regular on the fan circuit and attended conventions around the world for almost 40 years, but he was rumoured to have later fallen out with director Lucas and was banned from official events in 2010. Despite the enduring clamour for Star Wars, the actor always maintained that playing the Green Cross Code Man, which he first portrayed in 1975, was the ""best job I ever had"". Dressed in a distinctive green and white superhero suit, he became the face of British road safety for more than a decade, known for his catchphrase ""Stop, look and listen"". Brought up in Bristol, he spent his later years living in Croydon ""a loving husband, father and grandfather"". His autobiography Straight from the Force's Mouth was published in 2011.

"A US rule change will allow American pharmacists to import drugs intended for the Canadian market Canada has banned the export of some prescription medicines in order to prevent a shortage in the country. The decision is in response to a US plan that would allow for drugs to be imported from Canada to make them cheaper for Americans. Although prescription drug prices in Canada are higher than some nations, they are cheaper than the US. A number of Canada's drug suppliers had warned that the plan, implemented by President Trump, would cause shortages. The pandemic has already increased demands for some medicines, according to the AFP news agency. A statement from Canada's health ministry said the country sources 68% of its drugs from overseas and therefore it was important to avoid any disruptions to supplies. ""Companies will now also be required to provide information to assess existing or potential shortages when requested, and within 24 hours if there is a serious or imminent health risk,"" the statement said. Mr Trump signed anexecutive order in July,externalto allow for the legal importation of cheaper drugs from Canada. A month later, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was happy to help other nations with their supplies if possible but his priority was protecting the needs of Canadians. Drugmakers have faced intense criticism from US politicians - including Mr Trump - as well as insurance companies and patients' groups over the high cost of new medicines and price hikes in some older generic drugs.

"The H5N8 strain of avian influenza was found at a turkey fattening premises near Northallerton All 10,500 turkeys will be culled at a farm in North Yorkshire after bird flu was confirmed at the site. The H5N8 strain of avian influenza was found at a turkey fattening premises near Northallerton on Saturday. The birds will be humanely culled to stop the disease spreading, the Department for Rural Affairs (Defra) said, as it investigates the source. Risk to public health from the virus is very low, Public Health England (PHE) added. A temporary control zone is currently in place - a 3km (1.9-mile) protection zone immediately around the location of the outbreak and a 10km (6.2-mile) surveillance zone around that. More Yorkshire stories Defra's chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, said: ""We are urgently looking for any evidence of disease spread associated with this farm to control and eliminate it. ""Bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspected disease immediately and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises."" The disease can spread to poultry and other captive birds when wild birds migrate from mainland Europe during winter, Defra added. Routine health advice is being offered to those working on the farm. Dr Gavin Dabrera, consultant in Acute Respiratory Infections at PHE, said the World Health Organisation has never confirmed any cases of H5N8 in humans to date.

"The UK is in the ""last leg of negotiations"" with the EU over a post-Brexit trade deal, the foreign secretary has said. Dominic Raab told the BBC it was likely the talks were entering the ""last real major week"", and an agreement remained possible if the EU showed ""pragmatism"". He added that the talks now depended on resolving a ""fairly narrow"" set of issues, including fishing rights. Negotiators are racing to reach a deal, with a looming deadline in four weeks. Face-to-face discussions resumed in London over the weekend, after chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier left self-isolation following a colleague's positive Covid-19 test last week. The two sides are trying to strike an agreement to govern their trading relationship after the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. Barnier arrives in UK for face-to-face Brexit talks What's happening with Brexit? How close to a Brexit trade deal are we? Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Raab said: ""We're down to really two basic issues, but I think in particular the issue around fisheries. ""I do think this is a very significant week, the last real major week, subject to any further postponement of the goalposts in terms of the timing."" He added that a deal was subject to the EU accepting the ""point of principle"" that the UK would require ""control"" over its fishing grounds after the transition. ""If the EU understand that point of principle and we have some pragmatism, we can get there,"" he said. ""We ought to be able on both sides to resolve fisheries, if you take the context of the wider economic gains and potential downsides of not having a further deal."" Speaking earlier to Sky's Sophy Ridge, he said the UK was prepared to ""talk about transitions and things like that"" on fishing rights, but the ""point of principle"" on control would have to be respected. Michel Barnier has finished self-isolating after a member of his team tested positive for Covid. Ahead of in-person negotiations resuming on Saturday, Mr Barnier said the ""same significant divergences persist"" between the two sides. Negotiators had continued via video-link for the past week or so, after the positive Covid-19 test in a member of the EU negotiating team. Alongside fishing, the Frenchman has for a while said post-Brexit competition rules and how any deal would be enforced remain the most difficult areas. The two sides are continuing to haggle over how much access European fishing boats should have to British waters, and how much they would be allowed to catch from next year. They are also at odds over how closely the UK should have to follow the EU's social, labour, and environmental standards after the transition. The UK left the EU on 31 January, but it is continuing to follow the bloc's rules until the end of the year as part of an 11-month transition period. If a trade deal is not agreed by then, trading between the two will default to World Trade Organization rules. The EU and UK can keep negotiating if they want to after this, but the two sides would face import taxes on goods traded between them. The UK would have no access to the EU's energy market, and no agreement on police and judicial co-operation. On Sunday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would decide whether to vote for or abstain on any deal reached, after examining the final agreement. Speaking at an online conference for a party affiliate group, he said: ""This is an important discussion within our party, and I'm obviously listening to a number of different views on it."" ""I don't think there's really much of a case for voting against it, when that would effectively be to vote for no deal,"" he added. Last month the UK's chief negotiator Lord David Frost said he assumed MPs would have to vote on a law to implement ""at least some elements"" of a deal. What's happening with Brexit?

"A US rule change will allow American pharmacists to import drugs intended for the Canadian market Canada has banned the export of some prescription medicines in order to prevent a shortage in the country. The decision is in response to a US plan that would allow for drugs to be imported from Canada to make them cheaper for Americans. Although prescription drug prices in Canada are higher than some nations, they are cheaper than the US. A number of Canada's drug suppliers had warned that the plan, implemented by President Trump, would cause shortages. The pandemic has already increased demands for some medicines, according to the AFP news agency. A statement from Canada's health ministry said the country sources 68% of its drugs from overseas and therefore it was important to avoid any disruptions to supplies. ""Companies will now also be required to provide information to assess existing or potential shortages when requested, and within 24 hours if there is a serious or imminent health risk,"" the statement said. Mr Trump signed anexecutive order in July,externalto allow for the legal importation of cheaper drugs from Canada.

"Plans have been made for a public information campaign about the vaccine A mass Covid-19 vaccination programme will need the full support of the executive in order to be delivered, the Ulster Unionist Party leader has said. Steve Aiken urged the first and deputy first ministers to present a united front on the importance of the vaccine. Mr Aiken said Northern Ireland was moving to ""a critical stage"" of the pandemic. On Sunday, the Department of Health reported three more coronavirus-related deaths and 351 new cases in NI. It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test, to 986. GPs in NI arepreparing for a mass vaccination programme to begin next month. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Politics Mr Aiken said: ""All of the executive should be working together and getting the same message out. Mr Aiken called on Stormont to focus on recovering the economy and dealing with the pandemic ""Now is not the time for backbiting but what we must be doing is supporting [Robin Swann] because we must support our health service to get through this stage."" Mr Aiken said he would ""love"" the first and deputy first ministers to ""keep coherent with the message they have come out with in the past week"", saying ""they must do that because we're moving to a critical stage"" of the pandemic. Speaking about the vaccines, Mr Aiken said: ""I really do hope that the various vaccines, their efficacy will be proved and they will be given the approval for their rollout to start."" He called on Stormont to focus on helping the economy to recover and dealing with the pandemic in the new year. Plan for Covid vaccinations to begin in December Covid vaccines: Who decides if they are safe? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? ""We need to be doing this to be able to make sure we can come out the other side and make sure our health service isn't overwhelmed,"" he said. The UUP leader added that the ""most important thing"" for the people of Northern Ireland to doing was to support the health minister. On Saturday, the Department of Health reported nine more coronavirus-related deaths and 315 new cases of the virus in Northern Ireland. It brings the department's overall death toll, which is based on deaths from any cause within 28 days of a positive test - to 983. Meanwhile, it emerged that GPs in Northern Ireland are planning to deliver Covid-19 vaccines for people aged over 80 who do not live in care homes from 4 January. Vaccine approval is expected in the next two weeks Doctors have been advised to ""assume"" the GP vaccination programme will begin on that date. Approval is anticipated for two vaccines in the coming weeks. The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) group will decide on who should be first in line to receive it, but it has been widely reported that care home residents and health and social care workers will be the first priority groups. GPs will be central to the programme's roll-out, with Northern Ireland relying on them along with health trusts to ""urgently"" begin administering the doses once the drugs are licensed, according to a letter from the Health and Social Care Board sent to GP practices. The initiative is a ""major undertaking"" by GP practices to ""help bring the pandemic under control"" according to the head of general medical services at the HSCB, Dr Margaret O'Brien. ""Whilst clarity is still required on a number of issues, including the date of approval and delivery of the vaccine, the exact storage requirements and priority groups, the situation is developing at pace and there is a need to plan for the earliest possible commencement of the vaccination programme,"" said Dr O'Brien. ""We do however have enough information to be able to start to plan for a Covid-19 vaccination programme."" Plans from the executive include a public information campaign to encourage take up of the vaccine among the public ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel that so many of us have been waiting for,"" said Dr Alan Stout, chair of the GP committee at the British Medical Association. Dr Stout said the intention is ""to get started this side of Christmas"" but acknowledged the rollout will be ""massively challenging"". Health and social care frontline workers areexpected to be vaccinated in the first phase, followed by residents and staff of care homes and the clinically vulnerable. Without regulatory approval, plans for vaccine delivery are at this stage provisional. The vaccination programme will be on a phased basis, and will run well into 2021, according to the Department of Health. Plans include a public information campaign to encourage take up among the public. What happens when you break Covid-19 restrictions?

"Sir Philip Green's retail empire could collapse within hours, as a senior source at Arcadia Group told the BBC they do not expect any last-minute rescue deal. The company, which includes Topshop, Burton and Dorothy Perkins,is set to enter administration on Monday. That would put 13,000 jobs at risk. Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has, however, offered a Â£50m loan to Arcadia to try to help the group with its cash-flow problems in the short-term. ""Our offer would allow you to retain employment for many thousands of your staff, reopen hundreds of stores when the current lockdown ends, and protect the financial positions of thousands of members in your pension schemes,"" a letter addressed to Arcadia Group executives seen by the BBC says. The letter also says that the Frasers Group would consider giving out the emergency cash on an unsecured basis - meaning Arcadia would not need to put up collateral, such as property, to guarantee it would be paid back. ""We would urge you to carefully consider this offer,"" it says. But the Arcadia Group insider told the BBC's business editor Simon Jack earlier on Sunday: ""If this was about Â£50m we could find that in five minutes."" The source added: ""This is obviously a sad day, we tried to save it a year ago when Â£200m was put into the business and the pension fund, but it's impossible to operate now. ""You don't know when you'll be open, you don't know what stock to buy."" Buyers to 'pick over carcass' of Topshop firm Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was The 'king of the High Street's' biggest challenge Arcadia's brands once dominated High Street fashion, but its chains have been hit hard by store closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and the strength of online clothing retailers such as Boohoo and Asos. This appears to be the end of the road for Sir Philip's epic retail journey. One that has brought him riches, a knighthood and a government request to use his magic for public sector procurement. It's also brought him infamy, public condemnation and lawsuits settled controversially. He has been branded the ""unacceptable face of capitalism"". But to some he is a skilled businessman and shrewd financier who created thousands of jobs. He can also be generous - providing financial assistance and long-term healthcare support for dozens of his employees. Sir Philip doesn't really do humble but I believe he does consider this administration a genuinely sad day for the employees, the business and his own legacy. In the end he was operating in a world of modern retail that required a completely different skill set to the one he undoubtedly possessed. Sir Philipis chairman of the Arcadia group, while his wife Cristina is the majority owner of its parent company Taveta Investments. The couple are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Much of their wealth is derived from a Â£1.2bn dividend payment Sir Philip took from Arcadia and paid to his wife in 2005, two years after buying the business. Since Lady Green is a resident in Monaco, it was paid to her tax-free. The BBC understands Sir Philip is on his super-yacht Lionheart, which is docked in Monaco's harbour. He has so far declined requests for an interview. A BBC reporter in the principality said there was no sign of Sir Philip on deck, but crew members were busy cleaning the 90m-long vessel. Sir Philip's superyacht is docked in Monaco Adding to the uncertainty facing the thousands of Arcadia staff is an estimated Â£350m hole in the company's pension fund. The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee Stephen Timms has called on the Green family to plug the gap. The Labour MP said: ""This is a dreadful time for Arcadia staff to be worrying about their jobs and their pensions."" ""Whatever happens to the group, the Green family must make good the deficit in the Arcadia pension fund,"" he said. This video can not be played Monaco, models and money â who is retail mogul Sir Philip Green? Mr Timms said he would raise the matter with the Pensions Regulator on Monday. Pensions consultant John Ralfe told the BBC that if Sir Philip chose to use his personal wealth to plug the hole in the Arcadia pension pot, that would ensure workers enrolled in the scheme receive their full pension. But Mr Ralfe said even if the retail magnate did not do that - or if he writes a cheque that is substantially less than Â£350m - Arcadia workers should still receive most of their pension entitlement through the Pension Protection Fund. ""The good news is the government has a lifeboat - the Pension Protection Fund - which is designed to make sure that people get compensation if their company goes bust,"" he said. ""The compensation they get isn't the full 100% of the pension promise they were expecting, but it's not far short."" Sir Philip with his wife Lady Green are worth Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List Mr Ralfe has previously said Sir Philip seemed to have ""learnt his lesson"" from the pension scandal involving BHS a few years ago. Sir Philip sold the now-defunct department store to businessman Dominic Chappell in 2015 for Â£1, but a year later it collapsed. Around 11,000 people lost their jobs and the company was found to have a pension deficit of Â£571m. Sir Philip later reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator - which accused him of selling BHS to avoid responsibility for the deficit - to inject Â£363m into the scheme. Commentators say the situation with Arcadia is very different and point to the fact that last year Lady Green agreed to pump Â£100m into Arcadia's two pension schemes over three years. Labour's Stephen Timms said he will write a letter to the Pensions Regulator on Monday, ""to underline the importance of securing the interests of [Arcadia Group's] pension scheme members"". The Pension Regulator and the Pension Protection Fund are understood to be staying closely informed of decisions affecting Arcadia Group. There are fears Arcadia's expected collapse could affect the future of Debenhams The imminent collapse of Arcadia could also have implications for Debenhams, scuppering a potential sale of the department store chain to JD Sports. Arcadia is the biggest concession in Debenhams, accounting for around Â£75m of sales. JD Sports had been closing in on a rescue deal to buy Debenhams, which is currently in administration for the second time in a year. It has already cut some 6,500 jobs since May. Debenhams now has around 12,000 employees across 124 stores. According to a source close to the JD Sports, the appointment of administrators to Arcadia would give the company ""more to think about"". A final decision is expected within days.

"""Imminent threats"" have been made against two journalists working for the Sunday World newspaper by loyalist paramilitaries, the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has said. The NUJ said the threats came from the West Belfast Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Amnesty International condemned the threats and called it a ""despicable attempt to intimidate journalists"". Earlier this week, a threat was made againsta Belfast Telegraph journalist. In a statement on Saturday night, Seamus Dooley, the NUJ's assistant general secretary, said it welcomed ""the fact that the journalists concerned have received the full support of their employer"". He added the PSNI is engaged with both journalists. The NUJ said one of its members was contacted in the middle of the night by police and alerted to the threat, while another one of its members was also threatened. Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty International's Northern Ireland programme director, said journalists, and ""particularly those investigating illegal paramilitary and criminal activity"", were operating in ""a climate of fear"".

"Knockwellan Park is a residential area and police said the ""reckless"" pipe bomb attack ""could have injured or killed"" A pipe bomb has exploded in a van in Londonderry in what police have described as a ""reckless attack"". Police were called to Knockwellan Park in the Waterside area just before 22:00 GMT on Saturday after a report that the vehicle was in flames. On arrival, ""it became clear that the cause of the fire had been the detonation of a pipe bomb-type device,"" said PSNI Det Sgt Richard Donnell. There were no reports of any injuries. However, parts of the device remained at the scene after the fire so the area was cordoned off and Army experts were deployed to make it safe. They recovered the remnants of the device and took them away further forensic examination. The operation continued until 02:00 GMT on Sunday. ""This was a reckless attack carried out in a residential area with no consideration given as to who this device could have injured or killed,"" said Det Sgt Donnell. He said those responsible were ""a danger to us all"" and he appealed anyone with information about the incident to contact police. Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said the attack was a ""moronic"" attempt to ""intimidate and kill in our community"". In a tweet, the SDLP leader added: ""The people of Derry do not want this mindless violence. Stop now."" Sinn FÃ©in's Martina Anderson said it was the latest in ""a series of attacks"" in the area this year, and PSNI should ""step up its effort to bring these criminal gangs to book"". The Foyla MLA added: ""Those behind this attack have nothing to offer the community and need to end these reckless actions immediately.""

"Sarah Fuller played with an inspirational message on her helmet Sarah Fuller has become the first woman to play in a Power 5 match - the elite level of collegiate American football. Fuller, 21, took to the field for the Vanderbilt Commodores as a placekicker in a road game against the Missouri Tigers in the city of Columbia. ""I just want to tell all the girls out there that you can do anything you set your mind to,"" she said afterwards. Fuller was called in because many players were self-isolating due to the coronavirus outbreak in the US. During Saturday's match, which her team lost 41-0,she wore a helmet with the slogan Play Like A Girl on the back,external- in support of a non-profit group encouraging girls to play sports. The female American Football coach breaking barriers on and off the pitch Arizona Cardinals appoint NFL's first female coach ""History made,"" tweeted the Southeastern Conference (SEC), showing the moment Fuller stepped on to the pitch to kick off at the start of the second half. There was some social media criticism at the length of the kick but coach Derek Mason said it was an executed plan - a squib kick intended to prevent a return. Given the score, it was her only opportunity. The Power 5 refers to five conferences, including the SEC, considered the elite of collegiate football. The SEC has 14 university teams. College football is massive in the US, supplying the vast majority of players who go on to the NFL. Several women have appeared at lower levels of collegiate football.

"Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said Serbia wants to extend the hand of friendship Serbia has rescinded its decision to expel the Montenegrin ambassador following a row over a historical dispute dating back more than a century. Serbia expelled Montenegrin ambassador, Tarzan Milosevic, after Montenegro gave Serbia's envoy 72 hours to leave. Montenegro accused Vladimir Bozovic of ""interfering in Montenegro's internal affairs"". Relations between the two nations have been tense for much of the past year. On Sunday, Serbia's Prime Minister Ana Brnabic revoked the decision to expel Mr Milosevic and said her country wanted to extend ""the hand of cooperation and friendship"" to Montenegro. Serbia's envoy, Mr Bozovic, was expelled after he described a decision by Montenegrin authorities in 1918 to unify with Serbia as a ""liberation"". The 1918 assembly ruled that Montenegro would become part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was later known as Yugoslavia. In 2006, Montenegro declared independence, becoming a sovereign state for the first time since the end of the First World War. Mr Bozovic made the comments at a meeting of an association representing Montenegrin Serbs. He described the decision in 1918 as a ""free expression of people's will to unite with fraternal Serbia"". Montenegro's incoming Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapic criticised the current government's decision and accused it of trying to deepen divisions between ethnic Serbs and Montenegrins. Mr Krivokapic, will lead a coalition of pro-Serb parties and is set to take office this week.

"Willie Anderson in his element in snow high in the Cairngorms Just over 40 years ago, a teacher from Drumchapel in Glasgow joined a mountain rescue team frequently faced with some of the toughest terrain and weather conditions in Scotland. Willie Anderson is brutally honest about his lack of abilities when he volunteered to join Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team. He had been drawn to the Highlands by the beauty of its mountains, hills and glens and, though a keen hillwalker, he had no experience of the arctic-like conditions of a full Scottish winter high in the Cairngorms. ""I wasn't a mountaineer,"" he said. ""I didn't have the greatest of gear, it was old boots and old mitts. I think I was the worst mountaineer in the team at the time. I might have even been the worst in Scotland."" But following hard training, Willie went on to be involved in more than 1,600 rescues and was team leader for 13 years, until standing down from the role this summer. Climbers rescued in 'ferocious weather' Willie, now 64, moved from Glasgow to the Highlands in 1978 to take up a technical studies teaching post at Kingussie High School. He had been offered jobs at city schools but turned them down to work and live in the Cairngorms. ""I had been going to the hills with a mate of mine who worked as a shepherd,"" said Willie. ""That was when I first saw the beauty of the Highlands, and thought I really wanted to live there. ""When the job came up at Kingussie in '78 I moved up and have been here ever since. I joined the rescue team the following winter."" Willie continues to be a volunteer at Cairngorm MRT after a 13-year stint as team leader Willie was inspired to volunteer after hearing stories told in the local pub by John Allen, Cairngorm's leader for many years. ""It sounded exciting, the blizzards, the snow and the difficulty of carrying a stretcher,"" said Willie. John put Willie's name forward to the team and he was accepted. ""At the time the hills were getting quite busy and rescue teams needed more members to keep up with demand,"" Willie said. Scottish mountain rescue was also undergoing changes at the time, with moves towards more formal training and set-ups. ""When I joined rescues were being done by gamekeepers and shepherds, anyone the police could get off the streets and muster,"" Willie said. ""But the authorities were becoming aware that people were pushing the limits, going further into the hills and climbing harder, and there were more and more accidents. It was acknowledged rescue teams had to be more professional."" Team members in arctic conditions in the Cairngorms While Willie did not lack any enthusiasm for mountain rescue, he admitted he did fall short in skills when he first volunteered. He did not take part in a rescue until he had served an ""apprenticeship"" - training in navigation and the use of crampons and an ice axe. He also spent time with experienced climbers in winter conditions in the hills. He can still vividly recall his first call-out following his probation. It involved a military officer who had been night-time skiing on Braeriach, Britain's third highest mountain, and skied off the edge of the mountain into the  Lairig Ghru pass. Willie said: ""We went out the next day to look for him. ""It was a beautiful day and there were two aircraft involved, which was unusual but was due to him being in the military. ""We eventually found him. It was the first time I had seen a dead person."" ""When it's brutal it is absolutely brutal,"" says Willie of how bad conditions can be He said the hardest call-outs have involved the deaths of children and young students. A father himself, he said: ""They've not done anything wrong. They are just trying to experience the great outdoors and improve their own personal life skills and then they have an accident."" The reward for the team is the look of relief in the faces of those they manage to help from difficult situations. Willie said: ""They have looked the Grim Reaper in the eye and then the cavalry arrives. It's a great feeling."" Team training on a calm cold day in the hills But the Cairngorms can be unforgiving terrain - especially in winter when winds can reach gusts of 120mph - challenging even the most experienced mountaineers. ""At times it be can truly arctic,"" said Willie. ""People come here to train for arctic expeditions and for climbing the Himalayas. ""The wind is the thing. That really is the killer. It saps all your energy. It will blow you off your feet, and there have been times we have been on our hands and knees trying to get to people who are injured. ""When it is brutal it's absolutely brutal and unfortunately it can kill you."" Still, there are other times in the Cairngorms when Willie is reminded of why he moved to the Highlands. ""Some of the nights up there when it's calm and crystal clear and the moon and the stars are out and you've got beautiful snow, it's a winter wonderland.""

"England's new Covid tier system has a ""sunset"" expiry date of 3 February, Boris Johnson has told MPs in a bid to prevent a Commons rebellion. The current lockdown ends on Wednesday, and many Tory MPs are unhappy with the toughened tiers that will replace it. MPs will vote on the system on Tuesday, with Labour undecided on its stance. In a letter to MPs, the PM said rules could be eased in December, MPs could vote again in January, and the tier system could end in February. And writing separately in theMail on Sunday,external, Mr Johnson said he believed Easter would mark a ""real chance to return to something like life as normal"". He warned, however, there would be ""disastrous consequences"" for the NHS if the government did not introduce the new tiered system when lockdown ends. Has England's lockdown worked? Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? England's new system will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. In a bid to quell MPs' concerns, Mr Johnson wrote to them outlining a timeline of when - and how - the tiered approach will end. In his letter, Mr Johnson said: Regulations have a ""sunset"" clause - or expiry date - of 3 February Tiers will be reviewed every two weeks, and areas can move down the tiers from 16 December At the end of January, MPs will have another vote on the tiered approach and decide whether measures stay in place until the end of March The government will publish the circumstances that need to change for an area to move down a tier In his letter to the public, the prime minister urged people to support the new system and ""work together"" with tiering, testing and vaccines. He said: ""We can't blow it now. We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight. ""We have worked too hard, lost too many, sacrificed too much, just to see our efforts incinerated in another volcanic eruption of the virus."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr that having a tiered approach ""allows us to have these localised restrictions"". He said there was a ""risk"" of a third wave ""if we don't get the balance right."" Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News whether the government was looking at breaking counties into smaller areas for the tiers, given differences in rates of the virus within tier areas, Mr Raab said the measures would be reviewed every two weeks. ""But the problem is you've got to get the geographic size sufficiently effective that you don't find the smaller enclaves of lower level virus shooting up because they are not subject to the restrictions in the high levels around them,"" he said. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr that her party's support of the government's coronavirus restrictions was ""not unconditional"" and they ""will act in the public interest"". ""We need to know first of all that these measures are tough enough to get control of the virus, otherwise what we are asking businesses to do is go through significant pain, people laid off, some businesses at risk of collapsing, without being able to show that this is worth it."" She added that there also needed to be ""proper support"" in place. Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Irelandhas begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotlandeach area has been placed in one of five tiers. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and barswill be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas.They will come into force from Friday, 4 December. Conservative rebels were increasingly confident that they could demolish Boris Johnson's majority of 80 on Tuesday when the Commons votes on the proposed three tiers of restrictions in England. That would make the PM reliant on Labour votes to get his measures through - and the opposition hasn't yet committed to backing him. So, on Saturday night, there was a dramatic intervention to try to defuse the revolt. In the letter to his MPs, Mr Johnson - in effect - pleads with them to give him the benefit of the doubt this week, in return for a new vote on the restrictions at the end of January. If the government were to lose that vote, restrictions would end on 3 February. He also seeks to reassure them that the review of restrictions on 16 December will be genuine, so it's possible some areas could move down a tier before Christmas But one potential rebel, the former minister Tim Loughton told the BBC that the PM would have to do more to win him over. He said: ""We asked for a lot of information and that letter doesn't contain it. So unless we get it by Tuesday... then it doesn't change anything I'm afraid."" It's still possible Mr Johnson's new promises will sway some waverers, though a major rebellion may simply be postponed rather than avoided entirely. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Conservative Damian Green, MP for Ashford in Kent - a tier 3 area - said he would vote against the restrictions on Tuesday. He said that in Kent there was ""an extraordinary divergence in Covid rates"" and there was ""no logic"" in putting the whole county in the same tier. ""The new approach punishes rural areas next to large towns or cities and is bound to reduce public acceptance of these restrictions,"" he said. Tory MP Steve Baker said he wanted to see the data the government was basing its new system on. Hetweeted,externalthat MPs were ""glad to share in the burden of decision"", but added: ""That's why we need the information necessary to show the government's restrictions will do more good than harm, in full and in time."" Butwriting in the Sunday Times,external, England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries warned: ""If we relax our guard and the virus spreads too quickly then all the hard-won progress will be undone.""

"England's new Covid tier system has a ""sunset"" expiry date of 3 February, Boris Johnson has told MPs in a bid to prevent a Commons rebellion. The current lockdown ends on Wednesday, and many Tory MPs are unhappy with the toughened tiers that will replace it. MPs will vote on the system on Tuesday, with Labour undecided on its stance. In a letter to MPs, the PM said rules could be eased in December, MPs could vote again in January, and the tier system could end in February. And writing separately in theMail on Sunday,external, Mr Johnson said he believed Easter would mark a ""real chance to return to something like life as normal"". He warned, however, there would be ""disastrous consequences"" for the NHS if the government did not introduce the new tiered system when lockdown ends. Has England's lockdown worked? Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? England's new system will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. In a bid to quell MPs' concerns, Mr Johnson wrote to them outlining a timeline of when - and how - the tiered approach will end. In his letter, Mr Johnson said: Regulations have a ""sunset"" clause - or expiry date - of 3 February Tiers will be reviewed every two weeks, and areas can move down the tiers from 16 December At the end of January, MPs will have another vote on the tiered approach and decide whether measures stay in place until the end of March The government will publish the circumstances that need to change for an area to move down a tier In his letter to the public, the prime minister urged people to support the new system and ""work together"" with tiering, testing and vaccines. He said: ""We can't blow it now. We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight. ""We have worked too hard, lost too many, sacrificed too much, just to see our efforts incinerated in another volcanic eruption of the virus."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr that having a tiered approach ""allows us to have these localised restrictions"". He said there was a ""risk"" of a third wave ""if we don't get the balance right."" Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News whether the government was looking at breaking counties into smaller areas for the tiers, given differences in rates of the virus within tier areas, Mr Raab said the measures would be reviewed every two weeks. ""But the problem is you've got to get the geographic size sufficiently effective that you don't find the smaller enclaves of lower level virus shooting up because they are not subject to the restrictions in the high levels around them,"" he said. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr that her party's support of the government's coronavirus restrictions was ""not unconditional"" and they ""will act in the public interest"". ""We need to know first of all that these measures are tough enough to get control of the virus, otherwise what we are asking businesses to do is go through significant pain, people laid off, some businesses at risk of collapsing, without being able to show that this is worth it."" She added that there also needed to be ""proper support"" in place. Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Irelandhas begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotlandeach area has been placed in one of five tiers. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and barswill be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas.They will come into force from Friday, 4 December. Conservative rebels were increasingly confident that they could demolish Boris Johnson's majority of 80 on Tuesday when the Commons votes on the proposed three tiers of restrictions in England. That would make the PM reliant on Labour votes to get his measures through - and the opposition hasn't yet committed to backing him. So, on Saturday night, there was a dramatic intervention to try to defuse the revolt. In the letter to his MPs, Mr Johnson - in effect - pleads with them to give him the benefit of the doubt this week, in return for a new vote on the restrictions at the end of January. If the government were to lose that vote, restrictions would end on 3 February. He also seeks to reassure them that the review of restrictions on 16 December will be genuine, so it's possible some areas could move down a tier before Christmas But one potential rebel, the former minister Tim Loughton told the BBC that the PM would have to do more to win him over. He said: ""We asked for a lot of information and that letter doesn't contain it. So unless we get it by Tuesday... then it doesn't change anything I'm afraid."" It's still possible Mr Johnson's new promises will sway some waverers, though a major rebellion may simply be postponed rather than avoided entirely. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Conservative Damian Green, MP for Ashford in Kent - a tier 3 area - said he would vote against the restrictions on Tuesday. He said that in Kent there was ""an extraordinary divergence in Covid rates"" and there was ""no logic"" in putting the whole county in the same tier. ""The new approach punishes rural areas next to large towns or cities and is bound to reduce public acceptance of these restrictions,"" he said. Tory MP Steve Baker said he wanted to see the data the government was basing its new system on. Hetweeted,externalthat MPs were ""glad to share in the burden of decision"", but added: ""That's why we need the information necessary to show the government's restrictions will do more good than harm, in full and in time."" Butwriting in the Sunday Times,external, England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries warned: ""If we relax our guard and the virus spreads too quickly then all the hard-won progress will be undone."" She said that once the lockdown ends in England ""there is no other way to keep the virus under control"", urging people to ""hold on a little longer"". On Saturday, a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030.

"Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said Serbia wants to extend the hand of friendship Serbia has rescinded its decision to expel the Montenegrin ambassador following a row over a historical dispute dating back more than a century. Serbia expelled Montenegrin ambassador, Tarzan Milosevic, after Montenegro gave Serbia's envoy 72 hours to leave. Montenegro accused Vladimir Bozovic of ""interfering in Montenegro's internal affairs"". Relations between the two nations have been tense for much of the past year. On Sunday, Serbia's Prime Minister Ana Brnabic revoked the decision to expel Mr Milosevic and said her country wanted to extend ""the hand of cooperation and friendship"" to Montenegro. Serbia's envoy, Mr Bozovic, was expelled after he described a decision by Montenegrin authorities in 1918 to unify with Serbia as a ""liberation"". The 1918 assembly ruled that Montenegro would become part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was later known as Yugoslavia. In 2006, Montenegro declared independence, becoming a sovereign state for the first time since the end of the First World War. Mr Bozovic made the comments at a meeting of an association representing Montenegrin Serbs. He described the decision in 1918 as a ""free expression of people's will to unite with fraternal Serbia"". Montenegro's incoming Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapic criticised the current government's decision and accused it of trying to deepen divisions between ethnic Serbs and Montenegrins. Mr Krivokapic, will lead a coalition of pro-Serb parties and is set to take office this week. He says his new administration will ""promote a good-neighbour policy with Belgrade"" based on ""non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries"".

"Willie Anderson in his element in snow high in the Cairngorms Just over 40 years ago, a teacher from Drumchapel in Glasgow joined a mountain rescue team frequently faced with some of the toughest terrain and weather conditions in Scotland. Willie Anderson is brutally honest about his lack of abilities when he volunteered to join Cairngorm Mountain Rescue Team. He had been drawn to the Highlands by the beauty of its mountains, hills and glens and, though a keen hillwalker, he had no experience of the arctic-like conditions of a full Scottish winter high in the Cairngorms. ""I wasn't a mountaineer,"" he said. ""I didn't have the greatest of gear, it was old boots and old mitts. I think I was the worst mountaineer in the team at the time. I might have even been the worst in Scotland."" But following hard training, Willie went on to be involved in more than 1,600 rescues and was team leader for 13 years, until standing down from the role this summer. Climbers rescued in 'ferocious weather' Willie, now 64, moved from Glasgow to the Highlands in 1978 to take up a technical studies teaching post at Kingussie High School. He had been offered jobs at city schools but turned them down to work and live in the Cairngorms. ""I had been going to the hills with a mate of mine who worked as a shepherd,"" said Willie. ""That was when I first saw the beauty of the Highlands, and thought I really wanted to live there. ""When the job came up at Kingussie in '78 I moved up and have been here ever since. I joined the rescue team the following winter."" Willie continues to be a volunteer at Cairngorm MRT after a 13-year stint as team leader Willie was inspired to volunteer after hearing stories told in the local pub by John Allen, Cairngorm's leader for many years. ""It sounded exciting, the blizzards, the snow and the difficulty of carrying a stretcher,"" said Willie. John put Willie's name forward to the team and he was accepted. ""At the time the hills were getting quite busy and rescue teams needed more members to keep up with demand,"" Willie said. Scottish mountain rescue was also undergoing changes at the time, with moves towards more formal training and set-ups. ""When I joined rescues were being done by gamekeepers and shepherds, anyone the police could get off the streets and muster,"" Willie said. ""But the authorities were becoming aware that people were pushing the limits, going further into the hills and climbing harder, and there were more and more accidents. It was acknowledged rescue teams had to be more professional."" Team members in arctic conditions in the Cairngorms While Willie did not lack any enthusiasm for mountain rescue, he admitted he did fall short in skills when he first volunteered. He did not take part in a rescue until he had served an ""apprenticeship"" - training in navigation and the use of crampons and an ice axe. He also spent time with experienced climbers in winter conditions in the hills. He can still vividly recall his first call-out following his probation. It involved a military officer who had been night-time skiing on Braeriach, Britain's third highest mountain, and skied off the edge of the mountain into the  Lairig Ghru pass. Willie said: ""We went out the next day to look for him. ""It was a beautiful day and there were two aircraft involved, which was unusual but was due to him being in the military. ""We eventually found him. It was the first time I had seen a dead person."" ""When it's brutal it is absolutely brutal,"" says Willie of how bad conditions can be He said the hardest call-outs have involved the deaths of children and young students. A father himself, he said: ""They've not done anything wrong. They are just trying to experience the great outdoors and improve their own personal life skills and then they have an accident."" The reward for the team is the look of relief in the faces of those they manage to help from difficult situations. Willie said: ""They have looked the Grim Reaper in the eye and then the cavalry arrives. It's a great feeling."" Team training on a calm cold day in the hills But the Cairngorms can be unforgiving terrain - especially in winter when winds can reach gusts of 120mph - challenging even the most experienced mountaineers. ""At times it be can truly arctic,"" said Willie. ""People come here to train for arctic expeditions and for climbing the Himalayas. ""The wind is the thing. That really is the killer. It saps all your energy. It will blow you off your feet, and there have been times we have been on our hands and knees trying to get to people who are injured. ""When it is brutal it's absolutely brutal and unfortunately it can kill you."" Still, there are other times in the Cairngorms when Willie is reminded of why he moved to the Highlands. ""Some of the nights up there when it's calm and crystal clear and the moon and the stars are out and you've got beautiful snow, it's a winter wonderland.""

"Peak rail fares should be suspended over Christmas and mass testing should be provided for transport workers to avoid travel ""chaos"" when restrictions ease, Labour has said. Three households in the UK will be able to form a ""bubble"" from 23-27 December. A surge in travel is expected and Labour wants a ""comprehensive travel plan"" presented to Parliament. Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy has been appointed to assess how prepared road and rail networks are. The Department for Transport said on Friday thatplans are being preparedto reduce disruption on roads and railways, including 500 miles of roadworks being cleared and extended train timetables. Labour has warned that more than two million people travelled by train between Christmas and New Year in previous years, plus millions more by car. It said suspended peak fares between 23 and 27 December would reduce the risk of overcrowding on trains either side of peak hours. Train staff, bus drivers and highway personnel should also be mass tested, Labour said. Travelling at Christmas: What you need to know New road and rail plans for Christmas travel spike How many people can get together at Christmas? Shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""This is too important for the government to ignore or leave until the last minute. This is about protecting lives and livelihoods."" Labour also argued that planned engineering works on the East Coast Mainline - which will close London King's Cross station for six days from Christmas Day - should be delayed from 27 December. And it said Highways England should postpone non-essential road maintenance to reduce congestion and travel delays. Melanie Clarke, customer service director for Highways England, said the ""current plan"" was to remove ""non-essential"" roadworks from 20 December to 4 January 2021. The Department for Transport said it will publish measures aimed at easing travel disruption next week, and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has urged people to plan their journeys ""very carefully"". The start and the end of the five-day travel window is expected to be very busy. Cheaper advance train tickets went on sale on Friday for Christmas travel, about eight weeks later than usual because of delays in finalising timetables during the pandemic.

""I just want to tell all the girls out there that you can do anything you set your mind to,"" she said afterwards. Fuller was called in because many players were self-isolating due to the coronavirus outbreak in the US.

The female American Football coach breaking barriers on and off the pitch Arizona Cardinals appoint NFL's first female coach ""History made,"" tweeted the Southeastern Conference (SEC), showing the moment Fuller stepped on to the pitch to kick off at the start of the second half. There was some social media criticism at the length of the kick but coach Derek Mason said it was an executed plan - a squib kick intended to prevent a return. Given the score, it was her only opportunity. The Power 5 refers to five conferences, including the SEC, considered the elite of collegiate football. The SEC has 14 university teams. College football is massive in the US, supplying the vast majority of players who go on to the NFL. Several women have appeared at lower levels of collegiate football.

"Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said Serbia wants to extend the hand of friendship Serbia has rescinded its decision to expel the Montenegrin ambassador following a row over a historical dispute dating back more than a century. Serbia expelled Montenegrin ambassador, Tarzan Milosevic, after Montenegro gave Serbia's envoy 72 hours to leave. Montenegro accused Vladimir Bozovic of ""interfering in Montenegro's internal affairs"". Relations between the two nations have been tense for much of the past year. On Sunday, Serbia's Prime Minister Ana Brnabic revoked the decision to expel Mr Milosevic and said her country wanted to extend ""the hand of cooperation and friendship"" to Montenegro. Serbia's envoy, Mr Bozovic, was expelled after he described a decision by Montenegrin authorities in 1918 to unify with Serbia as a ""liberation"". The 1918 assembly ruled that Montenegro would become part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was later known as Yugoslavia. In 2006, Montenegro declared independence, becoming a sovereign state for the first time since the end of the First World War. Mr Bozovic made the comments at a meeting of an association representing Montenegrin Serbs. He described the decision in 1918 as a ""free expression of people's will to unite with fraternal Serbia"". Montenegro's incoming Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapic criticised the current government's decision and accused it of trying to deepen divisions between ethnic Serbs and Montenegrins. Mr Krivokapic, will lead a coalition of pro-Serb parties and is set to take office this week. He says his new administration will ""promote a good-neighbour policy with Belgrade"" based on ""non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries"".

"Police urged people to leave central London after the protest More than 150 people have been arrested during anti-lockdown protests in London's West End. The group Save Our Rights UK said it held the protest, which started from Marble Arch on Saturday afternoon. The Metropolitan Police said it had been a ""challenging day"" for its officers. It said it made arrests for a number of different offences, including breaching coronavirus restrictions, assaulting a police officer and illegal drugs. Police officers urged protesters to leave the demonstration and return home Police officers were booed and met with chants of ""shame on you"" as protesters, many not wearing face masks, ignored requests to leave. Earlier protesters, including some dressed as Christmas elves, brandished signs reading ""All I want for Christmas is my freedom back"", ""Ditch the face masks"" and ""Stop controlling us"". They had earlier been warned by police that protests were not acceptable exemptions to the ban on gathering under current coronavirus regulations in England. The protest had started at Marble Arch and protesters moved to Oxford Street Groups of police officers were seen running towards protesters in Oxford Circus, Carnaby Street and Regent Street. Traffic was temporarily blocked as officers tried to handcuff people on the ground in the middle of the road. Disorder was reported in central London, including in Oxford Circus, Carnaby Street and Regent Street Protests are not permitted under current coronavirus regulations in England Civil rights groups Liberty and Big Brother Watch have argued that the right to safely protest should be explicitly outlined as an exemption in regulations covering England's tiered restrictions, which are due to come into force next week. The Met said coaches taking protesters into London had earlier been intercepted and those who did not turn back and go home were either arrested or given fines. Ch Supt Stuart Bell, policing commander for the event, said: ""This was a challenging day for Met, City of London and British Transport Police officers and I would like to thank them for the professionalism they have shown throughout the day. ""On Friday, we made it very clear how we would police this event, warning those looking to attend that they risked facing enforcement action if they attended a gathering in London. ""Today's enforcement action is a direct result of those individuals deliberately breaking the law and at times, targeting our officers with aggression and causing disruption to the road network."" The Metropolitan Police said people were arrested for various offences, including breaching coronavirus restrictions Responding to the anti-lockdown protests, Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""We've seen our police officers yet again do incredible work to ensure that they help to stop the spread of this awful virus. ""The people that are protesting today have been protesting for many months, and we've seen this over successive weekends."" She added: ""We ask everybody to be conscientious - we all know the regulations and the guidance, we have brought these measures in to save lives and to prevent preventable deaths."" It comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030. There were also a further 15,871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours.

"England's new Covid tier system has a ""sunset"" expiry date of 3 February, Boris Johnson has told MPs in a bid to prevent a Commons rebellion. The current lockdown ends on Wednesday, and many Tory MPs are unhappy with the toughened tiers that will replace it. MPs will vote on the system on Tuesday, with Labour undecided on its stance. In a letter to MPs, the PM said rules could be eased in December, MPs could vote again in January, and the tier system could end in February. And writing separately in theMail on Sunday,external, Mr Johnson said he believed Easter would mark a ""real chance to return to something like life as normal"". He warned, however, there would be ""disastrous consequences"" for the NHS if the government did not introduce the new tiered system when lockdown ends. Has England's lockdown worked? Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? England's new system will see regions placed in one of three tiers: medium, high and very high. In total, 99% of England will enter the highest two tiers, with tight restrictions on bars and restaurants and a ban on households mixing indoors. Only Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly will be in the lowest tier. In a bid to quell MPs' concerns, Mr Johnson wrote to them outlining a timeline of when - and how - the tiered approach will end. In his letter, Mr Johnson said: Regulations have a ""sunset"" clause - or expiry date - of 3 February Tiers will be reviewed every two weeks, and areas can move down the tiers from 16 December At the end of January, MPs will have another vote on the tiered approach and decide whether measures stay in place until the end of March The government will publish the circumstances that need to change for an area to move down a tier In his letter to the public, the prime minister urged people to support the new system and ""work together"" with tiering, testing and vaccines. He said: ""We can't blow it now. We can't just throw it all away - not when freedom is in sight. ""We have worked too hard, lost too many, sacrificed too much, just to see our efforts incinerated in another volcanic eruption of the virus."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr that having a tiered approach ""allows us to have these localised restrictions"". He said there was a ""risk"" of a third wave ""if we don't get the balance right."" Asked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News whether the government was looking at breaking counties into smaller areas for the tiers, given differences in rates of the virus within tier areas, Mr Raab said the measures would be reviewed every two weeks. ""But the problem is you've got to get the geographic size sufficiently effective that you don't find the smaller enclaves of lower level virus shooting up because they are not subject to the restrictions in the high levels around them,"" he said. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr that her party's support of the government's coronavirus restrictions was ""not unconditional"" and they ""will act in the public interest"". ""We need to know first of all that these measures are tough enough to get control of the virus, otherwise what we are asking businesses to do is go through significant pain, people laid off, some businesses at risk of collapsing, without being able to show that this is worth it."" She added that there also needed to be ""proper support"" in place. Elsewhere in the UK, Northern Irelandhas begun a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown, while in Scotlandeach area has been placed in one of five tiers. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said pubs, restaurants and barswill be subject to stricter restrictions - which are not yet finalised - in the run-up to Christmas.They will come into force from Friday, 4 December. Conservative rebels were increasingly confident that they could demolish Boris Johnson's majority of 80 on Tuesday when the Commons votes on the proposed three tiers of restrictions in England. That would make the PM reliant on Labour votes to get his measures through - and the opposition hasn't yet committed to backing him. So, on Saturday night, there was a dramatic intervention to try to defuse the revolt. In the letter to his MPs, Mr Johnson - in effect - pleads with them to give him the benefit of the doubt this week, in return for a new vote on the restrictions at the end of January. If the government were to lose that vote, restrictions would end on 3 February. He also seeks to reassure them that the review of restrictions on 16 December will be genuine, so it's possible some areas could move down a tier before Christmas But one potential rebel, the former minister Tim Loughton told the BBC that the PM would have to do more to win him over. He said: ""We asked for a lot of information and that letter doesn't contain it. So unless we get it by Tuesday... then it doesn't change anything I'm afraid."" It's still possible Mr Johnson's new promises will sway some waverers, though a major rebellion may simply be postponed rather than avoided entirely. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Conservative Damian Green, MP for Ashford in Kent - a tier 3 area - said he would vote against the restrictions on Tuesday. He said that in Kent there was ""an extraordinary divergence in Covid rates"" and there was ""no logic"" in putting the whole county in the same tier. ""The new approach punishes rural areas next to large towns or cities and is bound to reduce public acceptance of these restrictions,"" he said. Tory MP Steve Baker said he wanted to see the data the government was basing its new system on. Hetweeted,externalthat MPs were ""glad to share in the burden of decision"", but added: ""That's why we need the information necessary to show the government's restrictions will do more good than harm, in full and in time."" Butwriting in the Sunday Times,external, England's deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries warned: ""If we relax our guard and the virus spreads too quickly then all the hard-won progress will be undone."" She said that once the lockdown ends in England ""there is no other way to keep the virus under control"", urging people to ""hold on a little longer"". On Saturday, a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 58,030.

"The number of officers patrolling French beaches will double from next week to help stop migrants crossing the Channel, the UK's home secretary has announced. It is part of further measures Priti Patel agreed in a meeting with her French counterpart on Saturday. Officers will be aided by ""enhanced"" surveillance, such as drones and radar, to find smugglers and migrants. Thousands of migrants have reached the UK in small boats this year. The Home Office said 59 people on four boats crossed the Channel on Friday. Migrants wrapped in blankets reach Dover Why can't the UK stop migrants in small boats? Priti Patel vows to stop illegal Channel crossings Ms Patel said that due to increased French patrols and intelligence sharing ""we are already seeing fewer migrants leaving French beaches"". ""The action we have agreed jointly today goes further, doubling the number of police officers on the ground in France, increasing surveillance and introducing new cutting edge technology, representing a further step forward in our shared mission to make Channel crossings completely unviable,"" she said. In announcing the French patrols, the Home Office did not say how many more officers would be deployed. Ms Patel also said there would be ""a new asylum system"" that is ""firm and fair"" and promised there would be new legislation for that next year. But Saturday's announcement was criticised by Bella Sankey, director of humanitarian charity Detention Action. ""It is an extraordinary mark of failure that the home secretary is announcing with such fanfare that she is rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic,"" she said. This video can not be played Patel also promised there would be legislation for a 'new asylum system' that is 'firm and fair' next year ""No amount of massaging the numbers masks her refusal to take the sensible step of creating a safe and legal route to the UK from northern France, thereby preventing crossings and child deaths. ""Instead she throws taxpayers' money away on more of the same measures that stand no chance of having a significant impact on this dangerous state of affairs."" According to figures collated by the BBC about 8,000 migrants in small boats have been taken into the care of Border Force officials, having reached UK shores or been intercepted in the Channel. That is despite Ms Patel's vow in 2019 to make such journeys an ""infrequent phenomenon"". Analysis: Simon Jones, BBC News There have been a number of deals between Britain and France over the past couple of years to try to bring a halt to these crossings. On each occasion, the two countries pledged to work more closely than ever to tackle the issue. But the number of migrants reaching the UK has continued to rise. The home secretary has been facing calls, not least from her fellow Conservative MPs, to get a grip of the issue. Now she's had to put her hands in her pockets to provide more resources for the French. There will now be real pressure on them to deliver results. In October a Kurdish-Iranian family of fivedied attempting to cross the Channel. The small boat they were heading to the UK in capsized in rough conditions just a few kilometres into its journey. There have been nearly 300 border-related deaths in and around the Channel since 1999, according to a recent report by Mael Galisson, from Gisti, a legal service for asylum seekers in France. At Saturday's meeting, Ms Patel and French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin also agreed on steps to better support migrants arriving in France to find appropriate accommodation ""in order to take them out of the hands of criminal gangs"". They agreed on measures to increase border security at ports in northern and western France to target smugglers and avoid migrant crossings threatening freight traffic. Co-operation between French and UK law enforcement had already stopped about 1,100 migrants from making the dangerous crossing and led to 140 arrests since July, the Home Office said.

"This video can not be played Ethiopia's Tigray conflict: What does it mean for the east Africa region? Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed says government forces are now ""fully in control"" of Mekelle, the capital of the northern Tigray region. He said the army had entered the city in the ""last phase"" of the conflict with the Tigray People's Liberation Front - but details are hard to confirm as there is a communications blackout. The TPLF leader vowed to ""fight... to the last"" in a statement to Reuters. Hundreds have reportedly been killed in the conflict and thousands displaced. It began earlier this month after Mr Abiy announced an operation against the TPLF, the regional party, accusing it of attacking the Ethiopian army's northern command HQ in Mekelle. Federal security forces are now searching for the TPLF leaders. Ethiopian soldiers accused of blocking border with Sudan Why Ethiopia may be marching into guerrilla war Crisis has engulfed Ethiopia. Hereâs what it means The BBC managed to briefly speak to one contact in Mekelle who said that federal soldiers were in the city and he had heard sporadic gunshots on Sunday morning. Some residents had earlier fled to the city's outskirts, he added. Meanwhile, the US embassy in neighbouring Eritrea said six explosions were heard in the capital Asmara late on Saturday. Tigrayan forces have previously fired rockets at Eritrea, which they accuse of backing Ethiopian government forces in the weeks-long conflict. It is not clear if the latest incidents in Asmara are linked to the fighting in Tigray. In a statement on Twitter, Mr Abiy saidthe army was in full control,externalof Mekelle and that this ""marks the completion of the [military's] last phase"". ""I am pleased to share that we have completed and ceased the military operations in the Tigray region,"" he said. The army had released thousands of soldiers taken by the TPLF and was in control of the airport and regional offices, Mr Abiy said, adding that the operation had been carried out with ""due care for citizens"". There have been fears for the safety of the 500,000 people living in the city. Mr Abiy's statement said federal forces would ""continue their task of apprehending TPLF criminals and bring them to the court of law"". Confirming details from Tigray is very hard as telephone and internet lines have been down during the conflict. In a text message to Reuters, TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael did not directly comment on the situation on the ground, but said of the government forces: ""Their brutality can only add [to] our resolve to fight these invaders to the last."" He added: ""This is about defending our right to self-determination."" Mr Debretsion's whereabouts are unknown. A TPLF statement read out on regional Tigray TV said: ""Fascistic bombings have caused civilian deaths and injuries. The Tigray government has vowed that it would take retaliatory actions against the barbaric bombings"". It also accused the Eritrean government of involvement in the attack on Mekelle. Tigray TV and another station from the region are now off air. Analysts say the TPLF could now be preparing to return to the mountains to launch a guerrilla war against the federal government. The UN had warned of possible war crimes if the Ethiopian army attacked Mekelle.

In a meeting on Friday, Mr Abiy told African peace envoys that civilians would be protected. However, there was no mention of potential peace talks and the envoys were not allowed to visit Tigray.

Ethiopia's state-appointed Human Rights Commission has accused a Tigrayan youth group of being behind a massacre this month in which it says more than 600 non-Tigrayan civilians in the town of Mai-Kadra were killed.

When Mr Abiy postponed a national election because of coronavirus in June, relations further deteriorated. The TPLF said the government's mandate to rule had expired, arguing that Mr Abiy had not been tested in a national election. In September the party held its own election, which the government said was ""illegal"".
