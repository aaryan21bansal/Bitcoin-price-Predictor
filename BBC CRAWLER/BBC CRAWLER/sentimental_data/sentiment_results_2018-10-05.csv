"Stephen Coxen had denied the rape charges against him and the case was found not proven in a criminal court A woman has won Â£80,000 in damages from a man who had been cleared of raping her after a night out in Fife. The woman, who cannot be named, had sued Stephen Coxen, who is now 23, from Bury in Greater Manchester. The second year student said she was raped after a night out in St Andrews in 2013 by Mr Coxen, who she had met earlier in the evening. Mr Coxen had denied the charges and in November 2015 a jury found the case against him not proven. But now, in a case understood to be the first of its kind in Scotland, a sheriff in a civil action has ruled Mr Coxen raped the woman, known as Miss M, and demanded he pay damages. The civil action was heard at the Personal Injury Court in Edinburgh. Civil cases require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, with judgements made on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt. Sheriff Robert Weir said the evidence from Miss M, who is now 23, had been ""cogent, compelling and persuasive"". He said that Mr Coxen took advantage of her when she was incapable of giving meaningful consent because of the effects of alcohol. The woman bringing the case was a student at the University of St Andrews The sheriff said Miss M had been distressed and had resisted but Mr Coxen had continued to rape her. He agreed that she should be paid Â£80,000 in damages. Miss M told BBC Scotland it was highly unlikely she would see any of the money as it would be clawed back to pay legal costs. She said: ""The thing that has happened from the civil trial is that people will see the type of person that Stephen Coxen is."" Miss M said: ""After being let down in the criminal process and having such a difficult fight to take the civil action to court in the first place I think shock is the word. ""It's not just me that's been through this journey for the past five years, it has had an impact on my family and friends."" She said did not know whether the sheriff's decision would bring ""closure"" but it was some form of justice. ""It's been a long journey to receive this justice and it is disappointing that it took a civil hearing following a criminal trial but I am obviously very relieved that now someone has listened and acknowledged that the actions of Stephen Coxen were wrong and unlawful."" Mr Coxen's lawyer, Mark Thorley, said: ""He (Stephen Coxen) is considering the judgement and will look at his options thereafter."" The personal injury court judgment follows a seven-day hearing in June. The sheriff heard that Mr Coxen, who was then 18, had driven up from Manchester in September 2013 to visit a friend who was beginning his second year at St Andrews University. Mr Coxen met Miss M, who was an 18-year-old student, at the Lizard Lounge in the town. The judgment said she had been drinking heavily at a party but was still able to gain entry to the club at about midnight. At some point after her arrival, she is reported to have been seen kissing with Mr Coxen in the club's smoking lounge. Mr Coxen is then said to have been involved in an altercation and was ejected from the premises close to 2am. Miss M said she could not remember leaving the nightclub and her next memory was standing at the gates outside her flat. She described turning to find that she was with someone and felt panicked because she did not know who the person was. Miss M said she rang the buzzer, hoping that her flatmates would answer. Mr Coxen became frustrated as she ""played for time"", searching in her bag for the house keys. Miss M then dropped her keys and Mr Coxen pushed her away when she tried to pick them up. He unlocked the gate himself and used the keys to gain entry to the flat, where he raped her. Mr Coxen is said to have left the flat soon after. Over the next few months, Miss M is said to have been prescribed a number of different types of medication to deal with depression, panic attacks and sleep disturbance. She reported the attack in January 2014. Mr Coxen denied rape and said they had consensual sex. Simon Di Rollo QC, who represented Miss M during the civil case, said she was an ""extremely courageous woman"". ""It is understandable that she found it impossible to come to terms with the verdict of the jury in the criminal proceedings,"" he said. ""Although the findings by the sheriff in these civil proceedings are of assistance, there can be no doubt that her experience of the criminal justice system was unsatisfactory. ""Unfortunately, that is not as unusual as it should be. I think that everyone must strive to ensure that, so far as is possible, others in the future do not feel as let down as she did.""

The judge in the civil court found the rapes had happened and awarded Ms Clair Â£100,000 damages from the men.

"Danny says losing his mum Christine in 2015 was a key moment in him deciding to tackle his addiction Tens of thousands of people have signed up to a new service from two mobile-only banks designed to help problem gamblers. One former addict says this ""gambling block"", available on the banks' apps, helped him beat his addiction. ""I'd be setting my alarm to wake up at 4am to do a first bet,"" says Danny Cheetham, who began placing bets in his early 20s. ""I'd plan my route to work so I could call in to a bookies which opened early for commuters."" Danny, who is now 29, found himself betting in bookies, on slot machines and online. He gambled a lot on football, which he doesn't even like. He began relying on overtime from work and on payday loans. In the course of eight years, Danny, who's from Stockport, estimates he lost more than Â£50,000. He sunk into depression and moved in with his dad as he could not afford to pay rent. It was the death of his mum Christine in 2015 that he says was the turning point for him - but he was not able to kick his habit until he signed up to a gambling block with his bank, Monzo. The so-called challenger bank is a mobile-only version of a traditional bank. Once the block is activated by the customer, it can spot any transaction that person might try to make with bookmakers - either online or in a shop - by using merchant category codes. It instantly stops the transaction from happening, before any money has left that customer's account. If a customer is tempted to place a bet in the heat of the moment, there is a 48-hour cooling-off period before the block is switched off.  There is also a daily limit on cash withdrawals. 430,000 problem gamblers in Britain Two million people ""at risk"" Harm can include higher levels of physical and mental illness, debt problems, relationship breakdown and, in some cases, criminality Source:Gambling Commission,external Monzo CEO Tom Blomfield says the block was introduced because customers asked for it. ""We have a team of people who work with vulnerable customers and they were getting this feedback quite often"" he says. More than 25,000 customers have signed up to the bank's block since it went live in June. ""Not all of those were problem gamblers [but] about 8,000 people did have a history of gambling,"" says Mr Blomfield. ""We've... seen a 70% decline in their gambling transactions so [it's made] a really big impact."" Another challenger bank, Starling, is offering a similar type of block. It's gained 20,000 users since its launch in June. Danny had a promising career as a radio DJ before his addiction took hold and derailed his plans The Royal College of Psychiatrists is calling on the big five high street banks - Lloyds, Santander, HSBC, RBS Group and Barclays - to offer the same type of service. Doctor Henrietta Bowden-Jones told BBC Radio 4's Money Box: ""If you are unable to access funds, this type of gambling block can save people's homes and their families."" The banks say protecting vulnerable customers is a priority and they are always looking at new ways to do that. The Gambling Commission is talking to financial institutions about how to improve protection for problem gamblers. Danny says he lost more than Â£50,000 but has now beaten his addiction and hopes to be debt-free within a year Three years on from taking his first steps to beat his gambling addiction, Danny says he is happy. ""And I've actually got money in the bank which I never thought I'd have,"" he says. ""I'm well on target to being debt-free by my 30th birthday, which is my next one, and I just don't feel depressed or helpless like I used to."" He says he can now think about his future and - although he will have a bad credit file for up to six years - he says this will give him time to save for a deposit for his own place. ""I just don't feel like it's an endless battle any more."" You can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme on Saturday at 12:00 BST or listen againhere.

"Cern, home to the Large Hadron Collider, was quick to condemn the talk More than 1,600 scientists have so far signed a statement condemning the remarks of the Italian researcher who stated that physics was ""built by men"". Prof Alessandro Strumia presented an analysis to an audience of predominantly young female physicists which he claimed ""proved"" women were less capable at the subject than men. The statement atparticlesforjustice.org,externalsays Prof Strumia's talk was ""fundamentally unsound"" and was ""followed by open discrimination and personal attacks"". In response, Prof Strumia told BBC News that the high-energy physics community was about 100 times bigger than the number that have so far signed the statement. He said that the signatories ""mostly come from those countries more affected by political correctness, which I indicated as the problem. This is what leads to academicians that want (to get) others fired for having 'morally reprehensible' ideas"". The Pisa University-affiliated researchermade his comments - first reported by the BBC - during a workshop at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern)- the lab on the Franco-Swiss border that discovered the Higgs Boson. Cern has since suspended his participation from any activities at the lab. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'We want to be accepted into the club' Four women who changed the face of physics First woman Physics Nobel winner in 55 years Physicists from across the world are continuing to add their names to the statement. ""Strumia's arguments are morally reprehensible,"" it reads. ""Belittling the ability and legitimacy of scientists of colour and white women scientists using such flimsy pretexts is disgraceful, and it reveals a deep contempt for more than half of humanity that clearly comes from some source other than scientific logic."" The workshop at which Prof Strumia was speaking was aimed at helping women to become particle physicists. But the audience of early career researchers was upset and angered by his analysis of published research papers from an online library. He told them that his analysis showed that physics was not sexist against women. Professor Donna Strickland became the first woman in 55 years to win the Nobel prize in Physics earlier this week He produced a series of graphs which, he claimed, demonstrated that women were hired over men whose research had been cited more highly in publications - an indication of higher quality. Prof Strumia also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers before men then overtook women as their careers progressed. In addition, he highlighted behavioural research that he said indicated that the ""assumption that men and women have identical brains is an ideology"". The statement at particlesforjustice.org forensically examines each of the claims and dismisses them. ""Strumia claimed to be proving that there is no discrimination against women, [but] his arguments were rooted in a circumscribed, biased reading of the data available, to the point of promoting a perspective that is biased against women,"" it states. ""The origin and validity of the data he presented have not yet been corroborated, but even if we take it at face value in all cases there are obvious alternative explanations that â¦ are directly in contradiction with his conclusions."" Professor Strumia denied that his use of data was biased. He told the BBC: ""The data about citations and hirings show that women are not discriminated (against) in fundamental physics. We reward merit, irrespective of gender."" The University of Pisa has said that it is considering a disciplinary review of his actions.

"This video can not be played Jason Van Dyke, left, listens as a jury in Chicago delivers its verdict A white police officer who killed a black teenager four years ago in Chicago has been found guilty of second-degree murder. Jason Van Dyke shot Laquan McDonald 16 times, seconds after arriving on the scene, saying he feared for his life as the 17-year-old had a knife. Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder, but has been convicted of the lesser charge. Chicago was braced for protests. The 20 October 2014 shooting sparked outcry. How a Chicago teenager was shot dead Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke, left, was led away in handcuffs after his guilty verdict Van Dyke was also found guilty on all 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm - one count per shot fired. The jury found him not guilty of official misconduct. His bail was revoked and he was taken into custody following the verdict. Van Dyke now faces a minimum of six years in prison and a maximum of over 15 years, with the possibility of probation. The jury of eight women and four men - one African-American, seven white, one Asian-American and three Hispanic - started deliberations on Thursday afternoon. Three other Chicago officers were charged last yearwith allegedly conspiring to cover up the fatal shooting, and they will be tried later this year. Laquan McDonald was 17-years-old when he was shot and killed in October 2014 Mr Van Dyke was arrested in 2015 after dashcam footage appeared to show him fatally shooting Mr McDonald as he moved away from officers, contradicting official accounts. He was the first Chicago officer to be charged with first-degree murder since 1980. According to prosecutors, Mr McDonald was holding a knife with a 3in (7.6cm) blade when he was stopped by police. Police said he had slashed a tyre on a patrol car, resulting in a stand-off between the teenager and officers. Van Dyke was not among the first officers to arrive - the officer who reached the scene first told prosecutors he saw no need to use force on Mr McDonald. Prosecutors say Van Dyke proceeded to open fire on Mr McDonald less than six seconds after he exited his patrol car, and he was the only officer to use his weapon. Mr McDonald still had a pulse when paramedics arrived, but was declared dead in hospital. A protester stands outside court after the guilty verdict in the murder trial of Jason Van Dyke in Chicago Van Dyke pleaded not guilty, with his defence arguing that had the teenager dropped his weapon, the officer would not have opened fire. When he took the stand, he told the jury the teenager had been ""advancing"" on him with the knife, with ""no expression"" on his face and eyes ""bugging out of his head"". Van Dyke said he continued to shoot ""at the knife"" after Mr McDonald was on the ground, because he ""just wanted him to get rid of that knife"". During the three-week trial, the officer was still a member of the Chicago Police Department, though he was suspended without pay pending the outcome. The trial heard from a truck driver, Rudy Barillas, who said he called police after Mr McDonald tried to stab him when he caught the teenager breaking into vehicles. But another witness, Jose Torres, told the court that as he watched Mr Van Dyke open fire on the teenager, he thought to himself: ""Why the eff are they still shooting him when he was on the ground?""

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statement following the jury's verdict: ""As we absorb their decision, let us continue to hear each other and partner with each other."" A judge ordered police to release the dashcam footage in November 2015 after the Democratic city leader's administration fought to withhold the video for a year. The clip resulted in mass protests, culminating with the dismissal of the police chief and a Department of Justice investigation into the Chicago Police Department's use of force. The justice department issued a report last year that found the police had routinely violated the constitutional rights of the city's residents. Police superintendent Garry McCarthy was oustedand the county's top prosecutor, Anita Alvarez, lost her re-election bid amid harsh criticism of her investigation into the incident. In September, ahead of Mr Van Dyke's trial, Mayor Emanuel announced he would not run for re-election.

"Ms Murad and Dr Mukwege made a ""crucial contribution"" to fighting violence against women The 2018 Nobel Peace Prize has gone to campaigners against rape in warfare, Nadia Murad and Denis Mukwege. Ms Murad is an Iraqi Yazidi who was tortured and raped by Islamic State militants and later became the face of a campaign to free the Yazidi people. Dr Mukwege is a Congolese gynaecologist who, along with his colleagues, has treated tens of thousands of victims. Some 331 individuals and organisations were nominated for the prestigious peace award this year. The winners announced in the Norwegian capital Oslo on Friday won the award for their ""efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war"", Berit Reiss-Andersen, the Nobel committee chair, said. DR Congo's 'Doctor Miracle' Enslaved by IS in Iraq Who are the Yazidis? The pair both made a ""crucial contribution to focusing attention on, and combating, such war crimes"", Ms Reiss-Andersen added. Ms Murad, 25, said in a statement that many Yazidis would ""look upon this prize and think of family members that were lost, are still unaccounted for, and of the 1,300 women and children, which remain in captivity"". ""For myself, I think of my mother, who was murdered by DAESH [IS], the children with whom I grew up, and what we must do to honour them,"" she added. ""Persecution of minorities must end. We must work together with determination - to prove that genocidal campaigns will not only fail, but lead to accountability for the perpetrators and justice for the survivors."" New Iraqi President Barham Saleh called the award ""an honour for all Iraqis who fought terrorism and bigotry"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dr Mukwege was operating at his hospital when he heard he had won the prize. ""I was in the operating room so when they started to make noise around [it] I wasn't really thinking about what was going on, and suddenly some people came in and told me the news,"" he told Norwegian newspaper VG. He dedicated his award to all women affected by sexual violence. ""This Nobel prize is a recognition of the suffering and the failure to adequately compensate women who are victims of rape and sexual violence in all countries around the world,"" he told reporters gathered outside his clinic. Ms Murad did not just lose her mother in the genocide. She endured three months as a sex slave at the hands of IS militants. She was bought and sold several times and subjected to sexual and physical abuse during her captivity. After escaping, she became an activist for the Yazidi people, campaigning to help put an end to human trafficking and calling on the world to take a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. Ms Murad described her escape in a BBC interview in 2016, detailing how the women who were held captive were treated by IS. This video can not be played WATCH: Nadia Murad was held captive as a sex slave by so called Islamic State - she tells the BBC's HardTalk how she escaped She was awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Council of Europe in 2016 and called for an international court to judge crimes committed by IS in her acceptance speech in Strasbourg. Ms Murad, the first Iraqi to win the award, was named the UN's first goodwill ambassador for survivors of human trafficking later that year. He has spent decades helping rape victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He and his colleagues are said to have treated about 30,000 rape victims, developing great expertise in the treatment of serious injuries sustained during sex assaults that were carried out as a weapon of war. The 63-year-old has won a number of international prizes, including the 2008 UN Human Rights Prize, and was named African of the Year in 2009. He lives under the permanent protection of UN peacekeepers at his hospital and has also previously called for a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. It was in 1999 that our first rape victim was brought into the hospital. After being raped, bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs. I thought that was a barbaric act of war but the real shock came three months later. Forty-five women came to us with the same story, they were all saying: ""People came into my village and raped me, tortured me."" Other women came to us with burns. They said that after they had been raped, chemicals had been poured on their genitals. Dr Mukwege travelled to northern Iraq in June to visit the Yazidi minority's holiest sites I started to ask myself what was going on. These weren't just violent acts of war, but part of a strategy. You had situations where multiple people were raped at the same time, publicly - a whole village might be raped during the night. In doing this, they hurt not just the victims but the whole community, which they force to watch. The result of this strategy is that people are forced to flee their villages, abandon their fields, their resources, everything. It's very effective. Read how Dr Mukwege went on to help thousands Earlier this weekthe Nobel prize for physics was awarded to Donna Strickland, only the third woman winner of the award and the first in 55 years. The Canadian was honoured along with Arthur Ashkin, from the US, and Gerard Mourou, from France. The Nobel prize for medicine was awarded to two scientists- Professor James P Allison from the US and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan - who discovered how to fight cancer using the body's immune system. For chemistry, the prize was awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in enzyme research.

"Judge Kavanaugh has vehemently denied the allegations made by Prof Christine Blasey Ford The US Senate has narrowly advanced President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to a final vote. Friday's vote - 51-49 in favour - was a test of support for the embattled nominee who has faced sexual assault allegations from several women. All eyes are on several swing senators for Saturday's final vote. Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation would tilt America's highest court in favour of conservatives. The nine-member panel has the final say on issues such as abortion, gun control and voting rules and justices are appointed for life. Allow Twitter content?

Following Friday's vote, Mr Trump tweeted that he was ""very proud"". What did the FBI inquiry into Kavanaugh result in? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words The truth about false assault accusations Hundreds of protesters against Judge Kavanaugh were arrested in Washington DC, on Thursday, including comedian Amy Schumer. After Friday's vote, dozens also were arrested outside Republican Senator Jeff Flake's office. Mr Flake told reporters that unless ""something big"" changes, he will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. This video can not be played Protesters take to Capitol Hill Friday's ""cloture"" vote activated a 30-hour period of discussions in the Senate, which will be followed by the final simple majority vote on Saturday. Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate. But two key swing senators voted against their party colleagues: Republican Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin. Mr Manchin, of West Virginia, represents a traditionally Republican state that Mr Trump won by a landslide. The self-described ""most centrist Democrat"" is also up for re-election this year. This video can not be played Collins: I vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh Ms Murkowski of Alaska, a state that also voted pro-Trump in 2016, has been undecided on Judge Kavanaugh throughout the hearings. She has been lobbied by sexual assault survivors to vote against the judge and represents a state with the highest sex crime rate by far in America,according to FBI data,external. Despite deciding against the nominee on Friday, she told reporters afterwards she has still not made up her mind on the confirmation vote, according to Reuters news agency. Another key Republican senator, Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine, announced that she would vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh on Saturday. This video can not be played 'Ford is a liar': Trump supporters' unequivocal backing for Kavanaugh Given that Republicans have a razor-thin margin of control in the Senate, the party can potentially only afford another defection if it wants to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court - assuming the two swing senators vote the same on Saturday.

On Friday morning, he was reported to be arranging travel back to Washington DC for the final vote. The truth about lie detector tests Are young men in America scared?

Addressing his angry testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he branded the allegations against him an ""orchestrated political hit"", he wrote: ""I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said."" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News The margin of error for confirming Brett Kavanaugh has evaporated. With Lisa Murkowski voting No on a key procedural motion, it seems very likely she will be a No on the final vote, as well. Republicans had one vote among their ranks to spare. Now, unless someone like West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin crosses party lines, they have to hold ranks. Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, whose change of heart prompted the current week-long delay in a final vote, has signalled he's a probable Yes. Republicans might be inclined to keep him comfortably sequestered in a quiet room in the Capitol until tomorrow. That leaves Susan Collins of Maine as the probable deciding vote. She'll announce her intentions later on Friday. If she says she's a Yes, Mr Kavanaugh can start shopping for Supreme Court robes. If she's a No, Saturday will get very interesting. Judge Kavanaugh has faced sexual assault allegations from several women, most prominently Professor Christine Blasey Ford. This video can not be played Christine Blasey Ford said she was ""100%"" sure Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her Both gave public testimony last week in which Prof Ford said she had been assaulted by Judge Kavanaugh when they were both teenagers in 1982. Judge Kavanaugh denied the claim - and allegations that he drank to the point of memory loss at the time - in a feisty confrontation with senators. After the testimony, President Trump agreed to a new FBI inquiry. Why sexual assault survivors forget details Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor Federal agents are believed to have spoken to five witnesses regarding Prof Ford's accusations and another four other witnesses involving a separate accusation by Deborah Ramirez, who said the nominee had exposed himself to her when they were both at Yale University. He denies Ms Ramirez's allegations, too. This video can not be played Feinstein and McConnell have very different views on the FBI report Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans said the new FBI report had cleared their nominee.

"The crucial vote in the Senate was broadcast live The Republican Party finally got the votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. Although that battle is over, the political war is just beginning. Donald Trump's court pick generated a controversy that captured the nation's attention in a way that few political issues do. It generated daily headlines rivalled only by the US quadrennial presidential elections. Now that the bombs have been thrown, it's time to assess the fallout. For most of this year, key indicators have pointed toward a strong Democratic showing in November's mid-term elections. Left-leaning voters, thanks to their anger at the president's policies and rhetorical proclivities, appear to be champing at the bit to have their say at the ballot box. They've been flooding Democratic candidates with political donations. They turned out in record numbers to vote in primaries and special elections across the nation. They're eager, after two years, to take action to wash away the bitterness of the 2016 presidential defeat. Republicans, on the other hand, have seemed less motivated. It's a natural consequence of winning. Those in power, even in good times, can grow complacent. Mr Trump and his team have sought to rally their conservative base in the face of this Democratic onslaught. In February,a White House adviser told Axios,externalthat the president was searching for ""unexpected cultural flashpoints - like the NFL and kneeling - that he can latch onto in person and on Twitter"". In the Kavanaugh fight, and the suggestion that men - fathers, brothers, sons - are at risk of being falsely accused of sexual misconduct, the president may have found his magic bullet. So far, however, all the non-anecdotal evidence for this residesin one recent poll showing the ""enthusiasm gap"",externalbetween Democrats and Republicans that had been a chasm as recently as July had become a statistically non-existent. The story has enthused conservatives In July, according to the Marist/NPR poll, 68% of Republicans said the November mid-terms were ""very important"". In October, the number had climbed to 80%, rivalling the Democrats' 82% mark. The poll also showed that the margin by which the public preferred a Democratic-controlled Congress over a Republican one had shrunk from 12 points in September to six points. The survey has set off a predictable panic among Democrats and probably was part of the reasonMr Trump tweeted on Wednesday,externalabout ""such enthusiasm and energy"" for Mr Kavanaugh. ""Look at the Energy, look at the Polls,"" he wrote. ""Something very big is happening."" It's just one poll. But it has given Republicans a feeling they've missed for quite some time. Hope. A simple guide to the US election The election explained in charts There's been an open question over the last few weeks about what would be better for the Republican Party's mid-term prospects. Conservative advocates warned that if Mr Kavanaugh's nomination crashed, conservative voters would punish the party by staying home on election day. Democrats, on the other hand, feared that an open Supreme Court seat on election day would be extra motivation for Republicans - particularly in the 10 states Trump won in 2016 where incumbent Democratic senators are seeking re-election. At the last presidential election, Republicans stuck by Donald Trump through the ups and downs of the campaign, and he won a larger share of evangelical voters than Mitt Romney did in 2012. The open Supreme Court seat was a big reason why. There were more than a few Democrats who were concerned that a similar trend would replay itself in the coming weeks. Now, however, the court battle is in the rear-view mirror. In recent mid-term elections, voters have tended to be more motivated by opposition - anger at the other party's actions - than an interest in rewarding their own side's good deeds. Perhaps that will change this time around. But, in politics - particularly in the Trump era - a month is an eternity. Why US top court is more political than UK's One thing that is certain is that it hasn't been easy being Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. One of his predecessors, Trent Lott, once compared leading Republicans in the chamber to herding cats. In 2016, Mr McConnell was a regular punching bag for Republican presidential hopefuls who viewed his job performance as too timid or insufficiently canny. In 2017 Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore won the Republican nomination by voicing his opposition to Mr McConnell as the face of the Republican Washington establishment. Mitch McConnell Earlier this year West Virginia coal tycoon Don Blankenship aired television advertisements mocking Mr McConnell as a Washington ""swamp captain"" who ""created millions of jobs for Chinapeople"" as part of his unsuccessful bid for the Republican Senate nomination. After the Kavanaugh confirmation, however, it appears Mr McConnell has renewed standing among his party's grass-roots base. Blankenship had alleged that Mr McConnell had secret ties to drug traffickers and came up with the nickname ""Cocaine Mitch"". That moniker has now beenadopted by Mr McConnell's supporters,external, including former critics, as a way of celebrating the Kentucky senator's bare-knuckle Senate leadership. If Republicans do hold on to their Senate majority in November, Mr McConnell's herd of cats might be a lot easier to manage in the new year.

"Donald Trump has run hot and cold in his attitude toward the controversy swirling around his appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. With a few notable exceptions, he has displayed restraint in attacking Mr Kavanaugh's accusers and those who believe them. One of those exceptions, however, came via Twitter on Friday morning, just before the Senate began a series of votes that will determine Mr Kavanaugh's fate. There's a lot to unpack in this tweet, so let's break it down. In this tweet, Mr Trump takes aim at Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher, the two women who cornered Senator Jeff Flake in a lift last Friday and accused him of ignoring women like them, who are victims of sexual assault. Archila and Gallagher are widely credited for helping to convince the Arizona senator, who had said he would vote for Mr Kavanaugh, into asking for the one-week delay in voting to accommodate an expanded FBI investigation into the accusations. ""I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me,"" Gallagher told Mr Flake. ""I didn't tell anyone, and you're telling all women that they don't matter."" This video can not be played Republican Senator Jeff Flake is challenged by a sexual assault survivor. Now Mr Trump appears to be attempting to not only belittle the two women by labelling them ""elevator screamers,"" but also to question their motivations. Archila is the co-executive director of the New York-based community organising group Center for Popular Democracy. Gallagher, who says she has never been involved in a protest before, is a recent college graduate from New York who currently lives in Washington state. Who were the women confronting Flake? Shortly after Mr Trump fired off his tweet, Archila offered her response. ""No one can pay for someone's lived experiences,""she wrote on Twitter,external. ""The pain, the trauma and the rage that I expressed when I spoke with Senator Jeff Flake in an elevator were my own, and I held it for more than 30 years to protect the people I love from it."" Accusing one's opponents of making organised protests look like a grass-roots movement is a tried and true political tactic. The anti-Kavanaugh protests that have rolled through Washington over the past week have been organised by a variety of liberal advocacy groups, including Move On and Ultraviolet - organisation that includes providing pre-printed signage. This video can not be played Women from both sides of the debate had pre-printed signs Pro-Kavanaugh demonstrators have had their own demonstrations, with their own pre-printed signs. Mass protests very rarely happen organically - they require logistics and planning, and that requires time and money. Tens of millions of dollars has been directed at the Kavanaugh confirmation battle from both sides, a sign of exactly how important a lifetime seat on a sharply divided Supreme Court is to the direction of the US for decades to come. â¢The supreme showdown for Trump's America Here Mr Trump references that long-time bogeyman for the right, billionaire financier George Soros. Like the Koch Brothers for liberals, Soros for conservatives is the incarnation of the deep-pocketed sinister force behind all their opponents' actions. Most Americans probably don't know who Soros is, but for those on the right - particularly those with a predilection for conspiracy-theorising - he's a regular topic of conversation. In fact, Soros does fund numerous progressive causes - to the tune of $10m to political action committees in 2018 alone.It puts him in the higher echelon of political donors,external, although still distant to conservative Sheldon Adelson and progressive Tom Steyer. Soros drew Mr Trump's attention in this case perhaps because he supports the Center for Popular Democracy and Ultraviolet, which not only helped put together the protest but also (in a press release that has since been deleted from their website,external) claimed Archila and Gallagher as members. Profile of George Soros The president closes with another shot at the sign-making proclivities of his opponents. (Twitter's expanded 280-character limit strikes again.) Mr Trump himself has a somewhat complicated relation with the use of paid supporters.His presidential campaign reportedly offered actors $50,externalto cheer at his June 2015 Trump Tower announcement speech. (The campaign apparently also had a pile of ""homemade"" signs to hand out before the event.) At some point, however, Mr Trump's presidential campaign took on a life of its own. It was not uncommon to see roughly-drawn signs and t-shirts at his rallies, while hand-lettered yard displays and billboards dotted the American countryside. This video can not be played 'Ford is a liar': Trump supporters' unequivocal backing for Kavanaugh It was then that candidate Trump first started going after protesters and opponents for having manufactured signs, instead of ones like those presumably made lovingly in basements by his supporters. Now, with this Friday morning fusillade, the president is stoking the fire that has fuelled his base for the past few years. With just over a month until the mid-term elections, Mr Trump has been searching for ways to motivate his supporters in the face of an active and engaged Democrat opposition. Tweeting about unruly protesters funded by shady liberal billionaires who threaten to derail his - and their - political hopes and dreams may be part of his electoral strategy. In 2018, as it was in 2016, it's us-against-them. Deploying the Clinton and Trump playbook Mr Trump has an uncanny ability to come up with memorable labels for his political opponents. He ends his tweet by dusting off ""troublemakers"" - a word last used to describe counter-protesters who clashed with white nationalist demonstrators in the Charlottesville last year. The hashtag is already getting hijacked by women's rights activists, who appear to be embracing the term. ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed #Troublemakers can change the world,""tweeted Alabama Democratic legislator Terri A.

"This video can not be played ""I like beer"": Kavanaugh defends his high school drinking during testimony The Senate has voted to advance US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh to a final confirmation vote on Saturday. It follows an FBI report into several sexual misconduct allegations against him. Last week, at a combative hearing in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the judge denied the allegations and pledged never to give up. It followed testimony from Doctor Christine Blasey Ford, a research psychologist, who said an assault by Mr Kavanaugh 36 years ago had ""drastically"" affected her life. Republican and Democrat senators are divided over the nomination and, with only a 51-49 party split, his confirmation hangs in the balance. If Mr Kavanaugh is confirmed, he could tilt the balance of the Supreme Court in favour of Republicans for decades. Key takeaways from a dramatic hearing Who is Brett Kavanaugh? Moment of reckoning for American women Judges hold the position for life and the nine-member court has the final say on US law, including on contentious social issues and challenges to government policy. Prof Ford says Mr Kavanaugh tried to force himself on her at a party in the 1980s when he was 17. This video can not be played Christine Blasey Ford said she was ""100%"" sure Brett Kavanaugh assaulted her Judge Kavanaugh's classmate at Yale University, Deborah Ramirez, then told the New Yorker he exposed himself to her at a party. A third woman, Julie Swetnick, alleged she was the victim of a gang rape in 1982 at a party the judge attended. He has rejected all the accusations. At his hearing he also denied drinking excessively to the point of blacking out - something some of Mr Kavanaugh's school and university classmates have contested. A confirmation vote in the full Senate is expected on Saturday. Republicans want their nominee in place before mid-term elections next month, when they could lose their control of the chamber.

"Ms Murad and Dr Mukwege made a ""crucial contribution"" to fighting violence against women The 2018 Nobel Peace Prize has gone to campaigners against rape in warfare, Nadia Murad and Denis Mukwege. Ms Murad is an Iraqi Yazidi who was tortured and raped by Islamic State militants and later became the face of a campaign to free the Yazidi people. Dr Mukwege is a Congolese gynaecologist who, along with his colleagues, has treated tens of thousands of victims. Some 331 individuals and organisations were nominated for the prestigious peace award this year.

""For myself, I think of my mother, who was murdered by DAESH [IS], the children with whom I grew up, and what we must do to honour them,"" she added. ""Persecution of minorities must end.

Dr Mukwege was operating at his hospital when he heard he had won the prize. ""I was in the operating room so when they started to make noise around [it] I wasn't really thinking about what was going on, and suddenly some people came in and told me the news,"" he told Norwegian newspaper VG.

She was bought and sold several times and subjected to sexual and physical abuse during her captivity.

He and his colleagues are said to have treated about 30,000 rape victims, developing great expertise in the treatment of serious injuries sustained during sex assaults that were carried out as a weapon of war. The 63-year-old has won a number of international prizes, including the 2008 UN Human Rights Prize, and was named African of the Year in 2009. He lives under the permanent protection of UN peacekeepers at his hospital and has also previously called for a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. It was in 1999 that our first rape victim was brought into the hospital. After being raped, bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs. I thought that was a barbaric act of war but the real shock came three months later. Forty-five women came to us with the same story, they were all saying: ""People came into my village and raped me, tortured me."" Other women came to us with burns. They said that after they had been raped, chemicals had been poured on their genitals. Dr Mukwege travelled to northern Iraq in June to visit the Yazidi minority's holiest sites I started to ask myself what was going on. These weren't just violent acts of war, but part of a strategy. You had situations where multiple people were raped at the same time, publicly - a whole village might be raped during the night. In doing this, they hurt not just the victims but the whole community, which they force to watch. The result of this strategy is that people are forced to flee their villages, abandon their fields, their resources, everything. It's very effective. Read how Dr Mukwege went on to help thousands Earlier this weekthe Nobel prize for physics was awarded to Donna Strickland, only the third woman winner of the award and the first in 55 years. The Canadian was honoured along with Arthur Ashkin, from the US, and Gerard Mourou, from France. The Nobel prize for medicine was awarded to two scientists- Professor James P Allison from the US and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan - who discovered how to fight cancer using the body's immune system. For chemistry, the prize was awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in enzyme research. Americans Frances Arnold and George P Smith shared the prize with Briton Gregory Winter Nobel peace winners throughout the years Eligible nominators from around the world can put forward candidates up to 1 February of the award year, while Nobel Committee members have more time All nominations are reviewed by the committee - whose five members are chosen by the Norwegian parliament - before a shortlist of 20-30 candidates is selected A group of Norwegian and international advisers writes individual reports on the shortlisted candidates. Using these and further reports, the committee narrows the selection down to a handful A decision is reached in the last meeting of the committee, usually in late September or early October, before the prize is announced If a unanimous decision cannot be reached, a simple majority vote is used After the announcement, the award ceremony takes place on 10 December, the date of Alfred Nobel's death Previous winners include figures such as Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr, Mother Theresa and the Dalai Lama Last yearthe prize was won by the anti-nuclear weapons group International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, a coalition of NGOs whose work has highlighted the humanitarian risk of such weapons This video can not be played Where do the prizes come from and what do peace and dynamite have in common?

"Stephen Coxen had denied the rape charges against him and the case was found not proven in a criminal court A woman has won Â£80,000 in damages from a man who had been cleared of raping her after a night out in Fife. The woman, who cannot be named, had sued Stephen Coxen, who is now 23, from Bury in Greater Manchester. The second year student said she was raped after a night out in St Andrews in 2013 by Mr Coxen, who she had met earlier in the evening. Mr Coxen had denied the charges and in November 2015 a jury found the case against him not proven. But now, in a case understood to be the first of its kind in Scotland, a sheriff in a civil action has ruled Mr Coxen raped the woman, known as Miss M, and demanded he pay damages. The civil action was heard at the Personal Injury Court in Edinburgh. Civil cases require a lower standard of proof than criminal cases, with judgements made on the balance of probabilities rather than beyond reasonable doubt. Sheriff Robert Weir said the evidence from Miss M, who is now 23, had been ""cogent, compelling and persuasive"". He said that Mr Coxen took advantage of her when she was incapable of giving meaningful consent because of the effects of alcohol. The woman bringing the case was a student at the University of St Andrews The sheriff said Miss M had been distressed and had resisted but Mr Coxen had continued to rape her. He agreed that she should be paid Â£80,000 in damages. Miss M told BBC Scotland it was highly unlikely she would see any of the money as it would be clawed back to pay legal costs. She said: ""The thing that has happened from the civil trial is that people will see the type of person that Stephen Coxen is."" Miss M said: ""After being let down in the criminal process and having such a difficult fight to take the civil action to court in the first place I think shock is the word. ""It's not just me that's been through this journey for the past five years, it has had an impact on my family and friends."" She said did not know whether the sheriff's decision would bring ""closure"" but it was some form of justice. ""It's been a long journey to receive this justice and it is disappointing that it took a civil hearing following a criminal trial but I am obviously very relieved that now someone has listened and acknowledged that the actions of Stephen Coxen were wrong and unlawful."" Mr Coxen's lawyer, Mark Thorley, said: ""He (Stephen Coxen) is considering the judgement and will look at his options thereafter."" The personal injury court judgment follows a seven-day hearing in June. The sheriff heard that Mr Coxen, who was then 18, had driven up from Manchester in September 2013 to visit a friend who was beginning his second year at St Andrews University. Mr Coxen met Miss M, who was an 18-year-old student, at the Lizard Lounge in the town. The judgment said she had been drinking heavily at a party but was still able to gain entry to the club at about midnight. At some point after her arrival, she is reported to have been seen kissing with Mr Coxen in the club's smoking lounge. Mr Coxen is then said to have been involved in an altercation and was ejected from the premises close to 2am. Miss M said she could not remember leaving the nightclub and her next memory was standing at the gates outside her flat. She described turning to find that she was with someone and felt panicked because she did not know who the person was. Miss M said she rang the buzzer, hoping that her flatmates would answer. Mr Coxen became frustrated as she ""played for time"", searching in her bag for the house keys. Miss M then dropped her keys and Mr Coxen pushed her away when she tried to pick them up. He unlocked the gate himself and used the keys to gain entry to the flat, where he raped her. Mr Coxen is said to have left the flat soon after. Over the next few months, Miss M is said to have been prescribed a number of different types of medication to deal with depression, panic attacks and sleep disturbance. She reported the attack in January 2014. Mr Coxen denied rape and said they had consensual sex. Simon Di Rollo QC, who represented Miss M during the civil case, said she was an ""extremely courageous woman"". ""It is understandable that she found it impossible to come to terms with the verdict of the jury in the criminal proceedings,"" he said. ""Although the findings by the sheriff in these civil proceedings are of assistance, there can be no doubt that her experience of the criminal justice system was unsatisfactory. ""Unfortunately, that is not as unusual as it should be. I think that everyone must strive to ensure that, so far as is possible, others in the future do not feel as let down as she did."" David Robertson (left) and David Goodwillie faced a civil action after a decision not to prosecute them Last year, another woman, Denise Clair, won a civil case against footballers David Goodwillie and David Robertson. Footballers lose appeal over rape finding But the case was different as Ms Clair, who waived her right to anonymity, brought the civil action after the Crown had decided against prosecuting the pair in the criminal courts. The judge in the civil court found the rapes had happened and awarded Ms Clair Â£100,000 damages from the men. Miss M told BBC Scotland she had decided to mount her civil case in 2016, which was supported by the Scottish Legal Aid Board, before Ms Clair's case became public knowledge.

"Emma Samms told her Twitter followers the group name for ladybirds should be a ""loveliness"" People across England and Wales say their homes and buildings are being swarmed by ladybirds. Ladybird experts suggest the hot summer has boosted numbers of the invasive Harlequin species, which first arrived in the UK in 2004. As the temperature cools, the Harlequin hibernates for the winter in buildings - including homes. Scientists say the ladybirds are mostly harmless and can be left alone if they are found in your house. Swarms of posts have appeared on social media documenting the ladybird invasion, with little red bugs seen crawling over doors and windows in people's homes. Allow Twitter content?

The hot summer was likely to have boosted the insect's numbers, although she said the survey data was not yet complete. Native to Asia, the Harlequin ladybird was first seen in the UK 14 years ago, and is now the second most common ladybird species, seen across England and parts of Wales. Allow Twitter content?

But its arrival has caused concern that it is displacing some native species, such as the two-spot ladybird. Peter Brown, another ladybird survey organiser who is also a senior lecturer at Anglia Ruskin University, says that although the Harlequin species is usually bigger, it isn't always easy to distinguish from the native varieties in the wild. But he said that ladybirds seen crawling into homes are likely to be this invader, as other species tend to hibernate in trees or leaf litter. He said: ""If you're getting large numbers of ladybirds coming into a building, they are very likely to be Harlequins."" Dr Brown said the Harlequin's annual swarming in autumn before hibernation had led to the nickname of the Halloween ladybug in the US. Allow Twitter content?

Dr Brown said Harlequin ladybirds sometimes bite people if no food is available, usually leaving a small bump and sting. In a few cases, people have had severe allergic reactions. But he said that if you do spot Harlequins in your home, it might be easiest to leave them alone - when disturbed they secrete a yellowish substance that can stain furnishings.

"The pop-up was up for 20 minutes before being dismantled, publisher Penguin tweeted Topshop removed an in-store pop-up in London used to promote feminism with publisher Penguin after 20 minutes. The fashion retailer had agreed to host the pop-up with Penguin, to help launch the book Feminists Don't Wear Pink (And Other Lies) with products for sale supporting the UN charity Girl Up. Penguin said its team was ""raring to go"" but ""just 20 minutes later it had been dismantled by Topshop"". Topshop said its decision was from ""a production and creative standpoint"". The book, which brings together ideas on feminism from 50 women, was compiled by author Scarlett Curtis, daughter of director Richard Curtis. Planning for the pop-up to coincide with the launch took ""months"", Ms Curtis said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Meng Hongwei was elected Interpol's head two years ago France has opened an investigation into the disappearance of Meng Hongwei, the Chinese head of the international police agency Interpol. His family have not heard from him since he left Interpol HQ in the French city of Lyon for a trip back to China on 25 September, officials said. ""He did not disappear in France,"" a source close to the inquiry told AFP. The South China Morning Post,externalquotes a source as saying Mr Meng, 64, was ""taken away"" for questioning in China. It is not clear why he was being investigated by ""discipline authorities"" or where he was being held, the Hong Kong-based newspaper adds. Chinese official to head Interpol Officials in China have so far made no public comments on Mr Meng, a senior Communist Party official there. It was opened after Mr Meng's wife went to police to report her husband missing. She was initially quoted by police sources as saying she has not heard from him since his departure on 29 September. But the French interior ministry later said the correct date was 25 September. ""Exchanges with Chinese authorities continue,"" the ministry said. ""France is puzzled about the situation of Interpol's president and concerned about the threats made to his wife."" It did not provide any further details. Analysis by BBC Asia Editor Celia Hatton Meng Hongwei's disappearance seems to fit in with a now familiar pattern among China's senior Communist Party officials. The official in question suddenly drops out of the public eye and an alarm is raised that the person is ""missing"", usually by members of the public. Eventually, the party issues a terse statement that the official is ""under investigation"", the official is then booted from the party for ""disciplinary infractions"" and - eventually - a prison sentence is announced. Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, well over a million party officials have been disciplined in some way. Mr Meng's case is notable for a few reasons. First, his wife notified the French authorities after he had only been missing for a few days. Family members of missing party officials rarely, if ever, reach out to foreign authorities, in fear their relatives will face ever greater punishment. Did the wife do this because she felt there was no other option? Also, at one time, China prized Mr Meng's lofty position at Interpol. If he has really gone missing within the Chinese state apparatus, whom did he anger, or what could he have done for Beijing to willingly, and publicly, forfeit the top job at Interpol? In a statement, the organisation said it was aware of reports of the ""alleged disappearance"" of Mr Meng. ""This is a matter for the relevant authorities in both France and China,"" it said. Interpol added that the secretary general - not the president - was in charge of the day-to-day running of the 192-member organisation. Allow Twitter content?

As president, Mr Meng leads the Executive Committee, which provides the overall guidance and direction to Interpol. Mr Meng's term is scheduled to run until 2020. Before taking over at Interpol, Meng Hongwei was deputy minister in charge of public security in China. After his election human rights groups expressed concern that the move could help China pursue political dissidents who have fled the country. Elected as Interpol's president in November 2016 Scheduled to serve until 2020 Is a senior Communist Party official in China and has served as Chinese vice-minister of public security Has 40 years of experience in criminal justice and policing Mr Meng said at the time that he was ready to do ""everything he could towards the cause of policing in the world"". Mr Meng has 40 years of experience in criminal justice and policing in China, notably in the fields of drugs, counter-terrorism and border control, according to Interpol. Interpol can issue a red notice - an international alert - for a wanted person. But it does not have the power to send officers into countries to arrest individuals or issue arrest warrants.

"This video can not be played 'Our message to the Welsh people must be simple: Yes Wales can' - Adam Price Welsh independence must be ""on the table"" after Brexit, Plaid Cymru's new leader has said. Adam Price said if there was a ""hard"" Irish border and the UK left the EU single market and customs union ""the appetite for Scottish independence and Irish unity"" would be ""insatiable"". He warned of a Wales ""at the mercy of Westminster"". Comparing Brexit to the Titanic, Mr Price told Plaid's autumn conference in Cardigan that the ""iceberg's looming"". The assembly member, who defeated Leanne Wood in the party's recent leadership contest, said voters should be given a chance to ""avert a disaster"" through a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Downing Street said the prime minister'sChequers planfor Brexit would create a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods with the EU based on a ""common rule book"", and resolveconcerns about the borderbetween Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. But Theresa May's proposals have been attacked by both Brexiteer and pro-EU Tory MPs, while the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said he is ""strongly"" opposed to key parts of her plan. Plaid backs decriminalisation of drugs Who is Adam Price? Brexit: All you need to know Adam Price replaces Wood as Plaid leader Pitching for independence, Mr Price told conference: ""We can be fair and flourishing. We can be self-governing and successful.  We can be Welsh and European."" In his speech Mr Price accused unionist parties of being devoid of ideas. ""The cupboard is bare,"" he said, claiming Labour represented ""the politics of the past"". The leader promised a ""new vision for health and care"" that NHS founder Aneruin Bevan ""could only dream of"", with reviews to examine the creation of a National Care Service and whether GPs should continue to act as private operators. Plaid Cymru needed an ""honest assessment of where"" it is, says Adam Price Mr Price said Plaid in power would build a ""National Western Rail Line"" from Swansea to Bangor, and promised a ""comprehensive child package"" so parents could return to work when they choose. ""We must fire up the national imagination with a sense of the Wales that might yet be,"" he said. ""We cannot afford to keep doing what we have done for another five years."" Plaid's new leader admitted the party had to ""transform"" and needed an ""honest assessment"" of itself. He has commissioned former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson to conduct a ""root and branch review"" of the party's campaign machinery. By BBC Wales political editor Felicity Evans Brexit threatens a constitutional crisis, says Adam Price Plaid's new leader was greeted by a standing ovation before he uttered a word. Adam Price's speech was chock full of historical references, including the use of the long bow by the Welsh armies at the battle of Crug Mawr here in Cardigan - the weapon, he noted, of a David confronted with a Goliath. Today he wants to deploy ballot boxes for two referendums - one on Welsh independence and one on Brexit. Plaid Cymru members will love this, but it is a risky strategy that could alienate more voters than it attracts. Wales opted for Brexit in 2016 and the issue remains divisive. On independence - polls suggest the vast majority of people oppose the idea. But Adam Price wants a message that can cut through the political noise, and his is strategy is this: energise the base, seek credibility with the wider electorate with a clarity about what the party stands for and reform the party's campaign machinery. Currently, Plaid is the third largest party in the Welsh Assembly so there's a steep road ahead to the next election in 2021. Please upgrade your browser Before conference began on Friday, Mr Price said Brexit was threatening a ""constitutional crisis - with or without a deal"", claiming that: ""The appetite for Scottish independence and Irish unity will become insatiable."" Welsh independence, Mr Price said, ""must be on the table"" in order to ""ensure that our country isn't swallowed into an 'England and Wales' entity where we are at the mercy of Westminster"". The Plaid Cymru leader said that if his party was in government after the 2021 election in Wales, it would ""put a Welsh Independence Referendum Act on the statute book at the earliest possible opportunity"".

"Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation process has been one of the most contentious for years Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court seat looks all but confirmed after he won the backing of key senators despite an FBI investigation into sexual assault allegations. Republican Senator Susan Collins and Joe Manchin, a Democrat, both indicated their backing for the judge on Friday. Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation would tilt America's highest court in favour of conservatives. The court has the final say on issues such as abortion and gun control. A final vote on whether Judge Kavanaugh will join the nine-member panel is scheduled for Saturday. If confirmed, the position is for life. Hours before the undecided senators indicated their backing, the US Senate narrowly advanced President Donald Trump's nominee to a final vote by voting to strictly limit debate on the issue. The political fallout from the Kavanaugh vote Friday's ""cloture"" vote - 51-49 in favour - was a test of support for the embattled nominee who has faced allegations of sexual misconduct from three women, including Prof Christine Blasey Ford. Senator Collins ended hopes she would side with Democrats in the final vote, telling fellow senators she did not believe the ""charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the court"". ""The facts presented do not mean that Professor Ford was not sexually assaulted that night or at some other time but they do lead me to conclude that the allegations failed to meet the more likely than not standard,"" she said. This video can not be played Collins: I vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh Senator Manchin, who is up for re-election in West Virginia, a traditionally Republican state that Mr Trump won by a landslide, told the Senate moments later he ""found Judge Kavanaugh to be a qualified jurist who will follow the constitution and determine cases based on the legal findings before him"". The reaction has been swift, with former president George HW Bush and White House press secretary Sarah Sanders both tweeting their support for Ms Collins. Allow Twitter content?

However,former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin tweeted she could ""see 2022 from my house"",external, suggesting Senator Murkowski would face a fight for her seat at the next election should she not side with her Republican colleagues in the vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court is all but certain. The Republican Party has the votes and the battle appears over. The political war, however, is just beginning. Donald Trump's court pick generated a controversy that captured the nation's attention in a way that few political issues do. It generated daily headlines rivalled only by the US quadrennial presidential elections. Now that the bombs have been thrown, it's time to assess the fallout.

"Mr Kavanaugh denies sex assault allegations On 4 October, the FBI handed over its report on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The findings are not for public eyes - but here's what we do know about it. Senators are taking turns reading the single copy of the report - which exists only on paper to prevent any leaks - in a secure room in the Capitol. The full Senate vote on whether Judge Kavanaugh gets a seat on America's top court was delayed while the FBI worked, and is now expected on Saturday. Who is Brett Kavanaugh? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Senator Dianne Feinstein has viewed the report, and has called the investigation ""very limited"" White House spokesman Raj Shah told CNN the FBI contacted 10 people and ""comprehensively interviewed"" nine of them. Official sources told US media the review focused on the alleged incidents involving Prof Ford and second accuser Deborah Ramirez. Here's who the FBI has interviewed, according to statements from their lawyers: Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate who alleges Judge Kavanaugh exposed his genitals to her during a college party Mark Judge, a childhood friend of Judge Kavanaugh, who Prof Ford testified was in the room during the alleged assault Leland Keyser, Prof Ford's high school friend who was reportedly at the summer of 1982 party where the alleged assault occurred PJ Smyth, another high school friend of Judge Kavanaugh, who says Prof Ford was at the July party Timothy Gaudette, another high school friend of the judge's at whose house the party reportedly occurred Christopher ""Squi"" Garrett, a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh, Prof Ford says she dated him for a few months in high school Republican Senator Bob Corker said the report is 46 pages long, with nine pages focusing on Mark Judge. But Democrats have criticised the narrow scope and time limitation of the FBI's inquiry - especially as neither the judge nor Prof Ford spoke with the FBI. Senator Dianne Feinstein said what she saw of the report, it appeared to be ""the product of an incomplete investigation"". This video can not be played Brett Kavanaugh's accuser recalls her most vivid memories from the night in question Federal agents reportedly did not look into the judge's drinking habits orthe claims of his third accuser, Julie Swetnick. A number of Judge Kavanaugh's former classmates have come forward since the hearings, willing to speak with the FBI about his behaviour, but it appears they have not been interviewed. Here are the people who have submitted statements or otherwise tried to contact the FBI: Kenneth Appold, who was Judge Kavanaugh's suitemate at Yale,told the New Yorker,externalhe was ""100% certain"" he could corroborate Ms Ramirez's story Two anonymous Georgetown Prep classmateswho detailed the judge's drinking habits and questionable behaviour during high school James Roche, another Yale roommate,who wrote in a piece for Slate,externalthat Judge Kavanaugh lied under oath about drinking Kerry Berchem, a Yale classmate, who says she has text messages that suggest Judge Kavanaugh knew of Ms Ramirez's allegation before it was published In addition, Ms Ramirez's lawyers say they provided a list of 20 individuals with relevant information who have not been contacted by the FBI. Prof Ford's lawyersalso shared a list of people,externalwho they said could support her claims. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Judge Kavanaugh and Prof Ford were not interviewed. Not exactly. As many have pointed out, the FBI files a report but does not reach any conclusion regarding the credibility or significance of allegations. ""They report any corroborating information that they obtain, or any contradicting information,"" former FBI Assistant Director Chris Swecker told CNN, but added that ""they do not make conclusions"" in their reports. Former FBI Assistant Director Steve Pomerantz told Fox News: ""Hopefully they provide enough information within their reports that allow a reasonable person to reach a conclusion based on the work that they've done."" Because it is not a criminal inquiry, witnesses were not compelled to co-operate with the investigation, but lying to an FBI agent does carry the threat of federal charges. This video can not be played Republican Senator Jeff Flake changed his mind after being challenged by a sexual assault survivor Yes. The FBI has completed a traditional background check - provided to any federal appointee - on Judge Kavanaugh, who is currently a District of Columbia appeals court judge. In his confirmation hearing, the judicial nominee himself said he had been through ""six separate FBI background investigations over 26 years"". This was the seventh. But typical FBI background checks never look back as far as 36 years ago, when Prof Ford says the assault took place. The women who confronted Jeff Flake Are young men in America scared? This video can not be played Trump: 'Ford's testimony was very compelling' Mr Trump gave the order at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee, after Arizona Republican Jeff Flake made such an inquiry his condition for backing the judge. The president's party has only a razor-thin 51-49 Senate majority. That means that if all Democrats vote against confirming Judge Kavanaugh, he can only afford for one Republican to join them - since in a tie, Vice-President Mike Pence would get the casting vote. Key takeaways from Thursday's dramatic hearing Moment of reckoning for American women The timing matters because Republicans are keen to get their Supreme Court nominee - who would serve for life - confirmed before the US mid-term elections on 6 November. And Democrats would profit from seeing that process delayed - or blocked altogether. The FBI's 1991 investigation into then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas over sexual harassment allegations was open and shut in three days. He was subsequently confirmed by the Senate.

"The pop-up was up for 20 minutes before being dismantled, publisher Penguin tweeted Topshop removed an in-store pop-up in London used to promote feminism with publisher Penguin after 20 minutes. The fashion retailer had agreed to host the pop-up with Penguin, to help launch the book Feminists Don't Wear Pink (And Other Lies) with products for sale supporting the UN charity Girl Up. Penguin said its team was ""raring to go"" but ""just 20 minutes later it had been dismantled by Topshop"". Topshop said its decision was from ""a production and creative standpoint"". The book, which brings together ideas on feminism from 50 women, was compiled by author Scarlett Curtis, daughter of director Richard Curtis.

"Co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley were elected in September People's free time should be recorded as a way to measure the UK's ""well-being"", the Green Party says. The party is calling for a ""Free Time Index"" and says that time spent outside work and commuting is a better measure of how well the UK is doing than GDP. Co-leader Sian Berry told the BBC work-life balance was ""in crisis"" and more people were working while commuting. The party also said it wanted paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover. Calling for new free time indicators to be included in the next Budget, Ms Berry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Work-life balance is an incredibly important indicator of people's well-being and it is in crisis at the moment. Bartley and Berry elected co-leaders ""People are constantly 'on', even when they are commuting. There's an enormous amount of unpaid caring going on which doesn't get measured, which doesn't leave people with very much free time either. We have got a mental health crisis and we think we should be measuring this."" She added that other indicators of a healthy society should be measured, like ""resource use, housing affordability and health"". ""It should be used as a more important indicator than GDP of how our country is doing,"" Ms Berry said, arguing it could then be used to inform policy. The Green co-leaders say ""true freedom"" is about having control of your own time Pressed on whether Green policies, which include a four-day working week, would mean less money to invest in infrastructure and public services, she said people with more fulfilling work and more free time could be more productive. The Green Party failed to make its hoped-for breakthrough in the 2017 general election, as its vote was squeezed by Labour. But it made headway in May's council elections, adding eight seats. Last year the party announced afour-day working week policy,external, amounting to a maximum of 35 hours, andthere have been reports,externalsuggesting Labour is considering a similar policy, as a way of sharing technological advances with staff. In Friday's speech to the Greens' autumn conference in Bristol, Ms Berry promised ""radical common sense for the common good"" and said her party was a real alternative to Labour as ""we go further and we do it better"". She said the momentum behind calls for a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations ""feels absolutely unstoppable"" while her co-leader Jonathan Bartley described Brexit as a ""pitiful charade"". Mr Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" in response to the threat from climate change, adding: ""We won't debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"". In response to the Greens' free time proposals, Len Shackleton, research fellow at the free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ""GDP is not the only measure of how well the country is doing, but it is the most useful for comparisons with other countries and with the UK over time."" He said life satisfaction, happiness and anxiety indicators were already published by the Office for National Statistics, adding: ""We have regular time-use surveys which could be used to create something like what the Greens want. But what would it show, really? ""People might have more time to spend with their families if unemployment rose dramatically. There are different perspectives within the family. ""Using GDP as our prime indicator cannot deal with these concerns, but nor can any other simple measure."" The ONScarried out a survey of leisure time in the UK in 2015,external, which suggested that UK men spent an average of six hours nine minutes a day on leisure activities - while women spent five hours 29 minutes. Most of that time was spent watching TV, listening to music or reading. There has beensome researchwhich suggests that using money to free up time is linked to increased happiness. The coalition government attempted to measure the happiness of UK citizens and the first national well-being surveywas published in 2012.

"Eleanor Wilson denies four counts of sexual activity with a child under 18 while in a position of trust A schoolteacher accused of having sex with a 16-year-old pupil on a plane said she told the boy she was pregnant because she ""wanted someone to feel sorry for her"". Eleanor Wilson is accused of having sex with the boy on a school trip in 2015. She told the court she did not reveal her pregnancy fears to her partner because she was afraid of his reaction. Ms Wilson, 29, denies four counts of sexual activity with a child under 18 while in a position of trust. Under questioning from defence barrister Anna Midgley, Ms Wilson said the boy, who cannot be identified, came into her office and asked why she was crying. So she told him of her pregnancy. ""I was scared. My guard was down, I was upset,"" she told Bristol Crown Court. ""It was inappropriate to tell him. I wanted someone to feel sorry for me."" Ms Wilson, of Dursley, Gloucestershire, told the jury she thought she may have become pregnant but did not want to tell her boyfriend ""because of what he might do"". ""I said, 'What would you think if we were to have a baby?'. He said 'You'd find your way to the bottom of the stairs.'"" Virginia Cornwall, for the prosecution, asked why Ms Wilson told the pupil not to say anything about him having ""extra meetings"" with her. ""It was against school policy. He was struggling personally,"" answered Ms Wilson. ""Because when we got back to school I was ashamed and scared of losing my job."" ""You knew it was morally wrong,"" said Ms Cornwall. ""It wasn't morally wrong, it was coming from a good place,"" Ms Wilson replied. The court heard how the science teacher at a Bristol school had asked her pupil to delete text messages between them after ""almost daily contact"" by phone. Ms Wilson said the boy became ""over familiar"" and they ""shared personal details, which I wouldn't have done with other students"". ""He had shared stuff with me, and at the time I didn't have anyone else."" She admitted going to the boy's house when his parents were away but denied any sexual activity took place, or going into his bedroom. Ms Wilson told the court: ""We had the opportunity but it didn't happen."" The court heard that Ms Wilson was in a relationship with her ex-partner for nine years, and he was the father of their unborn baby. However, prosecutors alleged she needed to tell the boy about the pregnancy ""because there was a guilt because you knew he was the father"", a claim she denied. Ms Wilson said: ""He wasn't the father. The fact that he's made this about him makes me so angry."" She admitted hiding the fact she was in contact with the boy from her boyfriend.

"Cern, home to the Large Hadron Collider, was quick to condemn the talk More than 1,600 scientists have so far signed a statement condemning the remarks of the Italian researcher who stated that physics was ""built by men"". Prof Alessandro Strumia presented an analysis to an audience of predominantly young female physicists which he claimed ""proved"" women were less capable at the subject than men. The statement atparticlesforjustice.org,externalsays Prof Strumia's talk was ""fundamentally unsound"" and was ""followed by open discrimination and personal attacks"". In response, Prof Strumia told BBC News that the high-energy physics community was about 100 times bigger than the number that have so far signed the statement. He said that the signatories ""mostly come from those countries more affected by political correctness, which I indicated as the problem. This is what leads to academicians that want (to get) others fired for having 'morally reprehensible' ideas"". The Pisa University-affiliated researchermade his comments - first reported by the BBC - during a workshop at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern)- the lab on the Franco-Swiss border that discovered the Higgs Boson. Cern has since suspended his participation from any activities at the lab. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'We want to be accepted into the club' Four women who changed the face of physics First woman Physics Nobel winner in 55 years Physicists from across the world are continuing to add their names to the statement. ""Strumia's arguments are morally reprehensible,"" it reads. ""Belittling the ability and legitimacy of scientists of colour and white women scientists using such flimsy pretexts is disgraceful, and it reveals a deep contempt for more than half of humanity that clearly comes from some source other than scientific logic."" The workshop at which Prof Strumia was speaking was aimed at helping women to become particle physicists. But the audience of early career researchers was upset and angered by his analysis of published research papers from an online library. He told them that his analysis showed that physics was not sexist against women. Professor Donna Strickland became the first woman in 55 years to win the Nobel prize in Physics earlier this week He produced a series of graphs which, he claimed, demonstrated that women were hired over men whose research had been cited more highly in publications - an indication of higher quality. Prof Strumia also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers before men then overtook women as their careers progressed. In addition, he highlighted behavioural research that he said indicated that the ""assumption that men and women have identical brains is an ideology"". The statement at particlesforjustice.org forensically examines each of the claims and dismisses them. ""Strumia claimed to be proving that there is no discrimination against women, [but] his arguments were rooted in a circumscribed, biased reading of the data available, to the point of promoting a perspective that is biased against women,"" it states. ""The origin and validity of the data he presented have not yet been corroborated, but even if we take it at face value in all cases there are obvious alternative explanations that â¦ are directly in contradiction with his conclusions."" Professor Strumia denied that his use of data was biased. He told the BBC: ""The data about citations and hirings show that women are not discriminated (against) in fundamental physics. We reward merit, irrespective of gender."" The University of Pisa has said that it is considering a disciplinary review of his actions.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events. Someone with PTSD often relives the traumatic event through nightmares and flashbacks, and may experience feelings of isolation, irritability and guilt. They may also have problems sleeping, such as insomnia, and find concentrating difficult. These symptoms are often severe and persistent enough to have a significant impact on the person's day-to-day life.

"Mr Kavanaugh denies sex assault allegations On 4 October, the FBI handed over its report on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The findings are not for public eyes - but here's what we do know about it. Senators are taking turns reading the single copy of the report - which exists only on paper to prevent any leaks - in a secure room in the Capitol. The full Senate vote on whether Judge Kavanaugh gets a seat on America's top court was delayed while the FBI worked, and is now expected on Saturday. Who is Brett Kavanaugh? The Brett Kavanaugh story in 300 words Senator Dianne Feinstein has viewed the report, and has called the investigation ""very limited"" White House spokesman Raj Shah told CNN the FBI contacted 10 people and ""comprehensively interviewed"" nine of them. Official sources told US media the review focused on the alleged incidents involving Prof Ford and second accuser Deborah Ramirez. Here's who the FBI has interviewed, according to statements from their lawyers: Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate who alleges Judge Kavanaugh exposed his genitals to her during a college party Mark Judge, a childhood friend of Judge Kavanaugh, who Prof Ford testified was in the room during the alleged assault Leland Keyser, Prof Ford's high school friend who was reportedly at the summer of 1982 party where the alleged assault occurred PJ Smyth, another high school friend of Judge Kavanaugh, who says Prof Ford was at the July party Timothy Gaudette, another high school friend of the judge's at whose house the party reportedly occurred Christopher ""Squi"" Garrett, a close friend of Judge Kavanaugh, Prof Ford says she dated him for a few months in high school Republican Senator Bob Corker said the report is 46 pages long, with nine pages focusing on Mark Judge. But Democrats have criticised the narrow scope and time limitation of the FBI's inquiry - especially as neither the judge nor Prof Ford spoke with the FBI. Senator Dianne Feinstein said what she saw of the report, it appeared to be ""the product of an incomplete investigation"". This video can not be played Brett Kavanaugh's accuser recalls her most vivid memories from the night in question Federal agents reportedly did not look into the judge's drinking habits orthe claims of his third accuser, Julie Swetnick. A number of Judge Kavanaugh's former classmates have come forward since the hearings, willing to speak with the FBI about his behaviour, but it appears they have not been interviewed. Here are the people who have submitted statements or otherwise tried to contact the FBI: Kenneth Appold, who was Judge Kavanaugh's suitemate at Yale,told the New Yorker,externalhe was ""100% certain"" he could corroborate Ms Ramirez's story Two anonymous Georgetown Prep classmateswho detailed the judge's drinking habits and questionable behaviour during high school James Roche, another Yale roommate,who wrote in a piece for Slate,externalthat Judge Kavanaugh lied under oath about drinking Kerry Berchem, a Yale classmate, who says she has text messages that suggest Judge Kavanaugh knew of Ms Ramirez's allegation before it was published In addition, Ms Ramirez's lawyers say they provided a list of 20 individuals with relevant information who have not been contacted by the FBI. Prof Ford's lawyersalso shared a list of people,externalwho they said could support her claims. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Judge Kavanaugh and Prof Ford were not interviewed. Not exactly. As many have pointed out, the FBI files a report but does not reach any conclusion regarding the credibility or significance of allegations. ""They report any corroborating information that they obtain, or any contradicting information,"" former FBI Assistant Director Chris Swecker told CNN, but added that ""they do not make conclusions"" in their reports. Former FBI Assistant Director Steve Pomerantz told Fox News: ""Hopefully they provide enough information within their reports that allow a reasonable person to reach a conclusion based on the work that they've done."" Because it is not a criminal inquiry, witnesses were not compelled to co-operate with the investigation, but lying to an FBI agent does carry the threat of federal charges. This video can not be played Republican Senator Jeff Flake changed his mind after being challenged by a sexual assault survivor Yes. The FBI has completed a traditional background check - provided to any federal appointee - on Judge Kavanaugh, who is currently a District of Columbia appeals court judge. In his confirmation hearing, the judicial nominee himself said he had been through ""six separate FBI background investigations over 26 years"". This was the seventh. But typical FBI background checks never look back as far as 36 years ago, when Prof Ford says the assault took place. The women who confronted Jeff Flake Are young men in America scared? This video can not be played Trump: 'Ford's testimony was very compelling' Mr Trump gave the order at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee, after Arizona Republican Jeff Flake made such an inquiry his condition for backing the judge. The president's party has only a razor-thin 51-49 Senate majority. That means that if all Democrats vote against confirming Judge Kavanaugh, he can only afford for one Republican to join them - since in a tie, Vice-President Mike Pence would get the casting vote. Key takeaways from Thursday's dramatic hearing Moment of reckoning for American women The timing matters because Republicans are keen to get their Supreme Court nominee - who would serve for life - confirmed before the US mid-term elections on 6 November. And Democrats would profit from seeing that process delayed - or blocked altogether. The FBI's 1991 investigation into then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas over sexual harassment allegations was open and shut in three days. He was subsequently confirmed by the Senate.

"The club said none of its employees had shown any symptoms Visitors to a renowned sex club in Berlin have been urged to seek medical treatment after a patron was taken to hospital with bacterial meningitis. The KitKatClub said the man was in a serious condition after attending a party there on Saturday. About 100 others were treated as a precaution. Bacterial meningitis is spread through close physical contact and can become life-threatening within hours. The nightclub hosts fetish parties that attract visitors from around the world. The man contacted a doctor on Monday and was immediately diagnosed with the disease.He is being treated with antibiotics,external, Bild newspaper reported. The man had attended the ""CarneBall Bizarre"" party on Saturday night Authorities in Berlin's Reinickendorf district advised anyone who attended the club on Saturday to ""seek immediate preventive treatment"". ""A friend of the patient could tell us that they were both in the KitKat club, but he did not know who the sick person was in contact with there,"" said Patrick Larscheid, director of the Reinickendorf Health Department. The man had attended the ""CarneBall Bizarre"" party. The evening has a dress code of ""fetish, patent and leather, uniforms, TV, goth, costumes, evening wear, glitz & glamour, extravagant clothes"", according to the club's Facebook page.

"A criminal investigation has been launched after a backlog of medical waste was allowed to build up at several disposal sites. It emerged on Thursday that the waste from hospitals had not been disposed of in a timely fashion by contractor Healthcare Environmental Services. The Environment Agency said the firm was in breach of permits. HES said it had previously highlighted the need to invest in the UK's ""ageing"" incinerator network for clinical waste. The Department of Health in England said there was no risk to the public. A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency in England said it had found HES to be in breach of environmental permits at five sites which deal with clinical waste. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) also confirmed that it issued enforcement notices at sites in Dundee and Shotts last month, where its officers are conducting ""ongoing monitoring"". A Cobra meeting to discuss the issue was chaired by English Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month,according to the Health Service Journal,external, which first reported the story. A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency said: ""We are taking enforcement action against the operator, which includes clearance of the excess waste, and have launched a criminal investigation. ""We are supporting the government and the NHS to ensure there is no disruption to public services and for alternative plans to be put in place for hospitals affected to dispose of their waste safely."" Princess Anne toured Healthcare Environmental's Lanarkshire plant during a visit earlier this year SEPA said it was working closely with the Environment Agency and ""robustly monitoring sites in Scotland"". HES has a transfer station for waste in Dundee and a storage, processing and incineration site at Shotts. SEPA said the company had not gone over its agreed regulatory limits for either of the two Scottish sites. A UK government spokesman said it was monitoring the situation closely and had made sure that public services - including NHS Trusts - had contingency plans in place. He added: ""There is absolutely no risk to the health of patients or the wider public. ""Our priority is to prevent disruption to the NHS and other vital public services and work is under way to ensure organisations can continue to dispose of their waste safely and efficiently."" The Scottish government said there had been no reports of any impact on services from NHS boards in Scotland. A spokesman added: ""In the event of any disruption to service at NHS sites across Scotland, NHS Scotland already has contingency plans ready to put into place to ensure there is no impact on services to patients or staff."" Company director Garry Pettigrew with Princess Anne during her visit Healthcare Environmental Services describes itself on its website as the ""UK's leading independent provider of healthcare waste management"". Its latest company accounts show it had a turnover of just over Â£31m in the year to the end of April 2017. They credited an 18% increase in sales to a new treatment plant in Newcastle. Company directors Garry and Alison Pettigrew were paid Â£299,521 between them. They also shared dividends of Â£480,000. The company owns land and buildings worth Â£3.7m. HES said it had highlighted the reduction in the UK's high-temperature incineration capacity for the last few years to the UK government, NHS bodies and the Environment Agency. The company said all of its waste was stored ""in accordance with strict regulations"". ""Anatomical waste is not stored on any of our facilities for longer than is allowed by permitted guidelines,"" HES said. A spokesman added:  ""We have welcomed visits from the EA a number of times over the past few months and have pointed out to them that the amount of waste produced by the NHS for incineration far outweighs the entire incineration capabilities of the UK, and not just HES. ""We are not the only company to feel the strain on our services, with many of our competitors continually breaching storage regulations."" Healthcare Environmental Services' headquarters is in Shotts in Lanarkshire The firm also has a depot in Dundee Jonathan Ashworth, Labour's shadow health and social care secretary in England, called on Matt Hancock to make a statement in the House of Commons on the ""staggering revelations"" next week. ""When something of this scale is going on which the government has known about for some time they have a responsibility to come to Parliament and explain to Parliament whether they've got credible contingency plans and to reassure MPs who will represent those 50 hospital trusts,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World At One. ""Given the scale of this, it's hugely disappointing that the secretary of state has not done this,"" he added. Unison's head of health, Sara Gorton, described the situation as ""simply horrific"", saying it was ""unlikely that such a distressing situation would have happened had the service remained in-house"".

"Co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley were elected in September People's free time should be recorded as a way to measure the UK's ""well-being"", the Green Party says. The party is calling for a ""Free Time Index"" and says that time spent outside work and commuting is a better measure of how well the UK is doing than GDP. Co-leader Sian Berry told the BBC work-life balance was ""in crisis"" and more people were working while commuting. The party also said it wanted paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover. Calling for new free time indicators to be included in the next Budget, Ms Berry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Work-life balance is an incredibly important indicator of people's well-being and it is in crisis at the moment. Bartley and Berry elected co-leaders ""People are constantly 'on', even when they are commuting. There's an enormous amount of unpaid caring going on which doesn't get measured, which doesn't leave people with very much free time either. We have got a mental health crisis and we think we should be measuring this."" She added that other indicators of a healthy society should be measured, like ""resource use, housing affordability and health"". ""It should be used as a more important indicator than GDP of how our country is doing,"" Ms Berry said, arguing it could then be used to inform policy. The Green co-leaders say ""true freedom"" is about having control of your own time Pressed on whether Green policies, which include a four-day working week, would mean less money to invest in infrastructure and public services, she said people with more fulfilling work and more free time could be more productive. The Green Party failed to make its hoped-for breakthrough in the 2017 general election, as its vote was squeezed by Labour. But it made headway in May's council elections, adding eight seats. Last year the party announced afour-day working week policy,external, amounting to a maximum of 35 hours, andthere have been reports,externalsuggesting Labour is considering a similar policy, as a way of sharing technological advances with staff. In Friday's speech to the Greens' autumn conference in Bristol, Ms Berry promised ""radical common sense for the common good"" and said her party was a real alternative to Labour as ""we go further and we do it better"". She said the momentum behind calls for a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations ""feels absolutely unstoppable"" while her co-leader Jonathan Bartley described Brexit as a ""pitiful charade"". Mr Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" in response to the threat from climate change, adding: ""We won't debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"". In response to the Greens' free time proposals, Len Shackleton, research fellow at the free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ""GDP is not the only measure of how well the country is doing, but it is the most useful for comparisons with other countries and with the UK over time."" He said life satisfaction, happiness and anxiety indicators were already published by the Office for National Statistics, adding: ""We have regular time-use surveys which could be used to create something like what the Greens want. But what would it show, really? ""People might have more time to spend with their families if unemployment rose dramatically. There are different perspectives within the family. ""Using GDP as our prime indicator cannot deal with these concerns, but nor can any other simple measure."" The ONScarried out a survey of leisure time in the UK in 2015,external, which suggested that UK men spent an average of six hours nine minutes a day on leisure activities - while women spent five hours 29 minutes. Most of that time was spent watching TV, listening to music or reading. There has beensome researchwhich suggests that using money to free up time is linked to increased happiness. The coalition government attempted to measure the happiness of UK citizens and the first national well-being surveywas published in 2012.

"This video can not be played Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege: Conflict to blame for rape increase Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege is known as ""Doctor Miracle"" for his ability to repair through reconstructive surgery the horrific damage inflicted on women who have been raped. The 63-year-old Congolese gynaecologist set up the Panzi hospital in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo city of Bukavu nearly 20 years ago - shortly after he had his first experience of treating a woman who had been raped and mutilated by armed men. Dr Mukwege recounted the horrific injury the patient had suffered in a BBC interview, saying the woman had not only been raped but bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs. He, along with his colleagues, have since treated tens of thousands of victims. Panzi hospital now cares for more than 3,500 women a year. Sometimes Dr Mukwege performs as many as 10 operations a day. ""I... started a hospital made from tents. I built a maternity ward with an operating theatre. In 1998, everything was destroyed again. So, I started all over again in 1999,"" he told the BBC in 2013. Dr Mukwege talks to staff and students during a round at the ward for recovering patients Panzi hopsital has since grown to become a major health facility in eastern DR Congo. Its website says it has 370 doctors, nurses and support staff. It serves a population of 400,000 and also treats patients from neighbouring countries. Eastern DR Congo has been wracked by more than two decades of conflict, with numerous armed groups battling for control of the region's rich deposits of gold and other precious minerals. Dr Mukwege says the conflict in DR Congo is being waged to destroy Congolese women Many different militias have been accused of carrying out the indiscriminate rape of the region's women. ""The conflict in DR Congo is not between groups of religious fanatics. Nor is it a conflict between states. This is a conflict caused by economic interests - and it is being waged by destroying Congolese women,"" Dr Mukwege told the BBC. In 2010, a top UN official labelled the country ""the rape capital of the world"". In September 2012, in a speech at the UN, Dr Mukwege criticised President Joseph Kabila's government and other countries for not doing enough to stop what he called ""an unjust war that has used violence against women and rape as a strategy of war"". The following month he was targeted by gunmen who broke into his home and briefly held his daughters hostage. According to his organisation's website,,externalhis trusted friend and security guard was killed during the attack. He later fled with his family to Sweden, then to Belgium. He returned home in 2013 following a campaign by local women who raised funds to pay for his return ticket. ""After that gesture, I couldn't really say no. And also, I am myself determined to help fight these atrocities, this violence."" ""My life has had to change, since returning. I now live at the hospital and I take a number of security precautions, so I have lost some of my freedom,"" he told the BBC's Outlook programme in 2013. Dr Mukwege currently lives under the permanent protection of UN peacekeepers at his hospital. He told the Nobel committee in a brief interview that he was in the operating theatre when the news of the prize came through. ""It was when I was operating and I heard people start to cry and it was so, so surprising,"" he said. ""I can see in the face of many women how they are happy to be recognised and this is really so touching,"" he added. A picture of Dr Mukwege and the staff of Panzi hospital celebrating the Nobel win has been shared on Twitter: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Crowds gathered at the hospital cheered and ululated to celebrate the prize which Dr Mukwege said was dedicated to the many women who were victims of sexual violence. Although he has fallen out with DR Congo's government, its spokesman Lambert Mende congratulated Dr Mukwege. ""We have had differences with [him] every time that he tried to politicise his work, which however is important from a humanitarian standpoint. But now, we are satisfied with the Nobel Academy's recognition of the work of a compatriot,"" Mr Mende told AFP news agency. Dr Mukwege was born in 1955 in Bukavu. He went to medical school across the border in Burundi and later studied gynaecology and obstetrics at the University of Angers in France. He was inspired to become a doctor after numerous visits to see the sick with his preacher father. He has received many other international awards, including the 2008 UN Human Rights Prize.

"Hundreds of people are killed by police in the US each year, and much attention has been paid recently to the high proportion that are black. But there's another disturbing trend that is rarely discussed. It was shortly after 05:00 when three West Milwaukee police officers broke into the home of 22-year-old Adam Trammell to find him naked and bewildered, standing in his bathtub as water from the shower ran down his body. Adam, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, was having some form of breakdown. A neighbour had called 911 to report that she had seen him naked in the corridor, talking about the devil. She thought Adam's name was Brandon, and told police this when they arrived at the building. According to his father, Larry Trammell, Adam often had delusions and hallucinations. He would take showers to help him calm down when he felt anxious. Adam was not armed and he did not appear to behave in a threatening manner. But he did not leave the shower as the police commanded. The officers then fired their Tasers at him 15 times, administering long, painful electric shocks as he screamed and writhed in the bathtub. Then more officers arrived, and after dragging him, still naked, from his apartment, they held him down and he was injected with sedatives - midazolam at first, and then ketamine. Moments later, Adam stopped breathing. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead soon after arrival. The date was 25 May 2017. We know this is how events unfolded because the incident was caught on cameras worn by the officers. ""I could barely stand to watch it,"" Adam's mother Kathleen says of the footage. ""He was being brutally tortured and screaming out in agony and I could feel the pain, almost. It was like a nightmare with my son as the victim."" Kathleen is at a loss to explain why the police behaved the way they did. ""He was just in his own place, he was not out on the streets, he didn't have a weapon. He didn't even have any clothes on, in his own shower. Where was the imminent danger? There was none. He didn't deserve it at all,"" she tells me, wiping tears from her eyes. Larry thinks his son may have believed the police were a hallucination. The officers who found him in the bathroom addressed him as ""Brandon"", not ""Adam"", because this was the name they were given by the neighbour. ""By them calling him by a different name, he was thinking, 'This ain't real,'"" says Larry. At one point Adam splashed water at the officers, something Larry says he might have done as a test to find out whether they really existed. Even the police acknowledge Adam had not committed a crime and was not suspected of committing one. So why did it happen? The police say they broke into the apartment solely to help Adam. They say they acted the way they did to restrain him and get him medical care. In spite of the footage, Milwaukee's District Attorney John Chisholm went so far as to rule that ""there was no basis to conclusively link Mr Trammell's death to the actions taken by the police officers"". No officers were prosecuted. There was no national media attention and there were no riots or protest marches. Almost unnoticed, Adam became part of a disturbing statistic that is rarely  talked about - the high proportion of disabled people among the hundreds who die after interactions with US police each year. Conservative estimates suggest that about a quarter of those who die in these interactions have a disability - whether mental, intellectual or physical. But other research indicates that the proportion may be far greater. Already in 2018, across the US, at least 136 people with a disability are known to have been killed by police officers, according to a database maintained by the Washington Post and analysis of local media reports. In many countries the police would be the last resort when people are going through mental health crises but in the US, they are often the first to respond because of the lack of more specialised agencies. And when I began to look at these interactions between police and disabled people in different parts of the country, clear patterns began to emerge. Adam's story may be extreme, but some aspects of it are repeated time and time again. Ethan Saylor, 26, had Down's syndrome. On the evening of 12 January 2013, in Frederick County, Maryland, he was at the cinema with his carer, watching the film Zero Dark Thirty. He was fascinated by its CIA characters and applauded the end of the movie, insisting he did not want to go home. Instead, he wanted to see the film again. Ethan and his carer left the auditorium but he refused to leave the building. His carer went to bring her car around, hoping this would persuade him, but Ethan went back into the cinema to the same seat in which he'd watched the film. In the carer's absence, three off-duty police officers who were working as security staff in their spare time heard someone was in the cinema without a ticket for the next showing. ""At some point it becomes, 'You need to leave or you are going to be arrested,'"" says Ethan's mother, Patti, who sat through the evidence given in a subsequent investigation. Ethan apparently told the officers he was a CIA agent and was not going anywhere. ""So the officers put their arms under his arms to lift him up and remove him from the theatre,"" says Patti. Ethan, crying out for his mother, was restrained and handcuffed. ""Somehow in the next seconds or minutes, Ethan ends up on the floor face down and not breathing,"" Patti says. Attempts to resuscitate him failed. Initially she thought he had died as a result of some unexplained medical complication. ""I believe it was two weeks later when we were called to the sheriff's department,"" Patti tells me. ""The autopsy report was back and they told us the medical examiner had ruled this a homicide and that he had died of asphyxiation. ""That was the most dramatic and traumatic moment in all of this - realising he had been killed."" Ethan had idolised police officers, even wanting to become one. He frequently called 911 just so he could meet officers and see the squad car pull up to his house. In the weeks leading up to his death, Patti had visited the local sheriff's office with cookies to thank the deputies for being so patient with Ethan. Now he had died in a confrontation with some of the same officers. ""I took a step back and thought about how ridiculous it was for a young man to lose his life over the cost of a movie ticket. There was no reason for that to occur,"" says Patti. ""What is the state of mind for a law enforcement officer that they would literally intervene physically with someone with Down's syndrome to the point of their death?"" Patti says the attitude among some members of her community, even some close to her, was that Ethan must have done something to deserve what happened to him. She says both they and the law enforcement community have made the case that Ethan would still be alive if he had just followed instructions. But therein is precisely the problem - his ability to follow instructions. Ethan, like Adam, did not have this ability. It is a problem that is even more apparent in the case of Magdiel Sanchez, a 35-year-old man who was confronted by police on the porch of his own home in Oklahoma City on 19 September 2017. Police believed he was carrying a weapon - it emerged that it was a section of piping - and shouted instructions at him to drop it, but he did not. The confrontation ended with him being shot dead on his front lawn in front of several of his neighbours. Tragically, Magdiel never heard the police commands - because he was deaf. During the stand-off, neighbours shouted to the officers to tell them this, but they shot him anyway. Surveillance footage from the house across the street shows that at one point Magdiel, holding the pipe, did run towards officers. He then walked away again and moments later, out of view of the cameras, he was killed. ""He was a special needs child and he was deaf and he was real timid. He was an older boy but he was like a child,"" says Regina Smith, who saw the end of the incident from her kitchen window. ""I realised it was him and I thought: 'What could he have done?'"" In fact, police only went to his house because they suspected his father had been involved in a hit-and-run incident, and once there they saw him walking around with the pipe. As I stand outside Magdiel's home, I see one of the neighbours, Kevin Tillery, riding along the street on his bicycle, holding a piece of wood. Tillery says he always carries it for protection against stray dogs and that at a certain point Magdiel decided to copy him. ""He would see me going up and down the street with the stick and one morning he held a stick up (to me) and smiled,"" Tillery tells me. But Oklahoma City Police Department defends the actions of the officers. ""Nobody disputes neighbours were yelling that he was deaf,"" says William Citty, Oklahoma City's police chief. But he adds: ""He understood that they were police officers. That's why we wear uniforms."" Police Chief Citty does not accept that Magdiel's deafness and the extent of his learning difficulties mean the officers should have behaved differently. He says his officers feared being hit with the piping and acted in self-defence. ""It's our job to be able to respond to situations in a manner which creates the best outcome,"" he says. ""That may include the use of lethal force. ""Under the circumstances at that moment, with what they had to work with, it was the best possible outcome."" As in the cases of Adam and Ethan, none of the officers involved have been prosecuted. Data concerning the number of disabled people who are killed by police in the US is hard to come by. Researchers are left to go through media reports of individual cases from around the country. The figures are not officially collected at national level. The current estimate of 136 for this year may therefore be a gross underestimate. In hundreds more cases it was never determined whether the person killed had a disability at all. And there may be other cases that are not reported or that the researchers failed to spot. This was an issue before President Donald Trump was elected. But his administration has signalled that there will be fewer investigations into police departments when things go wrong, arguing that federal oversight of local police departments reduces morale among police officers. So what of the officers who have taken the life of someone in these circumstances? One is Sgt Corey Nooner, who told me about the moment near a school, 15 years ago, when he shot and killed a woman who had schizophrenia. ""I was forced into a situation where I didn't have any other choice,"" he says, becoming visibly emotional. ""We were outside the school, she had a knife and she wasn't responding to my instructions,"" he says. Nooner says that given the same circumstances today, he would do exactly the same thing. ""I have to make sure I go home to my family at night,"" he says. But it is clear that the incident had a profound impact on him. ""After the incident was over, I was told that she had a history of mental illness. I didn't know that at the time. I didn't understand what was going on at the time,"" he says. He is angered, though, by any suggestion that American police may be too ready to use lethal force. ""Who would welcome that kind of encounter?"" he says. ""The reality is that no-one wants to be involved in that moment when they have to point to a weapon at another individual and pull the trigger."" So why are so many disabled people killed by the police? All police in the US are, of course, armed. There is also the very real prospect that they could face criminals who are, too. Across the US, 40 officers have been shot dead so far this year. So a large proportion of police training is geared towards the use of firearms and personal protection.  But critics say this creates a police culture that is excessively confrontational, particularly in certain types of neighbourhoods. An area that has seen a spate of disabled people killed in interactions with officers is Chicago's South Side - one of the most heavily policed areas in the US. The complaint from many there is that officers too often employ a ""command and control"" style of policing, especially in low-income areas - shouting commands and physically dominating, particularly when someone doesn't immediately comply. This can sometimes, very quickly, lead the police to use guns. The problem is - as we know from the cases of Adam, Ethan and Magdiel - that there may be reasons why it is harder for some people to comply with commands shouted at them. Candace Coleman, who has cerebral palsy, is an organiser with Access Living, an advocacy group for people with disabilities. She grew up in the South Side of Chicago and works with people there who are disabled, particularly those diagnosed with schizophrenia and autism. ""If they do encounter police, it's a scary situation,"" she says, saying any confrontation with a police officer could lead to extreme panic and confusion in those with similar challenges to those of the young people she works with. ""'Who is this person with a gun?'"", they might ask themselves, she says. ""'Why are the lights flashing?' 'What are these loud sounds?'"" Being ordered to stand in a certain way - for instance, with their hands where they can be seen - or to look an officer in the eye can also be a problem, she says. So can being touched or grabbed by an officer. ""If I'm not used to that, then I'm going to respond in a way that would look as if I'm being defiant,"" she adds. That all rings true for Larry Trammell, Adam's father. ""There were times when you couldn't touch Adam,"" Larry says.  ""He [could get] really withdrawn or get excited, so I always knew when I dealt with Adam, I was to stay back and let him talk. ""If I went in there and just used my authority as a father and said 'You have to do this' - it just didn't work."" After weeks of trying, I finally manage to speak to the Milwaukee District Attorney, John Chisholm, who ruled Adam did not die as a result of the actions of the officers who used Tasers on him numerous times. ""They are not doing this because they wanted to harm Adam. It's the exact opposite, right?"" says Chisholm. ""Their expressed intent, any number of times, is that they were there to help him. That they wanted to get him out of that situation."" I put it to Chisholm that they had, indeed, been saying that they wanted to help Adam, but they did so as they were issuing electric shocks - that they had their Tasers drawn even before they entered his home, even though he was in a building where others with mental illness lived. And I point out that the officers started Tasering him moments after the encounter started. ""Right, because they had to get him under control, so they could get him some medical attention,"" the district attorney repeats. Lawyers for Adam's family highlight many other breaches of police guidelines that, for example, say someone should not be exposed to more than 15 seconds of cumulative electric shocks using a Taser. They point out the terrible injuries, including broken ribs, that the post-mortem showed Adam had sustained. The guidelines say that police encountering someone in a mental health crisis should ""avoid increasing the subject's agitation or excitement, avoid physical engagement, avoid restraint and attempt to calm down the subject."" And yet the district attorney ruled that the behaviour of the officers had not been negligent or abusive. ""Not based on their training,"" he says. ""The decision that they have to make is - what's the appropriate means to get him under control so that they can get him the medical attention at that point and time?"" Chisholm insists that Adam may have died anyway because of his health crisis - and that the officers' choice was either to do what they did, or do nothing. ""I would have liked it to have gone to trial,"" says Adam's father, Larry. ""If it had gone to trial and they had found the officers innocent, it still would have been hard, but we didn't even get that."" Police officers are prosecuted in very few cases involving the deaths of disabled people. They are presumed to have acted in good faith and often given legal protection on that basis. Adam's case illustrates how police in the US are often called on to do a job that trained medical professionals would be far better placed to handle. ""Our calls concerning mental health from 2012 to 2016 have more than tripled,"" says Citty, Oklahoma City's police chief, whose officers shot dead Magdiel Sanchez. ""This society has not effectively dealt with mental health. They haven't provided the dollars for treatment,"" he says. ""Officers are running from call to call to call dealing with this."" So if the police are to be the first to be called, how can things improve? ""I have to tell you, if you don't know someone with Down's syndrome, you are missing out,"" says Patti Saylor, Ethan's mother, as she trains a group of police officers in how to interact better with disabled people. She is trying to turn the devastation caused by the death of her son into something positive, using her own horrific personal experience. ""Ethan didn't have the cognitive ability to recognise those officers needed an explanation,"" she tells the room. ""Like, 'Officer it's OK, I'm going to sit in the seat and watch this movie a second time, my mom is on her way, she'll pay for the ticket when she gets here.' He didn't understand he should do that."" Patti tells me that she is sometimes struck by the level of ignorance about disability among officers, but that this simply mirrors the lack of awareness in society as a whole. ""I have been asked questions like 'You mean they are not all the same?' or 'So they are not out to hurt us?'"" she says of officers she has trained. Officers often apologise to her when they hear her story and display some degree of shame about what happened, she says. But the Frederick County Sheriff's Office, whose deputies were involved in Ethan's death, has not engaged with Patti. It did agree a financial settlement with her but never apologised or admitted any wrongdoing. Oklahoma City Police may defend the death of Magdiel Sanchez on his front lawn, but it is clear that the department has tried to make changes since the incident - offering more training to officers on how to approach disabled people. The force deploys these specially trained officers to incidents where their skills will be useful. One is Sgt Corey Nooner - the same officer who, 15 years ago, says he was forced to shoot and kill a woman with schizophrenia. That experience pushed him to try to understand mental illness better and he underwent a considerable amount of additional training. I go out on patrol with him as he is dispatched to a home in an affluent neighbourhood in Oklahoma City. A man has called to say that his wife, who has recently been discharged from a medical facility, is having a manic episode and experiencing paranoia and delusions. At their home, Nooner patiently listens as the woman talks, visibly distressed, about how she is being watched by government agencies. Ultimately, though, after she refuses to accompany him to see a psychiatrist and when she tries to dive into her bedroom, he restrains and handcuffs her. Later, he tells me he had feared she might try to arm herself and that his basic police instincts kicked in. For many, the nub of the problem is the way police are taught to interact from the very beginning - with so much emphasis on firearms training and personal protection, and relatively little on de-escalating confrontations. As things stand, the deaths and injuries of people with disabilities at the hands of the police have left some of the people Candace Coleman works with in Chicago's South Side wondering who might be next, she says. Some of them have made pacts never to call the police under any circumstances, she adds, so worried are they that harm could come to them. Coleman says they've also got together in groups to discuss what they can do to protect themselves in any interactions with the police. ""Extra disability training for police is one thing but is not enough,"" she says. ""We need a cultural shift across the board."" ""The way in which they approach situations needs to change. It shouldn't always be that the immediate reaction is to pull out your gun or your Taser or to yell or scream,"" she adds. Until that happens, some of the most vulnerable people in US society will be left to work things out for themselves.

"Fewer homes have been on the market in 2018 than in any year of the past decade, the UK's biggest mortgage lender has said. The Halifax said,externalhouse-hunters have been left with relatively little choice, which means that prices have still risen as a result. House prices rose by 2.5% in the year to the end of September, with the average home costing Â£225,995, it said. However, this rate of growth is slowing, down from 3.7% in August. Russell Galley, managing director of the Halifax, said that low mortgage rates and more people in work meant that demand for homes remained steady. However, economic uncertainty and the squeeze on wages mean the rate of price rises is far from the runaway growth seen before the financial crisis. House prices actually fell by 1.4% in September compared with the previous month. The month-on-month change is considered to be a much more volatile measure, but this is the second drop in a row.

""The concern is that legions of Brits didn't get back from holiday and head straight out again to the estate agent like they normally do. The back to work bounce is nowhere to be seen."" Russell Quirk, chief executive of Emoov, said: ""With stock levels at their lowest in a decade, we need more on the menu to fuel the UK property market machine."" The figures come shortly after rival lender,the Nationwide, said property values had risen by 2% annually,externalin September, a rate unchanged from August.

"Co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley were elected in September People's free time should be recorded as a way to measure the UK's ""well-being"", the Green Party says. The party is calling for a ""Free Time Index"" and says that time spent outside work and commuting is a better measure of how well the UK is doing than GDP. Co-leader Sian Berry told the BBC work-life balance was ""in crisis"" and more people were working while commuting. The party also said it wanted paid training leave for all workers to boost skills and reduce staff turnover. Calling for new free time indicators to be included in the next Budget, Ms Berry told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Work-life balance is an incredibly important indicator of people's well-being and it is in crisis at the moment. Bartley and Berry elected co-leaders ""People are constantly 'on', even when they are commuting. There's an enormous amount of unpaid caring going on which doesn't get measured, which doesn't leave people with very much free time either. We have got a mental health crisis and we think we should be measuring this."" She added that other indicators of a healthy society should be measured, like ""resource use, housing affordability and health"". ""It should be used as a more important indicator than GDP of how our country is doing,"" Ms Berry said, arguing it could then be used to inform policy. The Green co-leaders say ""true freedom"" is about having control of your own time Pressed on whether Green policies, which include a four-day working week, would mean less money to invest in infrastructure and public services, she said people with more fulfilling work and more free time could be more productive. The Green Party failed to make its hoped-for breakthrough in the 2017 general election, as its vote was squeezed by Labour. But it made headway in May's council elections, adding eight seats. Last year the party announced afour-day working week policy,external, amounting to a maximum of 35 hours, andthere have been reports,externalsuggesting Labour is considering a similar policy, as a way of sharing technological advances with staff. In Friday's speech to the Greens' autumn conference in Bristol, Ms Berry promised ""radical common sense for the common good"" and said her party was a real alternative to Labour as ""we go further and we do it better"". She said the momentum behind calls for a referendum on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations ""feels absolutely unstoppable"" while her co-leader Jonathan Bartley described Brexit as a ""pitiful charade"". Mr Bartley called for a total ""system overhaul"" in response to the threat from climate change, adding: ""We won't debate with climate-change deniers because there isn't time"". In response to the Greens' free time proposals, Len Shackleton, research fellow at the free market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ""GDP is not the only measure of how well the country is doing, but it is the most useful for comparisons with other countries and with the UK over time."" He said life satisfaction, happiness and anxiety indicators were already published by the Office for National Statistics, adding: ""We have regular time-use surveys which could be used to create something like what the Greens want. But what would it show, really? ""People might have more time to spend with their families if unemployment rose dramatically. There are different perspectives within the family. ""Using GDP as our prime indicator cannot deal with these concerns, but nor can any other simple measure."" The ONScarried out a survey of leisure time in the UK in 2015,external, which suggested that UK men spent an average of six hours nine minutes a day on leisure activities - while women spent five hours 29 minutes. Most of that time was spent watching TV, listening to music or reading. There has beensome researchwhich suggests that using money to free up time is linked to increased happiness.

"The officer was ""deliberately driven at"" and injured in Bradbourne Road An armed police officer investigating an assault has been seriously injured in a ""deliberate"" hit-and-run. Three men, aged 25, 21 and 20, were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and remain in custody. The officer suffered serious head injuries on Bradbourne Road, Leicester, on Friday morning, but his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening. Police had been attending reports of an assault and someone armed with a gun in Belvoir Street before the incident. Four men, two aged 20 and two aged 19, who were arrested on suspicion of affray have been released pending further investigations.

"This video can not be played Footage of the attack on Sir Robert drew gasps when it was shown in court A man who pushed a former Eurotunnel boss on to Tube tracks in central London has been found guilty of attempted murder. Sir Robert Malpas went ""flying"" from the platform at Marble Arch Station when he was shoved by Paul Crossley. The 91-year-old industrialist was rescued by a bystander but suffered a fractured pelvis and a head wound. An Old Bailey jury found Crossley, 46, of Leyton, east London, guilty of two counts of attempted murder. The second related to an unsuccessful attempt to push another passenger, Tobias French, on to the tracks at Tottenham Court Road station earlier on 27 April. Sir Robert watched proceedings from the public gallery and could be seen sobbing after the jury left, BBC Journalist Jeremy Britton reported from court. CCTV footage of the attack drew gasps from the court's public gallery when it was played in court for the first time. In it, Sir Robert can be seen walking along the platform, wearing a brown Burberry raincoat, suit and tie, and carrying an umbrella. He is then approached from behind by Crossley, who sends him sprawling on to the tracks with a two-handed push. Paul Crossley said his victims were chosen at random but claimed he had not intended to kill them. In a statement read in court, Sir Robert, who was knighted by the Queen in 1998, said: ""I felt myself flying over the tracks and landing on the rails."" He was rescued by passer-by Riyad El Hussani, who leapt from the platform to save him with one minute until the next train. Prosecutor Benjamin Aina QC said: ""Mr El Hussani bravely left where he was stood and ran down the platform and then jumped down on to the tracks."" ""As he landed he threw his hand forward to stop himself falling and he briefly touched the electrified track, causing a burn to his right hand."" The court heard members of the public pulled Sir Robert back on to the platform after Mr El Hussani managed to get him to the edge. Sir Robert Malpas, 91, was left with a fractured pelvis after being pushed on to the tracks Mr French, the court heard, managed to keep his balance when he was earlier pushed by Crossley as a train pulled in to Tottenham Court Road station. The defendant told the court he meant ""to scare"" Mr French, who had ""looked at me a bit funny"". Crossley told jurors his victims were chosen at random but claimed he had not intended to kill them. He had taken crack cocaine the previous day, the court heard, and began feeling paranoid as he made his way to the West End to get coffee. He said he was having a panic attack at the time he attacked Sir Robert, intending to ""push him over on to the floor"". Crossley had previously admitted the lesser charge of attempting to wound with intent against Sir Robert. He had denied an alternative count of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to Mr French. Crossley, who was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia when he was 17 years old, will be sentenced on 9 November after a psychiatric report has been prepared. Det Insp Darren Gough, of the British Transport Police, said: ""We could have easily been dealing with a double murder investigation had it not been for the brave actions of the public who stepped in and restrained Mr Crossley, and assisted the victims. ""I would like to remind the public that this type of incident is very rare and millions of journeys are made across the Underground without incident.""

"Fewer homes have been on the market in 2018 than in any year of the past decade, the UK's biggest mortgage lender has said. The Halifax said,externalhouse-hunters have been left with relatively little choice, which means that prices have still risen as a result. House prices rose by 2.5% in the year to the end of September, with the average home costing Â£225,995, it said. However, this rate of growth is slowing, down from 3.7% in August. Russell Galley, managing director of the Halifax, said that low mortgage rates and more people in work meant that demand for homes remained steady. However, economic uncertainty and the squeeze on wages mean the rate of price rises is far from the runaway growth seen before the financial crisis. House prices actually fell by 1.4% in September compared with the previous month. The month-on-month change is considered to be a much more volatile measure, but this is the second drop in a row. Half of twenty-somethings have no savings Your biggest financial decision - in 10 charts Where does rent hit young people the hardest in Britain? ""September is a month that normally sees a burst of activity as people return from holiday and go back to work. So a fall of this scale is quite a retreat,"" said Lucy Pendleton, founder director of independent estate agents James Pendleton. ""The concern is that legions of Brits didn't get back from holiday and head straight out again to the estate agent like they normally do. The back to work bounce is nowhere to be seen."" Russell Quirk, chief executive of Emoov, said: ""With stock levels at their lowest in a decade, we need more on the menu to fuel the UK property market machine."" The figures come shortly after rival lender,the Nationwide, said property values had risen by 2% annually,externalin September, a rate unchanged from August. The building society said the Yorkshire and Humberside area saw annual house price growth of 5.8% in the third quarter of the year - the biggest regional rise in the UK.

" When I was eight, my cousin had a baby. My Mum knew I loved babies so she dropped me off at her house for a few days “to help”. I must have been useful because when another cousin had one, I was dispatched again. I walked the babies up and down the hall and deflected swipes from jealous siblings. I helped with the bath-and-bed routine for our neighbour. I couldn’t wait to be 12 when I could babysit for all the kids in the village. I couldn’t wait to be a mother myself. But by 29 I had cervical cancer. The operation I needed to save my life would rob me of my chance to carry a child. I found another operation in a medical paper that would allow me that chance - I found a consultant who could do it. When my referral didn’t come through I just turned up to beg. Several gruelling years of IVF and miscarriage followed. And then finally, one Thursday morning, the baby I had longed for was wriggling around in my last scheduled ultrasound scan. The midwives waved me off wishing me good luck for the birth. When I was eight, my cousin had a baby. My Mum knew I loved babies so she dropped me off at her house for a few days “to help”.

Several gruelling years of IVF and miscarriage followed. And then finally, one Thursday morning, the baby I had longed for was wriggling around in my last scheduled ultrasound scan. The midwives waved me off wishing me good luck for the birth. That afternoon I was at work eating a piece of lemon drizzle cake to mark a colleague’s leaving do when I felt hot gushing liquid soak through my trousers. My waters had broken two months early. The hospital admitted me and said we had to delay labour for as long as possible, allowing the baby to grow stronger. Ten days later they said we were doing well and could go home the next day. But shortly after midnight, the umbilical cord dropped through me, compressing my baby’s supply of oxygen and nutrients. In the six minutes it took to get to the operating theatre, nurses running and shouting, wheeling my bed through empty corridors, our baby died. I didn’t sleep for 48 hours. I paced. I refused drugs. My precious longed-for baby was curled and silent in my womb - the cord that had bound us hung from me. When my feet ached from pacing I lay on my side facing Tim, my partner. I remembered a story of a mother who was told her baby had died, but was born healthy. I rang the buzzer to summon a nurse, I asked if they could have got it wrong. Twenty minutes later my partner rang the same bell, asked the same question. They gave me a C-section the next morning. As I breathed through the mask and felt the anaesthetic injected into my vein I thought: “I have dreamt of looking into my child’s face for 30 years, and when I wake, I will.” When she - a baby girl - was given to me, my heart expanded in love. She was beautiful - 30cm tip to toe. She had been dressed in a little white dress and hat, and draped in a white hand-knitted blanket. Her fingers and toes rested neatly in perfection. She was long-limbed like us both. We named her Willow. I imagined I heard Tim’s heart shatter when he said her name. I looked at her in wonder. I couldn’t understand why she was dead. The midwives and doctors came. There were no answers to our questions. Maybe they weren’t the right questions. We were at the edge of the delivery wing, and I had to listen to women in labour and to the mewling newborns. My arms ached. I thought I had a blood clot, but the doctors told me it was normal - a biological response to the shock that there was no living child for me to hold. I sobbed. My milk came through, marking my T-shirt, and I was too exhausted to be embarrassed.

In the bereavement suite there was a kitchen, to make cups of tea I couldn’t imagine any bereaved parent could ever stomach. I found myself looking at the cleaning rota - such a stark reminder of the other families who had been there. I thought of their loss. I focused on their survival. Stillbirth is much more common than people might think but it’s rarely talked about because pregnancy is a time of joy and hope. We stayed another four nights, our daughter in a refrigerated cot. No-one ever suggested we left but I knew when it was time. I couldn’t bring myself to say goodbye to the midwives who sat with us through that night, who dressed our daughter for us. There were no words of thanks big enough, so they just cried, and we cried, and nodded our heads and left. We had two matching cuddly lambs in hospital - one that we slept with, one for Willow in her crib. On the drive home I clutched our lamb, damp with tears. I whispered words to it and imagined my daughter could hear them. Grief folded and stretched time. The midwives had reminded us we were legally required to register Willow’s birth. So one day we travelled to a register office and an official asked quiet sad questions. We left holding legal proof she was here, she was real. Birth and death shared the paper, the only document she will ever have. Post piled up and I looked away from it, from other people’s kindness and awkwardness. Some friends came. Some family. I put my maternity jeans back on and exchanged platitudes, but there was nothing anyone could say so I went back to bed. We planned a funeral in place of a christening. Dry-eyed (there seemed to be nothing left), I delivered a eulogy to a crematorium filled with weeping family. The flowers were too big for the little lid of Willow’s casket. We asked them not to close the curtains at the end. When I finally managed to leave I carved off part of my soul to stay with her, my first child.

Two weeks later Tim returned to the sanctuary of work and I was left alone in the house. Our grief took different paths, and my loneliness and isolation increased. I scared myself reading about the rates of relationship breakdown after the death of a child, and decided to find a bereavement counsellor. I found a lot of help on offer for mothers, very little for fathers, but eventually found someone who would help us together, and whom we still see now. My period came and I raged at the betrayal of my body. I deleted friends on Facebook who had healthy babies the same age as Willow, or friends pregnant with a second or third child. The algorithms made social media a dark place for me, with adverts for baby food, prams and clothes flooding my feed. I became angry, bitter and withdrawn. One day I took three trains to a house in the far north-east corner of England to visit my 103-year-old grandmother, Nancy. I let myself in and sat at her feet, my head in her lap. She herself had a stillborn baby more than 60 years ago. She stroked my hair and said she was “sorry about the baby” - the baby she didn’t know we originally planned to name after her. It was the hardest visit I made and yet somehow it was the start of my healing. I did a lot of sleuthing. I applied for my notes from all the hospitals I’ve been treated in over the last decade and researched every stage of my medical treatment and pregnancy, cross-referencing and breaking the codes of doctors’ scribbles. At the heart of my obsession was guilt, a fear that somehow the stillbirth was my fault. A fear that was wrong, but that other parents of stillborn babies seem to feel too. I found a nine-week-old puppy and brought her home. She weighed 2kg, the weight of a newborn. Her needs made me feel useful. During night-time toilet trips we stood shivering in the dark, and she jumped at me like a child wanting to be picked up. When I called across the park for her, I occasionally called her Willow. Christmas loomed but I averted my eyes, hastily shoving money into cards for nieces and nephews. We escaped the dreams of our first family Christmas by hiring a remote shepherd’s hut in Suffolk. We walked miles every day, taking it in turns to carry our puppy. On Christmas Eve I went to a magical midnight Mass in a small rural church. I cried silently throughout the service. The old lady next to me, a stranger, reached out to hold my hand. Two weeks later Tim returned to the sanctuary of work and I was left alone in the house.

The old lady next to me, a stranger, reached out to hold my hand. A stillborn baby provides the mother with the same rights and protection as a newborn baby, and as I was entitled to maternity leave, I took it, returning after four months. Work was an easier place than home. I could hide from my loss. And so good did I become at compartmentalising that I was occasionally surprised by colleagues asking if I had had a boy or a girl. I got used to replying “my daughter was stillborn”, and then patting them on the arm and saying “it’s OK, please don’t worry”. In the long evenings at home I drank too much red wine. I watched Modern Family on a loop. But throughout the winter, there were glimmers of hope, like the snowdrops bravely poking their heads up. Some days I could feel positive again, some days I could see my friends and laugh. Sometimes I was ready to smile when Tim opened the front door. Many times I think we both just tried, not for ourselves, but for each other. My coping mechanisms are all about doing stuff and so I planned a part of our garden to dedicate to Willow, buying graph paper and poring over garden design books. We started landscaping in the coldest wettest week in February. We hired a 1.5 tonne digger. Friends and family came to help us in snow and frost, in driving rain, forking through piles of wet soil and stones to remove weeds. Our joyful little puppy Pina played in the mud at our feet and then stamped paw prints all over the kitchen floor. I found an artist to make a sculpture out of willow branches. We visited favourite beaches to collect stones to pave the path. We exhausted ourselves with manual work. In the week leading up to Mother’s Day, I stood watching the children leave the local village school. On the day itself, I opened the door to the nursery for the first time. I unfolded and refolded the babygros, and then lay down on the floor with the last one, placing it between my collar bone and navel. The dust motes floated in the afternoon sunlight. I thought of the email telling me the curtains for the nursery were waiting. When I had replied that we no longer needed them, they had simply written back: “We will send when you are ready.” I wondered if the saleswoman herself had lost a baby. I cried and cried and eventually fell asleep. When I woke up it was dark. I found two Mother’s Day cards. One from my Mum, the other from Tim, saying that I was and will always be a brilliant mother to Willow. From that day on, I left the nursery door open, and the air now circulates better through our house. We prepared for Willow’s first birthday by planning a party in her garden to raise funds for  stillborn charities. One of the charities we want to help provides memory boxes to hospitals for bereaved parents. We were given one for Willow and I found the courage to look at it again. A stillborn baby provides the mother with the same rights and protection as a newborn baby, and as I was entitled to maternity leave, I took it, returning after four months.

We visited favourite beaches to collect stones to pave the path. We exhausted ourselves with manual work. In the week leading up to Mother’s Day, I stood watching the children leave the local village school. On the day itself, I opened the door to the nursery for the first time. I unfolded and refolded the babygros, and then lay down on the floor with the last one, placing it between my collar bone and navel. The dust motes floated in the afternoon sunlight. I thought of the email telling me the curtains for the nursery were waiting. When I had replied that we no longer needed them, they had simply written back: “We will send when you are ready.” I wondered if the saleswoman herself had lost a baby. I cried and cried and eventually fell asleep. When I woke up it was dark. I found two Mother’s Day cards. One from my Mum, the other from Tim, saying that I was and will always be a brilliant mother to Willow. From that day on, I left the nursery door open, and the air now circulates better through our house. We prepared for Willow’s first birthday by planning a party in her garden to raise funds for stillborn charities. One of the charities we want to help provides memory boxes to hospitals for bereaved parents. We were given one for Willow and I found the courage to look at it again. This is what was inside: A white knitted blanket Willow’s hospital bracelet Photos of Willow when she was born Willow’s foot imprints A babygro from Willow’s nursery. Some of these things had been in the box when I received it, others I had added myself. I wanted to find other women who would understand the power of this box. In the weeks leading up to Willow’s birthday I began a journey around the UK to visit bereaved women who were connected with these five objects. Here are their stories: Val Isherwood runs the Tigerlily Trust, which provides hospitals with blankets, wraps and gowns for stillborn babies Everything went great with my pregnancy until probably 16 or 17 weeks. We got that phone call that started with: “Are you on your own?” The hospital told me my baby had something called Edwards’ syndrome and not to expect her to live past 28 weeks. She got to 32 weeks, and then I was getting something out of one of the bureau drawers in the lounge and felt a stab of pain. We went into hospital and her heartbeat had stopped. Even though we tried to prepare for that moment I can't really remember much about that day. I remember them saying they would give me this tablet and I'd go home and come back the next morning. I went through this phase later on where I thought: ‘Was I ever pregnant?’ I suddenly felt very scared that I had a dead body inside me and how cruel it was to send me home. But I'm so glad for that time, because it gave us that last night together. And come Tuesday morning I didn’t want to go back into hospital. I just wanted to keep her forever safe inside and felt like no-one should take her from me. But that time in hospital was just beautiful. Friends came and met Lily which was really important, because I went through this phase later on where I thought: “Was I ever pregnant?” I'd bought clothes for her early on in the pregnancy, and they were far too big, so we didn't have anything to put her in, and the hospital didn't offer us anything. So when I was in early labour we went out into town and the only thing we could find was a little T-shirt, and my Mum sewed it in the hospital into a little dress. One of my regrets is that the dress was cremated with her - I really wish that I still had what she'd been wearing. That's why now we give outfits in matching pairs so that parents can keep the one the baby has worn. We tried to have another baby as soon as we could after Lily, and we did think about IVF, but with my age the odds were stacked against me. I was 46 at the time and I didn't think I could go through all that and it not work out. So I thought a lot about acceptance - my message to myself was if it's not meant to be then that's my story. I knew I needed to find positive ways to channel all that love and energy that would have gone into raising Lily. Everything to do with the Tigerlily Trust is inspired by what I wish had been there for me. So I started appealing for knitters who would help us create the clothes I wished I had been given. People then asked if they could donate their wedding dresses to turn into little gowns, so we've got a lovely seamstress on the Isle of Man who makes them. Some of the women who had a stillborn baby before we existed were just told to go and buy a doll's dress which they felt was so insulting. Now a lot of the parents who get in touch can't believe someone has gone to those lengths to knit something to put their baby in and to give them that dignity. I have about 380 names on my list of people who have contributed in some way. Some of them are grandmas whose daughters have lost babies. My advice to other parents going through this is let yourself grieve hard. Don't be afraid of your grief - share it with people. That's almost precious time before the world sort of expects you to be OK. Let yourself have that time. Rachel Hayden runs Gifts of Remembrance, which trains midwives to take photos of stillborn babies- this section contains an image of her son Rowan who was stillborn Rowan was one of triplets, which was a bit of a surprise to me at 40 with two kids already. But the interesting thing is that when I found out I was pregnant I got a sense of him, so I felt like I already knew who he was. I went in for a scan at 31 weeks and they discovered there was no heartbeat for him. It’s a moment which I’m sure all parents of stillborn babies relate to. There’s just that stillness on the monitor. We can end up grieving not only for the fact our babies died, but... for the fact we never saw them I remember the way the nursery nurse spoke to him and handled him and it made me feel I could do the same. So it was “hello and what’s your name?” and “I bet your Mum wants to give you a cuddle”, and all this was great for me because I was utterly clueless. But I didn’t even think to ask to be involved in the memory making. She took him away and took handprints and footprints and dressed him and lay him in his Moses basket, and then took two photos of him lying there. I didn’t know what he really looked like naked or what he was wearing under his little knitted gown, and she took no photographs of him being held - he looked so alone. Although I was remarkably grateful for what I had, I later came across the work of Todd Hochberg, an amazing US photographer, and realised I could have had so much more. Not only was I blown away by the photographs and how emotional they were, but it was the stories they told - and I found myself comparing. What I say to the midwives in the training is you need to think for the future, and guide the parents through a process of gathering up details and stories, and saying: “This may feel too much now but it's going to be important later.” Very little of my training is actually about taking photographs - a big chunk of it is about midwives empowering parents, and saying the right things, and giving them time. I'll talk about how you have photographs that you might share with people, but there are plenty of photographs that just help you remember - every single photograph is going to be of importance to the family. This is actually a therapeutic intervention you are doing to help families make sense of what's happened. You're saying: “This is what happened to you in all its mess.” Midwives and nurses clean things all the time but I say just hand over everything as it is. The most precious thing to me of Rowan's is his hat because it smelt like him, so we challenge that approach. A photo of Rachel's baby, Rowan If you try and protect us then we can end up grieving not only for the fact our babies died,  but we can be grieving for the fact we never saw them. A really poignant story was a mum who said she had never seen her baby girl’s bottom - she said that her other children had birthmarks on their bottoms and she never knew if she had one. When we look back on things there'll be moments that we will even identify in terms of joy, because you're saying hello to your baby, as well as goodbye. Ruth Rodgers used to work in finance but was inspired to retrain as a midwife after the stillbirth of her daughter Scarlett. She has just started her first posting, having qualified this summer. Scarlett was born in November 2011 when I was 31 weeks pregnant. I realised she wasn’t moving so much, but I wasn’t really that worried - I did a full day of work before I went to the hospital. And they couldn't find a heartbeat pretty much straightaway. I had this amazing bereavement midwife, Jane, who I spoke to on the phone. During the two days before I went into labour she told me not to worry about things like funeral arrangements and post-mortems, but just to think about how I wanted to spend time with my little girl - helping me focus on the most important things at the right times. There's some amazing care out there, but there are also some poor things that happen repeatedly that are so easy to fix I also had a brilliant labour ward midwife. It's funny the things that you worry about - I assumed that she would have rigor mortis. I was frightened about how I might feel when I saw her. And she said: “She'll just look like a baby. She'll be a bit small, her skin might be quite thin, and she'll probably not have her eyes open, but otherwise she'll just look like your baby.” That was all I needed to hear to just carry on. Of course there were moments of utter misery, but I also have strangely fond memories of watching Strictly Come Dancing and the X Factor, and eating lasagne with one hand and holding the gas and air with the other! She was born just before six in the morning, and I remember thinking it was amazing that she was still warm and I needed to remember the way that felt because she wouldn’t stay like that. I fell pregnant again seven weeks after I'd had Scarlett, and miscarried again, having miscarried before. And that's when I became really obsessed with how having a baby works, with how all the embryology works. I read textbooks, I read research papers, I emailed professors in recurrent miscarriage - that's the way I approach life. I had another two miscarriages after that, and throughout it all Jane was basically there the whole time and we developed a really special relationship. I guess that’s really where the idea of me training to become a midwife myself started - that supportive relationship between a woman and her midwife. I was lucky enough to go on to have two beautiful boys, one just before I started training, and one in the middle of my degree. The first of these was an incredibly anxious pregnancy, and I received the most fantastic care from Jane, my consultants and my community midwife, all of whom knew my history and understood the way I felt. I could not have got through it without them, without suffering significant mental health consequences. In my third year of training I did a long stint on a labour ward and there was a lady who came in thinking she was in labour, only to find her baby had died. It was incredibly fulfilling to care for that woman and her baby and help her through everything. I think it's rarely appropriate to talk about your own experience to somebody else. If a woman specifically asked me if I’d had a stillbirth then I’d tell them, but I would never volunteer that, because the moment then would become about me and not about them. But I do suggest things that I found helpful, or that I know others did. I've met so many people over the last few years through online groups who've dealt with their grief and the process of having a subsequent baby all very differently. How you deal with having a stillbirth is incredibly personal. There's some amazing care out there, but there are also some poor things that happen repeatedly that are so easy to fix. The classic ones are not reading the mum’s notes before an appointment, or not calling the baby who died by their name. The research very clearly says that grief isn't necessarily related to gestation - there is a link, but actually the link is more to do with the “assignment of personhood”. If you have assigned a person to the baby inside you, you have created a relationship with that person that means that you feel the grief more acutely when they're gone. Publishing graduate Aliyah makes bespoke wall prints through her online shop, which help parents celebrate their baby’s name and birth date and is working on a bespoke memory book. She is expecting another baby at the end of October. One of the hardest parts is that we had bought everything for Aamiya - we had loads of clothes ready, we had her cot set up in the bedroom, everything was washed and ready for her. I had swelling but they just told me it was normal pregnancy swelling. Because I didn’t have any other symptoms I don’t think anyone was overly concerned. And then I woke up one morning and I didn’t feel anything and I just thought I should go and get checked out. And that’s when they told us she’d passed away and I found out I had pre-eclampsia. They told me my blood pressure was really high and there was lots of protein in my urine and they rushed me into delivery really fast. I must have fallen asleep because when I woke up she was already bathed and dressed, and next to me in the refrigerated cot. And that’s one thing I regret  - obviously it wasn’t in my control to stay awake, but I feel like I missed out on dressing her and that time after birth - the little things you always imagined doing for your baby. There’s that awkward moment when people don’t know what to say or do, but with my friends it was OK because they all know me so well, and they made the effort to come round and bring me flowers and chocolates. It was nice to know people cared, even if I didn’t want to speak or do anything. I’ve always been creative, and I first started with the memory book which I’m making for Aamiya. And then I found out about the baby loss community on Instagram. I got talking to a lot of mums from all over - from America, Canada - just sharing stuff that I’d done in my day and projects that I was working on. And then quite a few people started asking if I could make something for their babies too. At some point after Aamiya was born I had this overwhelming feeling of wanting everything in the house to reflect her - for everyone to remember she was here. And I think that was a way of dealing with grief - creating stuff so I could put her around the house. You can spend hours designing things and it just takes your mind off things. There have been times when I’ve thought it isn’t healthy to just be consumed by one moment in time, so I’ve put the memory book project off for a bit and focused on getting back to work and seeing friends more, but there are times when I go back to it. I’m definitely more anxious about being pregnant again since I hit the 30-week mark. At the beginning of my pregnancy, while I was happy and felt blessed that I was able to conceive another child, there were definitely feelings of guilt as you don't want your angel baby thinking they will be forgotten, because they never will be - my partner and I think about Aamiya every single day. However, as time has gone on these feelings of guilt have subsided - I truly believe this baby was sent by Aamiya. It's been a good pregnancy. Anxiety does get the better of me at times but I try and remain positive. My partner and I will make sure this baby grows up knowing all about their big sister Aamiya. Megan Evans began a vlog about stillbirth just weeks after the death of her son Milo - this section contains images of him Before Milo I thought I wasn't maternal - I've got two older brothers who wound me up about pregnancy and how painful childbirth was, so I always said I'm not having children. When the pregnancy test came back positive, I just thought I'm not supposed to have children. Because I was so young and petrified, I went straight on to YouTube and typed in “19 and pregnant” but there wasn't much there. There were a few videos but they were by 19-year-olds who had money. I needed to see someone who was just normal and working class, so the next day I told my Mum I was just going to start vlogging about my own situation. As soon as I started making those videos I had women getting in touch saying they felt the same - how they didn't have their own house and a stable financial situation either. So the vlog all started from there, and I really enjoyed having people get in touch saying “me too” which made me feel comfortable with my situation. And as time went on then everything just fitted into place. It's funny how your maternal instincts just kick in and you wouldn't imagine it any other way. One day I realised that I hadn't felt Milo move all day, and I thought I'd better get checked just in case. The midwife started to monitor me and she couldn’t find a heartbeat. And the sonographer came in, but so did a midwife, a nurse, a doctor, a consultant. So it was a whole string of people standing at the end of my bed and that's when I really clocked that something was wrong. It was as if I'd been shoved into a world that I had absolutely no idea how to navigate. The next day I spent all day seeing my family and discovered my Nan had had a son who died a few days after he was born. I asked her how I was going to survive it and she said: “Take lots of pictures, and make the most of the time you have with him.” When I went into hospital to be induced I was very scared about what he was going to look like, so I asked my Mum to see him first. She said “oh my god, he’s just perfect” and showed him to me. It was the moment I realised that was the baby I’d been carrying for eight months. Death doesn’t change anything - this was the first time I was going to meet my son. But it was also devastating. I was holding everything that I was waiting for but I knew I would have to give my baby back. My future was being erased before my eyes. I said to one of the midwives: “I feel like I'm the only person in the world this is happening to.” She replied: “It's just one of those things that nobody speaks about.” Three days after I came out of hospital I started thinking about my vlog. People were still commenting on my previous videos saying “wow I'm pregnant too”. Again I looked for vlogs about stillbirth and again I couldn’t find what I was looking for. I wasn’t expecting so many people to watch the videos because I didn’t realise how common stillbirth is. It helped me by telling his story but it was also comforting to see other people say his name. If someone you know experiences a stillbirth you don't need to know the right things to say. You just need to acknowledge their pain, acknowledge their grief, understand that you're not going to understand, and let them talk and talk until they've finished. As time's gone on, I've met a lot of people who've understood, and I've found my feet in grief which helps a lot. Rowan, Scarlett, Aamiya, Lily, Milo, and Willow. As I lay stones in their memory in a special baby loss garden in Staffordshire, I realise that even though they didn’t see the world, they have changed it through the action they have inspired in their mothers. But I also know that for each of these women there are many more who choose to hold their memories privately, who mourn behind closed doors. One in 225 pregnancies in the UK will end in stillbirth. And the death of a baby will not just affect the parents, but the grandparents, the siblings, the family and friends. A bereaved mother, in the process of getting physical care, gets emotional care throughout, but this risks men feeling sidelined, and powerless to help. The parents I speak to agree that the taboo and silence around stillbirth seems to be gradually easing, but there are still many people who have simply never spoken to me about Willow, never said her name. My arms no longer ache like those first hours, but they are still empty - I am a mother without a baby I have, though, felt support from so many people, especially women, many of whom I’d never even met before. As a journalist I have specialised in women’s stories around the world for many years, and yet only this has made me feel an invisible solidarity, a wall of history, of empathy, of strength from women around me. Over the past year my need to remember and memorialise Willow has jostled with my need for self-preservation. A year on, grief can still occasionally floor me, slicing behind my knees, but I can feel it coming and I can prepare, knowing I can survive its brief but powerful kick. Willow’s birth made me a Mum and Tim a Dad. My arms no longer ache like those first hours, but they are still empty. I am a mother without a baby. I think about my own mother. For weeks she sat in our house, the horrific shadow of bereavement hanging over us, my hacking sobs punctuated by the clack of her knitting needles. She made a beautiful pure white blanket for a baby box which will be opened at a time of immense loss. She knitted it for a stranger who at the time of knitting was an excited expectant mother-to-be, but whose baby would come too early, too sick, or simply stillborn for no known reason.  That baby - we will never know his or her name - will be rocked and mourned in their parents’ arms and will also, thanks to my Mum, have an extra layer, wrapped also in my family’s love - our endurance and our hope.

"Hundreds of people are killed by police in the US each year, and much attention has been paid recently to the high proportion that are black. But there's another disturbing trend that is rarely discussed. It was shortly after 05:00 when three West Milwaukee police officers broke into the home of 22-year-old Adam Trammell to find him naked and bewildered, standing in his bathtub as water from the shower ran down his body. Adam, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, was having some form of breakdown. A neighbour had called 911 to report that she had seen him naked in the corridor, talking about the devil. She thought Adam's name was Brandon, and told police this when they arrived at the building. According to his father, Larry Trammell, Adam often had delusions and hallucinations. He would take showers to help him calm down when he felt anxious. Adam was not armed and he did not appear to behave in a threatening manner. But he did not leave the shower as the police commanded. The officers then fired their Tasers at him 15 times, administering long, painful electric shocks as he screamed and writhed in the bathtub. Then more officers arrived, and after dragging him, still naked, from his apartment, they held him down and he was injected with sedatives - midazolam at first, and then ketamine. Moments later, Adam stopped breathing. He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead soon after arrival. The date was 25 May 2017. We know this is how events unfolded because the incident was caught on cameras worn by the officers. ""I could barely stand to watch it,"" Adam's mother Kathleen says of the footage. ""He was being brutally tortured and screaming out in agony and I could feel the pain, almost. It was like a nightmare with my son as the victim."" Adam Trammell Kathleen is at a loss to explain why the police behaved the way they did. ""He was just in his own place, he was not out on the streets, he didn't have a weapon. He didn't even have any clothes on, in his own shower. Where was the imminent danger? There was none. He didn't deserve it at all,"" she tells me, wiping tears from her eyes. Larry thinks his son may have believed the police were a hallucination. The officers who found him in the bathroom addressed him as ""Brandon"", not ""Adam"", because this was the name they were given by the neighbour. ""By them calling him by a different name, he was thinking, 'This ain't real,'"" says Larry. At one point Adam splashed water at the officers, something Larry says he might have done as a test to find out whether they really existed. Even the police acknowledge Adam had not committed a crime and was not suspected of committing one. So why did it happen? This video can not be played Video: Police confront Adam Trammell. Contains disturbing images. The police say they broke into the apartment solely to help Adam. They say they acted the way they did to restrain him and get him medical care. In spite of the footage, Milwaukee's District Attorney John Chisholm went so far as to rule that ""there was no basis to conclusively link Mr Trammell's death to the actions taken by the police officers"". No officers were prosecuted. There was no national media attention and there were no riots or protest marches. Almost unnoticed, Adam became part of a disturbing statistic that is rarely  talked about - the high proportion of disabled people among the hundreds who die after interactions with US police each year. Conservative estimates suggest that about a quarter of those who die in these interactions have a disability - whether mental, intellectual or physical. But other research indicates that the proportion may be far greater. Already in 2018, across the US, at least 136 people with a disability are known to have been killed by police officers, according to a database maintained by the Washington Post and analysis of local media reports. In many countries the police would be the last resort when people are going through mental health crises but in the US, they are often the first to respond because of the lack of more specialised agencies. And when I began to look at these interactions between police and disabled people in different parts of the country, clear patterns began to emerge. Adam's story may be extreme, but some aspects of it are repeated time and time again. Ethan Saylor, 26, had Down's syndrome. On the evening of 12 January 2013, in Frederick County, Maryland, he was at the cinema with his carer, watching the film Zero Dark Thirty. Ethan Saylor He was fascinated by its CIA characters and applauded the end of the movie, insisting he did not want to go home. Instead, he wanted to see the film again. Ethan and his carer left the auditorium but he refused to leave the building. His carer went to bring her car around, hoping this would persuade him, but Ethan went back into the cinema to the same seat in which he'd watched the film. In the carer's absence, three off-duty police officers who were working as security staff in their spare time heard someone was in the cinema without a ticket for the next showing. ""At some point it becomes, 'You need to leave or you are going to be arrested,'"" says Ethan's mother, Patti, who sat through the evidence given in a subsequent investigation. Ethan apparently told the officers he was a CIA agent and was not going anywhere. ""So the officers put their arms under his arms to lift him up and remove him from the theatre,"" says Patti. Ethan, crying out for his mother, was restrained and handcuffed. Watch Aleem Maqbool's Our World documentaryDon't Shoot, I'm Disabledon the BBC News Channel at 21:30 on 6 and 7 October and on BBC World News atthese times Orwatch later on iPlayer Listen to the documentary onBBC World Service's Assignment ""Somehow in the next seconds or minutes, Ethan ends up on the floor face down and not breathing,"" Patti says. Attempts to resuscitate him failed. Initially she thought he had died as a result of some unexplained medical complication. ""I believe it was two weeks later when we were called to the sheriff's department,"" Patti tells me. ""The autopsy report was back and they told us the medical examiner had ruled this a homicide and that he had died of asphyxiation. ""That was the most dramatic and traumatic moment in all of this - realising he had been killed."" Ethan had idolised police officers, even wanting to become one. He frequently called 911 just so he could meet officers and see the squad car pull up to his house. In the weeks leading up to his death, Patti had visited the local sheriff's office with cookies to thank the deputies for being so patient with Ethan. Now he had died in a confrontation with some of the same officers. ""I took a step back and thought about how ridiculous it was for a young man to lose his life over the cost of a movie ticket. There was no reason for that to occur,"" says Patti. ""What is the state of mind for a law enforcement officer that they would literally intervene physically with someone with Down's syndrome to the point of their death?"" Patti says the attitude among some members of her community, even some close to her, was that Ethan must have done something to deserve what happened to him. She says both they and the law enforcement community have made the case that Ethan would still be alive if he had just followed instructions. But therein is precisely the problem - his ability to follow instructions. Ethan, like Adam, did not have this ability. It is a problem that is even more apparent in the case of Magdiel Sanchez, a 35-year-old man who was confronted by police on the porch of his own home in Oklahoma City on 19 September 2017. Magdiel Sanchez Police believed he was carrying a weapon - it emerged that it was a section of piping - and shouted instructions at him to drop it, but he did not. The confrontation ended with him being shot dead on his front lawn in front of several of his neighbours. Tragically, Magdiel never heard the police commands - because he was deaf. During the stand-off, neighbours shouted to the officers to tell them this, but they shot him anyway. Surveillance footage from the house across the street shows that at one point Magdiel, holding the pipe, did run towards officers. He then walked away again and moments later, out of view of the cameras, he was killed. ""He was a special needs child and he was deaf and he was real timid. He was an older boy but he was like a child,"" says Regina Smith, who saw the end of the incident from her kitchen window. ""I realised it was him and I thought: 'What could he have done?'"" In fact, police only went to his house because they suspected his father had been involved in a hit-and-run incident, and once there they saw him walking around with the pipe. As I stand outside Magdiel's home, I see one of the neighbours, Kevin Tillery, riding along the street on his bicycle, holding a piece of wood. Tillery says he always carries it for protection against stray dogs and that at a certain point Magdiel decided to copy him. ""He would see me going up and down the street with the stick and one morning he held a stick up (to me) and smiled,"" Tillery tells me. Kevin Tillery But Oklahoma City Police Department defends the actions of the officers. ""Nobody disputes neighbours were yelling that he was deaf,"" says William Citty, Oklahoma City's police chief. But he adds: ""He understood that they were police officers. That's why we wear uniforms."" Police Chief Citty does not accept that Magdiel's deafness and the extent of his learning difficulties mean the officers should have behaved differently. He says his officers feared being hit with the piping and acted in self-defence. ""It's our job to be able to respond to situations in a manner which creates the best outcome,"" he says. ""That may include the use of lethal force. ""Under the circumstances at that moment, with what they had to work with, it was the best possible outcome."" As in the cases of Adam and Ethan, none of the officers involved have been prosecuted. Data concerning the number of disabled people who are killed by police in the US is hard to come by. Researchers are left to go through media reports of individual cases from around the country. The figures are not officially collected at national level. The current estimate of 136 for this year may therefore be a gross underestimate. In hundreds more cases it was never determined whether the person killed had a disability at all. And there may be other cases that are not reported or that the researchers failed to spot. This was an issue before President Donald Trump was elected. But his administration has signalled that there will be fewer investigations into police departments when things go wrong, arguing that federal oversight of local police departments reduces morale among police officers. So what of the officers who have taken the life of someone in these circumstances? One is Sgt Corey Nooner, who told me about the moment near a school, 15 years ago, when he shot and killed a woman who had schizophrenia. This video can not be played Sgt Corey Nooner: 'I didn't have a choice but to shoot' ""I was forced into a situation where I didn't have any other choice,"" he says, becoming visibly emotional. ""We were outside the school, she had a knife and she wasn't responding to my instructions,"" he says. Nooner says that given the same circumstances today, he would do exactly the same thing. ""I have to make sure I go home to my family at night,"" he says. But it is clear that the incident had a profound impact on him. ""After the incident was over, I was told that she had a history of mental illness. I didn't know that at the time. I didn't understand what was going on at the time,"" he says. He is angered, though, by any suggestion that American police may be too ready to use lethal force. ""Who would welcome that kind of encounter?"" he says. ""The reality is that no-one wants to be involved in that moment when they have to point to a weapon at another individual and pull the trigger."" So why are so many disabled people killed by the police? All police in the US are, of course, armed. There is also the very real prospect that they could face criminals who are, too. Across the US, 40 officers have been shot dead so far this year. So a large proportion of police training is geared towards the use of firearms and personal protection.  But critics say this creates a police culture that is excessively confrontational, particularly in certain types of neighbourhoods. An area that has seen a spate of disabled people killed in interactions with officers is Chicago's South Side - one of the most heavily policed areas in the US. In the line of duty: How often are US police killed? What goes through a policeman's head before he shoots The complaint from many there is that officers too often employ a ""command and control"" style of policing, especially in low-income areas - shouting commands and physically dominating, particularly when someone doesn't immediately comply. This can sometimes, very quickly, lead the police to use guns. The problem is - as we know from the cases of Adam, Ethan and Magdiel - that there may be reasons why it is harder for some people to comply with commands shouted at them. Candace Coleman, who has cerebral palsy, is an organiser with Access Living, an advocacy group for people with disabilities. She grew up in the South Side of Chicago and works with people there who are disabled, particularly those diagnosed with schizophrenia and autism. ""If they do encounter police, it's a scary situation,"" she says, saying any confrontation with a police officer could lead to extreme panic and confusion in those with similar challenges to those of the young people she works with. ""'Who is this person with a gun?'"", they might ask themselves, she says. ""'Why are the lights flashing?' 'What are these loud sounds?'"" Being ordered to stand in a certain way - for instance, with their hands where they can be seen - or to look an officer in the eye can also be a problem, she says. So can being touched or grabbed by an officer. ""If I'm not used to that, then I'm going to respond in a way that would look as if I'm being defiant,"" she adds. That all rings true for Larry Trammell, Adam's father. ""There were times when you couldn't touch Adam,"" Larry says.  ""He [could get] really withdrawn or get excited, so I always knew when I dealt with Adam, I was to stay back and let him talk. ""If I went in there and just used my authority as a father and said 'You have to do this' - it just didn't work."" Adam Trammell After weeks of trying, I finally manage to speak to the Milwaukee District Attorney, John Chisholm, who ruled Adam did not die as a result of the actions of the officers who used Tasers on him numerous times. ""They are not doing this because they wanted to harm Adam. It's the exact opposite, right?"" says Chisholm. ""Their expressed intent, any number of times, is that they were there to help him. That they wanted to get him out of that situation."" I put it to Chisholm that they had, indeed, been saying that they wanted to help Adam, but they did so as they were issuing electric shocks - that they had their Tasers drawn even before they entered his home, even though he was in a building where others with mental illness lived. And I point out that the officers started Tasering him moments after the encounter started. ""Right, because they had to get him under control, so they could get him some medical attention,"" the district attorney repeats. Lawyers for Adam's family highlight many other breaches of police guidelines that, for example, say someone should not be exposed to more than 15 seconds of cumulative electric shocks using a Taser. They point out the terrible injuries, including broken ribs, that the post-mortem showed Adam had sustained. The guidelines say that police encountering someone in a mental health crisis should ""avoid increasing the subject's agitation or excitement, avoid physical engagement, avoid restraint and attempt to calm down the subject."" And yet the district attorney ruled that the behaviour of the officers had not been negligent or abusive. ""Not based on their training,"" he says. ""The decision that they have to make is - what's the appropriate means to get him under control so that they can get him the medical attention at that point and time?"" Chisholm insists that Adam may have died anyway because of his health crisis - and that the officers' choice was either to do what they did, or do nothing. ""I would have liked it to have gone to trial,"" says Adam's father, Larry. ""If it had gone to trial and they had found the officers innocent, it still would have been hard, but we didn't even get that."" Police officers are prosecuted in very few cases involving the deaths of disabled people. They are presumed to have acted in good faith and often given legal protection on that basis. Adam's case illustrates how police in the US are often called on to do a job that trained medical professionals would be far better placed to handle. William Citty ""Our calls concerning mental health from 2012 to 2016 have more than tripled,"" says Citty, Oklahoma City's police chief, whose officers shot dead Magdiel Sanchez. ""This society has not effectively dealt with mental health. They haven't provided the dollars for treatment,"" he says. ""Officers are running from call to call to call dealing with this."" So if the police are to be the first to be called, how can things improve? ""I have to tell you, if you don't know someone with Down's syndrome, you are missing out,"" says Patti Saylor, Ethan's mother, as she trains a group of police officers in how to interact better with disabled people. She is trying to turn the devastation caused by the death of her son into something positive, using her own horrific personal experience. ""Ethan didn't have the cognitive ability to recognise those officers needed an explanation,"" she tells the room. ""Like, 'Officer it's OK, I'm going to sit in the seat and watch this movie a second time, my mom is on her way, she'll pay for the ticket when she gets here.' He didn't understand he should do that."" This video can not be played Bereaved mother trains law enforcement Patti tells me that she is sometimes struck by the level of ignorance about disability among officers, but that this simply mirrors the lack of awareness in society as a whole. ""I have been asked questions like 'You mean they are not all the same?' or 'So they are not out to hurt us?'"" she says of officers she has trained. Officers often apologise to her when they hear her story and display some degree of shame about what happened, she says. But the Frederick County Sheriff's Office, whose deputies were involved in Ethan's death, has not engaged with Patti. It did agree a financial settlement with her but never apologised or admitted any wrongdoing. Oklahoma City Police may defend the death of Magdiel Sanchez on his front lawn, but it is clear that the department has tried to make changes since the incident - offering more training to officers on how to approach disabled people. The force deploys these specially trained officers to incidents where their skills will be useful. One is Sgt Corey Nooner - the same officer who, 15 years ago, says he was forced to shoot and kill a woman with schizophrenia. That experience pushed him to try to understand mental illness better and he underwent a considerable amount of additional training. I go out on patrol with him as he is dispatched to a home in an affluent neighbourhood in Oklahoma City. A man has called to say that his wife, who has recently been discharged from a medical facility, is having a manic episode and experiencing paranoia and delusions. At their home, Nooner patiently listens as the woman talks, visibly distressed, about how she is being watched by government agencies. Ultimately, though, after she refuses to accompany him to see a psychiatrist and when she tries to dive into her bedroom, he restrains and handcuffs her. Later, he tells me he had feared she might try to arm herself and that his basic police instincts kicked in. For many, the nub of the problem is the way police are taught to interact from the very beginning - with so much emphasis on firearms training and personal protection, and relatively little on de-escalating confrontations. As things stand, the deaths and injuries of people with disabilities at the hands of the police have left some of the people Candace Coleman works with in Chicago's South Side wondering who might be next, she says. Some of them have made pacts never to call the police under any circumstances, she adds, so worried are they that harm could come to them. Coleman says they've also got together in groups to discuss what they can do to protect themselves in any interactions with the police. ""Extra disability training for police is one thing but is not enough,"" she says. ""We need a cultural shift across the board."" ""The way in which they approach situations needs to change. It shouldn't always be that the immediate reaction is to pull out your gun or your Taser or to yell or scream,"" she adds. Until that happens, some of the most vulnerable people in US society will be left to work things out for themselves.

"Sea snakes are often encountered by fishing crews in northern Australia A British man has died after being bitten by a sea snake on a fishing trawler in Australia, police have said. The man, 23, thought to be a backpacker, had just pulled up a net off the coast of the Northern Territory when he was bitten about 09:00 local time on Thursday (23:00 GMT Wednesday). Emergency crews were called to the boat, near island Groote Eylandt, but were unable to save the man. It may be the first recorded death from a sea snake in Australia. The man was working on the trawler and was bitten by the sea snake while pulling the net onto the boat, police said. The man's body was taken to the mainland town of Borroloola on Thursday. Northern Territory Police said a post-mortem would be conducted. A British High Commission spokesperson said: ""We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in the Northern Territory and are in contact with the Australian authorities."" Authorities have not said which species may have caused the death. Sea snakes are highly venomous, but because of their limited contact with humans, bites are relatively rare. Australia is home to 30 of 70 known species, according to the Australian Institute of Marine Science. Blanche D'Anastasi, who researches the animal at James Cook University, said she believed Australia had no previously recorded deaths from sea snakes. Snake bites a 'global health priority' Venomous animals not Australia's deadliest Associate Prof Bryan Fry, from University of Queensland, described it as a ""tragically unlucky accident"". ""By and large they are very gentle animals, and people do go scuba diving with them all the time,"" he told the BBC.

"Unilever, which makes Marmite and Dove soap, has scrapped its plan to move its headquarters to the Netherlands after growing criticism from investors. The firm has headquarters in both London and Rotterdam, but announced in March that it planned to have just one HQ located in the Dutch city. But investors said the move could force UK shareholders to sell their shares. Unilever said it recognised ""the proposal has not received support from a significant group of shareholders"". However, chairman Marijn Dekkers said that the board continued to believe that simplifying Unilever's Anglo-Dutch structure was in the firm's best interests. ""The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders,""the company said in a statement.,external Unilever's current dual-headed structure has existed since 1930, when Dutch margarine firm Unie merged with British soap maker Lever Brothers. It is one of the biggest firms in the UK's FTSE 100 share index, valued at about Â£124bn. Ben & Jerry's ice cream is one of Unilever's brands The company -  which also makes Pot Noodle and Ben & Jerry's ice cream - will keep its listing on the London Stock Exchange. Under UK rules it would not have been eligible to be a member of the FTSE 100 had the proposed change gone through. This had concerned investors in the company, who were worried the change could spark a sell-off and drive down the share price. When Unilever first unveiled its plan in March, some had speculated that it was making the move because of Brexit - claims the firm denied. Simon Jack, BBC business editor Unilever's proposal to move its corporate headquarters and primary listing to the Netherlands had the appeal of one of its most famous products - Marmite. Some shareholders loved it but a significant number hated it. For those that bought the shares because of Unilever's inclusion in the FTSE 100 it was very off-putting indeed. Unilever's move would have meant ejection from a globally significant index which many funds track by buying all of its members. Thus it would have made many of them forced sellers at a time not of their choosing. The proposed move was a reaction to the hostile but short-lived takeover bid from Kraft Heinz, and was never about Brexit. But significant shareholder resistance highlights the power of London's capital markets and the cachet of its leading index. Global shareholders like global companies listed on a global index. A significant number of Unilever shareholders are saying that means staying in London - that does have post-Brexit significance. Read Simon's analysis in full One of the shareholders who had expressed discontent, and who did not want to be named, told the BBC they would now expect to see a ""sea change"" at board level with non-executive directors leaving. Aviva Investors said it was ""pleased"" with Unilever's decision to withdraw its proposal. Last month, Aviva Investors' chief investment officer for equities David Cumming told the BBC the move could force UK shareholders to sell their shares and offered ""no upside"". He said Unilever was looking for ""protection"" after a failed takeover bid by US food giant Kraft Heinz in 2017. Royal London Asset Management said it welcomed the decision. Earlier this week, the firm's head of equities, Peter Rutter, had told the BBC that Unilever's proposal would not benefit its UK clients and that Royal London was going to vote against it. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said that the backlash from both institutional and retail investors ""meant that the writing was on the wall"" for Unilever's plan. Thousands of Interactive Investor customers hold Unilever shares, Ms O'Keeffe said, with ""hundreds of millions invested"". Why did Unilever back down over HQ?

"Cristiano Ronaldo has a lucrative contract with Nike Nike has said it is ""deeply concerned"" by rape allegations against footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. The US sportswear giant - which has a contract worth a reported $1bn (Â£768m) with Ronaldo - said it would ""continue to closely monitor the situation"", the Associated Press reports. EA Sports, which also has a contract with Ronaldo, made similar comments. Ronaldo, 33, earlier ""firmly"" denied assaulting Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. Ms Mayorga, a 34-year-old US former teacher, was inspired to speak out by the #MeToo movement, her lawyer said. ""The MeToo movement and the women who have stood up and disclosed sexual assaults has given Kathryn a lot of courage,"" Leslie Stovall said.

Der Spiegel said Ms Mayorga had filed a report with Las Vegas police shortly after the alleged incident. But the next year, she reportedly reached an out-of-court settlement with Ronaldo involving a $375,000 (Â£288,000) payment for agreeing never to go public with the allegations. Her lawyers are now seeking to declare the non-disclosure agreement void. In a lawsuit, Ms Mayorga says she met Ronaldo at the Rain Nightclub in the Palms Hotel and Casino, and that he raped her in his penthouse suite. Mr Stovall said his client had suffered from major depression and considered suicide since the alleged assault almost a decade ago. He said a psychiatrist had diagnosed Ms Mayorga with post-traumatic stress disorder. Las Vegas police confirmed on Tuesdaythey had initially investigated a complaint in June 2009,but added they had no suspect in the case. ""At the time the report was taken, the victim did not provide detectives with the location of the incident or suspect description,"" a statement said.

"This video can not be played Protesters take to Capitol Hill Hundreds of protesters against US President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have been arrested in Washington, DC. Comedian Amy Schumer and model Emily Ratajkowski were among 302 people held for demonstrating against the nominee. They protested after an FBI report which Republicans say exonerates him of sexual assault claims, with Democrats complaining it is too limited. The first test vote on the nominee is due in a few hours. The likelihood of Judge Kavanaugh winning a full Senate vote on Saturday appeared to increase after two Republicans whose backing will be essential gave a positive account of the FBI inquiry. Comedian Amy Schumer and actress Emily Ratajkowski were among those held But the confirmation is not a certainty, with several senators undecided and one at risk of missing a vote because he is attending his daughter's wedding. If confirmed to the lifetime position on America's highest court, the 53-year-old is expected to help conservatives dominate the nine-member panel, which has the final say on issues such as abortion, gun control and voting rules. The truth about lie detector tests Are young men in America scared? Simple guide to mid-term elections As the vote neared, the judge defended his neutrality ina Wall Street Journal editorial titled, ""I am an independent, impartial judge"",external. Addressing his angry testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he branded the allegations against him an ""orchestrated political hit"", he wrote: ""I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said."" Thousands of mainly female demonstrators marched through the nation's capital on Thursday, starting at the appeals court where Judge Kavanaugh currently presides. They converged on Capitol Hill and held a rally outside the Supreme Court, chanting: ""Kavanaugh has got to go!"" Police rounded the protesters up in a Senate office building after they sat down and refused to budge. There was another protest in front of Trump Tower in New York City. President Trump and his fellow Republicans declared the FBI report had cleared their nominee, as they sounded increasingly confident Judge Kavanaugh would win confirmation. Senators said the FBI had spoken to five witnesses connected to accusations by Christine Blasey Ford, who alleges a drunken Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982. Why sexual assault survivors forget details Ford's testimony through the eyes of a survivor Federal agents are also said to have spoken to four other witnesses involving a separate accusation by Deborah Ramirez, who claims the nominee exposed himself to her when they were both at Yale University. He denies both allegations.

Senate Republicans plan a procedural ""cloture"" vote at 10:30 on Friday (14:30 GMT), which is required to move to a final vote, scheduled on Saturday at around 17:30. But Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said the FBI report was ""the product of an incomplete investigation"", saying key corroborating witnesses had been snubbed. Another Democratic Senator, Richard Blumenthal, told reporters it was a ""whitewash"". Anti-Kavanaugh protesters rally outside the US Supreme Court White House spokesman Raj Shah said: ""What critics want is a never-ending fishing expedition into high school drinking."" One Republican Senator, John Cornyn, raised eyebrows by telling his party this was ""our Atticus Finch moment"", a reference to the lawyer in classic novel To Kill A Mockingbird who refutes a false rape allegation. Given that Republicans have a razor-thin 51-49 margin of control in the Senate, the party can potentially only afford one defection if it wants to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, assuming Democrats vote the same way. His nomination has been at the mercy of three wavering senators, but two of those - Jeff Flake and Susan Collins - appeared to respond positively to the FBI report. This video can not be played 'Ford is a liar': Trump supporters' unequivocal backing for Kavanaugh Another wavering Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, reportedly met sexual assault survivors in her office on Thursday. Complicating matters, the office of Republican Steve Daines said he was planning to attend his daughter's wedding in Montana on Saturday - meaning he might not be around to vote, or that the vote might be held open until he can return to take part. Another Republican,Cory Gardner, who previously said he would back Judge Kavanaugh, is yet to decide how he will vote,external, the Denver Post reported. A previously undecided Democratic Senator, Heidi Heitkamp, said she would vote against Judge Kavanaugh, citing ""concerns about his past conduct"". And Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the only Democrat who remains undecided, said he would finish reading the FBI report on Friday morning. Feinstein and McConnell differ sharply.

"Unilever, which makes Marmite and Dove soap, has scrapped its plan to move its headquarters to the Netherlands after growing criticism from investors. The firm has headquarters in both London and Rotterdam, but announced in March that it planned to have just one HQ located in the Dutch city. But investors said the move could force UK shareholders to sell their shares. Unilever said it recognised ""the proposal has not received support from a significant group of shareholders"". However, chairman Marijn Dekkers said that the board continued to believe that simplifying Unilever's Anglo-Dutch structure was in the firm's best interests. ""The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders,""the company said in a statement.,external Unilever's current dual-headed structure has existed since 1930, when Dutch margarine firm Unie merged with British soap maker Lever Brothers. It is one of the biggest firms in the UK's FTSE 100 share index, valued at about Â£124bn. Ben & Jerry's ice cream is one of Unilever's brands The company -  which also makes Pot Noodle and Ben & Jerry's ice cream - will keep its listing on the London Stock Exchange. Under UK rules it would not have been eligible to be a member of the FTSE 100 had the proposed change gone through. This had concerned investors in the company, who were worried the change could spark a sell-off and drive down the share price. When Unilever first unveiled its plan in March, some had speculated that it was making the move because of Brexit - claims the firm denied. Simon Jack, BBC business editor Unilever's proposal to move its corporate headquarters and primary listing to the Netherlands had the appeal of one of its most famous products - Marmite. Some shareholders loved it but a significant number hated it. For those that bought the shares because of Unilever's inclusion in the FTSE 100 it was very off-putting indeed. Unilever's move would have meant ejection from a globally significant index which many funds track by buying all of its members. Thus it would have made many of them forced sellers at a time not of their choosing. The proposed move was a reaction to the hostile but short-lived takeover bid from Kraft Heinz, and was never about Brexit. But significant shareholder resistance highlights the power of London's capital markets and the cachet of its leading index. Global shareholders like global companies listed on a global index. A significant number of Unilever shareholders are saying that means staying in London - that does have post-Brexit significance. Read Simon's analysis in full One of the shareholders who had expressed discontent, and who did not want to be named, told the BBC they would now expect to see a ""sea change"" at board level with non-executive directors leaving. Aviva Investors said it was ""pleased"" with Unilever's decision to withdraw its proposal. Last month, Aviva Investors' chief investment officer for equities David Cumming told the BBC the move could force UK shareholders to sell their shares and offered ""no upside"". He said Unilever was looking for ""protection"" after a failed takeover bid by US food giant Kraft Heinz in 2017. Royal London Asset Management said it welcomed the decision. Earlier this week, the firm's head of equities, Peter Rutter, had told the BBC that Unilever's proposal would not benefit its UK clients and that Royal London was going to vote against it. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said that the backlash from both institutional and retail investors ""meant that the writing was on the wall"" for Unilever's plan. Thousands of Interactive Investor customers hold Unilever shares, Ms O'Keeffe said, with ""hundreds of millions invested"". Why did Unilever back down over HQ?

"Net-connected cameras have helped attackers stage large-scale attacks Default passwords such as ""admin"" and ""password"" will be illegal for electronics firms to use in California from 2020. The state has passed a law that sets higher security standards for net-connected devices made or sold in the region. It demands that each gadget be given a unique password when it is made. Before now, easy-to-guess passwords have helped some cyber-attacks spread more quickly and cause more harm. TheInformation Privacy: Connected Devices bill,externaldemands that electronics manufacturers equip their products with ""reasonable"" security features. This can mean a unique password or a start-up procedure that forces users to generate their own code when using the gadget for the first time. The bill also allows customers who suffer harm when a company ignores the law to sue for damages. Writing on tech news site the RegisterKieren McCarthy said the law was ""a step forward"",externalbut also a ""massive missed opportunity"". A bigger problem than poor passwords was the creation of devices that could not be updated, he said. California should have added clauses that required manufacturers to take a more rounded approach, he said, to limit how much access malicious hackers can get to all kinds of devices. Many recent cyber-attacks have taken advantage of the default and easy-to-guess passwords on the devices found in millions of homes and offices. In late 2016, Twitter, Spotify, and Reddit were among sites taken offline by an attack that took advantage of poor passwords on lots of net-connected gadgets including webcams and other so-called smart home hardware.

"An eight-year-old found a pre-Viking-era sword while swimming in a lake in Sweden during the summer. Saga Vanecek found the relic in the Vidostern lake while at her family's holiday home in Jonkoping County. The sword was initially reported to be 1,000 years old, but experts at the local museum now believe it may date to around 1,500 years ago. ""It's not every day that you step on a sword in the lake!"" Mikael Nordstrom from the museum said. This video can not be played Saga Vanecek: ""I noticed something that felt like a stick"" The level of the water was extremely low at the time, owing to a drought, which is probably why Saga uncovered the ancient weapon. ""I felt something in the water and lifted it up. Then there was a handle and I went to tell my dad that it looked like a sword,"" Saga told the broadcaster Sveriges Television. Saga's father Andy Vanecek told the English-language website The Local he initially thought his daughter had found an unusual stick or branch in the water.

"UPDATE 5 October 2018: Denis Mukwege has beenjointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prizefor his work. This article was first published in 2013. Denis Mukwege is a gynaecologist working in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He and his colleagues have treated about 30,000 rape victims, developing great expertise in the treatment of serious sexual injuries. His story includes disturbing accounts of rape as a weapon of war. When war broke out, 35 patients in my hospital in Lemera in eastern DR Congo were killed in their beds. I fled to Bukavu, 100km (60 miles) to the north, and started a hospital made from tents. I built a maternity ward with an operating theatre. In 1998, everything was destroyed again. So, I started all over again in 1999. It was that year that our first rape victim was brought into the hospital. After being raped, bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs. I thought that was a barbaric act of war, but the real shock came three months later. Forty-five women came to us with the same story, they were all saying: ""People came into my village and raped me, tortured me."" Other women came to us with burns. They said that after they had been raped chemicals  had been poured on their genitals. I started to ask myself what was going on. These weren't just violent acts of war, but part of a strategy. You had situations where multiple people were raped at the same time, publicly - a whole village might be raped during the night. In doing this, they hurt not just the victims but the whole community, which they force to watch. The result of this strategy is that people are forced to flee their villages, abandon their fields, their resources, everything. It's very effective. We have a staged system of care for victims. Before I undertake a big operation we start with a psychological examination. I need to know if they have enough resilience to withstand surgery. Then we move to the next stage, which might consist of an operation or just medical care. And the following stage is socio-economic care - most of these patients arrive with nothing, no clothes even. We have to feed them, we have to take care of them. After we discharge them they will be vulnerable again if they're not able to sustain their own lives. So we have to assist them on socio-economical level - for example through helping women develop new skills and putting girls back in school. The fourth stage is to assist them on a legal level. Often the patients know who their assailants were and we have lawyers who help them bring their cases to court. In 2011, we witnessed a fall in the number of cases. We thought perhaps we were approaching the end of the terrible situation for women in the Congo. But since last year, when the war resumed, cases have increased again. It's a phenomenon which is linked entirely to the war situation. The conflict in DR Congo is not between groups of religious fanatics. Nor is it a conflict between states. This is a conflict caused by economic interests - and it is being waged by destroying Congolese women. When I was coming home after a trip outside the country I found five people waiting for me. Four of them had AK-47 guns, the fifth had a pistol. They opened the gate and got in my car, pointing their weapons at me. They got me out of my car and as one of my guards tried to rescue me they shot him down. He was killed. I fell down and the attackers continued firing bullets. I can't really tell you how I survived. Then they left in my car without taking anything else. I found out afterwards that my two daughters and their cousin were at home. They had been made to go into the living room where the attackers were sitting, waiting for me. During all that time they pointed their guns, their weapons at my daughters. It was terrible. I only saw the attackers for just a few seconds and I couldn't tell who these people were. I also can't say why they attacked me - only they know. After the attack, Dr Mukwege fled with his family to Sweden, then to Brussels, but he was persuaded to return to Congo last month. I was inspired to return by the determination of Congolese women to fight these atrocities. These women have taken the courage to protest about my attack to the authorities. They even grouped together to pay for my ticket home - these are women who do not have anything, they live on less than a dollar a day. The welcoming parade at Kavumu airport, Bukavu, in January After that gesture, I couldn't really say no. And also, I am myself determined to help fight these atrocities, this violence. My life has had to change, since returning. I now live at the hospital and I take a number of security precautions, so I have lost some of my freedom. When I was welcomed back by the women, they told me they would ensure my security by taking turns to guard me, with groups of 20 women volunteering in shifts, day and night. They don't have any weapons - they don't have anything. But it is a form of security to feel so close to the people you are working with. Their enthusiasm gives me the confidence to continue my work as usual. Denis Mukwege spoke to Outlook on theBBC World Service.

"This video can not be played Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege: Conflict to blame for rape increase Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege is known as ""Doctor Miracle"" for his ability to repair through reconstructive surgery the horrific damage inflicted on women who have been raped. The 63-year-old Congolese gynaecologist set up the Panzi hospital in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo city of Bukavu nearly 20 years ago - shortly after he had his first experience of treating a woman who had been raped and mutilated by armed men. Dr Mukwege recounted the horrific injury the patient had suffered in a BBC interview, saying the woman had not only been raped but bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs. He, along with his colleagues, have since treated tens of thousands of victims. Panzi hospital now cares for more than 3,500 women a year. Sometimes Dr Mukwege performs as many as 10 operations a day. ""I... started a hospital made from tents. I built a maternity ward with an operating theatre. In 1998, everything was destroyed again. So, I started all over again in 1999,"" he told the BBC in 2013. Dr Mukwege talks to staff and students during a round at the ward for recovering patients Panzi hopsital has since grown to become a major health facility in eastern DR Congo. Its website says it has 370 doctors, nurses and support staff. It serves a population of 400,000 and also treats patients from neighbouring countries. Eastern DR Congo has been wracked by more than two decades of conflict, with numerous armed groups battling for control of the region's rich deposits of gold and other precious minerals. Dr Mukwege says the conflict in DR Congo is being waged to destroy Congolese women Many different militias have been accused of carrying out the indiscriminate rape of the region's women. ""The conflict in DR Congo is not between groups of religious fanatics. Nor is it a conflict between states. This is a conflict caused by economic interests - and it is being waged by destroying Congolese women,"" Dr Mukwege told the BBC. In 2010, a top UN official labelled the country ""the rape capital of the world"". In September 2012, in a speech at the UN, Dr Mukwege criticised President Joseph Kabila's government and other countries for not doing enough to stop what he called ""an unjust war that has used violence against women and rape as a strategy of war"". The following month he was targeted by gunmen who broke into his home and briefly held his daughters hostage. According to his organisation's website,,externalhis trusted friend and security guard was killed during the attack. He later fled with his family to Sweden, then to Belgium. He returned home in 2013 following a campaign by local women who raised funds to pay for his return ticket. ""After that gesture, I couldn't really say no. And also, I am myself determined to help fight these atrocities, this violence."" ""My life has had to change, since returning. I now live at the hospital and I take a number of security precautions, so I have lost some of my freedom,"" he told the BBC's Outlook programme in 2013. Dr Mukwege currently lives under the permanent protection of UN peacekeepers at his hospital. He told the Nobel committee in a brief interview that he was in the operating theatre when the news of the prize came through. ""It was when I was operating and I heard people start to cry and it was so, so surprising,"" he said. ""I can see in the face of many women how they are happy to be recognised and this is really so touching,"" he added.

Crowds gathered at the hospital cheered and ululated to celebrate the prize which Dr Mukwege said was dedicated to the many women who were victims of sexual violence. Although he has fallen out with DR Congo's government, its spokesman Lambert Mende congratulated Dr Mukwege. ""We have had differences with [him] every time that he tried to politicise his work, which however is important from a humanitarian standpoint. But now, we are satisfied with the Nobel Academy's recognition of the work of a compatriot,"" Mr Mende told AFP news agency. Dr Mukwege was born in 1955 in Bukavu. He went to medical school across the border in Burundi and later studied gynaecology and obstetrics at the University of Angers in France.

" When I was eight, my cousin had a baby. My Mum knew I loved babies so she dropped me off at her house for a few days “to help”. I must have been useful because when another cousin had one, I was dispatched again. I walked the babies up and down the hall and deflected swipes from jealous siblings. I helped with the bath-and-bed routine for our neighbour. I couldn’t wait to be 12 when I could babysit for all the kids in the village. I couldn’t wait to be a mother myself. But by 29 I had cervical cancer. The operation I needed to save my life would rob me of my chance to carry a child. I found another operation in a medical paper that would allow me that chance - I found a consultant who could do it. When my referral didn’t come through I just turned up to beg. Several gruelling years of IVF and miscarriage followed. And then finally, one Thursday morning, the baby I had longed for was wriggling around in my last scheduled ultrasound scan. The midwives waved me off wishing me good luck for the birth. When I was eight, my cousin had a baby. My Mum knew I loved babies so she dropped me off at her house for a few days “to help”.

The midwives waved me off wishing me good luck for the birth. That afternoon I was at work eating a piece of lemon drizzle cake to mark a colleague’s leaving do when I felt hot gushing liquid soak through my trousers. My waters had broken two months early. The hospital admitted me and said we had to delay labour for as long as possible, allowing the baby to grow stronger. Ten days later they said we were doing well and could go home the next day. But shortly after midnight, the umbilical cord dropped through me, compressing my baby’s supply of oxygen and nutrients. In the six minutes it took to get to the operating theatre, nurses running and shouting, wheeling my bed through empty corridors, our baby died. I didn’t sleep for 48 hours. I paced. I refused drugs. My precious longed-for baby was curled and silent in my womb - the cord that had bound us hung from me. When my feet ached from pacing I lay on my side facing Tim, my partner. I remembered a story of a mother who was told her baby had died, but was born healthy. I rang the buzzer to summon a nurse, I asked if they could have got it wrong. Twenty minutes later my partner rang the same bell, asked the same question. They gave me a C-section the next morning. As I breathed through the mask and felt the anaesthetic injected into my vein I thought: “I have dreamt of looking into my child’s face for 30 years, and when I wake, I will.” When she - a baby girl - was given to me, my heart expanded in love. She was beautiful - 30cm tip to toe. She had been dressed in a little white dress and hat, and draped in a white hand-knitted blanket. Her fingers and toes rested neatly in perfection. She was long-limbed like us both. We named her Willow. I imagined I heard Tim’s heart shatter when he said her name. I looked at her in wonder. I couldn’t understand why she was dead. The midwives and doctors came. There were no answers to our questions. Maybe they weren’t the right questions. We were at the edge of the delivery wing, and I had to listen to women in labour and to the mewling newborns. My arms ached. I thought I had a blood clot, but the doctors told me it was normal - a biological response to the shock that there was no living child for me to hold. I sobbed. My milk came through, marking my T-shirt, and I was too exhausted to be embarrassed.

In the bereavement suite there was a kitchen, to make cups of tea I couldn’t imagine any bereaved parent could ever stomach. I found myself looking at the cleaning rota - such a stark reminder of the other families who had been there. I thought of their loss. I focused on their survival. Stillbirth is much more common than people might think but it’s rarely talked about because pregnancy is a time of joy and hope. We stayed another four nights, our daughter in a refrigerated cot. No-one ever suggested we left but I knew when it was time. I couldn’t bring myself to say goodbye to the midwives who sat with us through that night, who dressed our daughter for us. There were no words of thanks big enough, so they just cried, and we cried, and nodded our heads and left. We had two matching cuddly lambs in hospital - one that we slept with, one for Willow in her crib. On the drive home I clutched our lamb, damp with tears. I whispered words to it and imagined my daughter could hear them. Grief folded and stretched time. The midwives had reminded us we were legally required to register Willow’s birth. So one day we travelled to a register office and an official asked quiet sad questions. We left holding legal proof she was here, she was real. Birth and death shared the paper, the only document she will ever have. Post piled up and I looked away from it, from other people’s kindness and awkwardness. Some friends came. Some family. I put my maternity jeans back on and exchanged platitudes, but there was nothing anyone could say so I went back to bed. We planned a funeral in place of a christening. Dry-eyed (there seemed to be nothing left), I delivered a eulogy to a crematorium filled with weeping family. The flowers were too big for the little lid of Willow’s casket. We asked them not to close the curtains at the end. When I finally managed to leave I carved off part of my soul to stay with her, my first child.

Two weeks later Tim returned to the sanctuary of work and I was left alone in the house. Our grief took different paths, and my loneliness and isolation increased. I scared myself reading about the rates of relationship breakdown after the death of a child, and decided to find a bereavement counsellor. I found a lot of help on offer for mothers, very little for fathers, but eventually found someone who would help us together, and whom we still see now. My period came and I raged at the betrayal of my body. I deleted friends on Facebook who had healthy babies the same age as Willow, or friends pregnant with a second or third child. The algorithms made social media a dark place for me, with adverts for baby food, prams and clothes flooding my feed. I became angry, bitter and withdrawn. One day I took three trains to a house in the far north-east corner of England to visit my 103-year-old grandmother, Nancy. I let myself in and sat at her feet, my head in her lap. She herself had a stillborn baby more than 60 years ago. She stroked my hair and said she was “sorry about the baby” - the baby she didn’t know we originally planned to name after her. It was the hardest visit I made and yet somehow it was the start of my healing. I did a lot of sleuthing. I applied for my notes from all the hospitals I’ve been treated in over the last decade and researched every stage of my medical treatment and pregnancy, cross-referencing and breaking the codes of doctors’ scribbles. At the heart of my obsession was guilt, a fear that somehow the stillbirth was my fault. A fear that was wrong, but that other parents of stillborn babies seem to feel too. I found a nine-week-old puppy and brought her home. She weighed 2kg, the weight of a newborn. Her needs made me feel useful. During night-time toilet trips we stood shivering in the dark, and she jumped at me like a child wanting to be picked up. When I called across the park for her, I occasionally called her Willow. Christmas loomed but I averted my eyes, hastily shoving money into cards for nieces and nephews. We escaped the dreams of our first family Christmas by hiring a remote shepherd’s hut in Suffolk. We walked miles every day, taking it in turns to carry our puppy. On Christmas Eve I went to a magical midnight Mass in a small rural church. I cried silently throughout the service. The old lady next to me, a stranger, reached out to hold my hand. Two weeks later Tim returned to the sanctuary of work and I was left alone in the house.

The old lady next to me, a stranger, reached out to hold my hand. A stillborn baby provides the mother with the same rights and protection as a newborn baby, and as I was entitled to maternity leave, I took it, returning after four months. Work was an easier place than home. I could hide from my loss. And so good did I become at compartmentalising that I was occasionally surprised by colleagues asking if I had had a boy or a girl. I got used to replying “my daughter was stillborn”, and then patting them on the arm and saying “it’s OK, please don’t worry”. In the long evenings at home I drank too much red wine. I watched Modern Family on a loop. But throughout the winter, there were glimmers of hope, like the snowdrops bravely poking their heads up. Some days I could feel positive again, some days I could see my friends and laugh. Sometimes I was ready to smile when Tim opened the front door. Many times I think we both just tried, not for ourselves, but for each other. My coping mechanisms are all about doing stuff and so I planned a part of our garden to dedicate to Willow, buying graph paper and poring over garden design books. We started landscaping in the coldest wettest week in February. We hired a 1.5 tonne digger. Friends and family came to help us in snow and frost, in driving rain, forking through piles of wet soil and stones to remove weeds. Our joyful little puppy Pina played in the mud at our feet and then stamped paw prints all over the kitchen floor. I found an artist to make a sculpture out of willow branches. We visited favourite beaches to collect stones to pave the path. We exhausted ourselves with manual work. In the week leading up to Mother’s Day, I stood watching the children leave the local village school. On the day itself, I opened the door to the nursery for the first time. I unfolded and refolded the babygros, and then lay down on the floor with the last one, placing it between my collar bone and navel. The dust motes floated in the afternoon sunlight. I thought of the email telling me the curtains for the nursery were waiting. When I had replied that we no longer needed them, they had simply written back: “We will send when you are ready.” I wondered if the saleswoman herself had lost a baby. I cried and cried and eventually fell asleep. When I woke up it was dark. I found two Mother’s Day cards. One from my Mum, the other from Tim, saying that I was and will always be a brilliant mother to Willow. From that day on, I left the nursery door open, and the air now circulates better through our house. We prepared for Willow’s first birthday by planning a party in her garden to raise funds for  stillborn charities. One of the charities we want to help provides memory boxes to hospitals for bereaved parents. We were given one for Willow and I found the courage to look at it again.

We prepared for Willow’s first birthday by planning a party in her garden to raise funds for stillborn charities. One of the charities we want to help provides memory boxes to hospitals for bereaved parents. We were given one for Willow and I found the courage to look at it again. This is what was inside: A white knitted blanket Willow’s hospital bracelet Photos of Willow when she was born Willow’s foot imprints A babygro from Willow’s nursery. Some of these things had been in the box when I received it, others I had added myself. I wanted to find other women who would understand the power of this box. In the weeks leading up to Willow’s birthday I began a journey around the UK to visit bereaved women who were connected with these five objects. Here are their stories: Val Isherwood runs the Tigerlily Trust, which provides hospitals with blankets, wraps and gowns for stillborn babies Everything went great with my pregnancy until probably 16 or 17 weeks. We got that phone call that started with: “Are you on your own?” The hospital told me my baby had something called Edwards’ syndrome and not to expect her to live past 28 weeks. She got to 32 weeks, and then I was getting something out of one of the bureau drawers in the lounge and felt a stab of pain. We went into hospital and her heartbeat had stopped. Even though we tried to prepare for that moment I can't really remember much about that day. I remember them saying they would give me this tablet and I'd go home and come back the next morning. I went through this phase later on where I thought: ‘Was I ever pregnant?’ I suddenly felt very scared that I had a dead body inside me and how cruel it was to send me home. But I'm so glad for that time, because it gave us that last night together. And come Tuesday morning I didn’t want to go back into hospital. I just wanted to keep her forever safe inside and felt like no-one should take her from me. But that time in hospital was just beautiful. Friends came and met Lily which was really important, because I went through this phase later on where I thought: “Was I ever pregnant?” I'd bought clothes for her early on in the pregnancy, and they were far too big, so we didn't have anything to put her in, and the hospital didn't offer us anything. So when I was in early labour we went out into town and the only thing we could find was a little T-shirt, and my Mum sewed it in the hospital into a little dress. One of my regrets is that the dress was cremated with her - I really wish that I still had what she'd been wearing. That's why now we give outfits in matching pairs so that parents can keep the one the baby has worn. We tried to have another baby as soon as we could after Lily, and we did think about IVF, but with my age the odds were stacked against me. I was 46 at the time and I didn't think I could go through all that and it not work out. So I thought a lot about acceptance - my message to myself was if it's not meant to be then that's my story. I knew I needed to find positive ways to channel all that love and energy that would have gone into raising Lily. Everything to do with the Tigerlily Trust is inspired by what I wish had been there for me. So I started appealing for knitters who would help us create the clothes I wished I had been given. People then asked if they could donate their wedding dresses to turn into little gowns, so we've got a lovely seamstress on the Isle of Man who makes them. Some of the women who had a stillborn baby before we existed were just told to go and buy a doll's dress which they felt was so insulting. Now a lot of the parents who get in touch can't believe someone has gone to those lengths to knit something to put their baby in and to give them that dignity. I have about 380 names on my list of people who have contributed in some way. Some of them are grandmas whose daughters have lost babies. My advice to other parents going through this is let yourself grieve hard. Don't be afraid of your grief - share it with people. That's almost precious time before the world sort of expects you to be OK. Let yourself have that time. Rachel Hayden runs Gifts of Remembrance, which trains midwives to take photos of stillborn babies- this section contains an image of her son Rowan who was stillborn Rowan was one of triplets, which was a bit of a surprise to me at 40 with two kids already. But the interesting thing is that when I found out I was pregnant I got a sense of him, so I felt like I already knew who he was. I went in for a scan at 31 weeks and they discovered there was no heartbeat for him. It’s a moment which I’m sure all parents of stillborn babies relate to. There’s just that stillness on the monitor. We can end up grieving not only for the fact our babies died, but... for the fact we never saw them I remember the way the nursery nurse spoke to him and handled him and it made me feel I could do the same. So it was “hello and what’s your name?” and “I bet your Mum wants to give you a cuddle”, and all this was great for me because I was utterly clueless. But I didn’t even think to ask to be involved in the memory making. She took him away and took handprints and footprints and dressed him and lay him in his Moses basket, and then took two photos of him lying there. I didn’t know what he really looked like naked or what he was wearing under his little knitted gown, and she took no photographs of him being held - he looked so alone. Although I was remarkably grateful for what I had, I later came across the work of Todd Hochberg, an amazing US photographer, and realised I could have had so much more. Not only was I blown away by the photographs and how emotional they were, but it was the stories they told - and I found myself comparing. What I say to the midwives in the training is you need to think for the future, and guide the parents through a process of gathering up details and stories, and saying: “This may feel too much now but it's going to be important later.” Very little of my training is actually about taking photographs - a big chunk of it is about midwives empowering parents, and saying the right things, and giving them time. I'll talk about how you have photographs that you might share with people, but there are plenty of photographs that just help you remember - every single photograph is going to be of importance to the family. This is actually a therapeutic intervention you are doing to help families make sense of what's happened. You're saying: “This is what happened to you in all its mess.” Midwives and nurses clean things all the time but I say just hand over everything as it is. The most precious thing to me of Rowan's is his hat because it smelt like him, so we challenge that approach. A photo of Rachel's baby, Rowan If you try and protect us then we can end up grieving not only for the fact our babies died,  but we can be grieving for the fact we never saw them. A really poignant story was a mum who said she had never seen her baby girl’s bottom - she said that her other children had birthmarks on their bottoms and she never knew if she had one. When we look back on things there'll be moments that we will even identify in terms of joy, because you're saying hello to your baby, as well as goodbye. Ruth Rodgers used to work in finance but was inspired to retrain as a midwife after the stillbirth of her daughter Scarlett. She has just started her first posting, having qualified this summer. Scarlett was born in November 2011 when I was 31 weeks pregnant. I realised she wasn’t moving so much, but I wasn’t really that worried - I did a full day of work before I went to the hospital. And they couldn't find a heartbeat pretty much straightaway. I had this amazing bereavement midwife, Jane, who I spoke to on the phone. During the two days before I went into labour she told me not to worry about things like funeral arrangements and post-mortems, but just to think about how I wanted to spend time with my little girl - helping me focus on the most important things at the right times. There's some amazing care out there, but there are also some poor things that happen repeatedly that are so easy to fix I also had a brilliant labour ward midwife. It's funny the things that you worry about - I assumed that she would have rigor mortis. I was frightened about how I might feel when I saw her. And she said: “She'll just look like a baby. She'll be a bit small, her skin might be quite thin, and she'll probably not have her eyes open, but otherwise she'll just look like your baby.” That was all I needed to hear to just carry on. Of course there were moments of utter misery, but I also have strangely fond memories of watching Strictly Come Dancing and the X Factor, and eating lasagne with one hand and holding the gas and air with the other! She was born just before six in the morning, and I remember thinking it was amazing that she was still warm and I needed to remember the way that felt because she wouldn’t stay like that. I fell pregnant again seven weeks after I'd had Scarlett, and miscarried again, having miscarried before. And that's when I became really obsessed with how having a baby works, with how all the embryology works. I read textbooks, I read research papers, I emailed professors in recurrent miscarriage - that's the way I approach life. I had another two miscarriages after that, and throughout it all Jane was basically there the whole time and we developed a really special relationship. I guess that’s really where the idea of me training to become a midwife myself started - that supportive relationship between a woman and her midwife. I was lucky enough to go on to have two beautiful boys, one just before I started training, and one in the middle of my degree. The first of these was an incredibly anxious pregnancy, and I received the most fantastic care from Jane, my consultants and my community midwife, all of whom knew my history and understood the way I felt. I could not have got through it without them, without suffering significant mental health consequences. In my third year of training I did a long stint on a labour ward and there was a lady who came in thinking she was in labour, only to find her baby had died. It was incredibly fulfilling to care for that woman and her baby and help her through everything. I think it's rarely appropriate to talk about your own experience to somebody else. If a woman specifically asked me if I’d had a stillbirth then I’d tell them, but I would never volunteer that, because the moment then would become about me and not about them. But I do suggest things that I found helpful, or that I know others did. I've met so many people over the last few years through online groups who've dealt with their grief and the process of having a subsequent baby all very differently. How you deal with having a stillbirth is incredibly personal. There's some amazing care out there, but there are also some poor things that happen repeatedly that are so easy to fix. The classic ones are not reading the mum’s notes before an appointment, or not calling the baby who died by their name. The research very clearly says that grief isn't necessarily related to gestation - there is a link, but actually the link is more to do with the “assignment of personhood”. If you have assigned a person to the baby inside you, you have created a relationship with that person that means that you feel the grief more acutely when they're gone. Publishing graduate Aliyah makes bespoke wall prints through her online shop, which help parents celebrate their baby’s name and birth date and is working on a bespoke memory book. She is expecting another baby at the end of October. One of the hardest parts is that we had bought everything for Aamiya - we had loads of clothes ready, we had her cot set up in the bedroom, everything was washed and ready for her. I had swelling but they just told me it was normal pregnancy swelling. Because I didn’t have any other symptoms I don’t think anyone was overly concerned. And then I woke up one morning and I didn’t feel anything and I just thought I should go and get checked out. And that’s when they told us she’d passed away and I found out I had pre-eclampsia. They told me my blood pressure was really high and there was lots of protein in my urine and they rushed me into delivery really fast. I must have fallen asleep because when I woke up she was already bathed and dressed, and next to me in the refrigerated cot. And that’s one thing I regret  - obviously it wasn’t in my control to stay awake, but I feel like I missed out on dressing her and that time after birth - the little things you always imagined doing for your baby. There’s that awkward moment when people don’t know what to say or do, but with my friends it was OK because they all know me so well, and they made the effort to come round and bring me flowers and chocolates. It was nice to know people cared, even if I didn’t want to speak or do anything. I’ve always been creative, and I first started with the memory book which I’m making for Aamiya. And then I found out about the baby loss community on Instagram. I got talking to a lot of mums from all over - from America, Canada - just sharing stuff that I’d done in my day and projects that I was working on. And then quite a few people started asking if I could make something for their babies too. At some point after Aamiya was born I had this overwhelming feeling of wanting everything in the house to reflect her - for everyone to remember she was here. And I think that was a way of dealing with grief - creating stuff so I could put her around the house. You can spend hours designing things and it just takes your mind off things. There have been times when I’ve thought it isn’t healthy to just be consumed by one moment in time, so I’ve put the memory book project off for a bit and focused on getting back to work and seeing friends more, but there are times when I go back to it. I’m definitely more anxious about being pregnant again since I hit the 30-week mark. At the beginning of my pregnancy, while I was happy and felt blessed that I was able to conceive another child, there were definitely feelings of guilt as you don't want your angel baby thinking they will be forgotten, because they never will be - my partner and I think about Aamiya every single day. However, as time has gone on these feelings of guilt have subsided - I truly believe this baby was sent by Aamiya. It's been a good pregnancy. Anxiety does get the better of me at times but I try and remain positive. My partner and I will make sure this baby grows up knowing all about their big sister Aamiya. Megan Evans began a vlog about stillbirth just weeks after the death of her son Milo - this section contains images of him Before Milo I thought I wasn't maternal - I've got two older brothers who wound me up about pregnancy and how painful childbirth was, so I always said I'm not having children. When the pregnancy test came back positive, I just thought I'm not supposed to have children. Because I was so young and petrified, I went straight on to YouTube and typed in “19 and pregnant” but there wasn't much there. There were a few videos but they were by 19-year-olds who had money. I needed to see someone who was just normal and working class, so the next day I told my Mum I was just going to start vlogging about my own situation. As soon as I started making those videos I had women getting in touch saying they felt the same - how they didn't have their own house and a stable financial situation either. So the vlog all started from there, and I really enjoyed having people get in touch saying “me too” which made me feel comfortable with my situation. And as time went on then everything just fitted into place. It's funny how your maternal instincts just kick in and you wouldn't imagine it any other way. One day I realised that I hadn't felt Milo move all day, and I thought I'd better get checked just in case. The midwife started to monitor me and she couldn’t find a heartbeat. And the sonographer came in, but so did a midwife, a nurse, a doctor, a consultant. So it was a whole string of people standing at the end of my bed and that's when I really clocked that something was wrong. It was as if I'd been shoved into a world that I had absolutely no idea how to navigate. The next day I spent all day seeing my family and discovered my Nan had had a son who died a few days after he was born. I asked her how I was going to survive it and she said: “Take lots of pictures, and make the most of the time you have with him.” When I went into hospital to be induced I was very scared about what he was going to look like, so I asked my Mum to see him first. She said “oh my god, he’s just perfect” and showed him to me. It was the moment I realised that was the baby I’d been carrying for eight months. Death doesn’t change anything - this was the first time I was going to meet my son. But it was also devastating. I was holding everything that I was waiting for but I knew I would have to give my baby back. My future was being erased before my eyes. I said to one of the midwives: “I feel like I'm the only person in the world this is happening to.” She replied: “It's just one of those things that nobody speaks about.” Three days after I came out of hospital I started thinking about my vlog. People were still commenting on my previous videos saying “wow I'm pregnant too”. Again I looked for vlogs about stillbirth and again I couldn’t find what I was looking for. I wasn’t expecting so many people to watch the videos because I didn’t realise how common stillbirth is. It helped me by telling his story but it was also comforting to see other people say his name. If someone you know experiences a stillbirth you don't need to know the right things to say. You just need to acknowledge their pain, acknowledge their grief, understand that you're not going to understand, and let them talk and talk until they've finished. As time's gone on, I've met a lot of people who've understood, and I've found my feet in grief which helps a lot. Rowan, Scarlett, Aamiya, Lily, Milo, and Willow. As I lay stones in their memory in a special baby loss garden in Staffordshire, I realise that even though they didn’t see the world, they have changed it through the action they have inspired in their mothers. But I also know that for each of these women there are many more who choose to hold their memories privately, who mourn behind closed doors. One in 225 pregnancies in the UK will end in stillbirth. And the death of a baby will not just affect the parents, but the grandparents, the siblings, the family and friends. A bereaved mother, in the process of getting physical care, gets emotional care throughout, but this risks men feeling sidelined, and powerless to help. The parents I speak to agree that the taboo and silence around stillbirth seems to be gradually easing, but there are still many people who have simply never spoken to me about Willow, never said her name. My arms no longer ache like those first hours, but they are still empty - I am a mother without a baby I have, though, felt support from so many people, especially women, many of whom I’d never even met before. As a journalist I have specialised in women’s stories around the world for many years, and yet only this has made me feel an invisible solidarity, a wall of history, of empathy, of strength from women around me. Over the past year my need to remember and memorialise Willow has jostled with my need for self-preservation. A year on, grief can still occasionally floor me, slicing behind my knees, but I can feel it coming and I can prepare, knowing I can survive its brief but powerful kick. Willow’s birth made me a Mum and Tim a Dad. My arms no longer ache like those first hours, but they are still empty. I am a mother without a baby. I think about my own mother. For weeks she sat in our house, the horrific shadow of bereavement hanging over us, my hacking sobs punctuated by the clack of her knitting needles. She made a beautiful pure white blanket for a baby box which will be opened at a time of immense loss. She knitted it for a stranger who at the time of knitting was an excited expectant mother-to-be, but whose baby would come too early, too sick, or simply stillborn for no known reason.  That baby - we will never know his or her name - will be rocked and mourned in their parents’ arms and will also, thanks to my Mum, have an extra layer, wrapped also in my family’s love - our endurance and our hope.

"An eight-year-old found a pre-Viking-era sword while swimming in a lake in Sweden during the summer. Saga Vanecek found the relic in the Vidostern lake while at her family's holiday home in Jonkoping County. The sword was initially reported to be 1,000 years old, but experts at the local museum now believe it may date to around 1,500 years ago. ""It's not every day that you step on a sword in the lake!"" Mikael Nordstrom from the museum said. This video can not be played Saga Vanecek: ""I noticed something that felt like a stick"" The level of the water was extremely low at the time, owing to a drought, which is probably why Saga uncovered the ancient weapon. ""I felt something in the water and lifted it up. Then there was a handle and I went to tell my dad that it looked like a sword,"" Saga told the broadcaster Sveriges Television. Saga's father Andy Vanecek told the English-language website The Local he initially thought his daughter had found an unusual stick or branch in the water. Roman road discovered in Dutch town Drugs trace find inside Bronze Age jug Nursery to teach 'Viking language' It was only after he asked a friend to take a closer look did he discover that it was likely to be an ancient relic. The local museum, where the sword is now being kept, said it was extremely well-preserved. Further excavations have revealed more ancient items lurk at the bottom of the lake Saga's discovery led the museum and local council to carry out further excavations at the site, finding a brooch from the 3rd Century. The Jonkoping county museum said that its investigation of the lake is unfinished and it could yet turn up more ancient items.

"Elon Musk has mocked a US financial regulator just days after reaching an agreement with it over fraud charges. The Tesla boss tweeted the ""Shortseller Enrichment Commission"", as he dubbed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), was doing ""incredible work"". Last weekend Mr Musk agreed to step down as Tesla chairman and pay a $20m (Â£15m) fine over tweets that he had funding to take Tesla private. The deal followed the SEC's decision to sue him for alleged securities fraud. The SEC declined to comment on Mr Musk's latest tweet. Allow Twitter content?

The SEC's allegation of fraud against Mr Musk related to tweets he posted in August in which he said he was considering taking electronic car maker Tesla off the stock market and into private ownership. He wrote he had ""funding secured"" for the proposal, which would value Tesla at $420 per share. Shares in the company briefly rose after his announcement, but later fell again. The SEC said those claims were ""false and misleading"". At the time, short-sellers, who make a profit by borrowing shares, selling them and then buying them back at an expected lower price, claimed to have lost millions thanks to Mr Musk's comments. The Tesla boss's dislike of short-sellers is well-known: He once called them ""jerks who want us to die"". Following his attack on the SEC, Mr Musk referred back to a tweet of his from 2012 in which he had described short-sellers as ""unreasonably maligned"", indicating that he had changed his view. ""The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned,"" he tweeted. ""What they do should be illegal."" Under the deal reached between the SEC and Mr Musk last weekend, Mr Musk will remain as Tesla chief executive but has to step down as chairman for three years. BBC North America technology reporter Dave Lee said many people had expected Mr Musk would ""rein in his Twitter habit"". Shares in Tesla closed down 4.4% on Thursday, and fell further in after-hours trading following Mr Musk's tweet. Also on Thursday, District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan gave Mr Musk and the SEC until 11 October to explain why the deal they had struck was fair and reasonable and would not hurt the public interest.

"Cristiano Ronaldo has a lucrative contract with Nike Nike has said it is ""deeply concerned"" by rape allegations against footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. The US sportswear giant - which has a contract worth a reported $1bn (Â£768m) with Ronaldo - said it would ""continue to closely monitor the situation"", the Associated Press reports. EA Sports, which also has a contract with Ronaldo, made similar comments. Ronaldo, 33, earlier ""firmly"" denied assaulting Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. Ms Mayorga, a 34-year-old US former teacher, was inspired to speak out by the #MeToo movement, her lawyer said.

Der Spiegel said Ms Mayorga had filed a report with Las Vegas police shortly after the alleged incident. But the next year, she reportedly reached an out-of-court settlement with Ronaldo involving a $375,000 (Â£288,000) payment for agreeing never to go public with the allegations. Her lawyers are now seeking to declare the non-disclosure agreement void. In a lawsuit, Ms Mayorga says she met Ronaldo at the Rain Nightclub in the Palms Hotel and Casino, and that he raped her in his penthouse suite. Mr Stovall said his client had suffered from major depression and considered suicide since the alleged assault almost a decade ago. He said a psychiatrist had diagnosed Ms Mayorga with post-traumatic stress disorder. Las Vegas police confirmed on Tuesdaythey had initially investigated a complaint in June 2009,but added they had no suspect in the case.

"Waitrose is to test a delivery service which will allow drivers to enter a customer's home while they are out, and put their groceries away. The trial uses smart lock technology to allow customers to set an access code for their door lock which is deleted when the delivery is complete. The pilot starting later this month will involve 100 homes in south London. Profit margins on home deliveries are thin, and one analyst said the aim was to boost loyalty and profitability. Amazon service lets couriers unlock door Can supermarkets really deliver in a day? Waitrose, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership, will be the first UK supermarket to try ""in-home"" deliveries. Archie Mason, Waitrose head of business development, said there was ""an increasing demand"" among customers to make shopping ""even more convenient to fit around their busy lifestyles"". ""The concept of 'in-home delivery' has started to prove popular in other countries so we are keen to establish if there is an appetite for it in the UK,"" he said. Waitrose has teamed up with lock maker Yale to launch the trial. Participating customers will set a temporary access code for their smart lock which will be sent to Waitrose via a secure app. The code will be forwarded to the driver at the scheduled delivery time and deleted after the delivery has been made. The driver will wear a body camera and customers will be able to view the video the next working day, if they wish. Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, said his own research showed a ""surprisingly high proportion"" of people would be happy to allow drivers access to their homes when they were not there. Online deliveries operated on ""wafer thin margins"", he added, and it was ""increasingly difficult to make a profit"". ""Convenience is the key driver [for this scheme] and in turn that's going to drive loyalty, drive increased basket values and it will drive profitability as well,"" he said. He also said there could be potential efficiencies for retailers, if wider delivery windows meant drivers could cut down on the distance travelled between deliveries. In recent years, the arrival of discounters Aldi and Lidl and the increasing popularity of online delivery has ramped up competition in the supermarket sector. Last month, Waitrose published results for the six months to 28 September which showed like-for-like sales were up 2.6%, but operating profits fell 12% to Â£96.4m.

"Ms Murad and Dr Mukwege made a ""crucial contribution"" to fighting violence against women The 2018 Nobel Peace Prize has gone to campaigners against rape in warfare, Nadia Murad and Denis Mukwege. Ms Murad is an Iraqi Yazidi who was tortured and raped by Islamic State militants and later became the face of a campaign to free the Yazidi people. Dr Mukwege is a Congolese gynaecologist who, along with his colleagues, has treated tens of thousands of victims. Some 331 individuals and organisations were nominated for the prestigious peace award this year. The winners announced in the Norwegian capital Oslo on Friday won the award for their ""efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war"", Berit Reiss-Andersen, the Nobel committee chair, said. DR Congo's 'Doctor Miracle' Enslaved by IS in Iraq Who are the Yazidis? The pair both made a ""crucial contribution to focusing attention on, and combating, such war crimes"", Ms Reiss-Andersen added. Ms Murad, 25, said in a statement that many Yazidis would ""look upon this prize and think of family members that were lost, are still unaccounted for, and of the 1,300 women and children, which remain in captivity"". ""For myself, I think of my mother, who was murdered by DAESH [IS], the children with whom I grew up, and what we must do to honour them,"" she added. ""Persecution of minorities must end. We must work together with determination - to prove that genocidal campaigns will not only fail, but lead to accountability for the perpetrators and justice for the survivors."" New Iraqi President Barham Saleh called the award ""an honour for all Iraqis who fought terrorism and bigotry"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Dr Mukwege was operating at his hospital when he heard he had won the prize. ""I was in the operating room so when they started to make noise around [it] I wasn't really thinking about what was going on, and suddenly some people came in and told me the news,"" he told Norwegian newspaper VG. He dedicated his award to all women affected by sexual violence. ""This Nobel prize is a recognition of the suffering and the failure to adequately compensate women who are victims of rape and sexual violence in all countries around the world,"" he told reporters gathered outside his clinic. Ms Murad did not just lose her mother in the genocide. She endured three months as a sex slave at the hands of IS militants. She was bought and sold several times and subjected to sexual and physical abuse during her captivity. After escaping, she became an activist for the Yazidi people, campaigning to help put an end to human trafficking and calling on the world to take a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. Ms Murad described her escape in a BBC interview in 2016, detailing how the women who were held captive were treated by IS. This video can not be played WATCH: Nadia Murad was held captive as a sex slave by so called Islamic State - she tells the BBC's HardTalk how she escaped She was awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Council of Europe in 2016 and called for an international court to judge crimes committed by IS in her acceptance speech in Strasbourg. Ms Murad, the first Iraqi to win the award, was named the UN's first goodwill ambassador for survivors of human trafficking later that year. He has spent decades helping rape victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He and his colleagues are said to have treated about 30,000 rape victims, developing great expertise in the treatment of serious injuries sustained during sex assaults that were carried out as a weapon of war. The 63-year-old has won a number of international prizes, including the 2008 UN Human Rights Prize, and was named African of the Year in 2009. He lives under the permanent protection of UN peacekeepers at his hospital and has also previously called for a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. It was in 1999 that our first rape victim was brought into the hospital. After being raped, bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs. I thought that was a barbaric act of war but the real shock came three months later. Forty-five women came to us with the same story, they were all saying: ""People came into my village and raped me, tortured me."" Other women came to us with burns. They said that after they had been raped, chemicals had been poured on their genitals. Dr Mukwege travelled to northern Iraq in June to visit the Yazidi minority's holiest sites I started to ask myself what was going on. These weren't just violent acts of war, but part of a strategy. You had situations where multiple people were raped at the same time, publicly - a whole village might be raped during the night. In doing this, they hurt not just the victims but the whole community, which they force to watch. The result of this strategy is that people are forced to flee their villages, abandon their fields, their resources, everything. It's very effective. Read how Dr Mukwege went on to help thousands Earlier this weekthe Nobel prize for physics was awarded to Donna Strickland, only the third woman winner of the award and the first in 55 years. The Canadian was honoured along with Arthur Ashkin, from the US, and Gerard Mourou, from France. The Nobel prize for medicine was awarded to two scientists- Professor James P Allison from the US and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan - who discovered how to fight cancer using the body's immune system. For chemistry, the prize was awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in enzyme research.

"This video can not be played Candace Wilson says she has only managed to save by living with members of her family Young people in the UK are losing the savings habit - with more than half of 22 to 29-year-olds living with no savings at all, official figures show. Some 53% of this age group have nothing in a savings account or Individual Savings Account (Isa), the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The squeeze on pay and the prevalence of insecure work mean many cannot put money aside. Ten years ago, 41% of the equivalent age group had no savings. Among those who are saving now, seen in the chart below, nearly four in 10 have no more than Â£1,000 tucked away. On average, those in this age group who do save have Â£1,600 in the bank - up from Â£900 a decade ago. However, a savings gap has also emerged with the top 10% of savers having Â£15,000 or more set aside, according to the latest figures from 2014 to 2016, compared with the bottom 10% who had less than Â£100. Pay your savings first - set up a standing order to move money after payday. Automate your savings - link your bank account to a smart app. The app analyses your spending habits and decides how much you can afford to save, and automatically moves the money into a savings account. Round up your spending - some banks have a feature where you can round up transactions to the nearest pound. So spend Â£1.30 and 70p will be moved to a separate pot. Make it difficult to spend your savings - if you are likely to dip into your savings for impulse purchases, keep the money in an account which is hard to access. Spend in cash - if you're going on a night out, take cash with you and leave your cards at home. Then dump any change you have left to gradually build up a pot of notes and coins. How safe are my savings after the financial crisis? Why are so many of us not saving for a rainy day? Home ownership has also fallen since the financial crisis, with the proportion of 22 to 29-year-olds with their own property falling by 10 percentage points between 2008 and 2017, according to the ONS. As a result, more were living at home or renting, primarily from private landlords, since the financial crisis. The cost of renting is putting pressure on many young people who want to live on their own,according to BBC research. Why was I ashamed of the fact my mum had no money?,external Tenant rights: Can a landlord kick me out? The pay gap in this age group sees the highest earning 10% of 22 to 29-year-olds paid at least 4.3 times as much per week as the lowest earners, according to the latest figures from 2017. However, there is some cheer for young adults in the data, which shows 37% of this age group were in debt compared with 49% a decade ago. Significantly, this debt does not include student loans. Those with debts, seen in the chart below, owe an average of Â£1,900 - some Â£100 more than the typical debt 10 years earlier. The 10% most indebted owed at least Â£14,200, the latest data shows.

"Does my environmental impact look big in this? Young people's love of fast fashion is coming under the scrutiny of Britain's law-makers. MPs say the fashion industry is a major source of the greenhouse gases that are overheating the planet. Discarded clothes are also piling up in landfill sites and fibre fragments are flowing into the sea when clothes are washed. The retailers admit more needs to be done, but say they are already working to reduce the impact of their products. Would you rent rather than buy your clothes? The House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee says there is a basic problem with an industry that relies on persuading people to throw away good clothes because they are ""last year's colour"". It quotes evidence that: British shoppers buy far more new clothes than any nation in Europe People are buying twice as many items of clothing as they did a decade ago Fish in the seas are eating synthetic fibres dislodged in the wash The MPs have written to the UK's top fashion bosses asking how they can maintain the Â£28bn benefit their industry brings to the UK economy, while reducing the environmental harm. They believe swift action is essential, because if current clothes consumption continues ""...they will account for more than a quarter of our total impact on climate change by 2050"", chairwoman Mary Creagh told BBC News. ""Three in five garments end in landfill or incinerators within a year - that's expensive fuel! Half a million tonnes of microfibres a year enter the ocean. Doing nothing is not an option."" Shouldn't more clothing be re-used? The committee's report to government could include a call for the fashion industry to create less pollution, a demand for longer life for garments and a ban on dumping clothes in landfill. The MPs also have concerns about social impacts. They believe fast fashion is fuelling quick turnarounds among suppliers, which may lead to poor working conditions. Among their questions to retailers are: Do you pay the living wage and how do you ensure child labour is not used in factories? Do you use recycled materials? How long do you keep clothes, and how do you encourage recycling? Do you incinerate unsold or returned stock? How are you reducing the flow of microfibres into the sea? Will we ever get self-healing smartphones? Why 12 is the magic number when it comes to composting Could circular economics fix the planet? Why are 99.75% of coffee cups not recycled? More on theCircular Economy. Peter Andrews, head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, told BBC News that population growth and increased demand have led to an increase in the overall volume and environmental impact of clothing. But, he said his members are now designing products that are made to last, and they are encouraging customers to return unwanted clothes for reuse. ""We know more needs to be done, but the best answers will be achieved with collaborative global actions."" The companies approached by the MPs are: M&S, Primark, Next, Arcadia, Asda, TK Maxx and HomeSense, Tesco, JD Sports Fashion, Debenhams, Sports Direct International.

"A criminal investigation has been launched after a backlog of medical waste was allowed to build up at several disposal sites. It emerged on Thursday that the waste from hospitals had not been disposed of in a timely fashion by contractor Healthcare Environmental Services. The Environment Agency said the firm was in breach of permits. HES said it had previously highlighted the need to invest in the UK's ""ageing"" incinerator network for clinical waste. The Department of Health in England said there was no risk to the public. A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency in England said it had found HES to be in breach of environmental permits at five sites which deal with clinical waste. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) also confirmed that it issued enforcement notices at sites in Dundee and Shotts last month, where its officers are conducting ""ongoing monitoring"". A Cobra meeting to discuss the issue was chaired by English Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month,according to the Health Service Journal,external, which first reported the story. A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency said: ""We are taking enforcement action against the operator, which includes clearance of the excess waste, and have launched a criminal investigation. ""We are supporting the government and the NHS to ensure there is no disruption to public services and for alternative plans to be put in place for hospitals affected to dispose of their waste safely."" Princess Anne toured Healthcare Environmental's Lanarkshire plant during a visit earlier this year SEPA said it was working closely with the Environment Agency and ""robustly monitoring sites in Scotland"". HES has a transfer station for waste in Dundee and a storage, processing and incineration site at Shotts. SEPA said the company had not gone over its agreed regulatory limits for either of the two Scottish sites. A UK government spokesman said it was monitoring the situation closely and had made sure that public services - including NHS Trusts - had contingency plans in place. He added: ""There is absolutely no risk to the health of patients or the wider public. ""Our priority is to prevent disruption to the NHS and other vital public services and work is under way to ensure organisations can continue to dispose of their waste safely and efficiently."" The Scottish government said there had been no reports of any impact on services from NHS boards in Scotland. A spokesman added: ""In the event of any disruption to service at NHS sites across Scotland, NHS Scotland already has contingency plans ready to put into place to ensure there is no impact on services to patients or staff."" Company director Garry Pettigrew with Princess Anne during her visit Healthcare Environmental Services describes itself on its website as the ""UK's leading independent provider of healthcare waste management"". Its latest company accounts show it had a turnover of just over Â£31m in the year to the end of April 2017. They credited an 18% increase in sales to a new treatment plant in Newcastle. Company directors Garry and Alison Pettigrew were paid Â£299,521 between them. They also shared dividends of Â£480,000. The company owns land and buildings worth Â£3.7m. HES said it had highlighted the reduction in the UK's high-temperature incineration capacity for the last few years to the UK government, NHS bodies and the Environment Agency. The company said all of its waste was stored ""in accordance with strict regulations"". ""Anatomical waste is not stored on any of our facilities for longer than is allowed by permitted guidelines,"" HES said. A spokesman added:  ""We have welcomed visits from the EA a number of times over the past few months and have pointed out to them that the amount of waste produced by the NHS for incineration far outweighs the entire incineration capabilities of the UK, and not just HES. ""We are not the only company to feel the strain on our services, with many of our competitors continually breaching storage regulations."" Healthcare Environmental Services' headquarters is in Shotts in Lanarkshire The firm also has a depot in Dundee Jonathan Ashworth, Labour's shadow health and social care secretary in England, called on Matt Hancock to make a statement in the House of Commons on the ""staggering revelations"" next week. ""When something of this scale is going on which the government has known about for some time they have a responsibility to come to Parliament and explain to Parliament whether they've got credible contingency plans and to reassure MPs who will represent those 50 hospital trusts,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World At One. ""Given the scale of this, it's hugely disappointing that the secretary of state has not done this,"" he added. Unison's head of health, Sara Gorton, described the situation as ""simply horrific"", saying it was ""unlikely that such a distressing situation would have happened had the service remained in-house"".

"Unilever, which makes Marmite and Dove soap, has scrapped its plan to move its headquarters to the Netherlands after growing criticism from investors. The firm has headquarters in both London and Rotterdam, but announced in March that it planned to have just one HQ located in the Dutch city. But investors said the move could force UK shareholders to sell their shares. Unilever said it recognised ""the proposal has not received support from a significant group of shareholders"". However, chairman Marijn Dekkers said that the board continued to believe that simplifying Unilever's Anglo-Dutch structure was in the firm's best interests. ""The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders,""the company said in a statement.,external Unilever's current dual-headed structure has existed since 1930, when Dutch margarine firm Unie merged with British soap maker Lever Brothers. It is one of the biggest firms in the UK's FTSE 100 share index, valued at about Â£124bn. Ben & Jerry's ice cream is one of Unilever's brands The company -  which also makes Pot Noodle and Ben & Jerry's ice cream - will keep its listing on the London Stock Exchange. Under UK rules it would not have been eligible to be a member of the FTSE 100 had the proposed change gone through. This had concerned investors in the company, who were worried the change could spark a sell-off and drive down the share price. When Unilever first unveiled its plan in March, some had speculated that it was making the move because of Brexit - claims the firm denied. Simon Jack, BBC business editor Unilever's proposal to move its corporate headquarters and primary listing to the Netherlands had the appeal of one of its most famous products - Marmite. Some shareholders loved it but a significant number hated it. For those that bought the shares because of Unilever's inclusion in the FTSE 100 it was very off-putting indeed. Unilever's move would have meant ejection from a globally significant index which many funds track by buying all of its members. Thus it would have made many of them forced sellers at a time not of their choosing. The proposed move was a reaction to the hostile but short-lived takeover bid from Kraft Heinz, and was never about Brexit. But significant shareholder resistance highlights the power of London's capital markets and the cachet of its leading index. Global shareholders like global companies listed on a global index. A significant number of Unilever shareholders are saying that means staying in London - that does have post-Brexit significance. Read Simon's analysis in full One of the shareholders who had expressed discontent, and who did not want to be named, told the BBC they would now expect to see a ""sea change"" at board level with non-executive directors leaving. Aviva Investors said it was ""pleased"" with Unilever's decision to withdraw its proposal. Last month, Aviva Investors' chief investment officer for equities David Cumming told the BBC the move could force UK shareholders to sell their shares and offered ""no upside"". He said Unilever was looking for ""protection"" after a failed takeover bid by US food giant Kraft Heinz in 2017. Royal London Asset Management said it welcomed the decision. Earlier this week, the firm's head of equities, Peter Rutter, had told the BBC that Unilever's proposal would not benefit its UK clients and that Royal London was going to vote against it. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said that the backlash from both institutional and retail investors ""meant that the writing was on the wall"" for Unilever's plan. Thousands of Interactive Investor customers hold Unilever shares, Ms O'Keeffe said, with ""hundreds of millions invested"". Why did Unilever back down over HQ?

"This video can not be played 100 Women: Undercover in London, catching harassers on the Tube (video from Oct 2017) Crime recorded on British railways has increased by almost a fifth, including a rise in the number of violent and sexual offences, police figures show. British Transport Police recorded 2,472 sexual offences last year, up 16%, and 11,711 violent crimes, up by 26%. The figures also showed big rises in cable thefts and arson attacks. The End Violence Against Women Coalition said a rise in the number of people reporting sexual violence was partly because of the #MeToo movement. It added that there have also been initiatives to encourage reporting over the past few years. The #MeToo campaign has encouraged women globally to speak out about sexual harassment and abuse. Big rise in sexual offences on trains Violent crime rising, police figures suggest Are England and Wales experiencing a crime wave? Overall, BTP recorded 61,159 crimes in 2017-18 in England, Scotland and Wales, a rise of 17%. Offences involving knives or other weapons increased by 46% to 206, while robbery rose by 53% to 553 recorded crimes. BTP figures also show a number of other crimes increasing on the rail network, including: Throwing missiles at trains (up 35% to 316) Arson (up 93% to 143) Live cable theft (up 86% to 158) Theft from vending machines (up 21% to 240) BTP Chief Constable Paul Crowther said: ""The chances of becoming a victim of crime on the rail network remains low. ""However, after a long period of steady decreases, both crimes per million passenger journeys and notifiable offences have increased."" A notifiable offence is any offence where the police must inform the Home Office for statistical purposes. Nineteen crimes were recorded per million passenger journeys. This graph shows violent crime recorded by all forces in England and Wales The BTP said the increase in the total number of crimes was partly due to improving the way crime is recorded. It said this had increased accuracy and given victims and witnesses ""more confidence to report crime"". Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ""There has been a huge increase in the number of women reporting sexual violence in the last year, partly as a consequence of #MeToo and because we have seen initiatives to encourage reporting over the last few years. ""If we're going to encourage women to report sexual violence, we also need to make sure they can have confidence their report will be taken seriously, and that everything will be done to ensure their report results in action."" Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail firms, said Britain's railways were the safest in Europe. But he added: ""The nature of some crimes is changing and as part of our long-term plan to change and improve, we are investing in new technology and innovations to make our railway even safer for our staff and customers.""

A notifiable offence is any offence where the police must inform the Home Office for statistical purposes. Nineteen crimes were recorded per million passenger journeys.

It said this had increased accuracy and given victims and witnesses ""more confidence to report crime"". Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ""There has been a huge increase in the number of women reporting sexual violence in the last year, partly as a consequence of #MeToo and because we have seen initiatives to encourage reporting over the last few years. ""If we're going to encourage women to report sexual violence, we also need to make sure they can have confidence their report will be taken seriously, and that everything will be done to ensure their report results in action."" Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which represents rail firms, said Britain's railways were the safest in Europe. But he added: ""The nature of some crimes is changing and as part of our long-term plan to change and improve, we are investing in new technology and innovations to make our railway even safer for our staff and customers.""

"Both Unilever's boss and the UK government were absolutely adamant that the company's decision to scrap its UK headquarters has got nothing to do with Brexit. In fact, chief executive Paul Polman said the decision to base two of the company's three divisions in the UK was a vote of confidence in the UK and ensured continued jobs and investment. He pointed to the opening of a new Â£70m advanced manufacturing centre on the Wirral as evidence of the company's commitment to the UK. Ditching the London HQis no small matter, however. Although it will keep a listing on the London Stock Exchange, it almost certainly will not be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE 100. That matters, because the many investment funds that exactly mirror that index are obliged to buy and hold shares of Unilever as long as it's in the index. Those funds will be forced to sell the shares when it leaves. So why would you want to do that? Many think the real reason Unilever is leaving is takeovers - defending against them and potentially making them. When Kraft Heinz launched one of the world's biggest (and shortest lived) takeover bids for Unilever last year, Paul Polman could be found complaining that UK takeover rules pandered to the interests of shareholders over those of customers, workers, suppliers, communities and the environment. The relevant section of UK law (section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 if you must know) does mention some of these groups but the law is very clear that shareholders' interests are paramount. Unilever owns many well-known household brands What shareholders want, shareholders get. And in a takeover situation, many shareholders want more money now - and so the directors are obliged to deliver that by accepting a good takeover price. (As it happens, Kraft Heinz backed off quickly when it realised the Unilever board was dead set against the deal). Mr Polman insisted that protection from takeovers is not the reason the company is moving as takeover rules in the UK and the Netherlands are converging - but there are still important differences. In the Netherlands, those wider interests hold much more legal and cultural sway and so it's harder for a corporate raider to succeed. Mr Polman, a Dutchman, has been a very vocal campaigner for exactly this brand of sustainable capitalism. It is not impossible to buy a Dutch company, but as PPG Industries found when it tried to buy Dulux owner Akzo Nobel, it's bloomin' difficult. It matters as much who you are and what kind of track record you have as much as how much money you are offering. Paradoxically perhaps, this move also makes it easier for Unilever to launch takeover bids of its own. A company with two HQs, two legal entities, two boards and a very complicated capital structure is very hard to get around one table to decide whether or not to make purchases of its own. Mr Polman conceded as much when he told me that the new company would be more ""agile"". Mr Polman played down the role of the headquarters in a modern organisation. ""The old notion of a headquarters with people smoking cigars, making decisions is over with. We are a very decentralised organisation,"" he said. Nevertheless, what was Lever Brothers in the 1890s, and became Unilever in 1930 with the merger with a Dutch margarine company, is now a 100% Dutch company which employs people in the UK. In the same way that McDonald's is 100% American. The government tried to make a brave face of it today by accentuating the positive news that two of its fastest-growing divisions will be managed by personnel here in the UK. But Greg Clark and Theresa May lobbied hard for this not to happen and will be disappointed that it has. They both know full well that one of UK's biggest companies abandoning its London HQ sends an unhelpful signal to the rest of the corporate world at a time of fragile confidence.

"Unilever, which makes Marmite and Dove soap, has scrapped its plan to move its headquarters to the Netherlands after growing criticism from investors. The firm has headquarters in both London and Rotterdam, but announced in March that it planned to have just one HQ located in the Dutch city. But investors said the move could force UK shareholders to sell their shares. Unilever said it recognised ""the proposal has not received support from a significant group of shareholders"". However, chairman Marijn Dekkers said that the board continued to believe that simplifying Unilever's Anglo-Dutch structure was in the firm's best interests. ""The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders,""the company said in a statement.,external Unilever's current dual-headed structure has existed since 1930, when Dutch margarine firm Unie merged with British soap maker Lever Brothers. It is one of the biggest firms in the UK's FTSE 100 share index, valued at about Â£124bn. Ben & Jerry's ice cream is one of Unilever's brands The company -  which also makes Pot Noodle and Ben & Jerry's ice cream - will keep its listing on the London Stock Exchange. Under UK rules it would not have been eligible to be a member of the FTSE 100 had the proposed change gone through. This had concerned investors in the company, who were worried the change could spark a sell-off and drive down the share price. When Unilever first unveiled its plan in March, some had speculated that it was making the move because of Brexit - claims the firm denied. Simon Jack, BBC business editor Unilever's proposal to move its corporate headquarters and primary listing to the Netherlands had the appeal of one of its most famous products - Marmite. Some shareholders loved it but a significant number hated it. For those that bought the shares because of Unilever's inclusion in the FTSE 100 it was very off-putting indeed. Unilever's move would have meant ejection from a globally significant index which many funds track by buying all of its members. Thus it would have made many of them forced sellers at a time not of their choosing. The proposed move was a reaction to the hostile but short-lived takeover bid from Kraft Heinz, and was never about Brexit. But significant shareholder resistance highlights the power of London's capital markets and the cachet of its leading index. Global shareholders like global companies listed on a global index. A significant number of Unilever shareholders are saying that means staying in London - that does have post-Brexit significance. Read Simon's analysis in full One of the shareholders who had expressed discontent, and who did not want to be named, told the BBC they would now expect to see a ""sea change"" at board level with non-executive directors leaving. Aviva Investors said it was ""pleased"" with Unilever's decision to withdraw its proposal. Last month, Aviva Investors' chief investment officer for equities David Cumming told the BBC the move could force UK shareholders to sell their shares and offered ""no upside"". He said Unilever was looking for ""protection"" after a failed takeover bid by US food giant Kraft Heinz in 2017. Royal London Asset Management said it welcomed the decision. Earlier this week, the firm's head of equities, Peter Rutter, had told the BBC that Unilever's proposal would not benefit its UK clients and that Royal London was going to vote against it. Rebecca O'Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said that the backlash from both institutional and retail investors ""meant that the writing was on the wall"" for Unilever's plan. Thousands of Interactive Investor customers hold Unilever shares, Ms O'Keeffe said, with ""hundreds of millions invested"". Why did Unilever back down over HQ?

"This video can not be played Candace Wilson says she has only managed to save by living with members of her family Young people in the UK are losing the savings habit - with more than half of 22 to 29-year-olds living with no savings at all, official figures show. Some 53% of this age group have nothing in a savings account or Individual Savings Account (Isa), the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The squeeze on pay and the prevalence of insecure work mean many cannot put money aside. Ten years ago, 41% of the equivalent age group had no savings. Among those who are saving now, seen in the chart below, nearly four in 10 have no more than Â£1,000 tucked away. On average, those in this age group who do save have Â£1,600 in the bank - up from Â£900 a decade ago. However, a savings gap has also emerged with the top 10% of savers having Â£15,000 or more set aside, according to the latest figures from 2014 to 2016, compared with the bottom 10% who had less than Â£100. Pay your savings first - set up a standing order to move money after payday. Automate your savings - link your bank account to a smart app. The app analyses your spending habits and decides how much you can afford to save, and automatically moves the money into a savings account. Round up your spending - some banks have a feature where you can round up transactions to the nearest pound. So spend Â£1.30 and 70p will be moved to a separate pot. Make it difficult to spend your savings - if you are likely to dip into your savings for impulse purchases, keep the money in an account which is hard to access. Spend in cash - if you're going on a night out, take cash with you and leave your cards at home. Then dump any change you have left to gradually build up a pot of notes and coins. How safe are my savings after the financial crisis? Why are so many of us not saving for a rainy day? Home ownership has also fallen since the financial crisis, with the proportion of 22 to 29-year-olds with their own property falling by 10 percentage points between 2008 and 2017, according to the ONS. As a result, more were living at home or renting, primarily from private landlords, since the financial crisis. The cost of renting is putting pressure on many young people who want to live on their own,according to BBC research. Why was I ashamed of the fact my mum had no money?,external Tenant rights: Can a landlord kick me out? The pay gap in this age group sees the highest earning 10% of 22 to 29-year-olds paid at least 4.3 times as much per week as the lowest earners, according to the latest figures from 2017. However, there is some cheer for young adults in the data, which shows 37% of this age group were in debt compared with 49% a decade ago. Significantly, this debt does not include student loans. Those with debts, seen in the chart below, owe an average of Â£1,900 - some Â£100 more than the typical debt 10 years earlier. The 10% most indebted owed at least Â£14,200, the latest data shows.

"Waitrose is to test a delivery service which will allow drivers to enter a customer's home while they are out, and put their groceries away. The trial uses smart lock technology to allow customers to set an access code for their door lock which is deleted when the delivery is complete. The pilot starting later this month will involve 100 homes in south London. Profit margins on home deliveries are thin, and one analyst said the aim was to boost loyalty and profitability. Amazon service lets couriers unlock door Can supermarkets really deliver in a day? Waitrose, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership, will be the first UK supermarket to try ""in-home"" deliveries. Archie Mason, Waitrose head of business development, said there was ""an increasing demand"" among customers to make shopping ""even more convenient to fit around their busy lifestyles"". ""The concept of 'in-home delivery' has started to prove popular in other countries so we are keen to establish if there is an appetite for it in the UK,"" he said. Waitrose has teamed up with lock maker Yale to launch the trial. Participating customers will set a temporary access code for their smart lock which will be sent to Waitrose via a secure app. The code will be forwarded to the driver at the scheduled delivery time and deleted after the delivery has been made. The driver will wear a body camera and customers will be able to view the video the next working day, if they wish. Richard Lim, chief executive of consultancy Retail Economics, said his own research showed a ""surprisingly high proportion"" of people would be happy to allow drivers access to their homes when they were not there. Online deliveries operated on ""wafer thin margins"", he added, and it was ""increasingly difficult to make a profit"". ""Convenience is the key driver [for this scheme] and in turn that's going to drive loyalty, drive increased basket values and it will drive profitability as well,"" he said. He also said there could be potential efficiencies for retailers, if wider delivery windows meant drivers could cut down on the distance travelled between deliveries. In recent years, the arrival of discounters Aldi and Lidl and the increasing popularity of online delivery has ramped up competition in the supermarket sector. Last month, Waitrose published results for the six months to 28 September which showed like-for-like sales were up 2.6%, but operating profits fell 12% to Â£96.4m.

"This video can not be played Footage shows former rap label boss Marion ""Suge"" Knight running over two men with his pick-up truck - the man in this clip survived Ex-rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight showed no emotion as he was sentenced for a hit-and-run amid emotional statements from his victim's family. The daughter of one victim called Knight ""truly a disgusting, selfish disgrace to the human species"" as Knight received 28 years behind bars. In September, Knight pleaded no contest to a 2015 fatal hit-and-run on the set of the film Straight Outta Compton. His record label helped launch rappers including Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg. The 55-year-old founder of Death Row Records had reached a plea deal last month with investigators over the driving attack, which left one man dead and another with serious injuries. The deal allowed him to avoid charges of murder and attempted murder with his pick-up truck in the Los Angeles neighbourhood of Compton. The incident happened after an argument over the making of Straight Outta Compton, a biopic about rap group NWA. Plea deal for hit-and-run rap mogul Crystal Carter, a daughter of victim Terry Carter, addressed Knight during the hearing in an LA courthouse on Thursday. ""You're unrepentant,"" Ms Carter said. ""Your callous actions took my dad's life away."" She told the judge that Knight deserved more than 28 years in jail. Suge Knight says Tupac may be alive Six of the most notorious execs in music How rock and rap combined to create Beats ""He is truly a disgusting, selfish disgrace to the human species,""she said,external. ""He murdered my dad in cold blood and is a menace to society."" Mr Carter's widow told local media that thinking about the crime still makes her ""feel numb"". ""I really don't want him to ever leave jail. I hope he spends the rest of his life there,"" she said. Throughout the sentencing hearing, Knight sat silently wearing an orange jail jumpsuit and a large crucifix. Sales and profits for Knight's Death Row Records declined after he was imprisoned in 1996 The maximum penalty for voluntary manslaughter in California is 11 years. But the sentence was doubled because of Knight's prior convictions under the state's three-strikes law, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said. Footage of the incident captured by security cameras show Knight's vehicle pulling up to the drive-in hamburger shop, with one of the victims approaching the driver's side window. Following what appears to be a brief discussion, a struggle then ensues. Knight's truck is seen going into reverse, throwing the man to the ground. It then moves forward, driving over his legs and slams into the other victim, who was killed. Knight turned himself in to authorities a day after the incident. His attorneys had said he was acting in self-defence and was fleeing armed attackers when he ran over Mr Carter and Cle ""Bone"" Sloan. Mr Sloan denied claims he was carrying a gun during the confrontation.

"The man walked towards the student and was captured striking her on the cafe's video A 25-year-old man who slapped a French woman earlier this year has been sentenced to six months in prison. Marie Laguerre said the man lashed out at her after she told him to stop harassing her on a Paris street. Her Facebook post detailing the assault, with CCTV footage, went viral and provoked an international conversation about harassment. A Paris court on Thursday ordered him not to contact the woman, and fined him â¬2,000 (Â£1,770) in damages. The man, identified only as Firaz M under French court rules, was sentenced to a further six months suspended sentence. He was also ordered to undergo psychological care and take a course about gender-related violence. Prosecutors described Mr M as ""violent and impulsive"", after the trial was delayed after a report into his mental health was requested. Allow YouTube content?

France plans law on street harassment One French woman in eight raped - report She said she told him to ""shut up"", and he reacted by throwing an ashtray, which narrowly missed her, then walked towards her and struck her. She filed a report, and police identified and arrested him in August. During his trial he acknowledged the assault, but denied being sexist or using obscene language toward Ms Laguerre. Ms Laguerre has created a website for women to report their harassment Mr M was found guilty of ""violence with the use or threat of a weapon"" but not of sexual harassment after prosecutors said there were insufficient grounds for the charge. Speaking to French publication LibÃ©ration before the hearing,the 22-year-old victim described the development as a ""harsh blow"",externalsymbolically and a ""disappointment"". ""My attacker will not be able to understand the misogynistic and sexist nature of what he is accused of,"" she said (in French). ""We are missing out on teaching him a lesson to make him aware that it's no longer possible to treat women like pieces of meat."" The video went viral at a time when the French government was pushing to impose on-the-spot fines for street harassment. The law, approved in August, imposes fines of up to â¬750 (Â£660) for those caught doing it. The first fine was given out last month to a man who slapped a woman's bottomon a bus near Paris. The initiative and Ms Laguerre's experience resonated among French women as the #MeToo movement and its French equivalent #BalanceTonPorc (""rat on your pig"") gathered pace this year.

"Megan Lee from Oswaldtwistle died two days after she was admitted to Royal Blackburn Hospital A 15-year-old girl was unlawfully killed when she unknowingly ate a takeaway meal containing peanuts, a court has heard. Megan Lee died on 1 January 2017 from acute asthma brought on by an allergic reaction to food from the Royal Spice Takeaway in Hyndburn, Lancashire. Her friend wrote ""prawns, nuts"" on the Just Eat online order, but staff paid no attention to it, the jury heard. Takeaway owner Mohammed Kuddus and co-accused Harun Rashid deny manslaughter. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said staff served a meal including an onion bhaji, a Peshwari naan and a seekh kebab which tests later showed had the ""widespread presence"" of peanut protein. Megan Lee died two days after eating food from the Royal Spice restaurant After the delivery was dropped off at her friend's house, the girls shared the food but Megan suffered an ""immediate reaction"" when she began to eat the kebab. Her friend noted Megan appeared ""lumpy"" and the friend's mum gave her some liquid antihistamine, which made her feel better. Megan left the kebab but continued eating and, aside for a rash on her cheek, showed no signs of discomfort when her mum, Gemma, took her home. Mr Wright said Megan went upstairs to her bedroom but shortly after Mrs Lee heard her daughter call out. He said: ""Megan was in a state of distress. Her lips were swollen and blue, she was struggling to breathe and an ambulance was called. Megan's condition continued to deteriorate. She stopped breathing and her heart stopped."" Mrs Lee and paramedics tried to revive Megan but she had suffered irreversible brain damage and was pronounced dead two days later when her life support was switched off, the prosecutor said. A police investigation was launched as well as a probe by local Trading Standards and environmental health officers who closed the takeaway. Mr Wright said there were ""no procedures in place"" to manage foods known to cause allergic reactions and ""no audit of their available dishes or written records of their recipes"". He said the premises were not clean and evidence of mouse droppings was found. Samples of the dishes were tested and detected the ""widespread presence of peanut protein of levels that were unsafe for people allergic to peanuts"", Mr Wright said. Mr Kuddus, 40, of Belper Street, Blackburn, earlier pleaded guilty to failing to discharge a general duty of employers, contrary to the Health and Safety at Work Act. He also admitted failing to put in place, implement and maintain a permanent procedure or procedures in contravention of European Union food safety regulations. Mr Kuddus also entered guilty pleas to the same offences on behalf of Royal Spice Takeaway Limited, trading as Royal Spice Takeaway. His co-defendant, fellow Bangladeshi national Rashid, 38, of Rudd Street, Haslingden, pleaded not guilty to those charges. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Gordon Corera looks at why the Russian cyber plot sting was surprising Russian spies have been accused of involvement in a series of cyber-plots across the globe, leading the US to level charges against seven agents. The US justice department said targets included the global chemical weapons watchdog, anti-doping agencies and a US nuclear company. The allegations are part of an organised push-back against alleged Russian cyber-attacks around the world. Russia earlier dismissed the allegations as ""Western spy mania"". The Netherlands has accused four Russians of plotting to hack the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which had been probing the chemical attack on a Russian ex-spy in the UK The UK government accused the GRU of being behind four high-profile cyber-attacks, whose targets included firms in Russia and Ukraine; the US Democratic Party; and a small TV network in the UK The US said its anti-doping agency, football's governing body Fifa and the US nuclear energy company Westinghouse were targeted by Russian intelligence Canada said ""with high confidence"" that breaches at its centre for ethics in sports and at the Montreal-based World Anti-Doping Agency were carried out by Russian intelligence Added to this, the Dutch authorities have said a laptop seized from the four suspects in April was found to have been used in Brazil, Switzerland and Malaysia. In Malaysia, the Netherlands said, it was used to target the investigation into the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014 over territory held by Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine. All 298 people on board were killed. by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent The revelations about how the British and Dutch security agencies disrupted the operations of the GRU are astonishing in their detail and their openness. This is not what secretive intelligence agencies normally do. But the willingness of both countries to be so candid illustrates how determined both they and some other Western governments are to try to push back against what they see as a concerted pattern of Russian aggression. ""I imagine Mr Putin is shouting at one or two people right now,"" a cheerful British official told me. Read more:Transparency - the tool to counter Russia Russia's foreign ministry - which had earlier dismissed the allegations from the UK and the Netherlands as ""Western spy mania"" - released an official statement late on Thursday, saying it was the victim of ""yet another stage-managed propaganda campaign"". ""It's unclear who is supposed to believe these statements accusing Russian citizens of attempting to mount cyber-attacks against the OPCW and trying to obtain data related to the Malaysian flight MH17, as if it is necessary to be near the target of your attack,"" it said. ""Any Russian citizen carrying a mobile device is seen as a spy,"" the statement added. John Demers, US Assistant Attorney General for National Security, told a press conference in Washington that many of the attacks were aimed at delegitimizing sports bodies and ""altering perceptions of the truth"". He said the attacks were how Russia retaliated forbans on its athletes following evidence it was systematically using drugsto enhance their performance. As a result of the findings, the US has indicted seven people, four of whom were the men expelled from the Netherlands, while the other three were amongthose charged in July with hacking Democratic officials during the 2016 US elections. The FBI released this ""wanted"" poster, naming and picturing the seven men They were also charged with wire fraud, identity theft and money laundering. All seven men are thought to be in Russia, which does not have an extradition treaty with the US. A joint statement from British Prime Minister Theresa May and her Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte said the alleged plot against the OPCW demonstrated ""the GRU's disregard for global values and rules that keep us all safe"". How the Dutch foiled Russian 'cyber-attack' on OPCW Russia, Fancy Bears and hacking Olympic athletes The risks of cyber-conflict with Russia Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK was discussing further sanctions against Russia with its allies. The EU has also denounced the alleged cyber-plots. The four suspects identified by Dutch officials had diplomatic passports - which meant the Netherlands could not arrest them as diplomats are in theory immune from prosecution in their host country - and included two IT experts and two support agents, officials said. The four hired a car and parked it in the car park of the Marriot hotel in The Hague, which is next to the OPCW office, to hack into the OPCW's wifi network, Major General Onno Eichelsheim from the Dutch MIVD intelligence service said. The suspects were allegedly found to have specialist hacking equipment Equipment in the car boot was pointed at the OPCW and was being used to intercept login details, he said, adding that the antenna for the operation lay under a jacket on the car's rear shelf. When the men were intercepted they tried to destroy one of the mobile phones they were carrying, Maj Gen Eichelsheim said. He said one of their mobile phones was found to have been activated near the GRU building in Moscow, while another carried a receipt for a taxi journey from a street near the GRU to the airport. Maj Gen Eichelsheim said the group were planning to travel to Switzerland, to a laboratory in Spiez where the OPCW analysed samples. They never made it. Instead, the four were immediately escorted out of the country, he added. They were named by the MIVD as hackers Alexei Morenets and Yevgeny Serebriakov, and support agents Oleg Sotnikov and Alexei Minin. Four suspects travelled to the Netherlands on diplomatic passports earlier this year Officials said they were from the GRU's Unit 26165, which has also been known as APT 28. The UK's ambassador to the Netherlands, Peter Wilson, said the unit had ""sent officers around the world to conduct brazen close access cyber-operations"" - which involve hacking into wifi networks. What happened to the Skripals? Russia 'tried to hack Foreign Office' He said the hackers were planning to travel on to the OPCW-certified laboratory in Spiez near Berne in Switzerland, where the Novichok nerve agent used in March's attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the British city of Salisbury was identified. This video can not be played What do we know about the Russian intelligence organisation, the GRU? At the time the Russian operation was disrupted, the OPCW was investigating the Skripal case as well as an alleged chemical attack in April on the Syrian town of Douma near Damascus by Russian-backed government forces, the MIVD said. ""With its aggressive cyber-campaigns, we see the GRU trying to clean up Russia's own mess - be it the doping uncovered by Wada [the World Anti-Doping Agency] or the nerve agent identified by the OPCW,"" Mr Wilson said. A laptop seized from the suspects was found to have been used in Brazil, Switzerland and Malaysia, the Dutch officials said. Russia 'liable' for downing MH17 airliner The cyber-operation in Malaysia targeted the attorney general's office and Malaysian police as well as the investigation into MH17's shooting down, Ambassador Wilson said. Earlier this year Dutch-led international investigators concluded that a missile that brought down MH17 belonged to a Russian brigade. Russia has denied any involvement in the plane's destruction, which led to the deaths of many Dutch citizens. Data from the laptop showed it was also present in the Swiss city of Lausanne where it was linked to the hacking of a laptop belonging to Wada, which has exposed doping by Russian athletes.

" When I was eight, my cousin had a baby. My Mum knew I loved babies so she dropped me off at her house for a few days “to help”. I must have been useful because when another cousin had one, I was dispatched again. I walked the babies up and down the hall and deflected swipes from jealous siblings. I helped with the bath-and-bed routine for our neighbour. I couldn’t wait to be 12 when I could babysit for all the kids in the village. I couldn’t wait to be a mother myself. But by 29 I had cervical cancer. The operation I needed to save my life would rob me of my chance to carry a child. I found another operation in a medical paper that would allow me that chance - I found a consultant who could do it. When my referral didn’t come through I just turned up to beg. Several gruelling years of IVF and miscarriage followed. And then finally, one Thursday morning, the baby I had longed for was wriggling around in my last scheduled ultrasound scan. The midwives waved me off wishing me good luck for the birth. When I was eight, my cousin had a baby. My Mum knew I loved babies so she dropped me off at her house for a few days “to help”.

The midwives waved me off wishing me good luck for the birth. That afternoon I was at work eating a piece of lemon drizzle cake to mark a colleague’s leaving do when I felt hot gushing liquid soak through my trousers. My waters had broken two months early. The hospital admitted me and said we had to delay labour for as long as possible, allowing the baby to grow stronger. Ten days later they said we were doing well and could go home the next day. But shortly after midnight, the umbilical cord dropped through me, compressing my baby’s supply of oxygen and nutrients. In the six minutes it took to get to the operating theatre, nurses running and shouting, wheeling my bed through empty corridors, our baby died. I didn’t sleep for 48 hours. I paced. I refused drugs. My precious longed-for baby was curled and silent in my womb - the cord that had bound us hung from me. When my feet ached from pacing I lay on my side facing Tim, my partner. I remembered a story of a mother who was told her baby had died, but was born healthy. I rang the buzzer to summon a nurse, I asked if they could have got it wrong. Twenty minutes later my partner rang the same bell, asked the same question. They gave me a C-section the next morning. As I breathed through the mask and felt the anaesthetic injected into my vein I thought: “I have dreamt of looking into my child’s face for 30 years, and when I wake, I will.” When she - a baby girl - was given to me, my heart expanded in love. She was beautiful - 30cm tip to toe. She had been dressed in a little white dress and hat, and draped in a white hand-knitted blanket. Her fingers and toes rested neatly in perfection. She was long-limbed like us both. We named her Willow. I imagined I heard Tim’s heart shatter when he said her name. I looked at her in wonder. I couldn’t understand why she was dead. The midwives and doctors came. There were no answers to our questions. Maybe they weren’t the right questions. We were at the edge of the delivery wing, and I had to listen to women in labour and to the mewling newborns. My arms ached. I thought I had a blood clot, but the doctors told me it was normal - a biological response to the shock that there was no living child for me to hold. I sobbed. My milk came through, marking my T-shirt, and I was too exhausted to be embarrassed.

In the bereavement suite there was a kitchen, to make cups of tea I couldn’t imagine any bereaved parent could ever stomach. I found myself looking at the cleaning rota - such a stark reminder of the other families who had been there. I thought of their loss. I focused on their survival. Stillbirth is much more common than people might think but it’s rarely talked about because pregnancy is a time of joy and hope. We stayed another four nights, our daughter in a refrigerated cot. No-one ever suggested we left but I knew when it was time. I couldn’t bring myself to say goodbye to the midwives who sat with us through that night, who dressed our daughter for us. There were no words of thanks big enough, so they just cried, and we cried, and nodded our heads and left. We had two matching cuddly lambs in hospital - one that we slept with, one for Willow in her crib. On the drive home I clutched our lamb, damp with tears. I whispered words to it and imagined my daughter could hear them. Grief folded and stretched time. The midwives had reminded us we were legally required to register Willow’s birth. So one day we travelled to a register office and an official asked quiet sad questions. We left holding legal proof she was here, she was real. Birth and death shared the paper, the only document she will ever have. Post piled up and I looked away from it, from other people’s kindness and awkwardness. Some friends came. Some family. I put my maternity jeans back on and exchanged platitudes, but there was nothing anyone could say so I went back to bed. We planned a funeral in place of a christening. Dry-eyed (there seemed to be nothing left), I delivered a eulogy to a crematorium filled with weeping family. The flowers were too big for the little lid of Willow’s casket. We asked them not to close the curtains at the end. When I finally managed to leave I carved off part of my soul to stay with her, my first child.

I whispered words to it and imagined my daughter could hear them. Grief folded and stretched time. The midwives had reminded us we were legally required to register Willow’s birth. So one day we travelled to a register office and an official asked quiet sad questions. We left holding legal proof she was here, she was real. Birth and death shared the paper, the only document she will ever have. Post piled up and I looked away from it, from other people’s kindness and awkwardness. Some friends came. Some family. I put my maternity jeans back on and exchanged platitudes, but there was nothing anyone could say so I went back to bed. We planned a funeral in place of a christening. Dry-eyed (there seemed to be nothing left), I delivered a eulogy to a crematorium filled with weeping family. The flowers were too big for the little lid of Willow’s casket. We asked them not to close the curtains at the end. When I finally managed to leave I carved off part of my soul to stay with her, my first child. Two weeks later Tim returned to the sanctuary of work and I was left alone in the house. Our grief took different paths, and my loneliness and isolation increased. I scared myself reading about the rates of relationship breakdown after the death of a child, and decided to find a bereavement counsellor. I found a lot of help on offer for mothers, very little for fathers, but eventually found someone who would help us together, and whom we still see now. My period came and I raged at the betrayal of my body. I deleted friends on Facebook who had healthy babies the same age as Willow, or friends pregnant with a second or third child. The algorithms made social media a dark place for me, with adverts for baby food, prams and clothes flooding my feed. I became angry, bitter and withdrawn. One day I took three trains to a house in the far north-east corner of England to visit my 103-year-old grandmother, Nancy. I let myself in and sat at her feet, my head in her lap. She herself had a stillborn baby more than 60 years ago. She stroked my hair and said she was “sorry about the baby” - the baby she didn’t know we originally planned to name after her. It was the hardest visit I made and yet somehow it was the start of my healing. I did a lot of sleuthing. I applied for my notes from all the hospitals I’ve been treated in over the last decade and researched every stage of my medical treatment and pregnancy, cross-referencing and breaking the codes of doctors’ scribbles. At the heart of my obsession was guilt, a fear that somehow the stillbirth was my fault. A fear that was wrong, but that other parents of stillborn babies seem to feel too. I found a nine-week-old puppy and brought her home. She weighed 2kg, the weight of a newborn. Her needs made me feel useful. During night-time toilet trips we stood shivering in the dark, and she jumped at me like a child wanting to be picked up. When I called across the park for her, I occasionally called her Willow. Christmas loomed but I averted my eyes, hastily shoving money into cards for nieces and nephews. We escaped the dreams of our first family Christmas by hiring a remote shepherd’s hut in Suffolk. We walked miles every day, taking it in turns to carry our puppy. On Christmas Eve I went to a magical midnight Mass in a small rural church. I cried silently throughout the service. The old lady next to me, a stranger, reached out to hold my hand. Two weeks later Tim returned to the sanctuary of work and I was left alone in the house.

The old lady next to me, a stranger, reached out to hold my hand. A stillborn baby provides the mother with the same rights and protection as a newborn baby, and as I was entitled to maternity leave, I took it, returning after four months. Work was an easier place than home. I could hide from my loss. And so good did I become at compartmentalising that I was occasionally surprised by colleagues asking if I had had a boy or a girl. I got used to replying “my daughter was stillborn”, and then patting them on the arm and saying “it’s OK, please don’t worry”. In the long evenings at home I drank too much red wine. I watched Modern Family on a loop. But throughout the winter, there were glimmers of hope, like the snowdrops bravely poking their heads up. Some days I could feel positive again, some days I could see my friends and laugh. Sometimes I was ready to smile when Tim opened the front door. Many times I think we both just tried, not for ourselves, but for each other. My coping mechanisms are all about doing stuff and so I planned a part of our garden to dedicate to Willow, buying graph paper and poring over garden design books. We started landscaping in the coldest wettest week in February. We hired a 1.5 tonne digger. Friends and family came to help us in snow and frost, in driving rain, forking through piles of wet soil and stones to remove weeds. Our joyful little puppy Pina played in the mud at our feet and then stamped paw prints all over the kitchen floor. I found an artist to make a sculpture out of willow branches. We visited favourite beaches to collect stones to pave the path. We exhausted ourselves with manual work. In the week leading up to Mother’s Day, I stood watching the children leave the local village school. On the day itself, I opened the door to the nursery for the first time. I unfolded and refolded the babygros, and then lay down on the floor with the last one, placing it between my collar bone and navel. The dust motes floated in the afternoon sunlight. I thought of the email telling me the curtains for the nursery were waiting. When I had replied that we no longer needed them, they had simply written back: “We will send when you are ready.” I wondered if the saleswoman herself had lost a baby. I cried and cried and eventually fell asleep. When I woke up it was dark. I found two Mother’s Day cards. One from my Mum, the other from Tim, saying that I was and will always be a brilliant mother to Willow. From that day on, I left the nursery door open, and the air now circulates better through our house. We prepared for Willow’s first birthday by planning a party in her garden to raise funds for  stillborn charities.

We prepared for Willow’s first birthday by planning a party in her garden to raise funds for stillborn charities. One of the charities we want to help provides memory boxes to hospitals for bereaved parents. We were given one for Willow and I found the courage to look at it again. This is what was inside: A white knitted blanket Willow’s hospital bracelet Photos of Willow when she was born Willow’s foot imprints A babygro from Willow’s nursery. Some of these things had been in the box when I received it, others I had added myself. I wanted to find other women who would understand the power of this box. In the weeks leading up to Willow’s birthday I began a journey around the UK to visit bereaved women who were connected with these five objects. Here are their stories: Val Isherwood runs the Tigerlily Trust, which provides hospitals with blankets, wraps and gowns for stillborn babies Everything went great with my pregnancy until probably 16 or 17 weeks. We got that phone call that started with: “Are you on your own?” The hospital told me my baby had something called Edwards’ syndrome and not to expect her to live past 28 weeks. She got to 32 weeks, and then I was getting something out of one of the bureau drawers in the lounge and felt a stab of pain. We went into hospital and her heartbeat had stopped. Even though we tried to prepare for that moment I can't really remember much about that day. I remember them saying they would give me this tablet and I'd go home and come back the next morning. I went through this phase later on where I thought: ‘Was I ever pregnant?’ I suddenly felt very scared that I had a dead body inside me and how cruel it was to send me home. But I'm so glad for that time, because it gave us that last night together. And come Tuesday morning I didn’t want to go back into hospital. I just wanted to keep her forever safe inside and felt like no-one should take her from me. But that time in hospital was just beautiful. Friends came and met Lily which was really important, because I went through this phase later on where I thought: “Was I ever pregnant?” I'd bought clothes for her early on in the pregnancy, and they were far too big, so we didn't have anything to put her in, and the hospital didn't offer us anything. So when I was in early labour we went out into town and the only thing we could find was a little T-shirt, and my Mum sewed it in the hospital into a little dress. One of my regrets is that the dress was cremated with her - I really wish that I still had what she'd been wearing. That's why now we give outfits in matching pairs so that parents can keep the one the baby has worn. We tried to have another baby as soon as we could after Lily, and we did think about IVF, but with my age the odds were stacked against me. I was 46 at the time and I didn't think I could go through all that and it not work out. So I thought a lot about acceptance - my message to myself was if it's not meant to be then that's my story. I knew I needed to find positive ways to channel all that love and energy that would have gone into raising Lily. Everything to do with the Tigerlily Trust is inspired by what I wish had been there for me. So I started appealing for knitters who would help us create the clothes I wished I had been given. People then asked if they could donate their wedding dresses to turn into little gowns, so we've got a lovely seamstress on the Isle of Man who makes them. Some of the women who had a stillborn baby before we existed were just told to go and buy a doll's dress which they felt was so insulting. Now a lot of the parents who get in touch can't believe someone has gone to those lengths to knit something to put their baby in and to give them that dignity. I have about 380 names on my list of people who have contributed in some way. Some of them are grandmas whose daughters have lost babies. My advice to other parents going through this is let yourself grieve hard. Don't be afraid of your grief - share it with people. That's almost precious time before the world sort of expects you to be OK. Let yourself have that time. Rachel Hayden runs Gifts of Remembrance, which trains midwives to take photos of stillborn babies- this section contains an image of her son Rowan who was stillborn Rowan was one of triplets, which was a bit of a surprise to me at 40 with two kids already. But the interesting thing is that when I found out I was pregnant I got a sense of him, so I felt like I already knew who he was. I went in for a scan at 31 weeks and they discovered there was no heartbeat for him. It’s a moment which I’m sure all parents of stillborn babies relate to. There’s just that stillness on the monitor. We can end up grieving not only for the fact our babies died, but... for the fact we never saw them I remember the way the nursery nurse spoke to him and handled him and it made me feel I could do the same. So it was “hello and what’s your name?” and “I bet your Mum wants to give you a cuddle”, and all this was great for me because I was utterly clueless. But I didn’t even think to ask to be involved in the memory making. She took him away and took handprints and footprints and dressed him and lay him in his Moses basket, and then took two photos of him lying there. I didn’t know what he really looked like naked or what he was wearing under his little knitted gown, and she took no photographs of him being held - he looked so alone. Although I was remarkably grateful for what I had, I later came across the work of Todd Hochberg, an amazing US photographer, and realised I could have had so much more. Not only was I blown away by the photographs and how emotional they were, but it was the stories they told - and I found myself comparing. What I say to the midwives in the training is you need to think for the future, and guide the parents through a process of gathering up details and stories, and saying: “This may feel too much now but it's going to be important later.” Very little of my training is actually about taking photographs - a big chunk of it is about midwives empowering parents, and saying the right things, and giving them time. I'll talk about how you have photographs that you might share with people, but there are plenty of photographs that just help you remember - every single photograph is going to be of importance to the family. This is actually a therapeutic intervention you are doing to help families make sense of what's happened. You're saying: “This is what happened to you in all its mess.” Midwives and nurses clean things all the time but I say just hand over everything as it is. The most precious thing to me of Rowan's is his hat because it smelt like him, so we challenge that approach. A photo of Rachel's baby, Rowan If you try and protect us then we can end up grieving not only for the fact our babies died,  but we can be grieving for the fact we never saw them. A really poignant story was a mum who said she had never seen her baby girl’s bottom - she said that her other children had birthmarks on their bottoms and she never knew if she had one. When we look back on things there'll be moments that we will even identify in terms of joy, because you're saying hello to your baby, as well as goodbye. Ruth Rodgers used to work in finance but was inspired to retrain as a midwife after the stillbirth of her daughter Scarlett. She has just started her first posting, having qualified this summer. Scarlett was born in November 2011 when I was 31 weeks pregnant. I realised she wasn’t moving so much, but I wasn’t really that worried - I did a full day of work before I went to the hospital. And they couldn't find a heartbeat pretty much straightaway. I had this amazing bereavement midwife, Jane, who I spoke to on the phone. During the two days before I went into labour she told me not to worry about things like funeral arrangements and post-mortems, but just to think about how I wanted to spend time with my little girl - helping me focus on the most important things at the right times. There's some amazing care out there, but there are also some poor things that happen repeatedly that are so easy to fix I also had a brilliant labour ward midwife. It's funny the things that you worry about - I assumed that she would have rigor mortis. I was frightened about how I might feel when I saw her. And she said: “She'll just look like a baby. She'll be a bit small, her skin might be quite thin, and she'll probably not have her eyes open, but otherwise she'll just look like your baby.” That was all I needed to hear to just carry on. Of course there were moments of utter misery, but I also have strangely fond memories of watching Strictly Come Dancing and the X Factor, and eating lasagne with one hand and holding the gas and air with the other! She was born just before six in the morning, and I remember thinking it was amazing that she was still warm and I needed to remember the way that felt because she wouldn’t stay like that. I fell pregnant again seven weeks after I'd had Scarlett, and miscarried again, having miscarried before. And that's when I became really obsessed with how having a baby works, with how all the embryology works. I read textbooks, I read research papers, I emailed professors in recurrent miscarriage - that's the way I approach life. I had another two miscarriages after that, and throughout it all Jane was basically there the whole time and we developed a really special relationship. I guess that’s really where the idea of me training to become a midwife myself started - that supportive relationship between a woman and her midwife. I was lucky enough to go on to have two beautiful boys, one just before I started training, and one in the middle of my degree. The first of these was an incredibly anxious pregnancy, and I received the most fantastic care from Jane, my consultants and my community midwife, all of whom knew my history and understood the way I felt. I could not have got through it without them, without suffering significant mental health consequences. In my third year of training I did a long stint on a labour ward and there was a lady who came in thinking she was in labour, only to find her baby had died. It was incredibly fulfilling to care for that woman and her baby and help her through everything. I think it's rarely appropriate to talk about your own experience to somebody else. If a woman specifically asked me if I’d had a stillbirth then I’d tell them, but I would never volunteer that, because the moment then would become about me and not about them. But I do suggest things that I found helpful, or that I know others did. I've met so many people over the last few years through online groups who've dealt with their grief and the process of having a subsequent baby all very differently. How you deal with having a stillbirth is incredibly personal. There's some amazing care out there, but there are also some poor things that happen repeatedly that are so easy to fix. The classic ones are not reading the mum’s notes before an appointment, or not calling the baby who died by their name. The research very clearly says that grief isn't necessarily related to gestation - there is a link, but actually the link is more to do with the “assignment of personhood”. If you have assigned a person to the baby inside you, you have created a relationship with that person that means that you feel the grief more acutely when they're gone. Publishing graduate Aliyah makes bespoke wall prints through her online shop, which help parents celebrate their baby’s name and birth date and is working on a bespoke memory book. She is expecting another baby at the end of October. One of the hardest parts is that we had bought everything for Aamiya - we had loads of clothes ready, we had her cot set up in the bedroom, everything was washed and ready for her. I had swelling but they just told me it was normal pregnancy swelling. Because I didn’t have any other symptoms I don’t think anyone was overly concerned. And then I woke up one morning and I didn’t feel anything and I just thought I should go and get checked out. And that’s when they told us she’d passed away and I found out I had pre-eclampsia. They told me my blood pressure was really high and there was lots of protein in my urine and they rushed me into delivery really fast. I must have fallen asleep because when I woke up she was already bathed and dressed, and next to me in the refrigerated cot. And that’s one thing I regret  - obviously it wasn’t in my control to stay awake, but I feel like I missed out on dressing her and that time after birth - the little things you always imagined doing for your baby. There’s that awkward moment when people don’t know what to say or do, but with my friends it was OK because they all know me so well, and they made the effort to come round and bring me flowers and chocolates. It was nice to know people cared, even if I didn’t want to speak or do anything. I’ve always been creative, and I first started with the memory book which I’m making for Aamiya. And then I found out about the baby loss community on Instagram. I got talking to a lot of mums from all over - from America, Canada - just sharing stuff that I’d done in my day and projects that I was working on. And then quite a few people started asking if I could make something for their babies too. At some point after Aamiya was born I had this overwhelming feeling of wanting everything in the house to reflect her - for everyone to remember she was here. And I think that was a way of dealing with grief - creating stuff so I could put her around the house. You can spend hours designing things and it just takes your mind off things. There have been times when I’ve thought it isn’t healthy to just be consumed by one moment in time, so I’ve put the memory book project off for a bit and focused on getting back to work and seeing friends more, but there are times when I go back to it. I’m definitely more anxious about being pregnant again since I hit the 30-week mark. At the beginning of my pregnancy, while I was happy and felt blessed that I was able to conceive another child, there were definitely feelings of guilt as you don't want your angel baby thinking they will be forgotten, because they never will be - my partner and I think about Aamiya every single day. However, as time has gone on these feelings of guilt have subsided - I truly believe this baby was sent by Aamiya. It's been a good pregnancy. Anxiety does get the better of me at times but I try and remain positive. My partner and I will make sure this baby grows up knowing all about their big sister Aamiya. Megan Evans began a vlog about stillbirth just weeks after the death of her son Milo - this section contains images of him Before Milo I thought I wasn't maternal - I've got two older brothers who wound me up about pregnancy and how painful childbirth was, so I always said I'm not having children. When the pregnancy test came back positive, I just thought I'm not supposed to have children. Because I was so young and petrified, I went straight on to YouTube and typed in “19 and pregnant” but there wasn't much there. There were a few videos but they were by 19-year-olds who had money. I needed to see someone who was just normal and working class, so the next day I told my Mum I was just going to start vlogging about my own situation. As soon as I started making those videos I had women getting in touch saying they felt the same - how they didn't have their own house and a stable financial situation either. So the vlog all started from there, and I really enjoyed having people get in touch saying “me too” which made me feel comfortable with my situation. And as time went on then everything just fitted into place. It's funny how your maternal instincts just kick in and you wouldn't imagine it any other way. One day I realised that I hadn't felt Milo move all day, and I thought I'd better get checked just in case. The midwife started to monitor me and she couldn’t find a heartbeat. And the sonographer came in, but so did a midwife, a nurse, a doctor, a consultant. So it was a whole string of people standing at the end of my bed and that's when I really clocked that something was wrong. It was as if I'd been shoved into a world that I had absolutely no idea how to navigate. The next day I spent all day seeing my family and discovered my Nan had had a son who died a few days after he was born. I asked her how I was going to survive it and she said: “Take lots of pictures, and make the most of the time you have with him.” When I went into hospital to be induced I was very scared about what he was going to look like, so I asked my Mum to see him first. She said “oh my god, he’s just perfect” and showed him to me. It was the moment I realised that was the baby I’d been carrying for eight months. Death doesn’t change anything - this was the first time I was going to meet my son. But it was also devastating. I was holding everything that I was waiting for but I knew I would have to give my baby back. My future was being erased before my eyes. I said to one of the midwives: “I feel like I'm the only person in the world this is happening to.” She replied: “It's just one of those things that nobody speaks about.” Three days after I came out of hospital I started thinking about my vlog. People were still commenting on my previous videos saying “wow I'm pregnant too”. Again I looked for vlogs about stillbirth and again I couldn’t find what I was looking for. I wasn’t expecting so many people to watch the videos because I didn’t realise how common stillbirth is. It helped me by telling his story but it was also comforting to see other people say his name. If someone you know experiences a stillbirth you don't need to know the right things to say. You just need to acknowledge their pain, acknowledge their grief, understand that you're not going to understand, and let them talk and talk until they've finished. As time's gone on, I've met a lot of people who've understood, and I've found my feet in grief which helps a lot. Rowan, Scarlett, Aamiya, Lily, Milo, and Willow. As I lay stones in their memory in a special baby loss garden in Staffordshire, I realise that even though they didn’t see the world, they have changed it through the action they have inspired in their mothers. But I also know that for each of these women there are many more who choose to hold their memories privately, who mourn behind closed doors. One in 225 pregnancies in the UK will end in stillbirth. And the death of a baby will not just affect the parents, but the grandparents, the siblings, the family and friends. A bereaved mother, in the process of getting physical care, gets emotional care throughout, but this risks men feeling sidelined, and powerless to help. The parents I speak to agree that the taboo and silence around stillbirth seems to be gradually easing, but there are still many people who have simply never spoken to me about Willow, never said her name. My arms no longer ache like those first hours, but they are still empty - I am a mother without a baby I have, though, felt support from so many people, especially women, many of whom I’d never even met before. As a journalist I have specialised in women’s stories around the world for many years, and yet only this has made me feel an invisible solidarity, a wall of history, of empathy, of strength from women around me. Over the past year my need to remember and memorialise Willow has jostled with my need for self-preservation. A year on, grief can still occasionally floor me, slicing behind my knees, but I can feel it coming and I can prepare, knowing I can survive its brief but powerful kick. Willow’s birth made me a Mum and Tim a Dad. My arms no longer ache like those first hours, but they are still empty. I am a mother without a baby. I think about my own mother. For weeks she sat in our house, the horrific shadow of bereavement hanging over us, my hacking sobs punctuated by the clack of her knitting needles. She made a beautiful pure white blanket for a baby box which will be opened at a time of immense loss. She knitted it for a stranger who at the time of knitting was an excited expectant mother-to-be, but whose baby would come too early, too sick, or simply stillborn for no known reason.  That baby - we will never know his or her name - will be rocked and mourned in their parents’ arms and will also, thanks to my Mum, have an extra layer, wrapped also in my family’s love - our endurance and our hope.
