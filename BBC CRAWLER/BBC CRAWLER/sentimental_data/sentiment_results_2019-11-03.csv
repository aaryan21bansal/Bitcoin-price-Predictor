"The Reverend Simon Nguyen, who led the service, said the victims lost their lives ""seeking freedom, dignity and happiness"" Services have been held in memory of the 39 Vietnamese victims found dead in a lorry container in Essex. More than 100 people attended the service at the Church of the Holy Name and Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in east London on Saturday evening. The Reverend Simon Nguyen, who led the service, said the 39 died ""seeking freedom, dignity and happiness"". At Mass on at the same church on Sunday Bishop Nicholas Hudson also asked for prayers for traffickers. It was confirmed by police on Friday that all of those who were found were Vietnamese. Police had initially believed they were Chinese. Candles were arranged into a figure of 39 to represent the number who died At the service on Saturday evening, prayers were heard and members of the Catholic congregation performed readings and candles were lit. ""We show our condolences and sympathies for the people who have lost their lives on the way seeking freedom, dignity and happiness,"" said Mr Nguyen. ""We ask God to welcome them into his kingdom even though some of them were not Catholic but they strongly believed in eternal peace, so we pray for them."" After the service he said: ""The people here are very united because we are all refugees. ""All the people here - most of the Vietnamese - came here as refugees in the '70s and the '80s and the '90s."" The Catholic church in East London has a large Vietnamese congregation He said in those decades, the disappearances of people from Vietnam were ""not reported by the media, but many of them died"". ""These victims [who died in the lorry last month], this tragedy, was reported but many tragedies to the Vietnamese no-one [knows about],"" he said. A memorial Mass on Sunday began with a projection of the trailer containing the bodies being removed from the industrial estate. After a minute's silence, Bishop Hudson said the service was to pray for the relations of congregation members who could be among the dead. He also asked for prayers for the emergency service staff who attended the scene. Bishop Hudson also sought prayers for traffickers, who he hoped ""as a result of this tragedy may have had a change of heart"". About 7% of Vietnam's population class themselves as Catholic, although the figure is higher in the area of the country where many of the missing people come from. In the past some Catholicshave had a fractious relationship,externalwith Vietnam's communist government. Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong's families are concerned they may be among the victims Essex Police said it was now in ""direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK"" and the Vietnamese Government. A number of Vietnamese families have previously come forward fearing their loved ones are among the dead. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on the night of 22 October - the day before the 39 people were found dead - saying her ""trip to a foreign land has failed"". The father of 30-year-old Le Van Ha, who comes from an agricultural part of Vietnam, previously told the BBC he was convinced his son was among the dead. Post-mortem examinations are being carried out on the 31 men and eight women to establish the cause of their deaths. The bodies were discovered in the lorry trailer in the early hours of 23 October The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court on Monday charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant. Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. On 21 December 2020, the Crown Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, found Eamonn Harrison, 24 of Newry, County Down, and Gheorghe Nica, 43 of Basildon, Essex, guilty of manslaughter and Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, admitted assisting unlawful immigration. All defendants were sentenced in January 2021.

"McDonald's has fired its chief executive Steve Easterbrook after he had a relationship with an employee. The US fast food giant said the relationship was consensual, but Mr Easterbrook had ""violated company policy"" and shown ""poor judgement"". The British businessman, who earned nearly $16m (Â£12.3m) last year, is due to receive 26 weeks of pay. The full value of the deal was not clear. He is also eligible for a bonus, if the firm hits its performance goals. Bloomberg estimated that he will leave with more than $37m, the bulk of which includes previously granted shares. In exchange, Mr Easterbrook has agreed not to work for a competitor for at least two years. Easterbrook's new McJob Intel chief resigns over relationship The Bottom Line: Managing Workplace Relationships In an email to staff, Mr Easterbrook acknowledged the relationship and said it was a mistake. ""Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is time for me to move on,"" he said. The company's top human resources officer has also left the company, McDonald's said. Mr Easterbrook, 52, who is divorced, first worked for McDonald's in 1993 as a manager in London before working his way up the company. He left in 2011 to become boss of Pizza Express and then Asian food chain Wagamama, before returning to McDonald's in 2013, eventually becoming its head in the UK and northern Europe. This video can not be played 'Fine line between consensual and inappropriate relationships' He was appointed chief executive of McDonald's in 2015. Mr Easterbrook is widely credited with revitalising the firm's menus and restaurants, by remodelling stores and using better ingredients. The value of its shares more than doubled during his tenure in the US. Under his leadership, McDonald's also expanded its delivery and mobile payment options to emphasise convenience. The fast food giant's board voted on Watford-born Mr Easterbrook's departure on Friday after a review. He has also stepped down as McDonald's president and member of the board. McDonald's said it has longstanding rules against conflicts of interest. It declined to provide further information about the person with whom Mr Easterbrook had the relationship, including whether the person was a direct report or remained employed by the company. Employment lawyer Ruby Dinsmore, of Slater and Gordon, said it is now common for firms to have either outright bans on relationships, or to have notification clauses requiring individuals to disclose them. Potential conflicts of interest or litigation if a relationship turns sour were becoming a real risk for companies, she told the BBC. ""Some people may view this an an invasion of privacy,"" she said. ""But businesses have their own interests to protect as well."" In the era of MeToo ""companies are very keen to be seem not only to have a policy for this type of situation, but also to be seen to be enforcing it at all levels,"" she said. The company has been criticised over the amount it pays shop staff, and Mr Easterbrook faced scrutiny for his $15.9m pay packet in 2018, which included a roughly $1.3m base salary, as well as benefits and bonus. It was 2,124 times the median employee salary of $7,473. He will be replaced by Chris Kempczinski, most recently president of McDonald's USA, with immediate effect. In a statement, Mr Kempczinski thanked Mr Easterbrook for his contributions, adding: ""Steve brought me into McDonald's and he was a patient and helpful mentor."" Last year Intel boss Brian Krzanich stepped down for having a consensual relationship with an Intel employee, which was against company rules. He had been in the post since May 2013.

"Mr Thomson has insisted the allegations were ""politically motivated smears"" Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson is to stand down after being accused of sexually assaulting a Labour MP in a Commons bar. Mr Thomson said he had made the ""hardest decision of my life"" not to contest the seat for Aberdeen South at the general election. Labour MP Paul Sweeney had said he reported Mr Thomson to Westminster's standards watchdog following the alleged incident last October. Mr Thomson denies any wrongdoing. But he said a number of ""anonymous and malicious allegations"" this year had made his life ""a living hell"". Mr Thomson, 32, said: ""This is a political smear and I will continue to fight to clear my name. I will see this investigatory process through to a conclusion. ""I have suffered a level of personal abuse that has affected my health, my mental wellbeing and my staff. It has been a level of abuse that I never imagined possible."" Mr Sweeney said he was with a group of friends in the Commons bar when the incident happened He added: ""I have therefore made the most difficult decision that I could ever make. I have decided that I will stand down as the Scottish Conservative and Unionist candidate for Aberdeen South."" Mr Sweeney, who is the MP for Glasgow North East,told the Scottish Mail on Sunday,externalhe was left feeling ""mortified"" by the alleged attack in the Strangers' Bar at Westminster. Ross Thomson: Tory MP says bar behaviour claims 'completely false' Ross Thomson: Fresh allegations over Tory MP's behaviour According to the paper, Mr Sweeney said he was ""paralysed"" with shock after Mr Thomson ""groped"" him in the bar. He said the alleged incident took place in October 2018 after he had invited a group of his old Glasgow University friends for a tour of the Commons. They later went to the Strangers' Bar for a drink where he claims they were interrupted by Mr Thomson, who was ""drunk to the point where he was barely able to stand up"". Mr Thomson then allegedly grabbed at Mr Sweeney through his clothes. Mr Sweeney said he repeatedly told Mr Thomson to stop touching him and asked him to leave. The Labour MP said that he later asked for advice from the Women's Aid charity before approaching the Standards watchdog. A House of Commons spokeswoman said: ""Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievances Scheme (ICGS) operates on the basis of absolute confidentiality. ""Therefore we cannot provide answers about any complaint that may or may not have been made."" Mr Thomson said dealing with the allegations had been ""nothing short of traumatic"" In February, Mr Thomson was publicly accused of gropinga man in the same Commons bar. The Tory MP also strongly denies any wrongdoing relating to that alleged incident. Mr Sweeney said he was finally speaking out in public more than a year after the alleged assault because the investigations had ""barely progressed"". A spokesman for the MP said: ""This assault, which took place last October, was reported to the appropriate authorities after similar but entirely separate allegations were made by other men against Ross Thomson in February. ""Thomson's denials today fly in the face of what was witnessed by other MPs and visitors and show him to be utterly unrepentant."" Mr Thomson had issued a statement on Twitter,externalon Sunday morning in which he strenuously denied Mr Sweeney's allegations, but insisted he would be a Tory candidate in the 12 December general election. However, he later confirmed he was standing down from the job he ""loved more than any other"". Mr Thomson, who has been an MP since 2017, said: ""I always believed politics was about noble pursuits and doing what you believed to be best for your country. ""My experience is that our politics is now so poisonous that we will never attract good, honest and decent people in the first place. ""This has been without doubt the hardest decision of my life. I remain confident that the ongoing parliamentary standards process will find in my favour, and that these baseless claims will be shown up for what they are. ""As I have already said I will continue to explore all options available to me in response to the defamatory and damaging allegations made by Mr Sweeney.""

"Labour is pledging to cut UK carbon emissions by 10% through the largest home improvement programme for decades. A Labour government would fund Â£60bn of energy-saving upgrades, such as loft insulation, enhanced double glazing and new heating systems, by 2030. Launching the policy on Sunday, Jeremy Corbyn said it ""will create a sustainable energy network"", adding: ""We cannot go on polluting our planet."" The Conservatives said the plan would ""wreck the economy"" and ""put up bills"". Speaking about the policy - called ""Warm Homes for All"" - in south-west London, Mr Corbyn said that climate change would be a major part of the party's election campaign. ""We cannot go on standing by while climate warming increases,"" the Labour leader said. How much could Labour's nationalisation plan cost? Labour pledges 'zero carbon' homes by 2022 Reality Check: Labour's green energy plans Labour says low-income households will receive a grant to carry out the work on their homes, while wealthier households would receive interest-free loans for enhancements. Households which take out the loan would pay it back through savings on energy bills, the party added. Labour expects the project to cost Â£250bn - an average of Â£9,300 per home - but only Â£60bn would come as a cost to central government, it says. Speaking on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the Â£60bn would come from its Â£250bn National Transformation Fund. Interest-free loans would make up the remaining cost of the policy, she said. She added: ""Overall, we're looking at generating more jobs and supporting businesses through the economy, so that by 2030 the increased tax-take more than recoups that Â£60bn outlay."" A spokesperson for the Tories said, while tackling climate change was vital, ""independent experts and even Labour's own unions say their promises don't stack up"". Labour says its proposals would create 450,000 jobs involved in the installation of energy-saving measures and renewable and low-carbon technologies. Almost all of the UK's 27 million homes would benefit from the pledge, either through a grant to fund works in full, or an interest-free loan, it said. Interest-free loans to improve the energy efficiency of homes are already available in Scotland, where the issue isdevolved to the Scottish government.,external A Labour spokeswoman told the BBC the party would make every effort to work with devolved powers to implement the plan across the whole of the UK. The party said the plan would cut carbon emissions by 10% by the year 2030 and reduce energy bills for 9.6 million low-income households by an average of Â£417 a year. The policy echoes previous announcements from Labour, including a pledge last yearto create over 400,000 skilled jobsthrough investment in renewable energy and making homes energy efficient. Over the past year or so the Labour Party has come out with a series of proposals to improve the energy efficiency of British homes. This plan is far larger - and also far more expensive. It involves, over the next decade, spending Â£250bn to fit every UK house with double-glazing and loft insulation, heat pumps and solar panels. Households with low incomes would not pay anything. Wealthier ones would get interest free loans. Everyone, it's said, would benefit from lower bills and the UK as a whole would see its carbon emissions fall. Much of the country's housing stock is relatively old and upgrading it is seen as essential to meeting our targets on climate change. But critics will say Labour's scheme lacks detail and that the estimates for the costs are unrealistic. The initiative comes a day after the Conservatives called a halt to fracking, a sign that the political parties sense the environment has become a key issue for voters. Outlining where the additional jobs would be created, Labour said an estimated 250,000 skilled jobs would be in the construction industry -  roles like insulation specialists, plasterers, carpenters and electricians. In addition, it claimed the investment would generate another 200,000 jobs ""across the economy"". Ms Long-Bailey said the pledge was ""one of the greatest investment projects since we rebuilt Britain's housing after the Second World War"". She said: ""Labour will offer every household in the UK the chance to bring the future into their homes - upgrading the fabric of their homes with insulation and cutting edge heating systems - tackling both climate change and extortionate bills."" A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""The reality is that Jeremy Corbyn's plans would wreck the economy, putting up bills for hardworking families - and preventing any real progress on climate change. ""Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives have a proper plan to continue reducing carbon emissions faster than any other G20 country, building on the 400,000 low-carbon jobs we've already created, while keeping bills low."" Rebecca Long-Bailey and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have made renewable energy a key policy On Saturday, Labour said it would ensure all new-build homes in Britainwere ""zero carbon"" within three years. It said a Labour government would introduce ""tough"" standards on new builds which would see homes fitted with solar panels and a ban on gas boilers. The party has previously said it intends to bring energy supply networksinto public ownership. It comes as the governmentcalled a halt to shale gas extraction- commonly known as fracking - in England amid fears about earthquakes. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party want to ban fracking permanently.

"The freeze in benefit payments is to come to an end next year, the government has confirmed. Working-age benefits such as universal credit and jobseeker's allowance will rise by 1.7% from April 2020, the Department for Work and Pensions said. It ends former Tory chancellor George Osborne's decision to introduce a freeze from April 2016. Labour called it a ""cynically-timed"" announcement ahead of the general election on 12 December. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said the move will be seen by some as an election pitch to poorer Leave-backing areas. Our correspondent added it follows a raft of other spending commitments made by Boris Johnson since he became prime minister, including funding for the NHS, schools and police. The benefits freeze - announced in the 2015 Budget - was intended to last until the end of the current financial year. Former chancellor Philip Hammond said in March that the freeze would end as planned and that the then administration had ""no intention of repeating the current freeze"". He added: ""When it is over, increases in benefits will resume in line with [the CPI rate of inflation] in the normal way."" Cuts 'have made renting unaffordable' Labour pledges to end in-work poverty Why the UK has a Â£100bn benefits bill What is universal credit? Rather than increasing each year in line with inflation - to reflect the rising cost of living - most working-age benefits and tax credits have been kept at the same value for more than four years, having last risen in April 2015. Groups such as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation have argued that this has been among the biggest factors in exacerbating poverty levels among working families with children. Other benefits that have been frozen but are now set to rise, by inflation, are: Employment and support allowance, income support, housing benefit, child tax credits, working tax credits and child benefit. Some of these are legacy benefits, which are being replaced by universal credit. The government also said the state pension - which has not been frozen because of the so-called triple lock - will increase by 3.9%. Disability benefits and carer's allowance, which have not been subject to the freeze, will also increase by 1.7% next year. The increase in benefits is expected to cost Â£5bn; ministers say the decision to end the freeze will help 10 million people. The benefit freeze has cut an average of Â£560 per year from the income of the country's poorest seven million families since 2016, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. That's more than Â£2,000 of lost income those families have had to cope with, and the end of the freeze next April doesn't reverse what amounts to a 6% cut in real terms in their income. And remember, some of those families have experienced earlier benefit cuts too, so they'll have been struggling even more. A few more quid each week will undoubtedly help, but next April's long-planned increase needs further context. Pensions will rise at more than double the rate than working age benefits will increase, despite more children living in poverty than older people. And restricting the benefits paid to families who have more than two children will also contribute to rising levels of child poverty, according to the Resolution Foundation. And for those who say, ""well they should just get a job"", bear in mind that in-work poverty is the fastest-rising category of poverty in the UK. Having a job is not a guarantee of not being poor. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said: ""We're clear the best way for people to improve their lives is through work, but we know some people require additional support. ""Our balanced fiscal approach has built a strong economy, with 3.6 million more people in work since 2010. And it's that strong economy which allows us to bolster the welfare safety net by increasing benefit payments for working-age claimants now."" Labour, which is promising to scrap universal credit in a revamp of the benefits system, pointed out the freeze would remain in place for a number of months yet. Adam Corlett, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes, described the announcement as a ""missed opportunity"" that would not increase living standards. ""The benefit freeze was always due to end next year. The government's confirmation that working-age benefits will only keep pace with rising prices means there will be no increase in living standards, and those in need of extra support will continue to be left behind,"" he said. ""With child poverty at risk of hitting record highs, this is a missed opportunity to provide a much-needed boost for low to middle income families."" The announcement comes as a committee of MPs warned thegovernment's policy of limiting welfare benefits to two childrenmust be scrapped because it forces families to stretch ""frozen and capped"" incomes to ""breaking point"". The Work and Pensions Select Committee said the government had not offered evidence to counter forecasts that the policy will ""significantly increase"" child poverty. The two-child limit means that in families where there are already two or more children, the child element in universal credit and tax credits - worth Â£2,780 per child per year - is restricted to the first two children. It applies to children born after 6 April 2017. As well as the two-child limit, there also remains a cap on the total amount of benefits one household can claim. The cap was lowered in 2016, further cutting the amount of benefits some people received. Meanwhile, the government has proposed that private car park operators are obliged to give drivers a 10-minute grace period after their tickets expire before issuing fines. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick said he wants a compulsory code of practice for the industry to ""restore common sense"" to the issuing of parking fines and ""crackdown on dodgy operators"" in England, Scotland and Wales.

"Protesters have been erecting burning barricades across Baghdad Protesters have blocked the main thoroughfares in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, as mass anti-government protests continue. Demonstrators were seen parking cars across key junctions of the city as police looked on without intervening. Since 1 October, tens of thousands of people have taken part in two waves of protests to demand more jobs, an end to corruption, and better services. More than 250 have been killed in clashes with security forces. Iraq protests: What's behind the anger? Is a new Arab Spring unfolding in the Middle East? Last week, Iraqi President Barham Saleh said Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi would resign if political parties could agree on his replacement. On Sunday, protesters shut down the main roads of the capital. They continued to defy a curfew introduced in late October. Protesters have been erecting barricades to block traffic in Baghdad The epicentre of the unrest has been Baghdad's central Tahrir Square Students staged sit-ins at their schools and government offices were closed on the first day of the working week in the Muslim nation. ""We decided to cut the roads as a message to the government that we will keep protesting until the corrupt people and thieves are kicked out and the regime falls,"" Tahseen Nasser, a 25-year-old protester, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. ""We're not allowing government workers to reach their offices, just those in humanitarian fields,"" he said. Alaa Wissam, a 25-year-old architect, said young people were heading to the square to volunteer their help. ""This thing will help young people to have a role in the change that is happening,"" she said. Riot police deployed along the bridges fired tear gas at protesters. Amnesty International has criticised Iraqi forces for using two types of military-grade tear gas canisters that have pierced protesters' skulls and lungs. The Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights said that Siba al-Mahdawi, an activist and doctor who provided medical care to protesters, was abducted on Saturday night by an unknown group. The Commission called on the government to reveal her whereabouts. Protesters want a change of government The epicentre of the unrest has been Baghdad's central Tahrir Square. Protesters there have been attempting to cross a nearby bridge to the fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign embassies. Similar protests have taken place in the city of Kut, south-east of Baghdad. Many government offices and schools were shut on Sunday in a number of cities and towns further south. Mr Abdul Mahdi, a veteran Shia Islamist politician with a background in economics, became prime minister just over a year ago, promising reforms that have not materialised.

"Boris Johnson said referendums were not ""wonderful for harmony"" Boris Johnson has ruled out granting permission for a second vote on Scottish independence while he is prime minister. Mr Johnson said his government would not give the go-ahead for another legally-binding referendum. The Tory leader claimed the issue had been settled in a ""once-in-a-generation"" vote in 2014. Nicola Sturgeon described the position of blocking another independence referendum as ""unsustainable"". The Scottish first minister has already said she will request a ""section 30 order"" - which grants permission for a new referendum from the UK government - within days of the 12 December general election. Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland's future 'must be in our own hands' Labour government 'would not block' indyref2 Nicola Sturgeon says indyref2 'must happen next year' The SNP leader previously said she believed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would grant her the section 30 order if he was voted into Downing Street. But Mr Johnson was clear he did not want to see Scots given a second vote on the country's place in the UK. Speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday, the PM said: ""I think having another referendum, I don't think people in this country think referendums are very wonderful for harmony. ""We had one in 2014, the British people, the people of Scotland, were told in 2014 that that was a once-in-a-generation event."" Asked if he would grant permission for an independence referendum as prime minister, Mr Johnson stated: ""No, I don't, I don't want to have one. But I don't see any reason to go back on that, on that assurance."" The prime minister and first minister have been at loggerheads over the issue of independence since Mr Johnson took office The Scottish government wants toput the question of independence to a new public votein the second half of 2020 and has started the legislative process in Holyrood to achieve this. However, for any referendum to be legally binding it needs the green light from the UK government, which has said it will not approve any section 30 agreement. The Electoral Commission has also said it would want toassess the wording of the questionfor a new Scottish independence vote even if it was the same one used in 2014. Reacting to Mr Johnson's comments, Ms Sturgeon, also speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday, said: ""It is not a sustainable position and it is certainly not a democratic position. ""Everyone in Scotland knows there is going to be another independence referendum and if the SNP wins this election then that sends a clear message that we want to take our future into our own hands rather than have Boris Johnson continue to impose a future upon us. ""If the SNP win this election, for any Westminster politician to seek to stand in the way of an independence referendum would be seeking to ignore the democratic wishes of the Scottish people and I don't think it will be a position that any Westminster politician will be able to stick to."" On the same programme Shadow cabinet member Rebecca Long-Bailey made clear Labour would not block a second referendum if the Scottish government was to push for one after the 2021 Holyrood election. While she was clear Labour wants ""Scotland to be part of Great Britain"" she added: ""Ultimately, what we have said is that after the next Scottish government elections, if the Scottish government determine they want to pursue another referendum and they go through the legislative process within their own government to push that forward, than as a government we wouldn't stand in their way."" The party has said it will oppose independence if there was another referendum. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Labour's comments on a second independence referendum showed Jeremy Corbyn's party could not be trusted to preserve the Union. He said: ""It's quite clear Jeremy Corbyn will break up the UK if it means he can get his hands on the keys to Downing Street.""

"Saudi Aramco has confirmed it is planning to list on the Riyadh stock exchange, in what could be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO). The state-owned oil giant will determine the IPO launch price after registering interest from investors. Business sources say the Saudis are expected to make shares available for 1% or 2% of the firm, and the offer will be for existing company shares. Saudi Aramco is thought to be worth about $1.2tn (Â£927bn). The firm said it has no current plans for a foreign share listing, saying long-discussed plans for a two-stage IPO including an offering on a foreign exchange had been put aside for now. ""For the (international) listing part, we will let you know in due course. So far it's only on Tadawul,"" Aramco chair Yasir al-Rumayyan told a media conference, referring to the Saudi stock exchange. Saudi Aramco flotation 'coming soon' Saudi Arabia denies calling off Aramco float Saudi Arabia to open up to foreign tourists Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at derivatives traders IG Group, said:  ""Investing in Aramco carries risks, of course, and not only that oil prices will struggle to move higher. ""Political and strategic risks are high for any firm operating in the region, not least one which is an arm of the Saudi state.  Aramco also has limited control in output policy, a key part of Saudi Arabia's Opec management."" This video can not be played Abqaiq has the world's largest oil processing plant Those potential risks were highlighted in September when drone attacks hit the Abqaiq oil facility and the Khurais oil field in Saudi Arabia, both owned by Aramco. But Aramco boss Amin Nasser, who called the plans ""historic"", told a media conference after the IPO statement was published that the firm was still the most reliable oil company globally. In its launch announcement Aramco said: ""The company does not expect the impact of these attacks to have a material impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations."" Saudi Aramco traces its roots to 1933 when a deal was struck between Saudi Arabia and the Standard Oil Company of California, which later became Chevron, to survey and drill for oil, creating a new firm to do so. Between 1973 and 1980, Saudi Arabia bought the whole company. Environmental activists are calling on oil companies to stop exploring for more fossil fuels Saudi Arabia has the second-biggest oil reserves after Venezuela, according to theEnergy Information Administration,external. It is also second in production, after the US. But it gets its prominence because it has the monopoly on all that oil in the country, and because of how cheap it is to extract. It's essentially the world's largest unquoted company; it's a massive global oil producer,"" said David Hunter, director of market studies at Schneider Electric. ""This is the absolute mother of all oil and gas companies."" Saudi Aramco is worth $1.2tn, according to analysis from financial news service Bloomberg, although Riyadh would prefer a valuation of $2tn, which is one reason the company's share sale has been delayed a number of times. Mr Beauchamp from IG Group says: ""Aramco is a world away from the tech IPOs that have been all the rage lately, but the valuation problem still haunts them like it does the firms of Silicon Valley."" He adds: ""$2 trillion probably overstates the worth of the firm in a world of high oil supply and uncertain demand, but $1.2 trillion is too low for a vital part of the Saudi state"". Once shrouded in mystery, Aramco has been transformed in the last few years as it geared up for this moment It has begun publishing financial results, holding question and answer sessions about the company and even bringing journalists to its sites following recent drone attacks. And it has hired female Westerners to some of its top jobs. The language in today's document speaks to international concerns. It describes ""long-term value creation through crude oil price cycles"" and improving sustainability ""by leveraging technology and innovation to lower our climate impact"". Local people - even ""Saudi female divorcees"" - will be eligible to buy shares, and will receive a bonus share for every 10 they hold. Either way, it is phenomenally profitable. For the first half of 2019, it posted a net profit of $46.9bn, almost all of which was paid out in dividends to the Saudi state. Any company that profitable will attract a high price. By comparison, for the same time period,Apple,external, the world's largest company by value currently, posted a net profit of $21.6bn, andExxon Mobil,external, the largest listed oil company, made $5.5bn. While alternatives are growing, oil and gas still dominate international energy markets Another aspect is the cost of production. Whereas extracting North Sea oil is expensive due to its location under hundreds of feet of water, oil in Saudi Arabia is relatively close to the surface. Saudi has many of the cheapest oil fields for extraction, with some per-barrel costs below $10, says Mr Hunter. With Brent crude at more than $60, much of the difference can be profit. Saudi Arabia is keen to sell shares in its state oil firm because it is trying to reduce its reliance on oil. The company was formed after an agreement between a US oil firm and Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman wishes to diversify his country's economy in the next decade under a programme dubbed Vision 2030. The plan includes more solar power, making use of the country's vast desert, says Mr Hunter. The first Saudi CEO of the company, Ali al-Naimi, had a vision that Aramco could become a global integrated energy company.  Over his years as CEO, he expanded Aramco's assets to include downstream (refining) and other assets in the US, South Korea, China, Indonesia, Japan and Europe. He and his successors also expanded Aramco's footprint in Saudi Arabia with joint ventures in refining and petrochemicals.  Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter today and is the only oil producer that maintains at least 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity that can be brought onto the market very quickly. The fact that it is a national oil company means it has exclusive access to the best and least-expensive-to-produce oil resources in the world.  This makes it hugely valuable.  But there are downsides.  Saudi Arabia's upstream assets aren't diversified like other major international oil companies upstream assets are.  It also means that the Saudi government plays a role in the company.  Historically, Saudi Arabia allowed Aramco to operate independently and did not make decisions about spending for strategy for the company. There are troubling signs that this is changing now and the government is taking a more active, and detrimental, role. How much Aramco is really worth will be determined by the market.  Banks have put forth their valuations, but the market will show how much it is really worth. Different sources have quoted valuations ranging from $1.2 tn to $2 tn. The most common number floated right now seems to be about $1.5 tn, perhaps $1.7 tn, though public sentiment probably indicates that this is too high a number. In 30 years, who knows how much Aramco will be worth.  We don't know what other energy technologies will develop, or not, in that time, nor what Aramco's strategic vision will produce. In September, the kingdom said it will open its doors to international tourists for the first time, launching a visa regime for 49 countries and relax strict dress codes for female visitors. Tourism Minister Ahmad al-Khateeb described it as a ""historic moment"" for the country. It wants tourism to rise from 3% to 10% of gross domestic product by 2030. The push comes as the kingdom faces a tarnished international image amid criticism of its human rights record following last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and a recent crackdown on women's rights activists. Politically, matters are rather complicated for Saudi Aramco right now, in light of the recent Kashoggi scandal, said Mr Hunter. ""And the fact of Saudi Arabia's human rights record. Anything to do with Saudi Arabia is always seen through that prism."" Aramco is the world's largest oil firm Another wrinkle in the crown prince's plan is the surge in anti-fossil fuel sentiment around the world, plus the comparatively low oil price compared to late last year, where prices were above $80. ""The listing could be controversial because it's a massive fossil fuel listing in a time investors are becoming increasingly ethical,"" said Mr Hunter. ""There are a lot of new and existing funds looking to divest from fossil fuel assets."" In May, fellow oil producer Norway's $1tn sovereign wealth fund said it expected to sell some of its oil and gas holdings, albeit to make it less reliant on price swings in the commodity.

"This video can not be played Mr Farage last stood for election in South Thanet in 2015 Nigel Farage has said he will not be standing as a candidate in the general election on 12 December. The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr he had thought ""very hard"" but had decided he could ""serve the cause better"" by supporting his party's 600 candidates ""across the UK"". ""I don't want to be in politics for the rest of my life,"" he said. Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Farage's decision was ""a bit weird"" given the Brexit Party hopes to stand in most places. The Labour leader said: ""It's obviously his decision. It's a bit weird to lead a political party that is apparently contesting all or most of the seats up in the election and he himself is not offering himself for election."" Mr Farage, who has stood unsuccessfully for Parliament seven times and currently sits in the European Parliament, alsoalso criticised the PM's Brexit deal.. The 55-year-old told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the deal agreed earlier this month was ""virtually worse that being in the EU"". ""If Boris Johnson was going for a genuine Brexit, we wouldn't need to fight against him in this election,"" he said. On Friday, theprime minister rejected an alliance with Mr Farage's Brexit Party, telling BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg doing deals with ""any other party... simply risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10"". A really simple guide to the election,external Who has selected the most women as candidates? Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external Mr Farage had called on the prime minister to drop his Brexit deal, unite in a ""Leave alliance"" or face a Brexit Party candidate in every seat in the election. He told the Marr show: ""I always thought that to win an election, get a big majority so we can get a proper Brexit, a coming-together would be the objective. ""I still hope and pray it happens but it doesn't look like it will."" Mr Johnson maintains that the only way out of the EU is to ""go with the deal we've got"". The prime minister told Sophy Ridge on Sky that he was ""deeply, deeply disappointed"" to miss the 31 October deadline to secure Brexit, calling it ""a matter of deep regret"". The PM had previously said he would rather ""die in a ditch"" than ask the EU to delay Brexit beyond Halloween. Mr Johnson told the programme that he was sorry, and took responsibility, for missing the date, but accused Parliament of failing to implement his deal. He also said Donald Trump was ""patently in error"" when the US president warned the government's Brexit deal would hamper a UK-US trade deal. Mr Farage said Mr Johnson's deal ""kills off any chance of genuine independence"". ""If Boris is determined to stick to this new EU treaty, then that is not Brexit,"" he said. By political correspondent Jessica Parker Political opponents of Nigel Farage will accuse him of running scared after he said he would not stand as a candidate in December's poll. They will suggest he's not going to run because he thinks he's not going to win. But the flip side is that rather than concentrating on one constituency where he personally might try to win, Mr Farage is making it clear he's going to try to make Boris Johnson's life pretty difficult. That's if this so-called Leave alliance doesn't happen - and it doesn't look like it will. The Brexit Party leader has made it clear he has no interest in getting on board with Mr Johnson's deal at all. It's likely Mr Farage will spend a lot of the campaign really criticising it, whereas the Tory party leader will say he's got an oven-ready deal to present and get through Parliament within weeks. Treasury minister Rishi Sunak hit back at the criticism of the deal, telling the Andrew Marr show: ""I campaigned for Leave, I spent a lot of time talking to my constituents and others across the North East and in Yorkshire - what do they want from Brexit? ""They want to end free movement and replace it with a points system, they want to end the fact that money keeps going to the EU year after year, they want to make sure we're in control of our laws, and also they want us to have an independent trade policy. These are all things the prime minister's deal delivers. ""What I would say to Nigel Farage is, sometimes in politics, as in life, you've got to take yes for an answer."" Also appearing on the programme, shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested that a Labour government would seek to end privatised contracts in the NHS. He said that, as the contracts ran out, the work should be brought in-house, and that the public didn't want money ""being poured into the pockets of profiteers"". Pushed on whether an incoming Labour government would see the eradication of all privatisation in the NHS, Mr McDonnell said ""we'll see how those contracts run out."" The Conservatives have strongly denied that the NHS is ""up for sale"". Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? NHS claims fact-checked Asked if Labour would scrap the expansion of Heathrow airport, Mr McDonnell said the party would make the decision based on a set of criteria covering the environmental, economic and social impact of the project. ""On the current criteria, we've said very clearly, Heathrow expansion doesn't qualify."" And on taxes, he said Labour would increase income tax for the top 5% of earners and raise corporation tax in order to pay for ""investments in schools and training"".

"Check the latest opinion poll trends with the poll tracker, which measures how people say they are going to vote at the next general election. This page is no longer being updated.You can see the latest poll tracker for the UK general election due to be called in 2024 by clicking here. Over the course of the campaign almost every single poll has had the Conservatives ahead by at least 6%. So if they don't end up with the most votes it would be a serious failure. Labour have consistently been in a clear second place, a long way ahead of the Liberal Democrats in third. The Brexit Party started the campaign at around 10% of the vote but have fallen back dramatically - in part as a result of their decision not to contest Conservative-held seats. In Scotland the picture is very different. In the few polls there have been, the SNP has always had a commanding lead with the Conservatives in second place. Again, if that's not the result then the polls will have been badly flawed. For most of the campaign there have been marked differences between the polling companies. But all of them have suggested that the race has narrowed in the final two weeks. Out of 100 people who are likely to vote, about... Please upgrade your browser or enable JavaScript to see the full interactive experience There's about a 90% chance that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown above, which means there's a one in 10 chance that it lies outside these ranges. * Because the SNP and Plaid Cymru only campaign in Scotland and Wales respectively, the margins of error for their support across Great Britain is likely to be less than +/- 1% What most polls don't tell us is how votes will be converted into seats in the House of Commons. There have been several attempts to do this, though, using large polling samples which allow complex analyses of the levels of support for each party among different demographic groups. The central forecast of the final YouGov projection is a Conservative majority of 28. But it's important to look at the range of possible outcomes their analysis implies. For the Conservatives that range is 311-367 seats. So, on this basis, another hung parliament cannot be ruled out - and neither can a large majority. The BBC won't report on any polls that come out on polling day so this will be the final update to the poll tracker. The exit poll, commissioned by the BBC, ITV News and Sky News will be published when voting ends at 22.00 GMT on Thursday night. Compare where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election manifesto guide Going into the last few days of the election campaign the Conservative lead over Labour remains solid. The latest polls all put the Conservatives in the low to mid-40s and Labour in the low 30s in percentage terms across Britain as a whole. The Lib Dems are in a narrow 11-14% range and the Brexit Party are in low single digits - a long way down compared to where they started. Over the course of the campaign, both of the main parties have seen their poll ratings go up but the gap between the two is more or less where it was five weeks ago. As Sir John Curtice has pointed out, if the result on Thursday is in line with these numbers then the Conservatives are probably on course for a decent majority in the House of Commons. There should be a few more polls to come over the next three days - as well as another YouGov seat projection - so that could still change. But there would have to be a pretty big shift to point to a different overall result. Of course, they could all be systematically wrong - it wouldn't be the first time if that turned out to be true. But if you're using the polls as a guide to what could happen then their message is clear. The latest batch of polls lends more weight to the suggestion that the Conservative rise, which has been a consistent feature of the election campaign, has levelled off. That doesn't mean they can't go up any further, but for the time being it seems as though support for them is fairly static. Meanwhile, the Labour Party is still moving upwards - apparently mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats. If this trend continues, then we could be on course for another election where the two biggest parties capture a very large share of the overall vote. It would still need another big move, though, to reach the 84% that the Conservatives and Labour achieved between them in 2017. And there are only ten days to go. Our poll tracker smoothes out the bumps in polling by including old polls. Their influence decays, halving every week, but that still means our rolling average can look a little behind the latest figures. The differences are all smaller than the margin of error, but if parties are picking up or losing share, we might be a point or two off what a simple average of the latest polls would tell you. That's not so apparent when the parties are all moving in parallel - so we're lagging a little for everyone and the differences between parties will look similar. But, with the Conservatives plateauing, it might take a little while before our tracker starts to show Labour catching up as the most recent polls suggest they might be. YouGov's seat projection has raised a lot of interest. A lot of that is down to the fact that when they did the same exercise in 2017 they were pretty successful at forecasting the overall election result as well as the outcome in most individual constituencies. Their new projection puts the Conservatives on 359 seats, Labour on 211, the SNP on 43, Lib Dems on 13 and other parties on 24. That suggests a Conservative majority of 68. However, this still needs to be treated with caution for several reasons. It's still based on polling which, as we know, is always subject to error. The margin of error for this model ranges from a Conservative landslide to a very slim majority. Whilst the model uses a sophisticated technique to see how national polling trends play out in individual constituencies, it is always going to be very difficult to account for truly local factors - such as a prominent local independent candidate. Also, some other recent polls have suggested that Labour have moved a bit closer to the Conservatives than they are in the YouGov poll. That would clearly have an impact on the size of any overall majority, and the polls will continue to move between now and 12 December. So, whilst the projection is certainly very interesting, it shouldn't be treated as providing a reliable forecast of what the result of the election will be. One other feature of the most recent polls is that, with one clear exception, there seems to be more consistency between the different polling companies. If you look back to the beginning of October, there were very large differences between them. Now, each of the parties seems to be performing in a fairly narrow range across the polls: the low 40s for the Conservatives; close to 30% for Labour, and the mid-teens for the Lib Dems. The outlier is Opinium's latest poll which has the Conservatives on 47% and the Lib Dems down on 12%. Of course, convergence doesn't mean the polls can tell us what the final result will be. There's still more than two weeks to go and the lesson from 2015 is that there can be a consistent error across nearly all polls. Overall, the polls from the last week have shown the same pattern of movement as they have throughout the campaign. In particular, the Conservatives have gone up again in the BBC poll tracker and the Brexit Party continues to fall. There may be the first signs in the raw polling figures, though, that the Conservative shift is beginning to level off. Several of the pollsters have them one or two points below their peak in the latest figures. Even if their rise does stall, though, the Tories are now fairly close to the 43% they actually achieved at the 2017 election. A new Panelbase poll in Scotland also puts them only marginally below the result from last time. However, a result along those lines wouldn't mean their vote share was approximately flat across the country. The national figures can mask big shifts at a local level. There could still be dramatic swings in individual constituencies. Writing updates on the election campaign polls is beginning to get a bit repetitive. Once again, the changes since last week are basically following the same pattern as we've seen before. The Conservatives are up and Labour is also up a bit. The Brexit Party is down, and the Lib Dems are also a bit lower than before. In fact, the Conservatives are now pushing towards the 43% they actually achieved across Britain at the general election in 2017. As we noted last week, pollsters are adjusting their methodologies to take account of the fact that the Brexit Party has withdrawn in Conservative-held seats. That ought to help them hold on to seats they're defending. Perhaps slightly counterintuitively, though, it might mean Boris Johnson needs a bigger lead in the polls to be sure of winning an overall majority of MPs. Piling on extra votes in safe Conservative constituencies, thanks to the absence of a Brexit Party candidate, probably won't translate into extra seats in the House of Commons. A poll by LucidTalk covering the election in Northern Ireland was also published last week. These are few and far between, and the poll was conducted before the official election campaign got underway, so it's very hard to get a good sense of any trends. But compared to the 2017 election, the poll suggested the DUP and Sinn Fein losing vote share with the Alliance and SDLP going up. If the actual election result goes a similar way it could mean the smaller parties making gains in terms of seats at the expense of the big two. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties. YouGov's latest poll removed the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Green and Plaid Cymru as an option in seats where they have stood down. The most notable, if unsurprising, effect was for the Brexit Party. Their support roughly halved from 9% to 4% as they roughly halved the number of constituencies in which they are standing. Other pollsters have said they will follow suit. We can expect further changes as nominations close and it becomes clear who is standing in each constituency. So there will be even more movements in the poll tracker over the coming weeks. Some of it will be, as ever, down to the changing political landscape. But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties. YouGov's latest poll removed the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Green and Plaid Cymru as an option in seats where they have stood down. The most notable, if unsurprising, effect was for the Brexit Party. Their support roughly halved from 9% to 4% as they roughly halved the number of constituencies in which they are standing. Other pollsters have said they will follow suit. We can expect further changes as nominations close and it becomes clear who is standing in each constituency. So there will be even more movements in the poll tracker over the coming weeks. Some of it will be, as ever, down to the changing political landscape. But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. The trends that were noticeable in the polls a week ago have carried on over the last seven days. The Conservatives have continued their steady upward progress. But the tentative signs of a Labour recovery have also become firmer. Both parties' average scores are up, although they're still below the vote shares they recorded at the 2017 election - more than 10% below in Labour's case. Going in the other direction, the Brexit Party are down to 9% in the BBC poll tracker - their lowest score since the party was launched in April. And it's now clear that the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from where they were a month ago. YouGov has also published polls for Wales and Scotland. In Wales, they have Labour up four points with the Lib Dems losing the same amount since the last poll. Labour, on 29%, are now roughly on a par with the Conservatives on 28%. Since there are so few Welsh polls probably the best we can say with any confidence is that it looks close between the two main parties - with Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party also in a close battle for third place. The Scotland poll gave the SNP a very large lead on 42%, with the Conservatives in a clear second place, and Labour falling to its lowest score since before the last election - just below the Lib Dems. However, that poll was conducted more than two weeks ago, before the election was even confirmed so it's rather likely that these figures are out of date. There can be little doubt, however, that the SNP are currently on course for a strong result. It's nearly a week now since it became clear that there would be a general election on 12 December. There have already been eight polls conducted since then - we can expect that from now on they will be coming thick and fast. Over the last seven days the Conservatives have continued their upward trend in the BBC poll tracker whilst the Brexit Party are still drifting downwards. There are also some early signs of a recovery for Labour. They've hit an average of 26% - their highest figure since the first half of September. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have fallen to 17% - their lowest since the start of June. These movements are pretty small so far, though, so we will need to see if they continue in the coming days. There's no doubt that Brexit will be a major issue at this election. But as the campaign gets underway, will other policy areas come to the fore? Opinium has found that Brexit is a more dominant subject as the campaign gets under way than it was at the last general election. Forty per cent of people in their latest poll said it was the single issue that was most likely to influence their vote. That compares with 18% at the start of the 2017 campaign. However, when people were asked to name the three most important issues facing the country, 59% of respondents identified health/NHS compared to only 52% for the EU/Brexit. That's a shift compared to their recent polls where Brexit has come out on top or in equal first place. It's possible that by campaigning on non-Brexit issues the parties will be able to influence how much weight voters give to different subjects. Panelbase's latest poll also puts the NHS/health as the top issue. On the other hand, Deltapoll have Britain leaving the EU clearly ahead of health. The difference here could be explained by the fact they don't namecheck the NHS in their range of options. The last few weeks have seen a gradual, further strengthening of the Conservatives' position in the polls. In the latest poll by Opinium they hit 40% - the highest figure in a single poll since the middle of August. They've also moved up to an average of 36% in the BBC poll tracker. In the meantime, the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from their party conference highpoint to settle at that 18%-ish level they've occupied for much of the autumn while the Brexit Party continue to drift downwards. Labour's average rating has essentially stayed flat. Because voting intention polls are fairly scarce in Scotland, it's difficult to identify trends. But the latest Panelbase poll conducted earlier this month suggests that the SNP continues to dominate. Comparing polls to the 2017 general election result suggests Labour and the Conservatives are on course to lose votes, the SNP are roughly level with where they were, whilst the Lib Dems could gain votes. The SNP's share in polls has floated between 36% and 43% for the last two years. In our GB-wide poll tracker, that translates to 4%, occasionally dropping to 3% or rising to 5% since Scotland has just under 10% of the GB population. That's why we don't suggest a margin of error range as we do for parties that field candidates across the whole of Great Britain. Polls are even rarer in Wales - but the latest from YouGov, also conducted earlier this month, broadly matches others from earlier in the year. The Conservatives are down from their 2017 election share but Labour has fallen back much more dramatically. From the 49% they achieved then, their share of the vote has approximately halved according to polls. The Lib Dems are up sharply and the Brexit Party are performing far more strongly than UKIP did when voters last had their say. Our poll tracker lines show an average of results from the polls to date. Each dot in the chart above shows one poll result for a party. There are too many individual dots to keep track of: even on one day there can be very different results for one party from different polls. So we summarise all that information with a line that averages those results. It bounces around less and makes it easier to tell the signal from the noise (or the trends from the blips?). We use polls conducted by members of the British Polling Council. As of September 2019, that's BMG, ComRes, Deltapoll, Hanbury, ICM, Ipsos Mori, Kantar, Opinium, ORB, Panelbase, Sky Data, Survation and YouGov. Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK, but as a result we do not have separate data for parties that only stand in Northern Ireland. We use results that exclude or downweight those who are unlikely to vote and people who do not express a preference. We include data that are in the public domain: some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time and so we update the poll tracker as data become available. The margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points. This means that there's a 90% chance that an election held tomorrow would give national vote shares within four points of our estimates for each of the parties. And there's a 10% chance that it would be outside that range. We base these figures on aBritish Polling Council analysis,externalof the results of the final set of polls before each of the elections from 2001 to 2017. The approach mentioned above doesn't quite work for parties that only run in Scotland or Wales or are standing in only a few seats, like UKIP or The Independent Group for Change. The electorate they are appealing to is smaller and this makes their possible vote smaller when it is projected across Great Britain or the whole of the UK. This also means that their margin of error is smaller than that of those parties that stand across Britain and is likely to be less than + / - 1%. We have more coverage of politics inScotlandandWaleson their national politics pages. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls to date. Bigger and more recent polls have more influence on our figures. We also limit the influence of any one poll or of those polling firms who poll very frequently to prevent our results being too dependent on one source. In a little more detail: the average is weighted by sample size. The more people polled in a particular survey, the more weight we will give it, up to a threshold of 2,000 people. On the other hand, the older a poll is the less influence it has on the average figure we calculate. We also give less value to any polling firm that has data for more than 5,000 people in a fortnight. A typical poll may cover about 1,000 people. Because a party isn't guaranteed to get the same vote share in an election as it did in a poll the previous day. Polling a sample of the population has often been likened to tasting soup. If the soup has been well stirred then you need to have only one spoonful to get a sense of what the whole bowl is like. In the same way, a well-conducted poll of 1,000 people can, most of the time, give us an idea of what the country as a whole is thinking. But it's not 100% precise, so, the margin of error gives a sense of how the results might change with a different sample of 1,000 people. This margin of error only applies to national vote share: converting that into seats in Parliament is much harder and less precise. There are also systematic differences between polling companies who approach people in different ways, who ask different questions and who analyse the results differently. We list the main polling firms and the questions they ask below. Polling companies also analyse their data differently. They make choices about how to weight each respondent. For example, if a poll of 1,000 people is made up of 550 men and 450 women, it is unrepresentative because it does not reflect the profile of the UK population (51% female). So the answers of female respondents should be given slightly more weight than male respondents in the analysis so that the final results are 51% based on female answers rather than 45%. That's not controversial, but adjusting for past vote or likelihood to vote is harder. Some pollsters ask respondents who they voted for last time and weight the sample to try and ensure it matches the political make-up of the general population. One problem with doing this is that a certain number of people will incorrectly recall who they voted for last time - and a few will even lie about it. So polling companies often use a variety of further methods to improve the accuracy of their weighting. That variety of methods leads to a variety of answers. Most companies then weight or filter by likelihood to vote so that the answers of people who are most likely to vote are given the most prominence in the results. Finally, several pollsters reallocate a percentage of ""don't knows"" to the party they voted for last time. This is to get around the problem that emerged following the 1979 election with the phenomenon of ""shy Tories"" or the ""spiral of silence"" - people who do not want to discuss their voting preference but who will still vote. Our approach, excluding ""don't knows"" from our polltracker, is slightly different. It is like saying that they won't vote or, if they did, their voting preferences would look quite like those who do express a preference. Many polling companies changed their methodology when the candidates lists were released to account for those parties that are standing only in a few seats. If a general election were held today, which of the following parties would you vote for? Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP (if living in Scotland), Plaid Cymru (if living in Wales), Green Party, Brexit Party, another party Prior to August 2019, Green Party and Brexit Party were only prompted for if the respondent answered ""another party"". Following a randomised controlled trial, BMG decided to move those two parties into the main prompt list. The Independent Group for Change and UKIP remain in the secondary prompt list. If there were a (UK) general election tomorrow to elect MPs to Westminster, would you vote Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, Brexit Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru, or for another party?

"The UK is gearing up to hold a general election on Thursday. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. A total of 650 people will be chosen asmembers of Parliament (MPs), to decide laws and policies. Members of Parliament are elected by voters to represent the interests of their constituency in the House of Commons. Most belong to a political party, but some do stand as independents. There are 650 MPs in the House. MPs are elected to the House of Commons, one of two chambers of Parliament in London, where the government is based. The government passes laws that help it run the country. This compares with local governments which deal with issues such as bin collections and schools in each area. In a general election, the UK's 46 million voters are invited to choose an MP for their area - one of 650 constituencies. Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, as long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. Older people are more likely than younger ones to vote. At the 2017 general election, 59% of 20- to 24-year-olds voted, compared with 77% of 60- to 69-year-olds. However, about two-thirds of the more than 3.1 million people who registered to vote between the election being called and the registration deadline were under the age of 35, with more than a million of them under 25. Voting takes place at local polling stations, set up in places such as churches and school halls. Voters put a cross on the ballot paper beside the name of their chosen candidate and drop it into a sealed ballot box. Most people over 18 on polling day can stand as a candidate - as long as they are a British citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizen resident in the UK. They must also pay a Â£500 deposit, which will be lost if they do not get at least 5% of the votes in their constituency. Candidates must meet certain conditions - prisoners, civil servants, judges and members of the police and armed forces cannot stand. A total of 3,322 candidates are standing across the 650 seats this year. There are 91 Davids standing for election - the most popular name among the candidates - while the first female name on the list is Sarah in 18th place. There are 22 candidates with that first name standing. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected, even if they are chosen by less than half the electorate in their seat. Most MPs represent a political party but some stand for election as independent candidates. Any party with more than half the MPs (326) in the Commons usually forms the government. Parties with well below 50% of the national vote can take power as a result of theUK's voting system. The UK uses a first past the post voting system. It means a local candidate who receives the most votes wins â and the party with the most winning candidates forms a government. So the overall number of votes parties get nationally does not have any bearing on who wins the election. If no party has a majority of MPs, the one with the most can form a coalition - or partnership - with one or more other parties to gain control. The prime minister is not directly voted for by the public. He or she is chosen by the winning party's MPs and appointed bythe Queen, who is duty bound to follow their advice. The Queen is the UKâs head of state, although she is not in charge of the government. Elizabeth II is the countryâs longest-serving monarch, having ascended to the throne in 1952. She performs state duties, which include formally opening Parliament, representing the country at events such as the annual Remembrance Day parade, and making official visits overseas. She is also head of the armed forces and Church of England. Detailed proposals for everything from the economy to defence and policing are set out before any general election inmanifestos. A manifesto is basically a brochure containing all of a party's ideas and policies. Manifestos are usually published during the general election campaign. If a party wins the election, it is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver as a government. These come from the UK's political parties - groups of people with similar political beliefs who come together to try to win power. The issues UK voters care most about have changed a lot, according to the polls. TheNational Health Service (NHS)and immigration were the things that most concerned voters in 2015. The National Health Service (NHS), which started in 1948, is the government-funded national healthcare service that provides free diagnosis and treatment for UK citizens. TheEuropean Union (EU)was of far less interest. European Union: the political and economic union of 28 member states, which the UK is planning to leave. Now, however,Brexit- the UK's departure from the EU - is a huge issue. Short for British exit - refers to the UK leaving the European Union. Neither the Conservative orLabourparties had enough votes to form a majority government after the 2017 election. The Labour Party was founded by the trade union movement in 1900 to give workers a voice in Parliament. It believes in the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, greater rights for working people and strong, state-run public services. The Conservatives were the bigger of the two parties and formed a partnership with the Democratic Unionist PartyDUPin order to win votes in the Commons. The Democratic Unionist Party was founded in 1971, during the time of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. As unionists, the DUP support Northern Ireland being part of the UK and are known for their socially conservative beliefs on abortion and same-sex marriage. After the 2017 election, DUP MPs helped keep the Conservatives in power by agreeing to support them in Commons votes. Since the election, the Conservatives and Labour have both lost MPs, while theLiberal Democratshave made gains. Often called the Lib Dems, the Liberal Democrats were formed in 1988 by the merger of one of Britain's oldest political institutions, the Liberal Party, which stood for free trade and individual liberty, and the Social Democratic Party, a centrist offshoot of the Labour Party. The party likes to see itself as being on the centre ground of British politics. Parliament's second chamber is theHouse of Lords. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. It is independent from the House of Commons but shares with it the role of making laws, while it also checks the governmentâs work. Members are given a title, such as Lord, are not elected, do not represent constituencies and most do not belong to any party. Its members are not elected but are appointed by the Queen, on the prime minister's advice. On general election day, voting takes place between 07:00 and 22:00. The results are declared through the night and the following day. When the overall result is known, the leader of the winning party, if there is one, visits Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Once they have that, which is a formality, they return to the traditional home of the prime minister10 Downing Street. This terraced house is the official residence and office of the UK prime minister. Often they will stand outside to deliver a speech about their party's plans for the coming years.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Election pact with Brexit Party 'risks putting Corbyn into No 10' Boris Johnson has rejected the suggestion from Nigel Farage and Donald Trump that he should work with the Brexit Party during the election. The Tory leader told the BBC he was ""always grateful for advice"" but he would not enter into election pacts. His comments come after the US president said Mr Farage and Mr Johnson would be ""an unstoppable force"". Downing Street sources say there are no circumstances in which the Tories would work with the Brexit Party. In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the prime minister said the ""difficulty"" of doing deals with ""any other party"" was that it ""simply risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10"". ""The problem with that is that his [Mr Corbyn's] plan for Brexit is basically yet more dither and delay,"" Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson also said there was ""no question of negotiating on the NHS"" as part of any future trade deal with the US, but he did not rule out expanding the amount of private provision in the health service in the future. But Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said the public ""can't trust the Tories on the NHS"", saying they would ""increase privatisation even further and do a deal with Donald Trump"". Kuenssberg: Colourful words no guarantee of election success First head-to-head TV election debate announced Jeremy Corbyn vows to 'transform' UK Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? A really simple guide to the UK general election Farage calls on Johnson to 'build Leave alliance' When pushed on whether he would rule out a deal with Mr Farage, Mr Johnson replied: ""I want to be very, very clear that voting for any other party than this government, this Conservative governmentâ¦ is basically tantamount to putting Jeremy Corbyn in."" The UK is going to the polls on 12 December following a further delay to the UK's departure from the EU, to 31 January 2020. The BBC will be talking to other party leaders during the course of the campaign. US president Donald Trumptold Nigel Farage's LBC show on Thursday,externalthat the Brexit Party leader should team up with Mr Johnson to do ""something terrific"" and he also criticised the prime minister's EU withdrawal agreement. Meanwhile, Mr Farage has called on the prime minister to drop his Brexit deal, unite in a ""Leave alliance"" or face a Brexit Party candidate in every seat in the election. Mr Johnson said there were ""lots of reasons"" why he thought a Labour government would be a ""disaster"". He said he Labour government would lead to a renegotiation with Brussels on a Brexit deal, then another referendum. ""Why go through that nightmare again?"" he said. The prime minister also suggested that the US president was wrong to believe a trade deal would be impossible with the UK after Brexit. Mr Johnson said his ""proper Brexit"" deal ""enables us to do proper all-singing, all-dancing free-trade deals"". This video can not be played Farage: Trump is a 'fan of Boris Johnson' ""It delivers exactly what we wanted, what I wanted, when I campaigned in 2016 to come out the European Union,"" Mr Johnson said. When asked about the criticism from Mr Trump, Mr Johnson said: ""I am always grateful for advice from wherever it comes and we have great relations as you know with the US and many many other countries. ""But on the technicalities of the deal anybody who looks at it can see that the UK has full control."" The prime minister is never short of a word or two, never short of a colourful phrase or a metaphor. When we sat down this afternoon there wasno suggestion of him being the Hulk,external, but Remain-tending MPs were accused of ""rope-a-doping"" the government, planning eventually to batter the prime minister and his Brexit deal into submission until he would have had to give up. But in Downing Street there is a serious awareness that trademark Johnson verbal gymnastics are no guarantee of success at the ballot box in six weeks' time, no guarantee at all. That's not just because there are even friends, like Donald Trump, and of course foes, like Jeremy Corbyn, whose words and actions will hamper his attempt to secure a majority to call his own. But also because this is a snap election, not a routine poll, and the public is hardly in a forgiving mood of our politicians right now. Read more from Laura Mr Johnson said he hoped the government could get Brexit ""over the line"" by the middle of January if he won a majority, claiming the current Parliament would never have passed his deal. He said he'd had ""no choice"" but to call a general election, saying: ""Nobody wants an election but we've got to do it now. ""This is a Parliament that is basically full of MPs who voted Remain. ""They voted Remain and they will continue to block Brexit if they're given the chance - we need a new mandate, we need to refresh our Parliament."" Mr Johnson said his government was determined to increase taxpayer funding of the NHS but said: ""Of course there are dentists and optometrists and so on who are providers to the NHS, of course, that's how it works,"" he said. ""But... I believe passionately in an NHS free at the point of use for everybody in this country."" Labour's Mr Ashworth said: ""Forced NHS privatisation has doubled under the Conservatives and Boris Johnson has refused to rule out expanding this further. ""You can't trust the Tories on the NHS. They will increase privatisation even further and do a deal with Donald Trump that will see as much as Â£500m more a week sent to US corporations.""

"An air ambulance was called to the scene of the crash, on the M23 near Hooley, Surrey A man has died while taking part in a classic car rally after his vintage vehicle crashed with a lorry on a motorway. The 80-year-old, driving a 1903 Knox Runabout Old Porcupine, was killed at the scene of the crash on the M23 in Surrey at about 10:00 GMT. His female passenger was seriously injured and taken to hospital. The car had been entered into the Bonhams London to Brighton Veteran Car Run, organisers have confirmed. They said the car had ""left the route, which does not include the M23, when the crash took place"". More than 400 vehicles dating from before 1905 were registered to take part in this year's run. The crash happened on the southbound carriageway, near Hooley. More than 400 pre-1905 cars were taking part in this year's Veteran Car Run, which was started by Alan Titchmarsh The road remains closed both ways between junctions seven and eight, close to the M25 junction. The run's organisers added: ""We are doing all we can to support the family concerned and are working with the police, but we cannot comment any further at this stage.""

"This video can not be played Knife attack amidst protests in Hong Kong shopping mall Five people have been injured in a knife attack at the site of a pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong. The attack happened at the Cityplaza mall in the Tai Koo district on Hong Kong Island. The local hospital authority said four men and one woman were injured, with two in critical condition. One of the injured, a local councillor, had his ear partially bitten off by the as-yet unidentified male attacker, who was subdued by passersby in the mall. Witnesses said the Mandarin-speaking attacker drew a knife after a political argument with people in the mall, which was the site of pro-democracy protests earlier in the day. The local councillor, Andrew Chiu Ka-yin, reportedly was attempting to prevent the attacker leaving the scene when the man bit off a section of his ear. Witnesses said the attacker was badly beaten by passersby who intervened, before police arrested the man. Andrew Chiu Ka-yin receives first aid after he was attacked on Sunday One of the victims, a woman, told the South China Morning Post that the suspect drew a knife after arguing with her sister and her husband, who were also injured. The Hong Kong Free Press reported that that attacker was a Mandarin-speaking pro-Beijing supporter. Hong Kong has experienced five months of sometimes violent demonstrations by pro-democracy activists, who first took to the streets to protest against a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, but evolved into a broader revolt against the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing. A quick guide to the Hong Kong protests The wave of pro-democracy protests continued this weekend, days after a high-profile activist, Joshua Wong, was banned from standing in local elections. Police fired tear gas on Sunday into crowds of demonstrators in the eastern suburb of Taikoo Shing, home to the Cityplaza where the stabbing occurred. With no end in sight, China's leaders signalled last week that they were preparing to change how the mainland administered Hong Kong. Shen Chunyao, the director of the Hong Kong, Macau and Basic Law Commission, told reporters that officials were looking at ways to ""perfect"" how Hong Kong's chief executive was appointed and removed. He did not elaborate on what exactly might change. Last month, the leader of one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups was taken to hospital after being attacked, apparently with hammers. Photographs on social media showed Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front lying in the street, covered in blood. From hospital, the activist said he ""remained committed to the ideal of peaceful non-violence"". Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hong Kong Images and footage of the incident spread quickly around social media platforms. The man who did the biting was subdued by a crowd, which then beat him, some using metal objects. That is was all happening in a shopping centre being stormed by riot police in pursuit of protestors who were earlier singing and chanting made it even more intense. A small group of hardcore activists had also smashed up shops whose owners they judged to be too ""pro-Beijing"". I watched the footage on a television in a small restaurant in Hong Kong. Halfway through the report, the woman running the place turned and walked away from the screen. ""This is all too depressing,"" she said in Chinese.

"Mr Thomson has insisted the allegations were ""politically motivated smears"" Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson is to stand down after being accused of sexually assaulting a Labour MP in a Commons bar. Mr Thomson said he had made the ""hardest decision of my life"" not to contest the seat for Aberdeen South at the general election. Labour MP Paul Sweeney had said he reported Mr Thomson to Westminster's standards watchdog following the alleged incident last October. Mr Thomson denies any wrongdoing. But he said a number of ""anonymous and malicious allegations"" this year had made his life ""a living hell"". Mr Thomson, 32, said: ""This is a political smear and I will continue to fight to clear my name. I will see this investigatory process through to a conclusion. ""I have suffered a level of personal abuse that has affected my health, my mental wellbeing and my staff. It has been a level of abuse that I never imagined possible."" Mr Sweeney said he was with a group of friends in the Commons bar when the incident happened He added: ""I have therefore made the most difficult decision that I could ever make. I have decided that I will stand down as the Scottish Conservative and Unionist candidate for Aberdeen South."" Mr Sweeney, who is the MP for Glasgow North East,told the Scottish Mail on Sunday,externalhe was left feeling ""mortified"" by the alleged attack in the Strangers' Bar at Westminster. Ross Thomson: Tory MP says bar behaviour claims 'completely false' Ross Thomson: Fresh allegations over Tory MP's behaviour According to the paper, Mr Sweeney said he was ""paralysed"" with shock after Mr Thomson ""groped"" him in the bar. He said the alleged incident took place in October 2018 after he had invited a group of his old Glasgow University friends for a tour of the Commons. They later went to the Strangers' Bar for a drink where he claims they were interrupted by Mr Thomson, who was ""drunk to the point where he was barely able to stand up"". Mr Thomson then allegedly grabbed at Mr Sweeney through his clothes. Mr Sweeney said he repeatedly told Mr Thomson to stop touching him and asked him to leave. The Labour MP said that he later asked for advice from the Women's Aid charity before approaching the Standards watchdog. A House of Commons spokeswoman said: ""Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievances Scheme (ICGS) operates on the basis of absolute confidentiality. ""Therefore we cannot provide answers about any complaint that may or may not have been made."" Mr Thomson said dealing with the allegations had been ""nothing short of traumatic"" In February, Mr Thomson was publicly accused of gropinga man in the same Commons bar. The Tory MP also strongly denies any wrongdoing relating to that alleged incident. Mr Sweeney said he was finally speaking out in public more than a year after the alleged assault because the investigations had ""barely progressed"". A spokesman for the MP said: ""This assault, which took place last October, was reported to the appropriate authorities after similar but entirely separate allegations were made by other men against Ross Thomson in February. ""Thomson's denials today fly in the face of what was witnessed by other MPs and visitors and show him to be utterly unrepentant."" Mr Thomson had issued a statement on Twitter,externalon Sunday morning in which he strenuously denied Mr Sweeney's allegations, but insisted he would be a Tory candidate in the 12 December general election. However, he later confirmed he was standing down from the job he ""loved more than any other"". Mr Thomson, who has been an MP since 2017, said: ""I always believed politics was about noble pursuits and doing what you believed to be best for your country. ""My experience is that our politics is now so poisonous that we will never attract good, honest and decent people in the first place. ""This has been without doubt the hardest decision of my life. I remain confident that the ongoing parliamentary standards process will find in my favour, and that these baseless claims will be shown up for what they are. ""As I have already said I will continue to explore all options available to me in response to the defamatory and damaging allegations made by Mr Sweeney.""

And here you can listen to the man of the moment, Lewis Hamilton, discussing what it means to be a six-time world champion. Andrew BensonBBC Sportâs chief F1 writer in Austin Lewis Hamilton sealed hissixth world drivers' titlewith second place in the United States Grand Prix. The result means Hamilton becomes the second most successful F1 driver of all time - moving him to within one championship of all-time record-holder Michael Schumacher, whose tally of seven is now within his reach. Hamilton failed in a valiant attempt to win the race by trying a different strategy to Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas but that did not matter such was his points advantage. Hamilton held off Max Verstappen for second as Bottas stroked to victory. Hamilton had said before the race that he was not thinking of sealing the championship in Austin, Texas, only of winning the race, and he drove with the fierce competitive instinct that has defined his season and career.

"A Scottish Conservative MP has described allegations about his behaviour in a House of Commons bar as ""completely false"". Ross Thomson was said to have been spoken to by police on Tuesday night after a report of ""sexual touching"". In a statement released on Twitter, Mr Thomson said no complaint had been made to his party, the police or parliament. But he said he had now referred himself to the Conservative Party's disciplinary panel. The Aberdeen South MP said he had done so ""in the interests of openness and transparency"". His statement added: ""A series of serious allegations have been made against me that have featured in the media. ""I would like to state that these allegations from anonymous sources are completely false."" He said the past few days had been ""a very distressing time for me and my family"", but stressed that he intends to be ""back at work on Monday"". The Metropolitan Police said on Wednesday that its officers had been called ""to a bar within the Palace of Westminster following a report of sexual touching"". The statement added: ""Officers attended and spoke to the parties involved - three men in their 20s and 30s. However, no formal allegations were made to the officers and no arrests were made."" The BBC has been told 31-year-old Mr Thomson was escorted from the Strangers' Bar following the incident. Mr Thomson's alleged behaviour was described as being ""completely unacceptable"" by Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw on Thursday. Mr Carlaw added: ""Inquiries are ongoing. However, I know enough to say that the alleged behaviour is completely unacceptable and falls well below the standard I think any of us would expect of any elected representative. ""We may have more to say at a later time."" Following Mr Thomson's statement, a Scottish Conservative party spokesman said: ""The party's investigation process will now take this matter forward.""

"Air quality in Delhi has deteriorated into the ""hazardous"" category Air pollution in the north of India has ""reached unbearable levels,"" the capital Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal says. In many areas of Delhi air quality deteriorated into the ""hazardous"" category, with the potential to cause respiratory illnesses. Low visibility caused more than 30 flights to be diverted on Sunday. Rules have now gone into effect allowing only cars with odd or even number plates to drive on given days. The initiative is aimed at getting more vehicles off the road in an effort to curb air pollution. Only cars with odd or even number plates can drive on given days in a bid to reduce pollution Schools in Delhi have been ordered to close until Tuesday, and construction has been halted. Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain advised the city's residents to ""avoid outdoor physical activities, especially during morning and late evening hours"". How a food crisis led to Delhiâs foul smog The advisory also said people should wear anti-pollution masks, avoid polluted areas and keep doors and windows closed. A major factor behind the high pollution levels at this time of year is farmers in neighbouring states burning crop stubble to clear their fields. Police are wearing face masks to protect themselves from the toxic smog This creates a lethal cocktail of particulate matter, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide - all worsened by fireworks set off during the Hindu festival Diwali a week ago. Vehicle fumes, construction and industrial emissions have also contributed to the smog. Indians are hoping that scattered rainfall over the coming week will wash away the pollutants but this is not due until Thursday. How bad is the smog? Levels of dangerous particles in the air - known as PM2.5 - are far higher than recommended and about seven times higher than in the Chinese capital Beijing. An Indian health ministry official said the city's pollution monitors did not have enough digits to accurately record pollution levels, which he called a ""disaster"". Allow Twitter content?

Five million masks were handed out in schoolson Friday as officials declared a public health emergency and Mr Kejriwal likened the city to a ""gas chamber"". The World Health Organization (WHO) says a third of deaths from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease are due to air pollution. ""This is having an equivalent effect to that of smoking tobacco,"" the WHO says on its website. This video can not be played Residents donned high-grade masks under a blanket of polluted smog Mr Kejriwal's most recent comments are unlikely to please government officials, reports the BBC's South Asia regional editor Jill McGivering. She said Indian politicians were blaming each other for the conditions. On Sunday young people in Delhi came out to protest and demand action. ""You can obviously see how terrible it is and it's actually scary you can't see things in front of you,"" said Jaivipra. Angry protesters compared the pollution to India's sluggish economy She said she wanted long-term and sustainable anti-pollution measures put in place. ""We are concerned about our futures and about our health but we are also fighting this on behalf of the children and the elderly who bear the biggest brunt of the problem here,"" she said. Some ministers have sparked controversy on social media by suggesting light-hearted measures to stay healthy. Harsh Vardhan, the union minister for health and family welfare, urged people to eat carrots to protect against ""night blindness"" and ""other pollution-related harm to health"".

"Keene Street was a mass of smoke and explosions during Bonfire Night last year A street that had fireworks set off down the middle of it last Bonfire Night will be policed more heavily this year. The incident on Keene Street, in Newport, prompted multiple calls to Gwent Police on the night, with the behaviour dubbed ""pure malevolence"". One local councillor said the actions had been the worst he had ever seen. At a public meeting before the 2019 celebrations, community leaders called for preventative action. Lliswerry councillor Allan Morris said: ""We had a public meeting a few weeks ago and the police have promised us that they will be increasing the number of patrols and presence within the area. ""What happened last year was an absolute disgrace. It went well beyond fun. It was pure malevolence. ""It was intended to cause fear and terror."" Firefighter injured in firework attack by teens Survey finds support for tougher fireworks controls Ministers to announce crackdown on fireworks The incident was filmed and posted on social media. Mr Morris, who worked as a fire officer for 30 years, said he had witnessed similar behaviour during his years in the service. ""Parents should have a word with their kids before they go out for the night,"" he said. ""There were a lot of frightened people out there last year."" Insp Martin Cawley, who attended the Lliswerry meeting, said ""dedicated staff"" would patrol ""hotspot locations"". ""This would include the Keene Street area due to the problems there last year,"" Insp Cawley said. Parties and discos had been organised to discourage youths from anti-social behaviour.

"The Caernarfon Show has been taking place since the late 19th Century More volunteers are needed to protect the future of small farm shows across the country, a chairman of one meeting has claimed. Shows such as the North Wales Show in Caernarfon are struggling, with a 30-strong team of volunteers down to just six in recent years. Since the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001, five shows in Gwynedd have either folded or merged. This year's show was cancelled over equine flu fears. How will Brexit affect the Welsh food industry? Football club joins badger bovine TB pilot The Caernarfon show's chairman, Peter Rutherford, said it was getting ""tougher"" each year. ""The committee is very concerned that there's a lack of a new generation of young people to come forward and take over our different roles within the committee,"" he said. ""It's not just our show - there's many shows throughout Britain that are facing the same issues. ""As we get older we want to retire, some of us have been at it a very long time and it's very difficult to get replacement people to join the committee and run these particular sections, and it's very important for the farming calendar that the shows maintain their momentum."" Peter Rutherford says more young farmers are needed to help keep the shows running Shows in Pontllyfni, Pwllheli, Eifionydd, Criccieth and Trefor have all folded or merged since 2001, leaving the Caernarfon show and one in Nefyn on the Llyn Peninsula. Mr Rutherford said some farmers preferred to travel to larger agricultural gatherings, and tight regulations - such as isolating cattle from the rest of their herd for a week after the meeting - can put people off. ""Possibly we need to have better communication with the young people, it's something that we'll be looking at to see if we can improve that,"" he said. ""But it would be very nice if people could come to us as well and embrace them and hopefully we will take it forward.""

"British nationals are among 33 people injured after a bus travelling from Paris to London overturned in northern France. Four people were seriously injured and 29 others wounded when the FlixBus coach toppled at an exit near Amiens on the A1 motorway on Sunday morning. Northern Ireland couple Jamie Kerr and Gemma Given, both 20, were treated in hospital for head and hand injuries. Eight other Britons were on board, alongside passengers from nine nations. Police had previously said there were 11 people from the UK on the coach. The Foreign Office said three Britons remained in hospital. Jamie's father John Kerr told BBC News: ""It was a pretty traumatic end to a Halloween weekend."" His son, a student at Glasgow University, had called on Sunday morning to say he and his girlfriend, Ms Given, were involved in the crash, which took place at around 11:00 GMT, but were not badly injured. It is understood Ms Given, a student at Brighton University, had her bag taken for examination by police because a passenger who was seriously injured had been lying on it. ""That brought home to me how close they were to being seriously injured,"" said John Kerr. He said the couple were offered a bus back to the UK but said they would make their own way home. ""I feel a bit more could have been done for them,"" he said. ""They'll learn a lot from all of this but I'm expecting an emotional response when they get home and it all hits them."" The Foreign Office said it was in contact with French authorities. ""We will do all we can to assist any British people who need our help,"" a spokeswoman said. Police, fire and ambulance services attended the scene The British embassy in France confirmed British nationals were involved in the incident. The coach was also carrying 11 people from France, five from the US, two from Romania, and one each from Spain, Australia, Mauritius, Japan and Sri Lanka. They were taken to local hospitals. Local police tweeted they had sent all state services to the scene, while firefighters urged motorists to avoid the area. In a statement, FlixBus said there were 32 passengers and one bus driver on board. A spokesman said: ""FlixBus is in close contact with the relevant authorities in order to determine the exact cause of the accident and to ensure all passengers receive appropriate support. ""An emergency phone number is available for the passengers and their relatives."" Those concerned about loved ones are asked to call 0080030013730.

"Kurdish militias fought Turkish and Turkish-backed rebels in north-east Syria last month Turkish-backed forces fighting Kurdish militias in north-east Syria have been accused of committing war crimes, with acts of brutality surfacing on mobile phone footage. The UN has warned that Turkey could be held responsible for the actions of its allies, while Turkey has promised to investigate. Bearded men shout ""Allahu Akbar [God is the Greatest]"". One captures the scene on his smartphone and says: ""We are mujahedeen [holy warriors] from Faylaq Al-Majd [Glory Corps] battalion."" In the background are the corpses of Kurdish fighters. Further away, a group of men plant their feet on a woman's bloodied body. One says she is a ""whore"". The gruesome footage is much like that produced by the ultra-violent Islamic State (IS) group. Yet the men in this video are not IS militants, but rather fighters for a rebel alliance known as the Syrian National Army, trained, equipped and paid for by a Nato member, Turkey. They are under the command of the Turkish army. The video was filmed on 21 October in northern Syria. The woman beneath the fighters' feet is Amara Renas, a member of an all-woman unit of Kurdish fighters, the YPJ, a force that played a significant role in defeating IS in Syria. Amara Renas' body was seen being desecrated in a video Amara was killed in the recent Turkish assaults against Kurdish forces in Syria. Syrian Kurds: 'The world has closed its eyes on us' Turkey v Syria's Kurds: The short, medium and long story Which countries export arms to Turkey? On 9 October the Turkish army and pro-Turkish Syrian rebels attacked the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), shortly after Donald Trump announced the US would pull troops out of Syria. SDF fighters had been a highly effective and trusted ally of the US-led coalition and led the defeat of IS on the ground. The group says it also provided intelligence that led to the killing last week of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Days after Turkey's attacks, numerous videos alleged to have been filmed by pro-Turkey rebels emerged on social media. In one, an unidentified fighter shouts in Arabic: ""We have come to behead you infidels and apostates!"" In another video, a masked rebel clad in black carries a terrified woman surrounded by other rebels - one films her, one shouts ""pig"", another says: ""Take her to be beheaded."" This video can not be played ""We were by the gate when a shell hit"" The captured woman is Cicek Kobane, another YPJ fighter. The widely-circulated video provoked outrage on social media. A few days after it was published, Turkish state TV showed Cicek Kobane being treated in a hospital in Turkey. US officials have said that some of the actions in these videos probably constitute war crimes. ""Many people fled because they're very concerned about these Turkish-supported Syrian opposition forces,"" James Jeffrey, US special envoy for Syria, told Congress. ""We'd say that Turkey-supported Syrian opposition forces who were under general Turkish command, at least in one instance did carry out war crimes."" Turkey has long been accused of taking little action against jihadists in Syria. ""I ran the ISIS [Islamic State group] campaign - 40,000 foreign fighters, jihadists from 110 countries around the world, all came into Syria to fight in that war and they all came through Turkey,"" Brett McGurk, former US President Special Envoy in the coalition against IS, told CNN last month. He said he tried to persuade Turkey to seal its border against IS. ""They said they couldn't do it,"" he said, ""but the minute the Kurds took parts of the border, it's totally sealed with a wall."" US officials say they have demanded an explanation from Turkey for alleged war crimes by the rebels. Ibrahim Kalin, the Turkish president's spokesman, said Turkey will investigate any suspected war crimes. But many Kurdish activists have no faith in the Turkish government or army. ""There is strong evidence that over the past four decades, Turkish military and security forces have systematically committed war crimes and violated human rights in their conflict with the PKK (The Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades),"" says Kamran Matin, Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Sussex University. In the past decade, numerous disturbing images and videos allegedly filmed by the Turkish army and security forces document the killing of captured Kurdish dissidents in Turkey. In one video published a few years ago, suspected Turkish soldiers behead dead PKK militants. In another video, two female PKK fighters with their hands tied behind their backs are seated on a mountain cliff, when what are apparently Turkish soldiers with automatic machine guns shoot them at close range and kick them over the edge. This video can not be played The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict In October 2015, a widely-shared video showed Turkish security forces dragging the body of 24-year-old actor Haci Lokman Birlik through the streets in Sirnak, a Kurdish town in south-east Turkey, with a rope around his neck. Part of the video appeared to have been filmed from inside the police vehicle. Turkish officials claimed his corpse might have been booby-trapped. Kurdish human rights activists have accused the US and the EU of failing to condemn Turkey or take any effective punitive action. ""The EU turned a blind eye to Turkey's human rights violations, because of Turkey's Nato membership, economic ties and the fear of a backlash among millions of Turks living in European countries, Germany in particular,"" says Kamran Matin. After the Syrian civil war began, a new factor ""constrained European countries' reaction to Turkey's gross violation of human rights,"" he says - ""Syrian refugees. [Turkish] President Erdogan repeatedly threatened flooding Europe with them."" This, it seems, is something European countries want to avoid, whatever the cost.

"As Russia enters its 20th year under the authoritarian leadership of Vladimir Putin, St Petersburg's vegan anarchist community thrives. Hated by the far right and out of tune with Russia's prevailing nationalist mood, the activists have created a version of what their ideal society would look like - and they're promoting this vision with delicious food. Could they be changing attitudes among other young Russians? Once a month, the eight people who work at the Horizontal takeaway hold a meeting in which they air any grievances, discuss updates to the menu, and vote on any changes they may want to make. The front of their restaurant, a hole-in-the-wall that serves vegan burgers, hot dogs and nuggets to go, is covered with stickers promoting anti-fascism, anarchism, and other vegan outlets in the city. Their meal deal offer, something commonly called a ""business lunch"" in Russia, is called ""the anti-business lunch"". Lately, the group has been discussing whether or not to change location - the complex they're currently based in holds shows featuring captive animals, which they believe are cruel and exploitative. Although some of them have been working there for longer than others, all eight members of the team have an equal say within the business. There are no managers and no hierarchies. Varya, 26, has been at the restaurant the longest. Varya, from Horizontal, says the restaurant is based on social justice and equality ""That's why we're called Horizontal - because every person who joins our restaurant is on the same level, and has the same rights and an equal position with all of the others,"" she says. The restaurant adheres to the principles of anti-racism, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, the abolition of borders, and animal liberation. In a country where people who are gender non-confirming or trans are shunned, and even sometimes attacked, Horizontal is a space where anyone's preferred pronouns will be respected. The group is planning to compose a manifesto of sorts stating what its values are, to make sure any new starters are on the same page. ""For us, it's important that people who join us hold similar ideology, that they share our views, and that they understand what 'veganism' really means to us,"" Varya says. Horizontal is one of about a dozen similar spaces across St Petersburg, promoting vegan anarchism - ""veganarchism"" - by cooking up delicious vegan food. The term ""veganarchist"" was coined by the New York-based anarchist Brian Dominick in his 1997 essay, Animal Liberation and Social Revolution. In it, he writes that veganism is inherently intertwined with anti-fascism, human rights activism and anti-capitalism. The animal slaughter that vegans and vegetarians are consciously opting out of, he says, relies on systematic exploitation of both humans and animals - and that only by fighting all injustices together can a vegan truly fight against any of them. This fight, he suggests, can be waged through individual actions and radical lifestyle changes. ""The role of the revolutionist is simple,"" Dominick writes. ""Make your life into a miniature model of the alternative, revolutionary society you envision. You are a microcosm of the world around you, and even the most basic among your actions affect the social context of which you are a part. Make those effects positive and radical in their nature."" Horizontal's ""chick-un"" nuggets are made of a mix of tofu and seitan But although the word ""veganarchism"" came from the US in the late 20th Century, both anarchism and meat-free diets have a long history in Russia. The Russian Orthodox church prescribes a plant-based diet during Lent, and most traditional restaurants still offer a plant-based ""Lenten menu"". Ethical vegetarianism, meanwhile, was thriving in pre-revolutionary Russia - partly because of the example set by the novelist Leo Tolstoy in the late 19th Century. But for much of the Soviet period vegetarianism fell out of favour, seen as a bourgeois indulgence. The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia went as far as to proclaim that ""vegetarianism, which is based on false hypotheses and ideas, does not have followers in the Soviet Union"". Today, only 1% of Russians say they are vegetarian,according to a Vtsiom poll from 2018,external- roughlythe proportion of British people who are vegan,external. As for anarchism, the 19th Century Russian philosophers Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin are considered two of the most influential thinkers in anarchist history. Kropotkin's radical 1892 text, The Conquest of Bread, continues to influence anarchists around the world to this day. In it, he says - among other things - that one of the first steps in any anarchist revolution would be for the people to seize food and the means of producing it. ""We have the temerity to declare that all have a right to bread, that there is bread enough for all, and that with this watchword of 'Bread for All' the revolution will triumph."" Visitors to Llamas vegan grocery shop are greeted with a painting of a cow holding up two middle fingers. Inside, rainbow-flag tote bags, feminist stickers and vegan condoms are sold alongside plant-based Napoleon cakes and reusable straws. In the freezer, there arevarenykyandpel'menidumplings made by She's Got A Knife, a ""feminist horizontalist culinary project"". In a back room, there's an unassuming hole-in-the-wall restaurant called Tempeh Time. It's dedicated to serving dishes made with tempeh - pronounced ""tem-pay"" - a protein made from fermented soya beans. The tongue-in-cheek artwork is one of the first things visitors see Llamas was opened last year by Anya, 30, and Igor, 33 - whom Anya describes affectionately as her ""husband and best friend"". When I speak to them, they're about to celebrate the shop's first anniversary. Igor tells me that with veganism growing more popular in the city, they wanted to try and emulate similar spaces in cities like Berlin. At the time they hadn't been there, but they knew it was Europe's vegan activist capital. ""People come here for that feeling of Europe, of freedom, to feel for a couple of minutes like they're in Berlin or somewhere,"" he says. ""We're trying to create a space where vegans won't feel ashamed to come with their non-vegan friends, and they can say, 'That's a vegan place - it's not strange, it's not scary.'"" ""We didn't just want Llamas to be a shop, but also a cafe and a meeting point for our community,"" Anya adds. ""We also had the idea to open a barbershop nearby, but that's still just an idea."" Anya, front-left, and Igor just behind her, are joined at the shop by Iiuri, front-right, and the kitchen's previous resident Danya, behind him Opening up their back room to vegan chefs was a big part of building this community space and putting their beliefs into practice, Anya says. The kitchen's first occupant was Danya, a friend of Anya and Igor's, who ran a pizzeria called Daner Pizza. When he moved out into a larger space, Iiuri Shilov, a tempeh maker, moved in. He had a soft launch of his restaurant Tempeh Time in early August, before officially opening on 7 September. I order a large bowl of fried rice, tempeh and fresh cucumber for 180 rubles - Â£2.26. The other options on the menu, including sandwiches and soups, all hover around the 200 ruble mark. Iiuri explains that he wants to keep prices low in order to make vegan food - in particular, tempeh - accessible to as many people as possible. ""My mission is for more and more people to try tempeh,"" he says, beaming. Iiuri first ate it two years ago while he and his wife were travelling across south-east Asia for their honeymoon. It was in Indonesia that he ordered a tempeh dish and, he says, it blew his mind. It had a flavour that was both mushroom-like and nutty, with a firm texture a bit like chicken. When fried in oil, with a small sprinkling of sea salt, the flavour was like nothing else he'd ever eaten. It rapidly became an obsession. Every day, after surfing, he would go back to the same cafe and order exactly the same dish that he had eaten that first time, and that I had coincidentally just ordered for myself: fried rice, tempeh and cucumber. Iiuri first discovered tempeh while on his honeymoon in Indonesia But when the honeymoon was over and the newlyweds were back home, Iiuri couldn't find his new favourite food anywhere. ""When we came back to Russia, I wanted to eat tempeh. I kept looking around for a tempeh shop, or maybe even a tempeh cafe, but I couldn't find anything,"" Iiuri says. So he decided to make it himself. ""I looked online and found an American book on tempeh production. It was old - a man called William Shurtleff had written it in the 1970s - but it was perfect,"" he says. ""After reading through the book, I ordered the starter [an ingredient for fermenting] all the way from Indonesia, made my own incubator at home, and bought enough soya beans to make about five or six packs of tempeh. At first I just made tempeh for myself and my friends. Then, once I figured out how to make bigger batches, I started selling to places like this,"" he says, gesturing to the grocery shop, Llamas, in which we are sitting. He cooks me the same dish he had while he was in Indonesia - fried rice, tempeh, and slices of fresh cucumber Before long he was making about 10kg of tempeh per batch, with a hands-on process that would have him up in the early hours of the morning. ""My wife started getting fed upâ¦ At this point we had a three-month-old son. Imagine: my baby is crying, my wife is getting annoyed, and I'm there making tempeh at 2am."" Eventually his wife lost patience. ""Iiura, go and find a proper kitchen,"" she told him. This turned out to be great advice, because once he did - it was a room lent to him by a friend of Danya the pizza-maker - he was able to make more tempeh than ever. Outside Indonesia, tempeh is far less common than other vegan proteins, such as tofu and seitan, a meat substitute made from wheat gluten. Personally, I had never been a fan - but Iiuri's tempeh was delicious, unlike anything I'd ever tried before. He doesn't add any special sauces to the tempeh, he just fries it with oil and a bit of salt... Before serving it with rice and cucumber, garnished with spring onions Iiuri tells me he went vegan six years ago, when he was working in the kitchen of a bar. He made himself a fried-egg sandwich, and a colleague asked him, ""Iiuri, why do you eat eggs?"" before using some choice words about the meat, dairy and egg industries. Intrigued, Iiuri watched an Austrian documentary about veganism. ""It was super-disgusting,"" he says. ""What I saw... it made my soul hurt. I felt so bad about all the time I had spent eating meat and eggs, and drinking milk."" Now, he tries to spread a positive message about veganism through his cooking. ""Food can be its own form of activism,"" Iiuri tells me. ""I have customers who eat meat, but after trying tempeh they enjoy it just as much. Many of my friends have tried tempeh and liked it too - I have one friend who's non-vegetarian, but after eating tempeh he's realised that he doesn't really need meat. ""Now, he has at least one meat-free day a week. This is action."" While Iiuri provides simple, hearty vegan food at low prices, another young vegan chef, 25-year-old Viktoria Mosina, is applying her vegan beliefs to haute-cuisine at her restaurant, Grun, and making vegan versions of traditional Georgian food at a nearby cafe, Dze Bistro. When we meet, Viktoria has just been shortlisted for a St Petersburg culinary award - the only woman in the Best Chef category, and the only vegan among the 31 contenders. For Dze Bistro, she devised a menu of plant-based Adzharuli - a type of Georgian bread, usually filled with meat. Viktoria's versions, however, are made with plant-based ingredients - aubergine and pomegranate, for example, which are traditional in Georgian cooking. A pomegranate and aubergine adzharuli from Dze Bistro, which serves vegan Georgian food As well as going into the forest, Viktoria grows her own herbs and vegetables in an allotment attached to the side of the restaurant As we speak, she shows me two deconstructed versions of traditional Russian soups from the Grun menu - one nettle soup and onesvekol'nik, a type of beetroot soup. ""I started to cook when I was 16, and ever since then my focus has been on promoting veganism and making it popular,"" she says. ""After a while I started to realise I could try to change the world through food - and now I've learned to cook food from plants that is so good, people won't have any need for meat."" There were so few vegan eateries in St Petersburg when she first started cooking that there was nowhere for her to learn about the restaurant business. So  she started her career in non-vegan kitchens, cooking only their vegan options - although she insisted that they weren't marked as vegan as on the menu. Viktoria and her colleague pour vegan svekol'nik, left, and nettle soup, right, into bowls ""In Russia, if a person knows that something is vegan, they'll refuse it on principle because they have stereotypes in their mind,"" she explains. When she then told her non-vegan customers what they had just eaten, they would often be surprised to learn that it hadn't been made with meat or dairy. ""At that moment, all those stereotypes would fall away. Because of my efforts and my mainstream popularity, vegans are not seen as grass-eaters or cultists as much as they used to be,"" she says. Viktoria's focus is on using fresh, seasonal plant ingredients that she either grows in a wall-mounted allotment attached to the restaurant, or that she picks herself in the wild. Once a week she goes to the forest with her kitchen team, sees which plants she can find, and researches them in botanical textbooks to figure out the best way to cook with them. When she returns to the city she spends about a day or two developing new recipes, and by the following week they are on the menu. ""It's possible to change the world one person at a time. That's the form my activism takes - to change individuals,"" she says. Viktoria focuses on fresh, wild ingredients at Grun, which opened this February Sonia, 26, feels the same way. She runs a cake business called Run Rabbit Run, which she founded just over three years ago with another vegan baker called Slava, 31. After a while they parted ways amicably, and he opened his own cafe. As well as running the bakery, Sonia is also making a name for herself as a feminist YouTuber, vlogging with friends on a channel calledFeministki Poyasnyayut- ""Feminists Explain"" - in which they clarify ""things about feminism for ordinary people"". She has also collaborated in cooking tutorials with the popular vegan YouTuber, Mikhail Vegan. The best way to get a message across, she says, is to ""lead by example"" - something she tries to do with Run Rabbit Run. ""If you're an ethical vegan and you're healthy, you're OK and you're not dying - you're just as normal as anyone else but you're vegan - in my experience that really is the best form of activism!"" Sonia is one half of a feminist YouTube duo, called ""Feminists Explain"" The cakes at Run Rabbit Run, she says, are supposed to be a delicious indulgence Sonia shows me a few of her cakes, and explains why customers won't find unrefined sugar or superfoods in her recipes. ""Some people think being vegan is somehow automatically healthier,"" she says. ""I don't think so. I think it can be really healthy if you want it to be, but I don't think cakesshould behealthy. I think they are something you should indulge in and enjoy. They are sugary, they're fatty, they have a lot of carbohydrates - they're not healthy at all."" Meanwhile, the cafe started earlier this year by Slava, Sonia's former business partner, is thriving too. He tells me he's inspired by Scandinavian culture, which is why he decided to name it Fika, the Swedish word for their afternoon tea. Slava, holding a matcha-flavoured ice cream, was inspired by Scandinavian culture when he opened Fika Before we talk, he brings out a cherry pie and a matcha latte ""I really liked the concept of a salad bar, deli and bakery with a cafe - I've seen similar things in Scandinavia and Finland,"" he says. He used to have a cafe near the Fontanka river, but it was small space, and the food was so popular that there were almost always long queues. In his new location - which is less central, but more spacious - it is much easier to get served. When St Petersburg's vegans say their philosophy is about more than food, it's not just empty words. A week before I met them, Anya and Igor from Llamas had taken part in an annual festival in the city calledZnak Ravenstva- meaning Equal Sign. It promotes not only veganism, but also feminism, anti-racism, LGBTQ+ rights and environmentalism, and tries to show how all of these movements are connected - as Brian Dominick himself believed. As well as food stalls, there are lectures, workshops on blogging and zero-waste living, and bands performing live. One of the festival's six co-organisers, Kostya, 24, tells me that Znak Ravenstva is now in its second year. Its predecessor, Vegan Fest, which focused more exclusively on veganism, ran for four years before the organisers decided to widen the scope. ""We're trying to say that everything is connected, and if you're vegan you have to also support all other movements for equality - so feminists, for example, are coming and learning about veganism, and vice-versa,"" Kostya says. But making this change hasn't been easy. Kostya is one of six co-organisers of Znak Ravenstva - ""Equal Sign"" ""Unfortunately, when we started including feminism and LGBT rights, the number of participants went down - because of prejudice."" He named a couple of restaurants that had pulled out of the festival because some staff members didn't want to openly support these causes. But the festival's popularity is growing nonetheless, he says. This year they had about 5,000 visitors. For Anya and Igor, events like Znak Ravenstva are vital both for helping to broaden their community, and for promoting equal rights in the city more widely. ""These four days of the festival felt even better than our last New Year holiday, because of the atmosphere, the feeling of freedom, the kindness, the toleranceâ¦ it was like a vision of our ideal Russia,"" Anya says. ""It is very hard for us as vegans to be open, but here we could come and see different projects, meet new people and make friends."" Igor agrees, and adds that because vegans don't get much support from outside the community, spaces where they can be themselves are really important. ""The fact that this festival even happens, it's quite strange in itself,"" he says. ""This vegan festival, promoting tolerance and equality, is against the main ideology of our society."" Anya, pictured with friends at Llamas, and her husband Igor say spaces like Znak Ravenstva are vital for their community On the other hand, St Petersburg has a long-established tradition of activism. This goes back to the Soviet era, and it's why Kostya says this may be the best city in Russia to be vegan - and to be an activist generally. It's also why he moved to St Petersburg from his hometown in Russia's far north. There's a feminist cafe called Simona, for example (named after Simone de Beauvoir) which made headlines in March when a group of pro-Kremlin men barged in armed with flowers for Women's Day. A confrontation ensued and one of the intruders ended up being pepper-sprayed. Elsewhere, there is a community centre called Open Space for activists to use, free of charge - a simple concept, but a rarity in many cities globally. Open Space's co-founder, Ilya, tells me that it is home to the city's only feminist library which, when I visit, is decorated with feminist anti-fascist posters and flyers calling for the release of political prisoners. It also regularly hosts events for independent electoral observers - a risky vocation in Russia - and marginalised groups, including the LGBT community, ""because it's unsafe to be openly gay here"". In total, he says, more than 80 independent activist groups have organised events at the space. But if Znak Ravenstva and Open Space are microcosms of the ideal Russia for the vegan anarchist community, the real Russia is sometimes very different. It's possible to be prosecuted for the type of activism that many of them support and sometimes engage in. Numerous Russian pride parades and LGBT youth groups have been shut down under the country's ""gay propaganda"" law, which bans the positive depiction of same-sex relationships in any media that can be consumed by children - including the internet. Recently, the authorities shut down two LGBT community groups on Russian-language social media. And while a growing number of young Russians seem ready to take to the streets to protest against the actions of local officials - against the exclusion of candidates in local elections, for example, against the destruction of a park, or the creation of a toxic dump close to a river - they may pay for it with arrest. But there is one case in particular that has hit home for the veganarchists in St Petersburg. In early November 2017, an anti-fascist vegan cafe owner called Arman Sagynbaev was arrested at his home in St Petersburg and charged with terrorism offences. He was one of about 10 activists from St Petersburg and the city of Penza, far away in the Volga region, accused by the authorities of being part of an ""anarchist terrorist group"" called ""the network"". Investigators accused them of trying to promote, through talks and meetings, ""further destabilisation of the political climate in the country"" during the presidential elections and the 2018 World Cup. The vegans I spoke to believe Sagynbaev is no terrorist, and that he was targeted because he was anti-fascist. Sagynbaev initially confessed to the charges against him, but withdrew this confession in September last year, alleging - in a lengthy and detailed statement - that the FSB had extracted it by means of torture. Two of his co-defendants have lodged complaints of torture with the European Court of Human Rights. Sagynbaev remains in custody, awaiting trial. Sagynbaev's arrest, Igor says, felt like a warning to the rest of the community. ""The political situation in Russia prohibits us from being free as vegan activists,"" he says. ""In Europe it's easier to be openly vegan and support equal rights, but Russian politics is the politics of xenophobia, of the absence of free speech."" Iiuri says Russia's political situation makes him want to leave the country When I ask Iiuri about politics, the smile quickly drains from his face. ""The political situation in Russia is worse than disgusting,"" he says. ""I hate our president, I hate our government. Policemen beat our guys, they break their legs."" Iiuri is referring to a graphic designer in recent pro-democracy demonstrations in Moscow, who had his leg broken by officers at a time when he wasn't even protesting, just jogging past City Hall. ""Last year, my wife and I went to a protest. She was pregnant - and the police came up to us and threatened to beat her,"" Iiuri continues, looking visibly shaken at the memory. He tells me that he and his wife are even thinking about moving to another country, such as Canada. ""I'm 31, and I've lived almost my entire life under the Putin regime. I don't want to live here any more."" But it's not just the authorities the vegan community worries about. Several of the people I speak to describe confrontations with far-right groups. These range from neo-Nazis sticking far-right stickers on their doors, to being violently attacked - including beatings and stabbings. In October 2017, a group of young, far-right activists went to a now-closed vegan anarchist restaurant called Animals and shot flares through the glass of the windows. Some staff were seriously injured. Animals, not pictured, was attacked by a far-right gang in 2017 Animals was run by the same group behind Horizontal, and was located just a few feet away. Like Horizontal it was an openly anarchist restaurant and a known meeting space for activists, says Horizontal worker Varya. ""It was the fash,"" she tells me, using a slang word for neo-fascists. ""We are politically active and we support different activist groups, we cover our walls with stickers, so they knew to target us. We all understand who was behind it, but no-one was fined or arrested."" Kostya tells me that he first became consciously anti-fascist at the age of 15, growing up in a village in the far-northern Yamalo Nenets district. It was a multicultural area - including members of the indigenous Nenets ethnic group - but there was also a strong far-right, Russian nationalist movement. This disturbed Kostya, who believed that everyone was equal. Even earlier, when Kostya was 10, he had been shocked by the murder of a 20-year-old rock musician and anti-racist activist, Timur Kacharava, who was stabbed to death by neo-Nazis outside a bookshop in St Petersburg. It stuck in his mind. ""We have a problem,"" he says. ""Unfortunately there has been no change in Russia for I don't know how long. A big part of the problem is our mass media, and the messages the government transmits through it. They say that the world is against us, they are homophobic and say that Europe is 'gay', for example."" He says many young people now ignore TV, and get their news online. Pollsters have noticed this trend, too - one recent poll foundalmost half of Russians aged 18-to-24 get their news from the largely uncensored internet,external. After a moment of pause, Kostya adds: ""I don't think Russians are bad people. They're just not educated, and are taught that the rest of the world is against us. From this fear grows a hatred of all difference."" So what does the future look like? Despite everything St Petersburg's vegan anarchists come up against, they remain hopeful about the years to come. ""I want an equal society, I'd like people to respect animals, to respect each other and to respect the planet - and I would like to see a border-free world, with no borders between the countries,"" Varya says. For many, a world without borders would be as unthinkable as a world without meat or cheese. But Varya is undaunted. ""I understand that, in reality, this will only be possible in several generations. But I just hope that we will bring up one generation, then another generation, and then another generation - then our descendants will finally be able to live in a much better society."" Igor and Anya agree. ""Russia has had a very difficult history,"" Igor says. ""But it's all about the mentality of the people - about whether we see the inertia of a generation, or the conscience of a generation. So if we at least manage to build a liberal state, in 10 years or so, we can have another country."" Kostya hopes that, eventually, society will change for the better Kostya adds that veganism in St Petersburg is growing so rapidly, there was even an animal rights section at the city's May Day parade this year. ""We had more people than United Russia,"" he laughs, referring to President Putin's political party. ""The ideal Russia, and the ideal world, for me would see us living in harmony and equality, living alongside people where we are all different but we are all equal. Where there's direct democracy - where the people vote for or against policies directly through referendums, rather than through representative governments. And of course where we're all environmentally aware,"" he says. ""A world with no state, no police, no borders, no nations - where people can decide for themselves what they want and what they want to achieve.""

"The freeze in benefit payments is to come to an end next year, the government has confirmed. Working-age benefits such as universal credit and jobseeker's allowance will rise by 1.7% from April 2020, the Department for Work and Pensions said. It ends former Tory chancellor George Osborne's decision to introduce a freeze from April 2016. Labour called it a ""cynically-timed"" announcement ahead of the general election on 12 December. BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said the move will be seen by some as an election pitch to poorer Leave-backing areas. Our correspondent added it follows a raft of other spending commitments made by Boris Johnson since he became prime minister, including funding for the NHS, schools and police. The benefits freeze - announced in the 2015 Budget - was intended to last until the end of the current financial year. Former chancellor Philip Hammond said in March that the freeze would end as planned and that the then administration had ""no intention of repeating the current freeze"". He added: ""When it is over, increases in benefits will resume in line with [the CPI rate of inflation] in the normal way."" Cuts 'have made renting unaffordable' Labour pledges to end in-work poverty Why the UK has a Â£100bn benefits bill What is universal credit? Rather than increasing each year in line with inflation - to reflect the rising cost of living - most working-age benefits and tax credits have been kept at the same value for more than four years, having last risen in April 2015. Groups such as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation have argued that this has been among the biggest factors in exacerbating poverty levels among working families with children. Other benefits that have been frozen but are now set to rise, by inflation, are: Employment and support allowance, income support, housing benefit, child tax credits, working tax credits and child benefit. Some of these are legacy benefits, which are being replaced by universal credit. The government also said the state pension - which has not been frozen because of the so-called triple lock - will increase by 3.9%. Disability benefits and carer's allowance, which have not been subject to the freeze, will also increase by 1.7% next year. The increase in benefits is expected to cost Â£5bn; ministers say the decision to end the freeze will help 10 million people. The benefit freeze has cut an average of Â£560 per year from the income of the country's poorest seven million families since 2016, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. That's more than Â£2,000 of lost income those families have had to cope with, and the end of the freeze next April doesn't reverse what amounts to a 6% cut in real terms in their income. And remember, some of those families have experienced earlier benefit cuts too, so they'll have been struggling even more. A few more quid each week will undoubtedly help, but next April's long-planned increase needs further context. Pensions will rise at more than double the rate than working age benefits will increase, despite more children living in poverty than older people. And restricting the benefits paid to families who have more than two children will also contribute to rising levels of child poverty, according to the Resolution Foundation. And for those who say, ""well they should just get a job"", bear in mind that in-work poverty is the fastest-rising category of poverty in the UK. Having a job is not a guarantee of not being poor. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said: ""We're clear the best way for people to improve their lives is through work, but we know some people require additional support. ""Our balanced fiscal approach has built a strong economy, with 3.6 million more people in work since 2010. And it's that strong economy which allows us to bolster the welfare safety net by increasing benefit payments for working-age claimants now."" Labour, which is promising to scrap universal credit in a revamp of the benefits system, pointed out the freeze would remain in place for a number of months yet. Adam Corlett, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focusing on people on lower incomes, described the announcement as a ""missed opportunity"" that would not increase living standards. ""The benefit freeze was always due to end next year. The government's confirmation that working-age benefits will only keep pace with rising prices means there will be no increase in living standards, and those in need of extra support will continue to be left behind,"" he said. ""With child poverty at risk of hitting record highs, this is a missed opportunity to provide a much-needed boost for low to middle income families."" The announcement comes as a committee of MPs warned thegovernment's policy of limiting welfare benefits to two childrenmust be scrapped because it forces families to stretch ""frozen and capped"" incomes to ""breaking point"". The Work and Pensions Select Committee said the government had not offered evidence to counter forecasts that the policy will ""significantly increase"" child poverty. The two-child limit means that in families where there are already two or more children, the child element in universal credit and tax credits - worth Â£2,780 per child per year - is restricted to the first two children. It applies to children born after 6 April 2017. As well as the two-child limit, there also remains a cap on the total amount of benefits one household can claim. The cap was lowered in 2016, further cutting the amount of benefits some people received. Meanwhile, the government has proposed that private car park operators are obliged to give drivers a 10-minute grace period after their tickets expire before issuing fines. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick said he wants a compulsory code of practice for the industry to ""restore common sense"" to the issuing of parking fines and ""crackdown on dodgy operators"" in England, Scotland and Wales.

"As Russia enters its 20th year under the authoritarian leadership of Vladimir Putin, St Petersburg's vegan anarchist community thrives. Hated by the far right and out of tune with Russia's prevailing nationalist mood, the activists have created a version of what their ideal society would look like - and they're promoting this vision with delicious food. Could they be changing attitudes among other young Russians? Once a month, the eight people who work at the Horizontal takeaway hold a meeting in which they air any grievances, discuss updates to the menu, and vote on any changes they may want to make. The front of their restaurant, a hole-in-the-wall that serves vegan burgers, hot dogs and nuggets to go, is covered with stickers promoting anti-fascism, anarchism, and other vegan outlets in the city. Their meal deal offer, something commonly called a ""business lunch"" in Russia, is called ""the anti-business lunch"". Lately, the group has been discussing whether or not to change location - the complex they're currently based in holds shows featuring captive animals, which they believe are cruel and exploitative. Although some of them have been working there for longer than others, all eight members of the team have an equal say within the business. There are no managers and no hierarchies. Varya, 26, has been at the restaurant the longest. Varya, from Horizontal, says the restaurant is based on social justice and equality ""That's why we're called Horizontal - because every person who joins our restaurant is on the same level, and has the same rights and an equal position with all of the others,"" she says. The restaurant adheres to the principles of anti-racism, feminism, LGBTQ+ rights, the abolition of borders, and animal liberation. In a country where people who are gender non-confirming or trans are shunned, and even sometimes attacked, Horizontal is a space where anyone's preferred pronouns will be respected. The group is planning to compose a manifesto of sorts stating what its values are, to make sure any new starters are on the same page. ""For us, it's important that people who join us hold similar ideology, that they share our views, and that they understand what 'veganism' really means to us,"" Varya says. Horizontal is one of about a dozen similar spaces across St Petersburg, promoting vegan anarchism - ""veganarchism"" - by cooking up delicious vegan food. The term ""veganarchist"" was coined by the New York-based anarchist Brian Dominick in his 1997 essay, Animal Liberation and Social Revolution. In it, he writes that veganism is inherently intertwined with anti-fascism, human rights activism and anti-capitalism. The animal slaughter that vegans and vegetarians are consciously opting out of, he says, relies on systematic exploitation of both humans and animals - and that only by fighting all injustices together can a vegan truly fight against any of them. This fight, he suggests, can be waged through individual actions and radical lifestyle changes. ""The role of the revolutionist is simple,"" Dominick writes. ""Make your life into a miniature model of the alternative, revolutionary society you envision. You are a microcosm of the world around you, and even the most basic among your actions affect the social context of which you are a part. Make those effects positive and radical in their nature."" Horizontal's ""chick-un"" nuggets are made of a mix of tofu and seitan But although the word ""veganarchism"" came from the US in the late 20th Century, both anarchism and meat-free diets have a long history in Russia. The Russian Orthodox church prescribes a plant-based diet during Lent, and most traditional restaurants still offer a plant-based ""Lenten menu"". Ethical vegetarianism, meanwhile, was thriving in pre-revolutionary Russia - partly because of the example set by the novelist Leo Tolstoy in the late 19th Century. But for much of the Soviet period vegetarianism fell out of favour, seen as a bourgeois indulgence. The Great Soviet Encyclopaedia went as far as to proclaim that ""vegetarianism, which is based on false hypotheses and ideas, does not have followers in the Soviet Union"". Today, only 1% of Russians say they are vegetarian,according to a Vtsiom poll from 2018,external- roughlythe proportion of British people who are vegan,external. As for anarchism, the 19th Century Russian philosophers Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin are considered two of the most influential thinkers in anarchist history. Kropotkin's radical 1892 text, The Conquest of Bread, continues to influence anarchists around the world to this day. In it, he says - among other things - that one of the first steps in any anarchist revolution would be for the people to seize food and the means of producing it. ""We have the temerity to declare that all have a right to bread, that there is bread enough for all, and that with this watchword of 'Bread for All' the revolution will triumph."" Visitors to Llamas vegan grocery shop are greeted with a painting of a cow holding up two middle fingers. Inside, rainbow-flag tote bags, feminist stickers and vegan condoms are sold alongside plant-based Napoleon cakes and reusable straws. In the freezer, there arevarenykyandpel'menidumplings made by She's Got A Knife, a ""feminist horizontalist culinary project"". In a back room, there's an unassuming hole-in-the-wall restaurant called Tempeh Time. It's dedicated to serving dishes made with tempeh - pronounced ""tem-pay"" - a protein made from fermented soya beans. The tongue-in-cheek artwork is one of the first things visitors see Llamas was opened last year by Anya, 30, and Igor, 33 - whom Anya describes affectionately as her ""husband and best friend"". When I speak to them, they're about to celebrate the shop's first anniversary. Igor tells me that with veganism growing more popular in the city, they wanted to try and emulate similar spaces in cities like Berlin. At the time they hadn't been there, but they knew it was Europe's vegan activist capital. ""People come here for that feeling of Europe, of freedom, to feel for a couple of minutes like they're in Berlin or somewhere,"" he says. ""We're trying to create a space where vegans won't feel ashamed to come with their non-vegan friends, and they can say, 'That's a vegan place - it's not strange, it's not scary.'"" ""We didn't just want Llamas to be a shop, but also a cafe and a meeting point for our community,"" Anya adds. ""We also had the idea to open a barbershop nearby, but that's still just an idea."" Anya, front-left, and Igor just behind her, are joined at the shop by Iiuri, front-right, and the kitchen's previous resident Danya, behind him Opening up their back room to vegan chefs was a big part of building this community space and putting their beliefs into practice, Anya says. The kitchen's first occupant was Danya, a friend of Anya and Igor's, who ran a pizzeria called Daner Pizza. When he moved out into a larger space, Iiuri Shilov, a tempeh maker, moved in. He had a soft launch of his restaurant Tempeh Time in early August, before officially opening on 7 September. I order a large bowl of fried rice, tempeh and fresh cucumber for 180 rubles - Â£2.26. The other options on the menu, including sandwiches and soups, all hover around the 200 ruble mark. Iiuri explains that he wants to keep prices low in order to make vegan food - in particular, tempeh - accessible to as many people as possible. ""My mission is for more and more people to try tempeh,"" he says, beaming. Iiuri first ate it two years ago while he and his wife were travelling across south-east Asia for their honeymoon. It was in Indonesia that he ordered a tempeh dish and, he says, it blew his mind. It had a flavour that was both mushroom-like and nutty, with a firm texture a bit like chicken. When fried in oil, with a small sprinkling of sea salt, the flavour was like nothing else he'd ever eaten. It rapidly became an obsession. Every day, after surfing, he would go back to the same cafe and order exactly the same dish that he had eaten that first time, and that I had coincidentally just ordered for myself: fried rice, tempeh and cucumber. Iiuri first discovered tempeh while on his honeymoon in Indonesia But when the honeymoon was over and the newlyweds were back home, Iiuri couldn't find his new favourite food anywhere. ""When we came back to Russia, I wanted to eat tempeh. I kept looking around for a tempeh shop, or maybe even a tempeh cafe, but I couldn't find anything,"" Iiuri says. So he decided to make it himself. ""I looked online and found an American book on tempeh production. It was old - a man called William Shurtleff had written it in the 1970s - but it was perfect,"" he says. ""After reading through the book, I ordered the starter [an ingredient for fermenting] all the way from Indonesia, made my own incubator at home, and bought enough soya beans to make about five or six packs of tempeh. At first I just made tempeh for myself and my friends. Then, once I figured out how to make bigger batches, I started selling to places like this,"" he says, gesturing to the grocery shop, Llamas, in which we are sitting. He cooks me the same dish he had while he was in Indonesia - fried rice, tempeh, and slices of fresh cucumber Before long he was making about 10kg of tempeh per batch, with a hands-on process that would have him up in the early hours of the morning. ""My wife started getting fed upâ¦ At this point we had a three-month-old son. Imagine: my baby is crying, my wife is getting annoyed, and I'm there making tempeh at 2am."" Eventually his wife lost patience. ""Iiura, go and find a proper kitchen,"" she told him. This turned out to be great advice, because once he did - it was a room lent to him by a friend of Danya the pizza-maker - he was able to make more tempeh than ever. Outside Indonesia, tempeh is far less common than other vegan proteins, such as tofu and seitan, a meat substitute made from wheat gluten. Personally, I had never been a fan - but Iiuri's tempeh was delicious, unlike anything I'd ever tried before. He doesn't add any special sauces to the tempeh, he just fries it with oil and a bit of salt... Before serving it with rice and cucumber, garnished with spring onions Iiuri tells me he went vegan six years ago, when he was working in the kitchen of a bar. He made himself a fried-egg sandwich, and a colleague asked him, ""Iiuri, why do you eat eggs?"" before using some choice words about the meat, dairy and egg industries. Intrigued, Iiuri watched an Austrian documentary about veganism. ""It was super-disgusting,"" he says. ""What I saw... it made my soul hurt. I felt so bad about all the time I had spent eating meat and eggs, and drinking milk."" Now, he tries to spread a positive message about veganism through his cooking. ""Food can be its own form of activism,"" Iiuri tells me. ""I have customers who eat meat, but after trying tempeh they enjoy it just as much. Many of my friends have tried tempeh and liked it too - I have one friend who's non-vegetarian, but after eating tempeh he's realised that he doesn't really need meat. ""Now, he has at least one meat-free day a week. This is action."" While Iiuri provides simple, hearty vegan food at low prices, another young vegan chef, 25-year-old Viktoria Mosina, is applying her vegan beliefs to haute-cuisine at her restaurant, Grun, and making vegan versions of traditional Georgian food at a nearby cafe, Dze Bistro. When we meet, Viktoria has just been shortlisted for a St Petersburg culinary award - the only woman in the Best Chef category, and the only vegan among the 31 contenders. For Dze Bistro, she devised a menu of plant-based Adzharuli - a type of Georgian bread, usually filled with meat. Viktoria's versions, however, are made with plant-based ingredients - aubergine and pomegranate, for example, which are traditional in Georgian cooking. A pomegranate and aubergine adzharuli from Dze Bistro, which serves vegan Georgian food As well as going into the forest, Viktoria grows her own herbs and vegetables in an allotment attached to the side of the restaurant As we speak, she shows me two deconstructed versions of traditional Russian soups from the Grun menu - one nettle soup and onesvekol'nik, a type of beetroot soup. ""I started to cook when I was 16, and ever since then my focus has been on promoting veganism and making it popular,"" she says. ""After a while I started to realise I could try to change the world through food - and now I've learned to cook food from plants that is so good, people won't have any need for meat."" There were so few vegan eateries in St Petersburg when she first started cooking that there was nowhere for her to learn about the restaurant business. So  she started her career in non-vegan kitchens, cooking only their vegan options - although she insisted that they weren't marked as vegan as on the menu. Viktoria and her colleague pour vegan svekol'nik, left, and nettle soup, right, into bowls ""In Russia, if a person knows that something is vegan, they'll refuse it on principle because they have stereotypes in their mind,"" she explains. When she then told her non-vegan customers what they had just eaten, they would often be surprised to learn that it hadn't been made with meat or dairy. ""At that moment, all those stereotypes would fall away. Because of my efforts and my mainstream popularity, vegans are not seen as grass-eaters or cultists as much as they used to be,"" she says. Viktoria's focus is on using fresh, seasonal plant ingredients that she either grows in a wall-mounted allotment attached to the restaurant, or that she picks herself in the wild. Once a week she goes to the forest with her kitchen team, sees which plants she can find, and researches them in botanical textbooks to figure out the best way to cook with them. When she returns to the city she spends about a day or two developing new recipes, and by the following week they are on the menu. ""It's possible to change the world one person at a time. That's the form my activism takes - to change individuals,"" she says. Viktoria focuses on fresh, wild ingredients at Grun, which opened this February Sonia, 26, feels the same way. She runs a cake business called Run Rabbit Run, which she founded just over three years ago with another vegan baker called Slava, 31. After a while they parted ways amicably, and he opened his own cafe. As well as running the bakery, Sonia is also making a name for herself as a feminist YouTuber, vlogging with friends on a channel calledFeministki Poyasnyayut- ""Feminists Explain"" - in which they clarify ""things about feminism for ordinary people"". She has also collaborated in cooking tutorials with the popular vegan YouTuber, Mikhail Vegan. The best way to get a message across, she says, is to ""lead by example"" - something she tries to do with Run Rabbit Run. ""If you're an ethical vegan and you're healthy, you're OK and you're not dying - you're just as normal as anyone else but you're vegan - in my experience that really is the best form of activism!"" Sonia is one half of a feminist YouTube duo, called ""Feminists Explain"" The cakes at Run Rabbit Run, she says, are supposed to be a delicious indulgence Sonia shows me a few of her cakes, and explains why customers won't find unrefined sugar or superfoods in her recipes. ""Some people think being vegan is somehow automatically healthier,"" she says. ""I don't think so. I think it can be really healthy if you want it to be, but I don't think cakesshould behealthy. I think they are something you should indulge in and enjoy. They are sugary, they're fatty, they have a lot of carbohydrates - they're not healthy at all."" Meanwhile, the cafe started earlier this year by Slava, Sonia's former business partner, is thriving too. He tells me he's inspired by Scandinavian culture, which is why he decided to name it Fika, the Swedish word for their afternoon tea. Slava, holding a matcha-flavoured ice cream, was inspired by Scandinavian culture when he opened Fika Before we talk, he brings out a cherry pie and a matcha latte ""I really liked the concept of a salad bar, deli and bakery with a cafe - I've seen similar things in Scandinavia and Finland,"" he says. He used to have a cafe near the Fontanka river, but it was small space, and the food was so popular that there were almost always long queues. In his new location - which is less central, but more spacious - it is much easier to get served. When St Petersburg's vegans say their philosophy is about more than food, it's not just empty words. A week before I met them, Anya and Igor from Llamas had taken part in an annual festival in the city calledZnak Ravenstva- meaning Equal Sign. It promotes not only veganism, but also feminism, anti-racism, LGBTQ+ rights and environmentalism, and tries to show how all of these movements are connected - as Brian Dominick himself believed. As well as food stalls, there are lectures, workshops on blogging and zero-waste living, and bands performing live. One of the festival's six co-organisers, Kostya, 24, tells me that Znak Ravenstva is now in its second year. Its predecessor, Vegan Fest, which focused more exclusively on veganism, ran for four years before the organisers decided to widen the scope. ""We're trying to say that everything is connected, and if you're vegan you have to also support all other movements for equality - so feminists, for example, are coming and learning about veganism, and vice-versa,"" Kostya says. But making this change hasn't been easy. Kostya is one of six co-organisers of Znak Ravenstva - ""Equal Sign"" ""Unfortunately, when we started including feminism and LGBT rights, the number of participants went down - because of prejudice."" He named a couple of restaurants that had pulled out of the festival because some staff members didn't want to openly support these causes. But the festival's popularity is growing nonetheless, he says. This year they had about 5,000 visitors. For Anya and Igor, events like Znak Ravenstva are vital both for helping to broaden their community, and for promoting equal rights in the city more widely. ""These four days of the festival felt even better than our last New Year holiday, because of the atmosphere, the feeling of freedom, the kindness, the toleranceâ¦ it was like a vision of our ideal Russia,"" Anya says. ""It is very hard for us as vegans to be open, but here we could come and see different projects, meet new people and make friends."" Igor agrees, and adds that because vegans don't get much support from outside the community, spaces where they can be themselves are really important. ""The fact that this festival even happens, it's quite strange in itself,"" he says. ""This vegan festival, promoting tolerance and equality, is against the main ideology of our society."" Anya, pictured with friends at Llamas, and her husband Igor say spaces like Znak Ravenstva are vital for their community On the other hand, St Petersburg has a long-established tradition of activism. This goes back to the Soviet era, and it's why Kostya says this may be the best city in Russia to be vegan - and to be an activist generally. It's also why he moved to St Petersburg from his hometown in Russia's far north. There's a feminist cafe called Simona, for example (named after Simone de Beauvoir) which made headlines in March when a group of pro-Kremlin men barged in armed with flowers for Women's Day. A confrontation ensued and one of the intruders ended up being pepper-sprayed. Elsewhere, there is a community centre called Open Space for activists to use, free of charge - a simple concept, but a rarity in many cities globally. Open Space's co-founder, Ilya, tells me that it is home to the city's only feminist library which, when I visit, is decorated with feminist anti-fascist posters and flyers calling for the release of political prisoners. It also regularly hosts events for independent electoral observers - a risky vocation in Russia - and marginalised groups, including the LGBT community, ""because it's unsafe to be openly gay here"". In total, he says, more than 80 independent activist groups have organised events at the space. But if Znak Ravenstva and Open Space are microcosms of the ideal Russia for the vegan anarchist community, the real Russia is sometimes very different. It's possible to be prosecuted for the type of activism that many of them support and sometimes engage in. Numerous Russian pride parades and LGBT youth groups have been shut down under the country's ""gay propaganda"" law, which bans the positive depiction of same-sex relationships in any media that can be consumed by children - including the internet. Recently, the authorities shut down two LGBT community groups on Russian-language social media. And while a growing number of young Russians seem ready to take to the streets to protest against the actions of local officials - against the exclusion of candidates in local elections, for example, against the destruction of a park, or the creation of a toxic dump close to a river - they may pay for it with arrest. But there is one case in particular that has hit home for the veganarchists in St Petersburg. In early November 2017, an anti-fascist vegan cafe owner called Arman Sagynbaev was arrested at his home in St Petersburg and charged with terrorism offences. He was one of about 10 activists from St Petersburg and the city of Penza, far away in the Volga region, accused by the authorities of being part of an ""anarchist terrorist group"" called ""the network"". Investigators accused them of trying to promote, through talks and meetings, ""further destabilisation of the political climate in the country"" during the presidential elections and the 2018 World Cup. The vegans I spoke to believe Sagynbaev is no terrorist, and that he was targeted because he was anti-fascist. Sagynbaev initially confessed to the charges against him, but withdrew this confession in September last year, alleging - in a lengthy and detailed statement - that the FSB had extracted it by means of torture. Two of his co-defendants have lodged complaints of torture with the European Court of Human Rights. Sagynbaev remains in custody, awaiting trial. Sagynbaev's arrest, Igor says, felt like a warning to the rest of the community. ""The political situation in Russia prohibits us from being free as vegan activists,"" he says. ""In Europe it's easier to be openly vegan and support equal rights, but Russian politics is the politics of xenophobia, of the absence of free speech."" Iiuri says Russia's political situation makes him want to leave the country When I ask Iiuri about politics, the smile quickly drains from his face. ""The political situation in Russia is worse than disgusting,"" he says. ""I hate our president, I hate our government. Policemen beat our guys, they break their legs."" Iiuri is referring to a graphic designer in recent pro-democracy demonstrations in Moscow, who had his leg broken by officers at a time when he wasn't even protesting, just jogging past City Hall. ""Last year, my wife and I went to a protest. She was pregnant - and the police came up to us and threatened to beat her,"" Iiuri continues, looking visibly shaken at the memory. He tells me that he and his wife are even thinking about moving to another country, such as Canada. ""I'm 31, and I've lived almost my entire life under the Putin regime. I don't want to live here any more."" But it's not just the authorities the vegan community worries about. Several of the people I speak to describe confrontations with far-right groups. These range from neo-Nazis sticking far-right stickers on their doors, to being violently attacked - including beatings and stabbings. In October 2017, a group of young, far-right activists went to a now-closed vegan anarchist restaurant called Animals and shot flares through the glass of the windows. Some staff were seriously injured. Animals, not pictured, was attacked by a far-right gang in 2017 Animals was run by the same group behind Horizontal, and was located just a few feet away. Like Horizontal it was an openly anarchist restaurant and a known meeting space for activists, says Horizontal worker Varya. ""It was the fash,"" she tells me, using a slang word for neo-fascists. ""We are politically active and we support different activist groups, we cover our walls with stickers, so they knew to target us. We all understand who was behind it, but no-one was fined or arrested."" Kostya tells me that he first became consciously anti-fascist at the age of 15, growing up in a village in the far-northern Yamalo Nenets district. It was a multicultural area - including members of the indigenous Nenets ethnic group - but there was also a strong far-right, Russian nationalist movement. This disturbed Kostya, who believed that everyone was equal. Even earlier, when Kostya was 10, he had been shocked by the murder of a 20-year-old rock musician and anti-racist activist, Timur Kacharava, who was stabbed to death by neo-Nazis outside a bookshop in St Petersburg. It stuck in his mind. ""We have a problem,"" he says. ""Unfortunately there has been no change in Russia for I don't know how long. A big part of the problem is our mass media, and the messages the government transmits through it. They say that the world is against us, they are homophobic and say that Europe is 'gay', for example."" He says many young people now ignore TV, and get their news online. Pollsters have noticed this trend, too - one recent poll foundalmost half of Russians aged 18-to-24 get their news from the largely uncensored internet,external. After a moment of pause, Kostya adds: ""I don't think Russians are bad people. They're just not educated, and are taught that the rest of the world is against us. From this fear grows a hatred of all difference."" So what does the future look like? Despite everything St Petersburg's vegan anarchists come up against, they remain hopeful about the years to come. ""I want an equal society, I'd like people to respect animals, to respect each other and to respect the planet - and I would like to see a border-free world, with no borders between the countries,"" Varya says. For many, a world without borders would be as unthinkable as a world without meat or cheese. But Varya is undaunted. ""I understand that, in reality, this will only be possible in several generations. But I just hope that we will bring up one generation, then another generation, and then another generation - then our descendants will finally be able to live in a much better society."" Igor and Anya agree. ""Russia has had a very difficult history,"" Igor says. ""But it's all about the mentality of the people - about whether we see the inertia of a generation, or the conscience of a generation. So if we at least manage to build a liberal state, in 10 years or so, we can have another country."" Kostya hopes that, eventually, society will change for the better Kostya adds that veganism in St Petersburg is growing so rapidly, there was even an animal rights section at the city's May Day parade this year. ""We had more people than United Russia,"" he laughs, referring to President Putin's political party. ""The ideal Russia, and the ideal world, for me would see us living in harmony and equality, living alongside people where we are all different but we are all equal. Where there's direct democracy - where the people vote for or against policies directly through referendums, rather than through representative governments. And of course where we're all environmentally aware,"" he says. ""A world with no state, no police, no borders, no nations - where people can decide for themselves what they want and what they want to achieve.""

"The Reverend Simon Nguyen, who led the service, said the victims lost their lives ""seeking freedom, dignity and happiness"" Services have been held in memory of the 39 Vietnamese victims found dead in a lorry container in Essex. More than 100 people attended the service at the Church of the Holy Name and Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in east London on Saturday evening. The Reverend Simon Nguyen, who led the service, said the 39 died ""seeking freedom, dignity and happiness"". At Mass on at the same church on Sunday Bishop Nicholas Hudson also asked for prayers for traffickers. It was confirmed by police on Friday that all of those who were found were Vietnamese. Police had initially believed they were Chinese. Candles were arranged into a figure of 39 to represent the number who died At the service on Saturday evening, prayers were heard and members of the Catholic congregation performed readings and candles were lit. ""We show our condolences and sympathies for the people who have lost their lives on the way seeking freedom, dignity and happiness,"" said Mr Nguyen. ""We ask God to welcome them into his kingdom even though some of them were not Catholic but they strongly believed in eternal peace, so we pray for them."" After the service he said: ""The people here are very united because we are all refugees. ""All the people here - most of the Vietnamese - came here as refugees in the '70s and the '80s and the '90s."" The Catholic church in East London has a large Vietnamese congregation He said in those decades, the disappearances of people from Vietnam were ""not reported by the media, but many of them died"". ""These victims [who died in the lorry last month], this tragedy, was reported but many tragedies to the Vietnamese no-one [knows about],"" he said. A memorial Mass on Sunday began with a projection of the trailer containing the bodies being removed from the industrial estate. After a minute's silence, Bishop Hudson said the service was to pray for the relations of congregation members who could be among the dead. He also asked for prayers for the emergency service staff who attended the scene. Bishop Hudson also sought prayers for traffickers, who he hoped ""as a result of this tragedy may have had a change of heart"". About 7% of Vietnam's population class themselves as Catholic, although the figure is higher in the area of the country where many of the missing people come from. In the past some Catholicshave had a fractious relationship,externalwith Vietnam's communist government. Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong's families are concerned they may be among the victims Essex Police said it was now in ""direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK"" and the Vietnamese Government. A number of Vietnamese families have previously come forward fearing their loved ones are among the dead. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on the night of 22 October - the day before the 39 people were found dead - saying her ""trip to a foreign land has failed"". The father of 30-year-old Le Van Ha, who comes from an agricultural part of Vietnam, previously told the BBC he was convinced his son was among the dead. Post-mortem examinations are being carried out on the 31 men and eight women to establish the cause of their deaths. The bodies were discovered in the lorry trailer in the early hours of 23 October The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court on Monday charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant. Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. On 21 December 2020, the Crown Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, found Eamonn Harrison, 24 of Newry, County Down, and Gheorghe Nica, 43 of Basildon, Essex, guilty of manslaughter and Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, admitted assisting unlawful immigration. All defendants were sentenced in January 2021.

"The UK will go to the polls for a general election on 12 December Official campaign begins this Wednesday after Parliament is formally shut down Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage confirms he will not be standing as a candidate Government announces benefits freeze will end in 2020 - its latest spending pledge ahead of the start of campaigning Labour vows a massive home improvement programme to cut energy bills and reduce carbon emissions if it wins power Lib Dems make formal complaint after ITV says its head-to-head election debate would only include the Tories and Labour Dulcie Lee and Suzanne Leigh Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, Boris Johnson, Jo Swinson and Nigel Farage We're finishing our Live coverage for now. Politicians have taken to social media and the airwaves to promote their parties ahead of next month's election.  That's all from us for now, but you can keep up to date with all the news about the electionhere.  The election period may not have officially started, but parties are already getting adverts out to potential supporters on social media. On Facebook, the Conservatives have started a second geographically targeted
campaign, covering 26 constituencies. It covers a mix of seats where the Tories were a close second in
2017 and those where the party currently have fairly safe majorities. The Labour Party also has a new campaign promoting an article in the Guardian, alongside the caption: âBoris
Johnsonâs disastrous Brexit would sell off our NHS to Donald Trump. The NHS
says that means skyrocketing costs for life-saving medicines."" The Lib Dems have two
new campaigns - one about the changes the party would bring if elected and the
other attacking Jeremy Corbyn. There are nine versions
of the advert on Mr Corbyn with a different message on each image. Jeremy Corbyn says climate change will be a big part of his campaign. Speaking to reporters as he campaigns in Putney, he says: ""The green industrial revolution, which we're promoting, will retrofit homes, will create a sustainable energy network in this country, will be a massive contribution of what we've signed up to through the Paris climate change accord. ""It's going to be a big part of it but it's also about land use and farming policies. We cannot go on polluting our planet. ""We cannot go on standing by while climate warming increases, we cannot go on seeing our biodiversity destroyed and diminished.""

Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is out and about campaigning in Wandsworth, London. Speaking about the party's before the election period officially begins, he tells one supporter: ""The numbers of people coming out are bigger than in 2017 at the same stage of the campaign."" BBC News Channel Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics at Kent University, says if Brexit Party candidates were to take ""anywhere as little at 5-6% of the vote"" that would have a ""significant impact"" on Boris Johnson's ability to win a majority. But in what sort of seats might the Brexit Party be a particular threat to the Conservatives? ""I imagine Brexit Party will not stand candidates against ERG [pro-Brexit European Research Group] Eurosceptic politicians within the Conservative Party,"" says Prof Goodwin. This would mark a return to UKIP's strategy in 2010 when they didn't stand candidates against politicians who wanted a referendum on the UK's EU membership, he says. ""If they then were to stand candidates in those all-important marginal seats, where the Conservatives are only a few points behind the Labour Party, that is going to cause a big problem for Boris Johnson."" Most sides have pledged to make their candidates more representative, including bringing more women into the race. However, with the deadline for selections just two weeks away on 14 November, the parties' record in selecting women is mixed - with Labour picking more women, while the Conservatives choose more men.

Our Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris explains here. Former minister Margot James announces she will not stand in next month's general election. The Stourbridge MP was one of 21 Conservative rebels who were removed from the parliamentary party after voting against the government to back a bill designed to stop a no-deal Brexit. In her resignation letter,external, Ms James says she welcomed the return of the whip last week and had wanted to continue in Parliament. But, as an active campaigner for Remain, she was at odds with her constituency, where 64% of voters backed Brexit. ""I realised that I needed to bring the three-and-a-half-year conflict between the result of the referendum in my constituency, and my own view of where the future interests of the country lie to a close,"" she writes.

"This video can not be played Knife attack amidst protests in Hong Kong shopping mall Five people have been injured in a knife attack at the site of a pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong. The attack happened at the Cityplaza mall in the Tai Koo district on Hong Kong Island. The local hospital authority said four men and one woman were injured, with two in critical condition. One of the injured, a local councillor, had his ear partially bitten off by the as-yet unidentified male attacker, who was subdued by passersby in the mall. Witnesses said the Mandarin-speaking attacker drew a knife after a political argument with people in the mall, which was the site of pro-democracy protests earlier in the day. The local councillor, Andrew Chiu Ka-yin, reportedly was attempting to prevent the attacker leaving the scene when the man bit off a section of his ear. Witnesses said the attacker was badly beaten by passersby who intervened, before police arrested the man. Andrew Chiu Ka-yin receives first aid after he was attacked on Sunday One of the victims, a woman, told the South China Morning Post that the suspect drew a knife after arguing with her sister and her husband, who were also injured. The Hong Kong Free Press reported that that attacker was a Mandarin-speaking pro-Beijing supporter. Hong Kong has experienced five months of sometimes violent demonstrations by pro-democracy activists, who first took to the streets to protest against a bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, but evolved into a broader revolt against the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing. A quick guide to the Hong Kong protests The wave of pro-democracy protests continued this weekend, days after a high-profile activist, Joshua Wong, was banned from standing in local elections. Police fired tear gas on Sunday into crowds of demonstrators in the eastern suburb of Taikoo Shing, home to the Cityplaza where the stabbing occurred. With no end in sight, China's leaders signalled last week that they were preparing to change how the mainland administered Hong Kong. Shen Chunyao, the director of the Hong Kong, Macau and Basic Law Commission, told reporters that officials were looking at ways to ""perfect"" how Hong Kong's chief executive was appointed and removed. He did not elaborate on what exactly might change. Last month, the leader of one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups was taken to hospital after being attacked, apparently with hammers. Photographs on social media showed Jimmy Sham of the Civil Human Rights Front lying in the street, covered in blood. From hospital, the activist said he ""remained committed to the ideal of peaceful non-violence"". Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hong Kong Images and footage of the incident spread quickly around social media platforms. The man who did the biting was subdued by a crowd, which then beat him, some using metal objects. That is was all happening in a shopping centre being stormed by riot police in pursuit of protestors who were earlier singing and chanting made it even more intense. A small group of hardcore activists had also smashed up shops whose owners they judged to be too ""pro-Beijing"". I watched the footage on a television in a small restaurant in Hong Kong. Halfway through the report, the woman running the place turned and walked away from the screen. ""This is all too depressing,"" she said in Chinese.

The original trousers were made in the 1950's The leather trousers were already two decades old when she wore them and had a broken zip that meant Newton-John had to be sewn into them.

"Contra Costa County search and rescue officers approach the property in Orinda Airbnb has said it will ban ""party houses"" after a mass shooting at a California home rented through the company left five people dead. CEO Brian Chesky said in a tweet the company would take steps to ""combat unauthorized parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct"". ""We must do better, and we will. This is unacceptable,"" Mr Chesky added. Three people died at the house, in the city of Orinda, near San Francisco, and two more died later in hospital. The house was reportedly booked under a pretence for a small group, before being publicised on Instagram as the venue for a Halloween party which eventually drew a crowd of more than 100 people. The host did not authorise the party, Airbnb said. All of those who died were under 30. The fifth victim died in hospital on Friday night. By Saturday, police had not arrested or identified any suspects. Officers said they found two guns at the house. Mr Chesky said Airbnb would create a dedicated ""party house"" rapid response team and expand manual screening of high-risk reservations. The company, which is expected to float on the stock market in 2020, would also take action against users who violated its policies, he said. Allow Twitter content?

"The Reverend Simon Nguyen, who led the service, said the victims lost their lives ""seeking freedom, dignity and happiness"" Services have been held in memory of the 39 Vietnamese victims found dead in a lorry container in Essex. More than 100 people attended the service at the Church of the Holy Name and Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in east London on Saturday evening. The Reverend Simon Nguyen, who led the service, said the 39 died ""seeking freedom, dignity and happiness"". At Mass on at the same church on Sunday Bishop Nicholas Hudson also asked for prayers for traffickers. It was confirmed by police on Friday that all of those who were found were Vietnamese. Police had initially believed they were Chinese. Candles were arranged into a figure of 39 to represent the number who died At the service on Saturday evening, prayers were heard and members of the Catholic congregation performed readings and candles were lit. ""We show our condolences and sympathies for the people who have lost their lives on the way seeking freedom, dignity and happiness,"" said Mr Nguyen. ""We ask God to welcome them into his kingdom even though some of them were not Catholic but they strongly believed in eternal peace, so we pray for them."" After the service he said: ""The people here are very united because we are all refugees. ""All the people here - most of the Vietnamese - came here as refugees in the '70s and the '80s and the '90s."" The Catholic church in East London has a large Vietnamese congregation He said in those decades, the disappearances of people from Vietnam were ""not reported by the media, but many of them died"". ""These victims [who died in the lorry last month], this tragedy, was reported but many tragedies to the Vietnamese no-one [knows about],"" he said. A memorial Mass on Sunday began with a projection of the trailer containing the bodies being removed from the industrial estate. After a minute's silence, Bishop Hudson said the service was to pray for the relations of congregation members who could be among the dead. He also asked for prayers for the emergency service staff who attended the scene. Bishop Hudson also sought prayers for traffickers, who he hoped ""as a result of this tragedy may have had a change of heart"". About 7% of Vietnam's population class themselves as Catholic, although the figure is higher in the area of the country where many of the missing people come from. In the past some Catholicshave had a fractious relationship,externalwith Vietnam's communist government. Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong's families are concerned they may be among the victims Essex Police said it was now in ""direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK"" and the Vietnamese Government. A number of Vietnamese families have previously come forward fearing their loved ones are among the dead. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on the night of 22 October - the day before the 39 people were found dead - saying her ""trip to a foreign land has failed"". The father of 30-year-old Le Van Ha, who comes from an agricultural part of Vietnam, previously told the BBC he was convinced his son was among the dead. Post-mortem examinations are being carried out on the 31 men and eight women to establish the cause of their deaths. The bodies were discovered in the lorry trailer in the early hours of 23 October The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court on Monday charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant. Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. On 21 December 2020, the Crown Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, found Eamonn Harrison, 24 of Newry, County Down, and Gheorghe Nica, 43 of Basildon, Essex, guilty of manslaughter and Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, admitted assisting unlawful immigration. All defendants were sentenced in January 2021.

"Boris Johnson said referendums were not ""wonderful for harmony"" Boris Johnson has ruled out granting permission for a second vote on Scottish independence while he is prime minister. Mr Johnson said his government would not give the go-ahead for another legally-binding referendum. The Tory leader claimed the issue had been settled in a ""once-in-a-generation"" vote in 2014. Nicola Sturgeon described the position of blocking another independence referendum as ""unsustainable"". The Scottish first minister has already said she will request a ""section 30 order"" - which grants permission for a new referendum from the UK government - within days of the 12 December general election. Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland's future 'must be in our own hands' Labour government 'would not block' indyref2 Nicola Sturgeon says indyref2 'must happen next year' The SNP leader previously said she believed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would grant her the section 30 order if he was voted into Downing Street. But Mr Johnson was clear he did not want to see Scots given a second vote on the country's place in the UK. Speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday, the PM said: ""I think having another referendum, I don't think people in this country think referendums are very wonderful for harmony. ""We had one in 2014, the British people, the people of Scotland, were told in 2014 that that was a once-in-a-generation event."" Asked if he would grant permission for an independence referendum as prime minister, Mr Johnson stated: ""No, I don't, I don't want to have one. But I don't see any reason to go back on that, on that assurance."" The prime minister and first minister have been at loggerheads over the issue of independence since Mr Johnson took office The Scottish government wants toput the question of independence to a new public votein the second half of 2020 and has started the legislative process in Holyrood to achieve this. However, for any referendum to be legally binding it needs the green light from the UK government, which has said it will not approve any section 30 agreement. The Electoral Commission has also said it would want toassess the wording of the questionfor a new Scottish independence vote even if it was the same one used in 2014. Reacting to Mr Johnson's comments, Ms Sturgeon, also speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday, said: ""It is not a sustainable position and it is certainly not a democratic position. ""Everyone in Scotland knows there is going to be another independence referendum and if the SNP wins this election then that sends a clear message that we want to take our future into our own hands rather than have Boris Johnson continue to impose a future upon us. ""If the SNP win this election, for any Westminster politician to seek to stand in the way of an independence referendum would be seeking to ignore the democratic wishes of the Scottish people and I don't think it will be a position that any Westminster politician will be able to stick to."" On the same programme Shadow cabinet member Rebecca Long-Bailey made clear Labour would not block a second referendum if the Scottish government was to push for one after the 2021 Holyrood election. While she was clear Labour wants ""Scotland to be part of Great Britain"" she added: ""Ultimately, what we have said is that after the next Scottish government elections, if the Scottish government determine they want to pursue another referendum and they go through the legislative process within their own government to push that forward, than as a government we wouldn't stand in their way."" The party has said it will oppose independence if there was another referendum. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Labour's comments on a second independence referendum showed Jeremy Corbyn's party could not be trusted to preserve the Union. He said: ""It's quite clear Jeremy Corbyn will break up the UK if it means he can get his hands on the keys to Downing Street."" Indyref2 legislation published at Holyrood Sturgeon says indyref2 'must happen next year' LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

"Saudi Aramco has confirmed it is planning to list on the Riyadh stock exchange, in what could be the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO). The state-owned oil giant will determine the IPO launch price after registering interest from investors. Business sources say the Saudis are expected to make shares available for 1% or 2% of the firm, and the offer will be for existing company shares. Saudi Aramco is thought to be worth about $1.2tn (Â£927bn). The firm said it has no current plans for a foreign share listing, saying long-discussed plans for a two-stage IPO including an offering on a foreign exchange had been put aside for now. ""For the (international) listing part, we will let you know in due course. So far it's only on Tadawul,"" Aramco chair Yasir al-Rumayyan told a media conference, referring to the Saudi stock exchange. Saudi Aramco flotation 'coming soon' Saudi Arabia denies calling off Aramco float Saudi Arabia to open up to foreign tourists Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at derivatives traders IG Group, said:  ""Investing in Aramco carries risks, of course, and not only that oil prices will struggle to move higher. ""Political and strategic risks are high for any firm operating in the region, not least one which is an arm of the Saudi state.  Aramco also has limited control in output policy, a key part of Saudi Arabia's Opec management."" This video can not be played Abqaiq has the world's largest oil processing plant Those potential risks were highlighted in September when drone attacks hit the Abqaiq oil facility and the Khurais oil field in Saudi Arabia, both owned by Aramco. But Aramco boss Amin Nasser, who called the plans ""historic"", told a media conference after the IPO statement was published that the firm was still the most reliable oil company globally. In its launch announcement Aramco said: ""The company does not expect the impact of these attacks to have a material impact on its business, financial condition or results of operations."" Saudi Aramco traces its roots to 1933 when a deal was struck between Saudi Arabia and the Standard Oil Company of California, which later became Chevron, to survey and drill for oil, creating a new firm to do so. Between 1973 and 1980, Saudi Arabia bought the whole company. Environmental activists are calling on oil companies to stop exploring for more fossil fuels Saudi Arabia has the second-biggest oil reserves after Venezuela, according to theEnergy Information Administration,external. It is also second in production, after the US. But it gets its prominence because it has the monopoly on all that oil in the country, and because of how cheap it is to extract. It's essentially the world's largest unquoted company; it's a massive global oil producer,"" said David Hunter, director of market studies at Schneider Electric. ""This is the absolute mother of all oil and gas companies."" Saudi Aramco is worth $1.2tn, according to analysis from financial news service Bloomberg, although Riyadh would prefer a valuation of $2tn, which is one reason the company's share sale has been delayed a number of times. Mr Beauchamp from IG Group says: ""Aramco is a world away from the tech IPOs that have been all the rage lately, but the valuation problem still haunts them like it does the firms of Silicon Valley."" He adds: ""$2 trillion probably overstates the worth of the firm in a world of high oil supply and uncertain demand, but $1.2 trillion is too low for a vital part of the Saudi state"". Once shrouded in mystery, Aramco has been transformed in the last few years as it geared up for this moment It has begun publishing financial results, holding question and answer sessions about the company and even bringing journalists to its sites following recent drone attacks. And it has hired female Westerners to some of its top jobs. The language in today's document speaks to international concerns. It describes ""long-term value creation through crude oil price cycles"" and improving sustainability ""by leveraging technology and innovation to lower our climate impact"". Local people - even ""Saudi female divorcees"" - will be eligible to buy shares, and will receive a bonus share for every 10 they hold. Either way, it is phenomenally profitable. For the first half of 2019, it posted a net profit of $46.9bn, almost all of which was paid out in dividends to the Saudi state. Any company that profitable will attract a high price. By comparison, for the same time period,Apple,external, the world's largest company by value currently, posted a net profit of $21.6bn, andExxon Mobil,external, the largest listed oil company, made $5.5bn. While alternatives are growing, oil and gas still dominate international energy markets Another aspect is the cost of production. Whereas extracting North Sea oil is expensive due to its location under hundreds of feet of water, oil in Saudi Arabia is relatively close to the surface. Saudi has many of the cheapest oil fields for extraction, with some per-barrel costs below $10, says Mr Hunter. With Brent crude at more than $60, much of the difference can be profit. Saudi Arabia is keen to sell shares in its state oil firm because it is trying to reduce its reliance on oil. The company was formed after an agreement between a US oil firm and Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman wishes to diversify his country's economy in the next decade under a programme dubbed Vision 2030. The plan includes more solar power, making use of the country's vast desert, says Mr Hunter. The first Saudi CEO of the company, Ali al-Naimi, had a vision that Aramco could become a global integrated energy company.  Over his years as CEO, he expanded Aramco's assets to include downstream (refining) and other assets in the US, South Korea, China, Indonesia, Japan and Europe. He and his successors also expanded Aramco's footprint in Saudi Arabia with joint ventures in refining and petrochemicals.  Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter today and is the only oil producer that maintains at least 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity that can be brought onto the market very quickly. The fact that it is a national oil company means it has exclusive access to the best and least-expensive-to-produce oil resources in the world.  This makes it hugely valuable.  But there are downsides.  Saudi Arabia's upstream assets aren't diversified like other major international oil companies upstream assets are.  It also means that the Saudi government plays a role in the company.  Historically, Saudi Arabia allowed Aramco to operate independently and did not make decisions about spending for strategy for the company. There are troubling signs that this is changing now and the government is taking a more active, and detrimental, role. How much Aramco is really worth will be determined by the market.  Banks have put forth their valuations, but the market will show how much it is really worth. Different sources have quoted valuations ranging from $1.2 tn to $2 tn. The most common number floated right now seems to be about $1.5 tn, perhaps $1.7 tn, though public sentiment probably indicates that this is too high a number. In 30 years, who knows how much Aramco will be worth.  We don't know what other energy technologies will develop, or not, in that time, nor what Aramco's strategic vision will produce. In September, the kingdom said it will open its doors to international tourists for the first time, launching a visa regime for 49 countries and relax strict dress codes for female visitors. Tourism Minister Ahmad al-Khateeb described it as a ""historic moment"" for the country. It wants tourism to rise from 3% to 10% of gross domestic product by 2030. The push comes as the kingdom faces a tarnished international image amid criticism of its human rights record following last year's murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and a recent crackdown on women's rights activists. Politically, matters are rather complicated for Saudi Aramco right now, in light of the recent Kashoggi scandal, said Mr Hunter. ""And the fact of Saudi Arabia's human rights record. Anything to do with Saudi Arabia is always seen through that prism."" Aramco is the world's largest oil firm Another wrinkle in the crown prince's plan is the surge in anti-fossil fuel sentiment around the world, plus the comparatively low oil price compared to late last year, where prices were above $80. ""The listing could be controversial because it's a massive fossil fuel listing in a time investors are becoming increasingly ethical,"" said Mr Hunter. ""There are a lot of new and existing funds looking to divest from fossil fuel assets."" In May, fellow oil producer Norway's $1tn sovereign wealth fund said it expected to sell some of its oil and gas holdings, albeit to make it less reliant on price swings in the commodity.

"Yoga's popularity does not look like it will wane any time soon. Its physical benefits for flexibility and balance, as well as its spiritual connection, mean it's practised by millions across the world. And that means a need for more and more yoga teachers. But now, there is a warning they may be putting their own hip health at risk. Benoy Matthews, a leading UK-based physiotherapist, warns he is seeing increasing numbers of yoga teachers with serious hip problems - many of whom require surgery - because they are pushing their bodies too hard. Mr Matthews, a specialist hip and knee physiotherapist and member of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, says he sees four to five yoga teachers a month. He says the problem lies in people repeatedly pushing their bodies into ""prescribed"" positions, when their physiology prevents it. About half of the teachers he sees simply need advice on how to moderate the ""prescribed"" yoga positions, so as not to put too much stress on their joints. But those with more advanced problems need medical treatment and surgery - including total hip replacements. Yoga 'helps my Irritable Bowel Syndrome' Yoga sessions 'could improve golf swing' Andy Murray's 'life-changing' hip surgery has left him pain-free ""People confuse stiffness and pain,"" he says. ""If there is a pinching or blocking feeling in the groin, it shouldn't be ignored. You have to know your limits."" Mr Matthews has specialised in hips and knees for the last eight of his 22 years as a physio. He says it can be easy for yoga practitioners to mistake joint pain, which means they should stop the movement, for stiffness, which they should push through. Benoy Matthews says the key is simply to understand what your body can do ""We all know about the health benefits of yoga - I practise it myself,"" he says. ""But, like anything, it can cause injury. We can't put it on a pedestal. ""I don't want to denounce yoga, after all it's been going for thousands of years. But you have to understand yourself."" Mr Matthews says the problem often boils down to how a person's hips are formed and how flexible they are. ""What's achievable for one might not be achievable for others,"" he says. ""People tend to do the same set positions, rather than what's achievable for them. ""Ego might mean them trying to take a position 'all the way' to the end when they should just stop where it's comfortable. ""Just because the person next to you can reach all the way doesn't mean it's necessary, or desirable, to do the same."" Mr Matthews says the amount of yoga teachers do, as well as the fact they might not be doing any other kind of exercise, can explain the problems that develop. ""They might be doing yoga six days a week and think that's enough, without doing any other kind of exercise, like cardio or cross training,"" he says. ""It's like anything. If you do the same thing again and again, there can be problems. You need to mix it up in terms of the kind of exercise you do. ""The yoga teachers I'm seeing are young - 40, 42. ""If they come limping and can't walk more than 10m [33ft], say, there's no amount of physio that can help them. If it's two years in, even the best physio can't do anything. Sometimes they can have keyhole surgery (hip arthroscopy), or it's a replacement. Mr Matthews suggests new yoga teachers should be assessed. ""You could see what mobility they have and what their body is allowing them to do,"" he says. Natalie Gartshore has been a yoga teacher for 16 years, She thinks the popularity of yoga means it's effectively a victim of its own success. ""I don't think you're told very much when you're training as a teacher about physiology or anatomy,"" she says. ""There is an overuse issue. ""If you got people en masse taking up ballet, you would get the same results."" Natalie, now 45, tore the cartilage in her hip five years ago. She now makes sure she manages her class workload and doesn't work weekends. But she says it's hard for newly qualified teachers to do the same. ""They'll be doing five classes a day, running around, working weekends,"" she says. The British Wheel of Yoga is approved by Sports England, as the practice's governing body. Wendy Haring, its chair of education, says: ""It's probably true in some schools of yoga, where people hold poses for a long time without modification, that's when there are problems."" But learning about anatomy and physiology is a ""major part"" of BWY-approved courses. ""We would teach people how to modify poses,"" Mrs Haring says. She adds though, people teaching yoga do need to take care and advises anyone wanting to train to make sure their courses are Ofqual-approved. Pip White, professional adviser at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, says: ""Yoga is a fantastic activity for people to do, with lots of benefits for your health and general wellbeing. ""However, as with any form of exercise, it's important to do it safely and in this case, also understanding your own limits, as we are all built differently. ""Yoga is not about being in competition with anyone else. If you stay aware of your abilities and practise within your own limits, you will gain all the great benefits this practice has to offer.""

"This video can not be played Donald Trump arrived to a rowdy reception from the crowd Donald Trump was met with raucous boos - and some cheers - on Saturday as he attended the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in New York. The US president attended the Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) event with high-ranking Republicans and his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. A small anti-Trump protest was held at the Madison Square Garden arena. It comes less than a week after the president was booed at the baseball World Series in Washington DC. This video can not be played Trump booed at Washington DC baseball match Chants of ""lock him up"" echoed around the stadium earlier in the week -  a reference to a chant sometimes heard at Mr Trump's political rallies, which calls for the imprisonment of his former presidential rival Hillary Clinton.

Mr Trump is currently facing an impeachment probe relating to allegations he pressured Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his rival in the 2020 White House race, former Vice President Joe Biden. As video of the crowd spread on social media, his son Donald Jr hit back on Twitter, saying the reception had been ""overwhelmingly positive"" and that UFC President Dana White - a long-time friend of the president's - had called it ""the most electrifying entrance he's seen in 25 years"". UFC, or the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is an American MMA promotion company. Its first mixed martial arts event was held in 1993. From humble beginnings, it now boasts millions of fans worldwide and has produced superstar fighters like Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey. Mr Trump hosted UFC events decades ago, when the sport was shunned by most venues and mainstream media.

"Contra Costa County search and rescue officers approach the property in Orinda Airbnb has said it will ban ""party houses"" after a mass shooting at a California home rented through the company left five people dead. CEO Brian Chesky said in a tweet the company would take steps to ""combat unauthorized parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct"". ""We must do better, and we will. This is unacceptable,"" Mr Chesky added. Three people died at the house, in the city of Orinda, near San Francisco, and two more died later in hospital. The house was reportedly booked under a pretence for a small group, before being publicised on Instagram as the venue for a Halloween party which eventually drew a crowd of more than 100 people. The host did not authorise the party, Airbnb said. All of those who died were under 30. The fifth victim died in hospital on Friday night. By Saturday, police had not arrested or identified any suspects. Officers said they found two guns at the house. Mr Chesky said Airbnb would create a dedicated ""party house"" rapid response team and expand manual screening of high-risk reservations. The company, which is expected to float on the stock market in 2020, would also take action against users who violated its policies, he said. Allow Twitter content?

"Mr Thomson has insisted the allegations were ""politically motivated smears"" Scottish Conservative MP Ross Thomson is to stand down after being accused of sexually assaulting a Labour MP in a Commons bar. Mr Thomson said he had made the ""hardest decision of my life"" not to contest the seat for Aberdeen South at the general election. Labour MP Paul Sweeney had said he reported Mr Thomson to Westminster's standards watchdog following the alleged incident last October. Mr Thomson denies any wrongdoing. But he said a number of ""anonymous and malicious allegations"" this year had made his life ""a living hell"". Mr Thomson, 32, said: ""This is a political smear and I will continue to fight to clear my name. I will see this investigatory process through to a conclusion. ""I have suffered a level of personal abuse that has affected my health, my mental wellbeing and my staff. It has been a level of abuse that I never imagined possible."" Mr Sweeney said he was with a group of friends in the Commons bar when the incident happened He added: ""I have therefore made the most difficult decision that I could ever make. I have decided that I will stand down as the Scottish Conservative and Unionist candidate for Aberdeen South."" Mr Sweeney, who is the MP for Glasgow North East,told the Scottish Mail on Sunday,externalhe was left feeling ""mortified"" by the alleged attack in the Strangers' Bar at Westminster. Ross Thomson: Tory MP says bar behaviour claims 'completely false' Ross Thomson: Fresh allegations over Tory MP's behaviour According to the paper, Mr Sweeney said he was ""paralysed"" with shock after Mr Thomson ""groped"" him in the bar. He said the alleged incident took place in October 2018 after he had invited a group of his old Glasgow University friends for a tour of the Commons. They later went to the Strangers' Bar for a drink where he claims they were interrupted by Mr Thomson, who was ""drunk to the point where he was barely able to stand up"". Mr Thomson then allegedly grabbed at Mr Sweeney through his clothes. Mr Sweeney said he repeatedly told Mr Thomson to stop touching him and asked him to leave. The Labour MP said that he later asked for advice from the Women's Aid charity before approaching the Standards watchdog. A House of Commons spokeswoman said: ""Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievances Scheme (ICGS) operates on the basis of absolute confidentiality. ""Therefore we cannot provide answers about any complaint that may or may not have been made."" Mr Thomson said dealing with the allegations had been ""nothing short of traumatic"" In February, Mr Thomson was publicly accused of gropinga man in the same Commons bar. The Tory MP also strongly denies any wrongdoing relating to that alleged incident. Mr Sweeney said he was finally speaking out in public more than a year after the alleged assault because the investigations had ""barely progressed"". A spokesman for the MP said: ""This assault, which took place last October, was reported to the appropriate authorities after similar but entirely separate allegations were made by other men against Ross Thomson in February. ""Thomson's denials today fly in the face of what was witnessed by other MPs and visitors and show him to be utterly unrepentant."" Mr Thomson had issued a statement on Twitter,externalon Sunday morning in which he strenuously denied Mr Sweeney's allegations, but insisted he would be a Tory candidate in the 12 December general election. However, he later confirmed he was standing down from the job he ""loved more than any other"". Mr Thomson, who has been an MP since 2017, said: ""I always believed politics was about noble pursuits and doing what you believed to be best for your country. ""My experience is that our politics is now so poisonous that we will never attract good, honest and decent people in the first place. ""This has been without doubt the hardest decision of my life. I remain confident that the ongoing parliamentary standards process will find in my favour, and that these baseless claims will be shown up for what they are. ""As I have already said I will continue to explore all options available to me in response to the defamatory and damaging allegations made by Mr Sweeney.""

"Check the latest opinion poll trends with the poll tracker, which measures how people say they are going to vote at the next general election. This page is no longer being updated.You can see the latest poll tracker for the UK general election due to be called in 2024 by clicking here. Over the course of the campaign almost every single poll has had the Conservatives ahead by at least 6%. So if they don't end up with the most votes it would be a serious failure. Labour have consistently been in a clear second place, a long way ahead of the Liberal Democrats in third. The Brexit Party started the campaign at around 10% of the vote but have fallen back dramatically - in part as a result of their decision not to contest Conservative-held seats. In Scotland the picture is very different. In the few polls there have been, the SNP has always had a commanding lead with the Conservatives in second place. Again, if that's not the result then the polls will have been badly flawed. For most of the campaign there have been marked differences between the polling companies. But all of them have suggested that the race has narrowed in the final two weeks. Out of 100 people who are likely to vote, about... Please upgrade your browser or enable JavaScript to see the full interactive experience There's about a 90% chance that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown above, which means there's a one in 10 chance that it lies outside these ranges. * Because the SNP and Plaid Cymru only campaign in Scotland and Wales respectively, the margins of error for their support across Great Britain is likely to be less than +/- 1% What most polls don't tell us is how votes will be converted into seats in the House of Commons. There have been several attempts to do this, though, using large polling samples which allow complex analyses of the levels of support for each party among different demographic groups. The central forecast of the final YouGov projection is a Conservative majority of 28. But it's important to look at the range of possible outcomes their analysis implies. For the Conservatives that range is 311-367 seats. So, on this basis, another hung parliament cannot be ruled out - and neither can a large majority. The BBC won't report on any polls that come out on polling day so this will be the final update to the poll tracker. The exit poll, commissioned by the BBC, ITV News and Sky News will be published when voting ends at 22.00 GMT on Thursday night. Compare where the parties stand on key issues like Brexit, education and the NHS. General election manifesto guide Going into the last few days of the election campaign the Conservative lead over Labour remains solid. The latest polls all put the Conservatives in the low to mid-40s and Labour in the low 30s in percentage terms across Britain as a whole. The Lib Dems are in a narrow 11-14% range and the Brexit Party are in low single digits - a long way down compared to where they started. Over the course of the campaign, both of the main parties have seen their poll ratings go up but the gap between the two is more or less where it was five weeks ago. As Sir John Curtice has pointed out, if the result on Thursday is in line with these numbers then the Conservatives are probably on course for a decent majority in the House of Commons. There should be a few more polls to come over the next three days - as well as another YouGov seat projection - so that could still change. But there would have to be a pretty big shift to point to a different overall result. Of course, they could all be systematically wrong - it wouldn't be the first time if that turned out to be true. But if you're using the polls as a guide to what could happen then their message is clear. The latest batch of polls lends more weight to the suggestion that the Conservative rise, which has been a consistent feature of the election campaign, has levelled off. That doesn't mean they can't go up any further, but for the time being it seems as though support for them is fairly static. Meanwhile, the Labour Party is still moving upwards - apparently mostly at the expense of the Liberal Democrats. If this trend continues, then we could be on course for another election where the two biggest parties capture a very large share of the overall vote. It would still need another big move, though, to reach the 84% that the Conservatives and Labour achieved between them in 2017. And there are only ten days to go. Our poll tracker smoothes out the bumps in polling by including old polls. Their influence decays, halving every week, but that still means our rolling average can look a little behind the latest figures. The differences are all smaller than the margin of error, but if parties are picking up or losing share, we might be a point or two off what a simple average of the latest polls would tell you. That's not so apparent when the parties are all moving in parallel - so we're lagging a little for everyone and the differences between parties will look similar. But, with the Conservatives plateauing, it might take a little while before our tracker starts to show Labour catching up as the most recent polls suggest they might be. YouGov's seat projection has raised a lot of interest. A lot of that is down to the fact that when they did the same exercise in 2017 they were pretty successful at forecasting the overall election result as well as the outcome in most individual constituencies. Their new projection puts the Conservatives on 359 seats, Labour on 211, the SNP on 43, Lib Dems on 13 and other parties on 24. That suggests a Conservative majority of 68. However, this still needs to be treated with caution for several reasons. It's still based on polling which, as we know, is always subject to error. The margin of error for this model ranges from a Conservative landslide to a very slim majority. Whilst the model uses a sophisticated technique to see how national polling trends play out in individual constituencies, it is always going to be very difficult to account for truly local factors - such as a prominent local independent candidate. Also, some other recent polls have suggested that Labour have moved a bit closer to the Conservatives than they are in the YouGov poll. That would clearly have an impact on the size of any overall majority, and the polls will continue to move between now and 12 December. So, whilst the projection is certainly very interesting, it shouldn't be treated as providing a reliable forecast of what the result of the election will be. One other feature of the most recent polls is that, with one clear exception, there seems to be more consistency between the different polling companies. If you look back to the beginning of October, there were very large differences between them. Now, each of the parties seems to be performing in a fairly narrow range across the polls: the low 40s for the Conservatives; close to 30% for Labour, and the mid-teens for the Lib Dems. The outlier is Opinium's latest poll which has the Conservatives on 47% and the Lib Dems down on 12%. Of course, convergence doesn't mean the polls can tell us what the final result will be. There's still more than two weeks to go and the lesson from 2015 is that there can be a consistent error across nearly all polls. Overall, the polls from the last week have shown the same pattern of movement as they have throughout the campaign. In particular, the Conservatives have gone up again in the BBC poll tracker and the Brexit Party continues to fall. There may be the first signs in the raw polling figures, though, that the Conservative shift is beginning to level off. Several of the pollsters have them one or two points below their peak in the latest figures. Even if their rise does stall, though, the Tories are now fairly close to the 43% they actually achieved at the 2017 election. A new Panelbase poll in Scotland also puts them only marginally below the result from last time. However, a result along those lines wouldn't mean their vote share was approximately flat across the country. The national figures can mask big shifts at a local level. There could still be dramatic swings in individual constituencies. Writing updates on the election campaign polls is beginning to get a bit repetitive. Once again, the changes since last week are basically following the same pattern as we've seen before. The Conservatives are up and Labour is also up a bit. The Brexit Party is down, and the Lib Dems are also a bit lower than before. In fact, the Conservatives are now pushing towards the 43% they actually achieved across Britain at the general election in 2017. As we noted last week, pollsters are adjusting their methodologies to take account of the fact that the Brexit Party has withdrawn in Conservative-held seats. That ought to help them hold on to seats they're defending. Perhaps slightly counterintuitively, though, it might mean Boris Johnson needs a bigger lead in the polls to be sure of winning an overall majority of MPs. Piling on extra votes in safe Conservative constituencies, thanks to the absence of a Brexit Party candidate, probably won't translate into extra seats in the House of Commons. A poll by LucidTalk covering the election in Northern Ireland was also published last week. These are few and far between, and the poll was conducted before the official election campaign got underway, so it's very hard to get a good sense of any trends. But compared to the 2017 election, the poll suggested the DUP and Sinn Fein losing vote share with the Alliance and SDLP going up. If the actual election result goes a similar way it could mean the smaller parties making gains in terms of seats at the expense of the big two. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties. YouGov's latest poll removed the Brexit Party, Liberal Democrats, Green and Plaid Cymru as an option in seats where they have stood down. The most notable, if unsurprising, effect was for the Brexit Party. Their support roughly halved from 9% to 4% as they roughly halved the number of constituencies in which they are standing. Other pollsters have said they will follow suit. We can expect further changes as nominations close and it becomes clear who is standing in each constituency. So there will be even more movements in the poll tracker over the coming weeks. Some of it will be, as ever, down to the changing political landscape. But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. We are starting to see the pollsters respond to the tactical voting arrangements by parties.

But some will be down to pollsters' efforts to measure that landscape more accurately. The trends that were noticeable in the polls a week ago have carried on over the last seven days. The Conservatives have continued their steady upward progress. But the tentative signs of a Labour recovery have also become firmer. Both parties' average scores are up, although they're still below the vote shares they recorded at the 2017 election - more than 10% below in Labour's case. Going in the other direction, the Brexit Party are down to 9% in the BBC poll tracker - their lowest score since the party was launched in April. And it's now clear that the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from where they were a month ago. YouGov has also published polls for Wales and Scotland. In Wales, they have Labour up four points with the Lib Dems losing the same amount since the last poll. Labour, on 29%, are now roughly on a par with the Conservatives on 28%. Since there are so few Welsh polls probably the best we can say with any confidence is that it looks close between the two main parties - with Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party also in a close battle for third place. The Scotland poll gave the SNP a very large lead on 42%, with the Conservatives in a clear second place, and Labour falling to its lowest score since before the last election - just below the Lib Dems. However, that poll was conducted more than two weeks ago, before the election was even confirmed so it's rather likely that these figures are out of date. There can be little doubt, however, that the SNP are currently on course for a strong result. It's nearly a week now since it became clear that there would be a general election on 12 December. There have already been eight polls conducted since then - we can expect that from now on they will be coming thick and fast. Over the last seven days the Conservatives have continued their upward trend in the BBC poll tracker whilst the Brexit Party are still drifting downwards. There are also some early signs of a recovery for Labour. They've hit an average of 26% - their highest figure since the first half of September. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats have fallen to 17% - their lowest since the start of June. These movements are pretty small so far, though, so we will need to see if they continue in the coming days. There's no doubt that Brexit will be a major issue at this election. But as the campaign gets underway, will other policy areas come to the fore? Opinium has found that Brexit is a more dominant subject as the campaign gets under way than it was at the last general election. Forty per cent of people in their latest poll said it was the single issue that was most likely to influence their vote. That compares with 18% at the start of the 2017 campaign. However, when people were asked to name the three most important issues facing the country, 59% of respondents identified health/NHS compared to only 52% for the EU/Brexit. That's a shift compared to their recent polls where Brexit has come out on top or in equal first place. It's possible that by campaigning on non-Brexit issues the parties will be able to influence how much weight voters give to different subjects. Panelbase's latest poll also puts the NHS/health as the top issue. On the other hand, Deltapoll have Britain leaving the EU clearly ahead of health. The difference here could be explained by the fact they don't namecheck the NHS in their range of options. The last few weeks have seen a gradual, further strengthening of the Conservatives' position in the polls. In the latest poll by Opinium they hit 40% - the highest figure in a single poll since the middle of August. They've also moved up to an average of 36% in the BBC poll tracker. In the meantime, the Liberal Democrats have fallen away a little from their party conference highpoint to settle at that 18%-ish level they've occupied for much of the autumn while the Brexit Party continue to drift downwards. Labour's average rating has essentially stayed flat. Because voting intention polls are fairly scarce in Scotland, it's difficult to identify trends. But the latest Panelbase poll conducted earlier this month suggests that the SNP continues to dominate. Comparing polls to the 2017 general election result suggests Labour and the Conservatives are on course to lose votes, the SNP are roughly level with where they were, whilst the Lib Dems could gain votes. The SNP's share in polls has floated between 36% and 43% for the last two years. In our GB-wide poll tracker, that translates to 4%, occasionally dropping to 3% or rising to 5% since Scotland has just under 10% of the GB population. That's why we don't suggest a margin of error range as we do for parties that field candidates across the whole of Great Britain. Polls are even rarer in Wales - but the latest from YouGov, also conducted earlier this month, broadly matches others from earlier in the year. The Conservatives are down from their 2017 election share but Labour has fallen back much more dramatically. From the 49% they achieved then, their share of the vote has approximately halved according to polls. The Lib Dems are up sharply and the Brexit Party are performing far more strongly than UKIP did when voters last had their say. Our poll tracker lines show an average of results from the polls to date. Each dot in the chart above shows one poll result for a party. There are too many individual dots to keep track of: even on one day there can be very different results for one party from different polls. So we summarise all that information with a line that averages those results. It bounces around less and makes it easier to tell the signal from the noise (or the trends from the blips?). We use polls conducted by members of the British Polling Council. As of September 2019, that's BMG, ComRes, Deltapoll, Hanbury, ICM, Ipsos Mori, Kantar, Opinium, ORB, Panelbase, Sky Data, Survation and YouGov. Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK, but as a result we do not have separate data for parties that only stand in Northern Ireland. We use results that exclude or downweight those who are unlikely to vote and people who do not express a preference. We include data that are in the public domain: some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time and so we update the poll tracker as data become available. The margin of error is plus or minus four percentage points. This means that there's a 90% chance that an election held tomorrow would give national vote shares within four points of our estimates for each of the parties. And there's a 10% chance that it would be outside that range. We base these figures on aBritish Polling Council analysis,externalof the results of the final set of polls before each of the elections from 2001 to 2017. The approach mentioned above doesn't quite work for parties that only run in Scotland or Wales or are standing in only a few seats, like UKIP or The Independent Group for Change. The electorate they are appealing to is smaller and this makes their possible vote smaller when it is projected across Great Britain or the whole of the UK. This also means that their margin of error is smaller than that of those parties that stand across Britain and is likely to be less than + / - 1%. We have more coverage of politics inScotlandandWaleson their national politics pages. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls to date. Bigger and more recent polls have more influence on our figures. We also limit the influence of any one poll or of those polling firms who poll very frequently to prevent our results being too dependent on one source. In a little more detail: the average is weighted by sample size. The more people polled in a particular survey, the more weight we will give it, up to a threshold of 2,000 people. On the other hand, the older a poll is the less influence it has on the average figure we calculate. We also give less value to any polling firm that has data for more than 5,000 people in a fortnight. A typical poll may cover about 1,000 people. Because a party isn't guaranteed to get the same vote share in an election as it did in a poll the previous day. Polling a sample of the population has often been likened to tasting soup. If the soup has been well stirred then you need to have only one spoonful to get a sense of what the whole bowl is like. In the same way, a well-conducted poll of 1,000 people can, most of the time, give us an idea of what the country as a whole is thinking. But it's not 100% precise, so, the margin of error gives a sense of how the results might change with a different sample of 1,000 people. This margin of error only applies to national vote share: converting that into seats in Parliament is much harder and less precise. There are also systematic differences between polling companies who approach people in different ways, who ask different questions and who analyse the results differently. We list the main polling firms and the questions they ask below. Polling companies also analyse their data differently. They make choices about how to weight each respondent. For example, if a poll of 1,000 people is made up of 550 men and 450 women, it is unrepresentative because it does not reflect the profile of the UK population (51% female). So the answers of female respondents should be given slightly more weight than male respondents in the analysis so that the final results are 51% based on female answers rather than 45%. That's not controversial, but adjusting for past vote or likelihood to vote is harder. Some pollsters ask respondents who they voted for last time and weight the sample to try and ensure it matches the political make-up of the general population. One problem with doing this is that a certain number of people will incorrectly recall who they voted for last time - and a few will even lie about it. So polling companies often use a variety of further methods to improve the accuracy of their weighting. That variety of methods leads to a variety of answers. Most companies then weight or filter by likelihood to vote so that the answers of people who are most likely to vote are given the most prominence in the results. Finally, several pollsters reallocate a percentage of ""don't knows"" to the party they voted for last time. This is to get around the problem that emerged following the 1979 election with the phenomenon of ""shy Tories"" or the ""spiral of silence"" - people who do not want to discuss their voting preference but who will still vote. Our approach, excluding ""don't knows"" from our polltracker, is slightly different. It is like saying that they won't vote or, if they did, their voting preferences would look quite like those who do express a preference. Many polling companies changed their methodology when the candidates lists were released to account for those parties that are standing only in a few seats. If a general election were held today, which of the following parties would you vote for? Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, SNP (if living in Scotland), Plaid Cymru (if living in Wales), Green Party, Brexit Party, another party Prior to August 2019, Green Party and Brexit Party were only prompted for if the respondent answered ""another party"". Following a randomised controlled trial, BMG decided to move those two parties into the main prompt list. The Independent Group for Change and UKIP remain in the secondary prompt list. If there were a (UK) general election tomorrow to elect MPs to Westminster, would you vote Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, Brexit Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru, or for another party? If there were a general election held tomorrow, which party would you vote for? SELECT ONE: Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, UK Independence Party (UKIP), Scottish National Party (SNP), Plaid Cymru (PC), Brexit Party, Green, Some other party If a general election is held in October before the Brexit deadline of 31 October, which party would you vote for?

"Contra Costa County search and rescue officers approach the property in Orinda Airbnb has said it will ban ""party houses"" after a mass shooting at a California home rented through the company left five people dead. CEO Brian Chesky said in a tweet the company would take steps to ""combat unauthorized parties and get rid of abusive host and guest conduct"". ""We must do better, and we will. This is unacceptable,"" Mr Chesky added. Three people died at the house, in the city of Orinda, near San Francisco, and two more died later in hospital. The house was reportedly booked under a pretence for a small group, before being publicised on Instagram as the venue for a Halloween party which eventually drew a crowd of more than 100 people. The host did not authorise the party, Airbnb said. All of those who died were under 30. The fifth victim died in hospital on Friday night. By Saturday, police had not arrested or identified any suspects. Officers said they found two guns at the house. Mr Chesky said Airbnb would create a dedicated ""party house"" rapid response team and expand manual screening of high-risk reservations. The company, which is expected to float on the stock market in 2020, would also take action against users who violated its policies, he said. Allow Twitter content?

"The UK will go to the polls for a general election on 12 December Official campaign begins this Wednesday after Parliament is formally shut down Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage confirms he will not be standing as a candidate Government announces benefits freeze will end in 2020 - its latest spending pledge ahead of the start of campaigning Labour vows a massive home improvement programme to cut energy bills and reduce carbon emissions if it wins power Lib Dems make formal complaint after ITV says its head-to-head election debate would only include the Tories and Labour Dulcie Lee and Suzanne Leigh Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon, Boris Johnson, Jo Swinson and Nigel Farage We're finishing our Live coverage for now. Politicians have taken to social media and the airwaves to promote their parties ahead of next month's election.  That's all from us for now, but you can keep up to date with all the news about the electionhere.  The election period may not have officially started, but parties are already getting adverts out to potential supporters on social media. On Facebook, the Conservatives have started a second geographically targeted
campaign, covering 26 constituencies. It covers a mix of seats where the Tories were a close second in
2017 and those where the party currently have fairly safe majorities. The Labour Party also has a new campaign promoting an article in the Guardian, alongside the caption: âBoris
Johnsonâs disastrous Brexit would sell off our NHS to Donald Trump. The NHS
says that means skyrocketing costs for life-saving medicines."" The Lib Dems have two
new campaigns - one about the changes the party would bring if elected and the
other attacking Jeremy Corbyn. There are nine versions
of the advert on Mr Corbyn with a different message on each image. Jeremy Corbyn says climate change will be a big part of his campaign. Speaking to reporters as he campaigns in Putney, he says: ""The green industrial revolution, which we're promoting, will retrofit homes, will create a sustainable energy network in this country, will be a massive contribution of what we've signed up to through the Paris climate change accord. ""It's going to be a big part of it but it's also about land use and farming policies. We cannot go on polluting our planet. ""We cannot go on standing by while climate warming increases, we cannot go on seeing our biodiversity destroyed and diminished.""

Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is out and about campaigning in Wandsworth, London. Speaking about the party's before the election period officially begins, he tells one supporter: ""The numbers of people coming out are bigger than in 2017 at the same stage of the campaign."" BBC News Channel Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics at Kent University, says if Brexit Party candidates were to take ""anywhere as little at 5-6% of the vote"" that would have a ""significant impact"" on Boris Johnson's ability to win a majority. But in what sort of seats might the Brexit Party be a particular threat to the Conservatives? ""I imagine Brexit Party will not stand candidates against ERG [pro-Brexit European Research Group] Eurosceptic politicians within the Conservative Party,"" says Prof Goodwin. This would mark a return to UKIP's strategy in 2010 when they didn't stand candidates against politicians who wanted a referendum on the UK's EU membership, he says. ""If they then were to stand candidates in those all-important marginal seats, where the Conservatives are only a few points behind the Labour Party, that is going to cause a big problem for Boris Johnson."" Most sides have pledged to make their candidates more representative, including bringing more women into the race. However, with the deadline for selections just two weeks away on 14 November, the parties' record in selecting women is mixed - with Labour picking more women, while the Conservatives choose more men. Read the full story here. The Conservative slogan ""Get Brexit done"" suggests a quick and easy path to leaving the EU. But what would getting Brexit done actually involve? Our Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris explains here. Former minister Margot James announces she will not stand in next month's general election. The Stourbridge MP was one of 21 Conservative rebels who were removed from the parliamentary party after voting against the government to back a bill designed to stop a no-deal Brexit. In her resignation letter,external, Ms James says she welcomed the return of the whip last week and had wanted to continue in Parliament. But, as an active campaigner for Remain, she was at odds with her constituency, where 64% of voters backed Brexit. ""I realised that I needed to bring the three-and-a-half-year conflict between the result of the referendum in my constituency, and my own view of where the future interests of the country lie to a close,"" she writes. Read the story in full here. Forget the doorstep, political parties vying for seats in next month's poll will be banking on social media to reach thousands of potential voters.

You've heard of ""wearing your heart on your sleeve"", what about wearing your politics on your... feet? Nigel Farage was snapped on the Andrew Marr show sporting union flag socks: And it's not the first time the Brexit Party leader has appeared on the show in that get-up. Here's another photo dug out of the archives, from 2017: Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Political opponents of Nigel Farage will accuse him of running scared after he said he would not stand as a candidate in December's poll. They will suggest he's not going to run because he thinks he's not going to win. But the flip side is that rather than concentrating on one constituency where he personally might try and win, Mr Farage is making it clear he's going to try and make Boris Johnson's life pretty difficult. That's if this so-called Leave alliance doesn't happen - and it doesn't look like it will. The Brexit Party leader has made it clear he has no interest in getting on board with Mr Johnson's deal at all. It's likely Mr Farage will spend a lot of the campaign really criticising it, whereas the Tory Party leader will say he's got an oven-ready deal to present and get through Parliament within weeks. We've had a plethora of politicians pitching to the electorate this morning as the UK gears up for a general election. Prime ministerBoris Johnsonruled out a pact with any other party, expressed ""deep regret"" over missing the Brexit deadline of 31 October, and said negotiating a future trade deal with the EU should be ""extremely simple"" given the close relationship between the UK and the bloc. Lib Dem leaderJo Swinsonsaid the prime minister ""only had himself to blame"" for missing the deadline, saying his previous ""do or die"" promise was ""stupid"". Meanwhile, Brexit Party leaderNigel Faragesaid he would not stand as a candidate in next month's general election, adding that he will still ""hope and pray"" for a some form of ""Leave alliance"". Scotland's first minister and SNP leaderNicola Sturgeonsaid there was nothing inevitable about the ""mess"" Brexit has become, and said she wants a second referendum on Scottish independence next year. Labour's shadow chancellorJohn McDonnellsaid he did not believe Donald Trump's assurances that he is not looking for the NHS to be part of a future trade deal. And your other questions answered. What happens if bad weather affects turnout? Or if the election returns a hung parliament? How much will this election cost? We answerthese and other questions sent in by readers. Last month, the Electoral Reform Society campaign group asked polling company BMG Research to find out how widespread tactical voting might be. Of 1,500 voters questioned,24% said they planned to vote tactically to keep out a candidate they dislike,external. That compares with 66% who said they would vote for their first preference - regardless of how likely they were to win. The remaining 10% said they didn't know.

"This video can not be played Mr Farage last stood for election in South Thanet in 2015 Nigel Farage has said he will not be standing as a candidate in the general election on 12 December. The Brexit Party leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr he had thought ""very hard"" but had decided he could ""serve the cause better"" by supporting his party's 600 candidates ""across the UK"". ""I don't want to be in politics for the rest of my life,"" he said. Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Farage's decision was ""a bit weird"" given the Brexit Party hopes to stand in most places. The Labour leader said: ""It's obviously his decision. It's a bit weird to lead a political party that is apparently contesting all or most of the seats up in the election and he himself is not offering himself for election."" Mr Farage, who has stood unsuccessfully for Parliament seven times and currently sits in the European Parliament, alsoalso criticised the PM's Brexit deal.. The 55-year-old told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the deal agreed earlier this month was ""virtually worse that being in the EU"". ""If Boris Johnson was going for a genuine Brexit, we wouldn't need to fight against him in this election,"" he said. On Friday, theprime minister rejected an alliance with Mr Farage's Brexit Party, telling BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg doing deals with ""any other party... simply risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10"". A really simple guide to the election,external Who has selected the most women as candidates? Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external Mr Farage had called on the prime minister to drop his Brexit deal, unite in a ""Leave alliance"" or face a Brexit Party candidate in every seat in the election. He told the Marr show: ""I always thought that to win an election, get a big majority so we can get a proper Brexit, a coming-together would be the objective. ""I still hope and pray it happens but it doesn't look like it will."" Mr Johnson maintains that the only way out of the EU is to ""go with the deal we've got"". The prime minister told Sophy Ridge on Sky that he was ""deeply, deeply disappointed"" to miss the 31 October deadline to secure Brexit, calling it ""a matter of deep regret"". The PM had previously said he would rather ""die in a ditch"" than ask the EU to delay Brexit beyond Halloween. Mr Johnson told the programme that he was sorry, and took responsibility, for missing the date, but accused Parliament of failing to implement his deal. He also said Donald Trump was ""patently in error"" when the US president warned the government's Brexit deal would hamper a UK-US trade deal. Mr Farage said Mr Johnson's deal ""kills off any chance of genuine independence"". ""If Boris is determined to stick to this new EU treaty, then that is not Brexit,"" he said. By political correspondent Jessica Parker Political opponents of Nigel Farage will accuse him of running scared after he said he would not stand as a candidate in December's poll. They will suggest he's not going to run because he thinks he's not going to win.

It's likely Mr Farage will spend a lot of the campaign really criticising it, whereas the Tory party leader will say he's got an oven-ready deal to present and get through Parliament within weeks. Treasury minister Rishi Sunak hit back at the criticism of the deal, telling the Andrew Marr show: ""I campaigned for Leave, I spent a lot of time talking to my constituents and others across the North East and in Yorkshire - what do they want from Brexit? ""They want to end free movement and replace it with a points system, they want to end the fact that money keeps going to the EU year after year, they want to make sure we're in control of our laws, and also they want us to have an independent trade policy. These are all things the prime minister's deal delivers. ""What I would say to Nigel Farage is, sometimes in politics, as in life, you've got to take yes for an answer."" Also appearing on the programme, shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested that a Labour government would seek to end privatised contracts in the NHS. He said that, as the contracts ran out, the work should be brought in-house, and that the public didn't want money ""being poured into the pockets of profiteers"". Pushed on whether an incoming Labour government would see the eradication of all privatisation in the NHS, Mr McDonnell said ""we'll see how those contracts run out."" The Conservatives have strongly denied that the NHS is ""up for sale"". Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? NHS claims fact-checked Asked if Labour would scrap the expansion of Heathrow airport, Mr McDonnell said the party would make the decision based on a set of criteria covering the environmental, economic and social impact of the project. ""On the current criteria, we've said very clearly, Heathrow expansion doesn't qualify."" And on taxes, he said Labour would increase income tax for the top 5% of earners and raise corporation tax in order to pay for ""investments in schools and training"".

A really simple guide to the election,external Who has selected the most women as candidates? Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external Mr Farage had called on the prime minister to drop his Brexit deal, unite in a ""Leave alliance"" or face a Brexit Party candidate in every seat in the election. He told the Marr show: ""I always thought that to win an election, get a big majority so we can get a proper Brexit, a coming-together would be the objective. ""I still hope and pray it happens but it doesn't look like it will."" Mr Johnson maintains that the only way out of the EU is to ""go with the deal we've got"". The prime minister told Sophy Ridge on Sky that he was ""deeply, deeply disappointed"" to miss the 31 October deadline to secure Brexit, calling it ""a matter of deep regret"". The PM had previously said he would rather ""die in a ditch"" than ask the EU to delay Brexit beyond Halloween. Mr Johnson told the programme that he was sorry, and took responsibility, for missing the date, but accused Parliament of failing to implement his deal. He also said Donald Trump was ""patently in error"" when the US president warned the government's Brexit deal would hamper a UK-US trade deal. Mr Farage said Mr Johnson's deal ""kills off any chance of genuine independence"". ""If Boris is determined to stick to this new EU treaty, then that is not Brexit,"" he said. By political correspondent Jessica Parker Political opponents of Nigel Farage will accuse him of running scared after he said he would not stand as a candidate in December's poll. They will suggest he's not going to run because he thinks he's not going to win. But the flip side is that rather than concentrating on one constituency where he personally might try to win, Mr Farage is making it clear he's going to try to make Boris Johnson's life pretty difficult. That's if this so-called Leave alliance doesn't happen - and it doesn't look like it will. The Brexit Party leader has made it clear he has no interest in getting on board with Mr Johnson's deal at all. It's likely Mr Farage will spend a lot of the campaign really criticising it, whereas the Tory party leader will say he's got an oven-ready deal to present and get through Parliament within weeks. Treasury minister Rishi Sunak hit back at the criticism of the deal, telling the Andrew Marr show: ""I campaigned for Leave, I spent a lot of time talking to my constituents and others across the North East and in Yorkshire - what do they want from Brexit? ""They want to end free movement and replace it with a points system, they want to end the fact that money keeps going to the EU year after year, they want to make sure we're in control of our laws, and also they want us to have an independent trade policy. These are all things the prime minister's deal delivers. ""What I would say to Nigel Farage is, sometimes in politics, as in life, you've got to take yes for an answer."" Also appearing on the programme, shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested that a Labour government would seek to end privatised contracts in the NHS. He said that, as the contracts ran out, the work should be brought in-house, and that the public didn't want money ""being poured into the pockets of profiteers"". Pushed on whether an incoming Labour government would see the eradication of all privatisation in the NHS, Mr McDonnell said ""we'll see how those contracts run out."" The Conservatives have strongly denied that the NHS is ""up for sale"". Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? NHS claims fact-checked Asked if Labour would scrap the expansion of Heathrow airport, Mr McDonnell said the party would make the decision based on a set of criteria covering the environmental, economic and social impact of the project. ""On the current criteria, we've said very clearly, Heathrow expansion doesn't qualify."" And on taxes, he said Labour would increase income tax for the top 5% of earners and raise corporation tax in order to pay for ""investments in schools and training"".

"Katie Taylor (left) has won five world title belts across two weights Katie Taylor became a two-weight world champion with a classy display as she beat Christina Linardatou on points to land the WBO super-lightweight title. Taylor, 33, boxed and moved stylishly for large spells of her debut at 140lbs and, despite being cut early on, landed a unanimous 96-94 97-93 97-93 win. Linardatou brought pressure throughout but Ireland's Taylor read attacks more easily as the fight progressed. ""I'm making history again,"" said an emotional Taylor. 'The best is yet to come,' says Taylor She was close to tears after the decision at the Manchester Arena, with the crowd serving up a rapturous ovation for a fighter who now owns all four world belts at 135lbs and now this one a division higher. This was Taylor's first outing since shecontroversially beat Delfine Persoon on pointsin June, and there were question marks around whether she could maintain her signature speed at a higher weight. Linardatou was a bundle of movement early on - swaying her upper body left and right, she forced Taylor backwards but walked on to right hands deep into round one. The champion - fighting under a Greek flag - was unquestionably game, so much so that when she slipped in round three she bounced up immediately to attack, only for the referee to call for a momentary pause. Taylor though, cut above the right eye after three rounds, seemingly broke her opponent's heart in the middle rounds as she began to read what was coming at her and counter repeatedly. Linardatou's corner screamed instruction but the movement and boxing IQ before her was winning the day. There were sporadic, often wild, shots that landed on Taylor but she remained poised, picked her punches well - and when things got aggressive in a grapple, dished out rough work of her own. ""Ole, ole, ole, ole,"" sang the crowd in the eighth. This was far from routine but Taylor appeared confident she would take the decision for a 15th win from as many bouts. Her next move will ideally be a unification bout at 140lbs with American Jessica McCaskill, or even more mouth-watering would be a bout with Norway's Cecilia Braekhus, who holds all four belts at 147lbs. Katie Taylor poses with trainer Ross Enamait and the WBO super-lightweight belt The next moves can be debated in the weeks to come. For now, in this sport that serves up hype from week to week, there should be no doubt that in Taylor, Ireland has a phenomenon. This is the athlete who spoke passionately to decision-makers about staging women's boxing at the Olympic Games, the woman who topped the podium in 2012 and who, before the 2016 Games, lost her long-term coach, her dad, in a family breakdown. Her response has been to fight her way - sometimes technically, sometimes doggedly - to five world titles. Those who have watched her in close quarters will speak of an obsessive nature and relentless dedication. Once again she stuck at her task here, her experience for all to see. Her application continues to pay dividends. More belts look set to be conquered and more boundaries broken. BBC Radio 5 Live boxing pundit Steve Bunce It was a brilliant performance by Katie Taylor. She started to find her range after the first two rounds and Linardatou had no idea how to deal with it. It was not a flawless performance but it was pretty close. She isn't just a leader or an icon.

"The UK is gearing up to hold a general election on Thursday. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. A total of 650 people will be chosen asmembers of Parliament (MPs), to decide laws and policies. Members of Parliament are elected by voters to represent the interests of their constituency in the House of Commons. Most belong to a political party, but some do stand as independents. There are 650 MPs in the House. MPs are elected to the House of Commons, one of two chambers of Parliament in London, where the government is based. The government passes laws that help it run the country. This compares with local governments which deal with issues such as bin collections and schools in each area. In a general election, the UK's 46 million voters are invited to choose an MP for their area - one of 650 constituencies. Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, as long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. Older people are more likely than younger ones to vote. At the 2017 general election, 59% of 20- to 24-year-olds voted, compared with 77% of 60- to 69-year-olds. However, about two-thirds of the more than 3.1 million people who registered to vote between the election being called and the registration deadline were under the age of 35, with more than a million of them under 25. Voting takes place at local polling stations, set up in places such as churches and school halls. Voters put a cross on the ballot paper beside the name of their chosen candidate and drop it into a sealed ballot box. Most people over 18 on polling day can stand as a candidate - as long as they are a British citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizen resident in the UK. They must also pay a Â£500 deposit, which will be lost if they do not get at least 5% of the votes in their constituency. Candidates must meet certain conditions - prisoners, civil servants, judges and members of the police and armed forces cannot stand. A total of 3,322 candidates are standing across the 650 seats this year. There are 91 Davids standing for election - the most popular name among the candidates - while the first female name on the list is Sarah in 18th place. There are 22 candidates with that first name standing. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected, even if they are chosen by less than half the electorate in their seat. Most MPs represent a political party but some stand for election as independent candidates. Any party with more than half the MPs (326) in the Commons usually forms the government. Parties with well below 50% of the national vote can take power as a result of theUK's voting system. The UK uses a first past the post voting system. It means a local candidate who receives the most votes wins â and the party with the most winning candidates forms a government. So the overall number of votes parties get nationally does not have any bearing on who wins the election. If no party has a majority of MPs, the one with the most can form a coalition - or partnership - with one or more other parties to gain control. The prime minister is not directly voted for by the public. He or she is chosen by the winning party's MPs and appointed bythe Queen, who is duty bound to follow their advice. The Queen is the UKâs head of state, although she is not in charge of the government. Elizabeth II is the countryâs longest-serving monarch, having ascended to the throne in 1952. She performs state duties, which include formally opening Parliament, representing the country at events such as the annual Remembrance Day parade, and making official visits overseas. She is also head of the armed forces and Church of England. Detailed proposals for everything from the economy to defence and policing are set out before any general election inmanifestos. A manifesto is basically a brochure containing all of a party's ideas and policies. Manifestos are usually published during the general election campaign. If a party wins the election, it is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver as a government. These come from the UK's political parties - groups of people with similar political beliefs who come together to try to win power. The issues UK voters care most about have changed a lot, according to the polls. TheNational Health Service (NHS)and immigration were the things that most concerned voters in 2015. The National Health Service (NHS), which started in 1948, is the government-funded national healthcare service that provides free diagnosis and treatment for UK citizens. TheEuropean Union (EU)was of far less interest. European Union: the political and economic union of 28 member states, which the UK is planning to leave. Now, however,Brexit- the UK's departure from the EU - is a huge issue. Short for British exit - refers to the UK leaving the European Union. Neither the Conservative orLabourparties had enough votes to form a majority government after the 2017 election. The Labour Party was founded by the trade union movement in 1900 to give workers a voice in Parliament. It believes in the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, greater rights for working people and strong, state-run public services. The Conservatives were the bigger of the two parties and formed a partnership with the Democratic Unionist PartyDUPin order to win votes in the Commons. The Democratic Unionist Party was founded in 1971, during the time of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. As unionists, the DUP support Northern Ireland being part of the UK and are known for their socially conservative beliefs on abortion and same-sex marriage. After the 2017 election, DUP MPs helped keep the Conservatives in power by agreeing to support them in Commons votes. Since the election, the Conservatives and Labour have both lost MPs, while theLiberal Democratshave made gains. Often called the Lib Dems, the Liberal Democrats were formed in 1988 by the merger of one of Britain's oldest political institutions, the Liberal Party, which stood for free trade and individual liberty, and the Social Democratic Party, a centrist offshoot of the Labour Party. The party likes to see itself as being on the centre ground of British politics. Parliament's second chamber is theHouse of Lords. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. It is independent from the House of Commons but shares with it the role of making laws, while it also checks the governmentâs work. Members are given a title, such as Lord, are not elected, do not represent constituencies and most do not belong to any party. Its members are not elected but are appointed by the Queen, on the prime minister's advice. On general election day, voting takes place between 07:00 and 22:00. The results are declared through the night and the following day. When the overall result is known, the leader of the winning party, if there is one, visits Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Once they have that, which is a formality, they return to the traditional home of the prime minister10 Downing Street. This terraced house is the official residence and office of the UK prime minister. Often they will stand outside to deliver a speech about their party's plans for the coming years.

"Labour is pledging to end in-work poverty within its first five years in office if it wins the next election. In a speech in London, John McDonnell promised to tackle the issue with a ""structurally different economy"", ""public services free at the point of use"" and a ""strong social safety net"". This includes a ""real living wage"" and stopping the Universal Credit roll-out. But the Conservatives said the policies would ""harm the people [Labour] claim they want to help the most"". Poverty among people who are working has risen since the mid-1990s. The Institute for Fiscal Studiessaid the proportion has gone up from 13% in 1994-95 to 18% in 2017, meaning about eight million people living in working households are in relative poverty. A household is defined as being in relative poverty when its income is less than 60% of the average - less than Â£17,040 a year, on the most recent figures. The IFS research said the rise had been partly driven by higher housing costs and lower earnings growth. What does Labour's poverty pledge mean? I'm in work 'but struggling to get by' UN expert criticises 'tragic' UK poverty In-work poverty hits 2.9 million children Speaking at the Resolution Foundation, the shadow chancellor said his goal was to eradicate poverty, since ""nothing less should be the aim of a socialist government"". While the next Labour government would re-distribute income between the richest and poorest, he said this would only ""paper over the cracks"" unless there were major changes in the way the economy worked to address inequalities in opportunities and productivity. He listed a number of policies -some which have been announced before- that he says will see a Labour government achieve their goal within a Parliamentary term of five years. They include: A network of regional public banks Expanded trade union rights Public services free at the point of use Free buses for young people Free childcare Restoring funding for public libraries, leisure centres and parks ""Behind the concept of social mobility is the belief that poverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it, leaving the others behind,"" he said. ""I reject that completely, and want to see a society with higher living standards for everyone as well as one in which nobody lacks the means to survive or has to choose between life's essentials."" Pledging to end the ""modern-day scourge"" of in-work poverty, he added. ""As chancellor in the next Labour government, I want you to judge me by how much we reduce poverty... how much we create a more equal society... by how much people's lives change for the better."" While immediately ending the most ""damaging"" aspects of Universal Credit, he said Labour would not seek to replicate the system of tax credits, designed to top up the incomes of the lowest-paid, introduced by Gordon Brown when he was chancellor. Instead, a future government would ""take a step back"" and looking at designing a welfare system that helped people ""find work and progress in work"". The main way poverty is assessed is by using a relative measure - ""relative poverty"". It's calculated by taking the median income in the country - that's the midpoint where half of the overall population have income more than that amount and half have less.It was Â£507 a week in 2017-18,external, or Â£437 after housing costs. Then you take 60% of this middle amount and anyone who has less income than this is considered to be living in relative poverty. In 1998-99, 34% of children in the UK were living in relative-poverty households. Today, this proportion is 30%, which represents about 4.1 million children. Statistics on income after housing costs and benefits received are more widely used as this gives a better idea of how much disposable income someone might have. But, some say relative poverty is flawed as a measure because the poverty line moves when average income changes. In times of recession, for example, when lots of people's wages decrease, relative poverty rates improve. Why child poverty targets were missed Campaigners say the benefit freeze in place for most of the past decade has been the biggest factor in exacerbating poverty levels among working families with children. Rather than rising each year in line with inflation, to reflect the rising cost of living, most working-age benefits and tax credits have been frozen in value each year. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says this has pushed 200,000 people into poverty since 2016 and a further 200,000 could follow by 2020. Claire Ainsley, the organisation's executive director, said ending in-work poverty should be the government's ""number one priority after Brexit"". ""In-work poverty is the problem of our times as millions have been swept into poverty through low wages, low hours and rising costs,"" she said. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said it is ""essential"" that the freeze is lifted next year although she had acknowledged it will be up to the next prime minister. But Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis dismissed Labour's wider pledge, saying its plans for the economy ""would lead to worse living standards"". He added: ""Just this week we have seenwages rise by their fastest in 11 years, giving people more money in their pockets, and record numbers of people getting the security of a wage. ""Thanks to (the Conservatives') balanced approach, we've also cut taxes for 32 million people, taking millions of the lowest paid out of paying income tax altogether, and taken action to reduce the cost of living.""

"Boris Johnson has made a series of spending promises both before and after becoming prime minister. How much would all of this cost? The plan:Immediate funds to help prepare the UK for a possible no-deal Brexit on 31 October. What it means:Just over a week after Mr Johnson become prime minister, the Treasury announced that Â£2.1bn would be spent bolstering border and customs operations, stockpiling critical medical supplies and supporting UK nationals abroad. Money will also be spent on a public awareness campaign ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit outcome. The cost:Ramping up no deal preparations will cost Â£2.1bn. This is on top of the Â£4.2bnTheresa May's previous government had already allocated on preparing for Brexit,external- with or without a deal. In total, the Treasury has now made Â£6.3bn available since 2016. The plan:Â£1.85bn for upgrades and new equipment at hospitals in England. What it means:The funding,externalis divided into two parts - Â£1bn will be available immediately to fund existing upgrade projects and tackle urgent needs. The Nuffield Trust has argued that this Â£1bn is money that NHS providers were promised in return for making savings over the past three years and then told they couldn't spend. But it is nonetheless a pot of money that the NHS did not have available to spend before this announcement, which it now can spend. The other Â£850m will be shared over the next five years between 20 hospitals in England to fund things like a new adult mental health inpatient unit in Manchester and four new hospital wards in Norwich. The cost:Successive governments havefailed to spendthe amount they said they would on capital projects, but if this government does manage to spend the full Â£1.85bn over five years, the Barnett formula would also require it to allocate Â£180m for Scotland, Â£110m for Wales and Â£60m for Northern Ireland, taking the total to Â£2.2bn. The plan:Hire an extra 20,000 police officers by 2022. What it means:There are 122,000 police officers in England and Wales, down from 143,000 in 2010 when Theresa May became home secretary. Mr Johnson repeated in Downing Street his plan to reverse almost all of those cuts. There has been some dispute about the link between police numbers and levels of violent crime, with Theresa May saying there was not a direct link. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said there is ""some link"" between the two. The cost:Mr Johnson has given a figure of Â£1.1bn. For police officers outside London,the lowest pay,externalwas about Â£25,400 in 2016 (although this differs from force to force). That comes to Â£500m a year but these costs will increase once they complete training, which takes about two years. Typically, after four years, the pay will increase to Â£33,700 (again outside London) - so almost Â£700m but this doesn't account for training costs. The Nottinghamshire police force,externalestimated recruitment and training to be about Â£13,000 per officer in 2012 (not including salary received during training). This would come in at about Â£258m for 20,000 new officers but again this would differ from force to force. Conservative MP Kit Malthouse, who supports Mr Johnson, says part-time special constables, who already have police training, would be recruited to become police officers, to help alleviate training costs. The plan:Create an extra 10,000 prison places in England and Wales. What it means:Michael Gove announced,externalthe building of 10,000 new prison places in 2015 and it was a commitment in the Conservative Party's manifesto for the 2017 election. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has now told BBC News that the government is only planning to create about 3,500 of those and that the extra 10,000 will start from now - so about 6,500 of the previously announced places have clearly been scrapped. ""By the end of the programme in the mid-2020s we'll have delivered about 13,500 extra prison places,"" he said. The first new prison will be built at HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire where there is already a maximum security prison. The new prison at Full Sutton was previouslyannounced in 2017. The cost:The programme is supposed to cost ""up to Â£2.5bn"" by the mid-2020s. That's the cost of building or refurbishing cells, not the ongoing cost of running them, which has not yet been announced. The justice secretary maintains that ""this is new money"", but it is not clear how much of the Â£1.3bn previously allocated to building 10,000 new prison places has been spent so far. If Â£2.5bn is actually spent then underthe Barnett formulaabout an extra Â£300m would need to be allocated to Scotland and Northern Ireland. The plan:It is currently government policy,externalto have full-fibre broadband across the UK by 2033 - Mr Johnson says he will have it done by 2025. What it means:Having full-fibre broadband means getting high-speed optical cables going into buildings so there is no use of copper cables. The telecoms regulatorOfcom said,externalthat in May only 7% of UK properties had full-fibre broadband. Increasing that to 100% in six years would be a big project and there has been no detail so far of how Mr Johnson plans to do it. The cost:Mr Johnson has said that government money would be needed to make this happen but has not specified how much. Commercial operators could be expected to fund this work in densely populated areas where they could expect to get a decent rate of return. But in more remote areas, there may have to be government subsidies. The government's current plan,externalestimates that getting full-fibre broadband to the most remote 10% of properties will require it to spend between Â£3bn and Â£5bn - it is reasonable to assume that doing it in six years instead of 14 years would increase that cost. Figures of about Â£30bn have been cited but it is not clear how much of that would be government money and how much would come from commercial investment. The plan:Level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools in England What it means:Mr Johnson wants to make sure per pupil funding is at least Â£5,000 in secondary schools across the country. He also said he wanted to increase funding in primary schools. And there were hints during the leadership campaign that he would reverse previous cuts to school spending, which would be considerably more expensive. MPs on the education select committee saidthat ""a multi-billion cash injection"" was needed. The cost:Taking per pupil funding to Â£5,000 in secondary schools would be relatively cheap - about Â£50m a year. Reversing previous cuts to spending was estimated during the campaign to cost about Â£4.6bn, although teaching unions have said that schools need an extra Â£12.6bn. The plan:Raise the higher income tax rate from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. What it means:At the moment,individuals have to pay 40% income tax on any earnings above Â£50,000,external. So, a person earning Â£55,000 a year, pays 40% on Â£5,000. Under Mr Johnson's plan - outlined during the leadership campaign but not set out in detail since - the point at which the 40% higher rate kicks in would be raised to Â£80,000. This would not benefit Scottish workers because the Scottish government sets its own income tax rates and bands. Mr Johnson also wants to raise the point at which people start paying National Insurance, absorbing some of the cost by also raising the point at which they stop paying NI. National Insurance is a separate tax. It's paid for by workers and companies and is meant to fund state benefits, such as the NHS. Under this new tax regime, someone earning Â£60,000 a year could benefit by Â£1,000 a year, while someone on Â£80,000 or more would gain a maximum of Â£3,000 (because some of the benefits would be lost because of National Insurance increases).

But it's wealthy pensioners who stand to benefit the most - up to Â£6,000 each, according to analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That's because pensioners don't pay National Insurance to begin with. So, if someone already receives a generous work pension, not only would they be subject to less income tax (up to the new threshold), they also would not be affected by the changes to National Insurance. The cost:Changing the tax system in this way would cost about Â£10bn a year, according to Mr Johnson. He says the bill could be funded from Â£26.6bn of ""fiscal headroom"". This ""headroom"" refers to government borrowing, which came in lower than originally expected and had been earmarked by the chancellor for no-deal Brexit planning. However, if Mr Johnson chooses to fund his tax changes with this Â£26.6bn, it would not amount to a permanent solution. That's because the money can be spent once only. So, to pay for the policy in the long term, Mr Johnson would need to raise taxes elsewhere, announce spending cuts or continue to fund it from government borrowing. The plan:Mr Johnson has spoken favourably about cutting corporation tax but has not been specific about how much he would like to cut it by. What it means:The corporation tax rate, which is the tax companies pay on their profits, has been cut from 28% in 2010 to the current rate of 19%. It is due to fall again, to 17%, next year. While the other candidate in the leadership election, Jeremy Hunt, wanted to cut the rate further to 12.5%, Mr Johnson was not as specific. The cost:Mr Johnson claimed at a hustings in Darlington that every time corporation tax has been cut in this country, the amount of revenue raised has increased. That is not the case.While there have been occasions since 2010 when corporation tax has been cut and revenue has risen, in the years after the rate was cut in 2008, revenue fell. The government currently estimates that an extra one percentage point cut in corporation tax would cost Â£3.1bn in 2022-23. In the longer term, some of that money would be clawed back in extra investment, wages or consumption.

That's all from us for now, but you can keep up to date with all the news about the electionhere.  The election period may not have officially started, but parties are already getting adverts out to potential supporters on social media. On Facebook, the Conservatives have started a second geographically targeted
campaign, covering 26 constituencies. It covers a mix of seats where the Tories were a close second in
2017 and those where the party currently have fairly safe majorities. The Labour Party also has a new campaign promoting an article in the Guardian, alongside the caption: âBoris
Johnsonâs disastrous Brexit would sell off our NHS to Donald Trump. The NHS
says that means skyrocketing costs for life-saving medicines."" The Lib Dems have two
new campaigns - one about the changes the party would bring if elected and the
other attacking Jeremy Corbyn. There are nine versions
of the advert on Mr Corbyn with a different message on each image. Jeremy Corbyn says climate change will be a big part of his campaign. Speaking to reporters as he campaigns in Putney, he says: ""The green industrial revolution, which we're promoting, will retrofit homes, will create a sustainable energy network in this country, will be a massive contribution of what we've signed up to through the Paris climate change accord. ""It's going to be a big part of it but it's also about land use and farming policies. We cannot go on polluting our planet. ""We cannot go on standing by while climate warming increases, we cannot go on seeing our biodiversity destroyed and diminished.""

Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is out and about campaigning in Wandsworth, London. Speaking about the party's before the election period officially begins, he tells one supporter: ""The numbers of people coming out are bigger than in 2017 at the same stage of the campaign."" BBC News Channel Matthew Goodwin, professor of politics at Kent University, says if Brexit Party candidates were to take ""anywhere as little at 5-6% of the vote"" that would have a ""significant impact"" on Boris Johnson's ability to win a majority. But in what sort of seats might the Brexit Party be a particular threat to the Conservatives? ""I imagine Brexit Party will not stand candidates against ERG [pro-Brexit European Research Group] Eurosceptic politicians within the Conservative Party,"" says Prof Goodwin. This would mark a return to UKIP's strategy in 2010 when they didn't stand candidates against politicians who wanted a referendum on the UK's EU membership, he says. ""If they then were to stand candidates in those all-important marginal seats, where the Conservatives are only a few points behind the Labour Party, that is going to cause a big problem for Boris Johnson."" Most sides have pledged to make their candidates more representative, including bringing more women into the race. However, with the deadline for selections just two weeks away on 14 November, the parties' record in selecting women is mixed - with Labour picking more women, while the Conservatives choose more men. Read the full story here. The Conservative slogan ""Get Brexit done"" suggests a quick and easy path to leaving the EU. But what would getting Brexit done actually involve? Our Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris explains here. Former minister Margot James announces she will not stand in next month's general election. The Stourbridge MP was one of 21 Conservative rebels who were removed from the parliamentary party after voting against the government to back a bill designed to stop a no-deal Brexit. In her resignation letter,external, Ms James says she welcomed the return of the whip last week and had wanted to continue in Parliament. But, as an active campaigner for Remain, she was at odds with her constituency, where 64% of voters backed Brexit. ""I realised that I needed to bring the three-and-a-half-year conflict between the result of the referendum in my constituency, and my own view of where the future interests of the country lie to a close,"" she writes.

How Queer as Folk broke the mould for gay people on TV Years & Years singer to play man 'in shadow of Aids' ""We've always been there, behind the scenes, making the sensible decisions for thousand of years. Just saying: 'If you built that on the left it would all be so much better'... [or] 'Hadrian just move that wall a little bit' - there was undoubtedly a gay man there saying: 'Just don't go all the way!'"" ""But now as an out society we are less than 50 years old really, and that's nothing,"" he went on. ""That's tiny little babies and there are things that we've felt, things that we've said, emotions in our hearts that have not been put on screen yet or on the page or into fiction."" The 56-year-old suggested it was as important for modern writers to show there are things that gay people feel, say and do ""that are identical to other people"". ""That needs saying as well, that we are exactly the same,"" he declared. ""It's all there to celebrated. It's wonderful, it's rich open territory."" Growing up as a ""wimpish gay boy"" in Swansea in the '60s and '70s, Davies told Laverne that his father was ""brilliant"" about the fact he didn't want to play rugby like a lot of the other lads. He also spoke about finding a passion for drama when he joined the West Glamorgan Youth Theatre company, and his recent TV hits, including A Very English Scandal and the dystopian series Years and Years. A Very 'bone-chilling' English Scandal Hugh Grant, politics and a murdered dog ""The world itself is getting madder and faster and stranger and I wanted to capture that on screen."" His song selections to take to that famous mythical island, included Kate Bush's Wuthering Heights and ""the greatest club track of all"" - Hold That Sucker Down (builds like a skyscraper mix) by OT Quartet, which featured in his ground-breaking and semi-autobiographical Channel 4 series, about the lives of three gay young men in Manchester. ELO's Mr Blue Sky also featured as it was the track that was playing when he and his late husband Andrew walked down the aisle. Or at least is was before the record cut out, hilariously. Davies spoke movingly about stopping work to look after his ""truly extraordinary"" partner, who died of brain cancer last year. Doctor Who writer quits to help partner ""It was hard and also it was an honour to be the person doing that,"" he said of becoming Andrew's carer, following a series of debilitating operations. Doctors had given him just 18 months to live but he survived for another eight years - ""the happiest years"" of their marriage. ""They were so intimate and honest and everything else just falls away and there's no nonsense - there's it's just you and him."" Davies added: ""If you'd have asked me at the time what's it like to be a carer, thinking 'year four', I'd have been going [it's] 'driving me a bit mad, I wouldn't mind a bit of freedom'. ""Now I've got the freedom, I'd chuck away that freedom away in an instant just to have five more minutes sitting watching the television with him."" Davies confirmed it had been a boyhood dream come true when he was asked to re-launch Dr Who in the mid-noughties for a new generation. Russell T Davies with Doctor Who actors Chrisopher Ecclestone and Billie Piper in 2004 He daydreamed that if he had his own personal Tardis now, he'd go back to 1998 to the ""magic moment"" he and Andrew - ""the nicest man in the world"" - met in a nightclub in Manchester's Canal Street. ""He will be in every good man I ever write now."" Finally, as is tradition on the show, this week's castaway was allowed to select a book and a luxury item. He plumped for ""the finest book ever made"", Asterix and the Roman Agent, as well as a box of black Ball Pentel pens - ""for the artist in me"".

"The committee said the Department of Health must take ""immediate action to tackle acute issues facing the health service"" Health services in Northern Ireland risk ""deteriorating to the point of collapse"" without a long-term funding strategy to support transformation, a report by a Westminster committee has said. It said services are struggling to meet the needs of an ageing population. The report added that the services are ""lacking adequate financial support or strategic guidance"". The Department of Health said it would carefully consider the recommendations. The warning comes as the department spelled out the scale of the budgetary pressures it faces in a letter to Northern Ireland's political parties. Â£1bn 'needed to eradicate Northern Ireland waiting lists' Bengoa Review: Ambitious health care shake-up unveiled The Westminister committeereport,external, by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, said key services, ""in particular cancer, social care and mental health"", lack comprehensive strategies to guide their future direction. It added that the Department of Health ""must do more to demonstrate its commitment to developing long-term strategies for these services"". The committee said the department must also take immediate action to tackle ""acute issues facing the health service"". These, it said, include cancer waiting times, shortages in social care staffing and inadequate mental health funding. The report said decisions over health services in Northern Ireland are the responsibility of the health minister in the Northern Ireland Executive, but that if the Northern Ireland Assembly was not formed by the end of the year, the government will need to take action. In a letter to MLAs, the department spelled out how many millions are needed to train new doctors and nurses A government spokesperson said health and social care services in Northern Ireland were ""a devolved matter"". The spokesperson added that Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith had visited a number of health and social care facilities and ""fully understands the pressures that the sectors are facing"". ""That is why he is doing everything he can to get the Stormont institutions back up and running as soon as possible, in order that local politicians make decisions affecting everyone in Northern Ireland. ""The secretary of state will consider the recommendations contained in the report and respond in due course."" The letter, meanwhile, which the Department of Health sent to MLAs who lead on health in Northern Ireland's political parties, spells out the specific pressures under which it is operating. The issues include: Waiting Lists - the department estimates that about Â£100m a year would be required to tackle hospital backlogs; Pay parity - the department says that offering Northern Ireland staff parity with wages in Great Britain would add Â£103m to the bill; Employers' contributions to staff pensions - this is a UK-wide issue and could cost Â£144m; Ambulance service - an investment of up to Â£30m is needed for its new clinical response model; Medical training - up to Â£30m is needed to support graduate entry medical training places; Specialist drugs and therapies - including specific cancer therapies - could cost up to Â£26.8m; Nursing places - maintaining these could cost up to Â£42m in future years. Simon Hoare said the committee expected ""more regular updates"" on progress Northern Ireland Affairs Committee chair Simon Hoare said the health service in Northern Ireland was falling behind the rest of the UK. ""An approach to funding that simply keeps things ticking over, and an absence of over-arching strategy in key areas, has left services at breaking point and this situation must end as soon as possible,"" he said. ""We have called for the government to end the insecurity and set three year minimum budget allocations to give vital services the space to breathe and look ahead. ""We also expect more regular updates on the progress in developing strategies in key areas, particularly cancer services and mental health."" One of the key findings of the committee was that the ""transformation of Northern Ireland's health and social care services is long overdue"". The report said services are struggling to meet the needs of an ageing population It said the recommendations ofthe Bengoa ReportandDelivering Together,externalare urgently needed if services are to keep pace with the ""increasingly complex and evolving needs of an ageing population"". It said the UK government should also work with the Department of Health and Department of Finance to produce three-year minimum budget allocations.

"Katie Taylor (left) has won five world title belts across two weights Katie Taylor became a two-weight world champion with a classy display as she beat Christina Linardatou on points to land the WBO super-lightweight title. Taylor, 33, boxed and moved stylishly for large spells of her debut at 140lbs and, despite being cut early on, landed a unanimous 96-94 97-93 97-93 win. Linardatou brought pressure throughout but Ireland's Taylor read attacks more easily as the fight progressed. ""I'm making history again,"" said an emotional Taylor. 'The best is yet to come,' says Taylor She was close to tears after the decision at the Manchester Arena, with the crowd serving up a rapturous ovation for a fighter who now owns all four world belts at 135lbs and now this one a division higher. This was Taylor's first outing since shecontroversially beat Delfine Persoon on pointsin June, and there were question marks around whether she could maintain her signature speed at a higher weight. Linardatou was a bundle of movement early on - swaying her upper body left and right, she forced Taylor backwards but walked on to right hands deep into round one. The champion - fighting under a Greek flag - was unquestionably game, so much so that when she slipped in round three she bounced up immediately to attack, only for the referee to call for a momentary pause. Taylor though, cut above the right eye after three rounds, seemingly broke her opponent's heart in the middle rounds as she began to read what was coming at her and counter repeatedly. Linardatou's corner screamed instruction but the movement and boxing IQ before her was winning the day. There were sporadic, often wild, shots that landed on Taylor but she remained poised, picked her punches well - and when things got aggressive in a grapple, dished out rough work of her own. ""Ole, ole, ole, ole,"" sang the crowd in the eighth. This was far from routine but Taylor appeared confident she would take the decision for a 15th win from as many bouts. Her next move will ideally be a unification bout at 140lbs with American Jessica McCaskill, or even more mouth-watering would be a bout with Norway's Cecilia Braekhus, who holds all four belts at 147lbs. Katie Taylor poses with trainer Ross Enamait and the WBO super-lightweight belt The next moves can be debated in the weeks to come. For now, in this sport that serves up hype from week to week, there should be no doubt that in Taylor, Ireland has a phenomenon. This is the athlete who spoke passionately to decision-makers about staging women's boxing at the Olympic Games, the woman who topped the podium in 2012 and who, before the 2016 Games, lost her long-term coach, her dad, in a family breakdown. Her response has been to fight her way - sometimes technically, sometimes doggedly - to five world titles. Those who have watched her in close quarters will speak of an obsessive nature and relentless dedication. Once again she stuck at her task here, her experience for all to see. Her application continues to pay dividends. More belts look set to be conquered and more boundaries broken. BBC Radio 5 Live boxing pundit Steve Bunce It was a brilliant performance by Katie Taylor. She started to find her range after the first two rounds and Linardatou had no idea how to deal with it. It was not a flawless performance but it was pretty close. She isn't just a leader or an icon.

"A US judge said the proposal would cause ""irreparable harm"" to families A US judge has temporarily blocked a rule proposed by President Donald Trump that would require immigrants to prove they will have health insurance within 30 days of arrival in the US, or can pay for medical care. Judge Michael Simon, a district judge in Oregon, granted a preliminary injunction against the proposal. Seven American citizens and an NGO had filed a lawsuit opposing the rule. They argued it would block hundreds of thousands of legal migrants. The lawsuit said the number of immigrants who enter the US with family-sponsored visas would drop considerably, or be eliminated altogether. Trump 'suggested shooting migrants in the legs' Trump targets legal migrants who get food aid Judge Simon said the potential damage to families justified a US-wide ban. ""Facing a likely risk of being separated from their family members and a delay in obtaining a visa to which family members would otherwise be entitled is irreparable harm,"" his legal order read. This video can not be played President Trump wants to move away from an immigration system that favours people with family ties to the US Would-be immigrants had been struggling to establish how to get the required insurance coverage. The US healthcare system is complex, and has not generally catered to people yet to arrive there. The policy is part of Mr Trump's effort to shift the US away from a family-focused immigration system. Trump vows 'merit-based' immigration rules US Democrat Warren sets out health plan funding Judge Simon's 28-day temporary restraining order will prevent the rule from coming into effect on 3 November, but the legal battle is likely to continue. The Trump administration has argued that legal immigrants are about three times more likely to lack health insurance than US citizens, and that taxpayers should not bear their medical costs. However, US policy experts say immigrants are less likely to use the healthcare system than American citizens. Research from George Washington University found that recent immigrants without insurance made up less than a tenth of 1% of US medical fees in 2017.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump arrived to a rowdy reception from the crowd Donald Trump was met with raucous boos - and some cheers - on Saturday as he attended the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in New York. The US president attended the Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) event with high-ranking Republicans and his sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. A small anti-Trump protest was held at the Madison Square Garden arena. It comes less than a week after the president was booed at the baseball World Series in Washington DC. This video can not be played Trump booed at Washington DC baseball match Chants of ""lock him up"" echoed around the stadium earlier in the week -  a reference to a chant sometimes heard at Mr Trump's political rallies, which calls for the imprisonment of his former presidential rival Hillary Clinton. The reception was mixed on Saturday night, however, with cheers and clapping heard from some spectators, and boos and profanities from others. Allow Twitter content?

Signs reading ""Remove Trump"" and ""Impeach Trump"" were also spotted in the crowd. Mr Trump is currently facing an impeachment probe relating to allegations he pressured Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his rival in the 2020 White House race, former Vice President Joe Biden. As video of the crowd spread on social media, his son Donald Jr hit back on Twitter, saying the reception had been ""overwhelmingly positive"" and that UFC President Dana White - a long-time friend of the president's - had called it ""the most electrifying entrance he's seen in 25 years"". UFC, or the Ultimate Fighting Championship, is an American MMA promotion company. Its first mixed martial arts event was held in 1993. From humble beginnings, it now boasts millions of fans worldwide and has produced superstar fighters like Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey. Mr Trump hosted UFC events decades ago, when the sport was shunned by most venues and mainstream media. ""I would never say anything negative about Donald Trump because he was there when other people weren't,"" said Dana White, who spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention in support of Mr Trump's presidential campaign.

"A white Nissan Qashqai hit the Spinnaker Inn in Hythe Quay, Colchester A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man died when a car hit a pub in Essex. Police said a 36-year-old man died when the white Nissan Qashqai hit the Spinnaker Inn in Hythe Quay, Colchester, at about 00:30 GMT. Three others who had been at the pub were taken to hospital, including a man who has life-changing injuries. The 40-year-old man is also being held on suspicion of grievous bodily harm, death by dangerous driving and assault. Police urged anyone with dashcam and mobile phone footage of the crash to contact them Police said the seriously injured 34-year-old man was taken to hospital, along with a 34-year-old woman and a 33-year-old man who both had minor injuries. Officers urged anyone who saw a white Nissan Qashqai before the crash to contact them, along with anyone in the pub who they have not spoken to. They are also appealing for dashcam and mobile phone footage. The road was closed for seven hours and reopened at 09:00. One man said that his friend was taken to hospital by helicopter with two broken legs, two broken hips and possibly a broken sternum. He added: ""He has injuries from the waist down, and someone was saying maybe head injuries, but I'm waiting for updates at the moment. ""He was with a group of about four people."" By Jenny Kirk, BBC News The car has destroyed a wooden fence attached to the pub, which is the seating area for smokers. You can see it has hit the brickwork as well.

""I went to sleep at about 23:00, all of a sudden, about an hour or two later, we heard a massive bang. ""Because it was Halloween and Guy Fawkes, we put it down to fireworks. We didn't think anything of it and went back to sleep,"" he said. ""Then we woke up to this kind of carnage, it's bad.""

"Labour is pledging to end in-work poverty within its first five years in office if it wins the next election. In a speech in London, John McDonnell promised to tackle the issue with a ""structurally different economy"", ""public services free at the point of use"" and a ""strong social safety net"". This includes a ""real living wage"" and stopping the Universal Credit roll-out. But the Conservatives said the policies would ""harm the people [Labour] claim they want to help the most"". Poverty among people who are working has risen since the mid-1990s. The Institute for Fiscal Studiessaid the proportion has gone up from 13% in 1994-95 to 18% in 2017, meaning about eight million people living in working households are in relative poverty. A household is defined as being in relative poverty when its income is less than 60% of the average - less than Â£17,040 a year, on the most recent figures. The IFS research said the rise had been partly driven by higher housing costs and lower earnings growth. What does Labour's poverty pledge mean? I'm in work 'but struggling to get by' UN expert criticises 'tragic' UK poverty In-work poverty hits 2.9 million children Speaking at the Resolution Foundation, the shadow chancellor said his goal was to eradicate poverty, since ""nothing less should be the aim of a socialist government"". While the next Labour government would re-distribute income between the richest and poorest, he said this would only ""paper over the cracks"" unless there were major changes in the way the economy worked to address inequalities in opportunities and productivity. He listed a number of policies -some which have been announced before- that he says will see a Labour government achieve their goal within a Parliamentary term of five years. They include: A network of regional public banks Expanded trade union rights Public services free at the point of use Free buses for young people Free childcare Restoring funding for public libraries, leisure centres and parks ""Behind the concept of social mobility is the belief that poverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it, leaving the others behind,"" he said. ""I reject that completely, and want to see a society with higher living standards for everyone as well as one in which nobody lacks the means to survive or has to choose between life's essentials."" Pledging to end the ""modern-day scourge"" of in-work poverty, he added. ""As chancellor in the next Labour government, I want you to judge me by how much we reduce poverty... how much we create a more equal society... by how much people's lives change for the better."" While immediately ending the most ""damaging"" aspects of Universal Credit, he said Labour would not seek to replicate the system of tax credits, designed to top up the incomes of the lowest-paid, introduced by Gordon Brown when he was chancellor. Instead, a future government would ""take a step back"" and looking at designing a welfare system that helped people ""find work and progress in work"". The main way poverty is assessed is by using a relative measure - ""relative poverty"". It's calculated by taking the median income in the country - that's the midpoint where half of the overall population have income more than that amount and half have less.It was Â£507 a week in 2017-18,external, or Â£437 after housing costs. Then you take 60% of this middle amount and anyone who has less income than this is considered to be living in relative poverty. In 1998-99, 34% of children in the UK were living in relative-poverty households. Today, this proportion is 30%, which represents about 4.1 million children. Statistics on income after housing costs and benefits received are more widely used as this gives a better idea of how much disposable income someone might have. But, some say relative poverty is flawed as a measure because the poverty line moves when average income changes. In times of recession, for example, when lots of people's wages decrease, relative poverty rates improve. Why child poverty targets were missed Campaigners say the benefit freeze in place for most of the past decade has been the biggest factor in exacerbating poverty levels among working families with children. Rather than rising each year in line with inflation, to reflect the rising cost of living, most working-age benefits and tax credits have been frozen in value each year. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says this has pushed 200,000 people into poverty since 2016 and a further 200,000 could follow by 2020. Claire Ainsley, the organisation's executive director, said ending in-work poverty should be the government's ""number one priority after Brexit"". ""In-work poverty is the problem of our times as millions have been swept into poverty through low wages, low hours and rising costs,"" she said. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said it is ""essential"" that the freeze is lifted next year although she had acknowledged it will be up to the next prime minister. But Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis dismissed Labour's wider pledge, saying its plans for the economy ""would lead to worse living standards"". He added: ""Just this week we have seenwages rise by their fastest in 11 years, giving people more money in their pockets, and record numbers of people getting the security of a wage. ""Thanks to (the Conservatives') balanced approach, we've also cut taxes for 32 million people, taking millions of the lowest paid out of paying income tax altogether, and taken action to reduce the cost of living.""

"Labour is pledging to end in-work poverty within its first five years in office if it wins the next election.

"Boris Johnson has made a series of spending promises both before and after becoming prime minister. How much would all of this cost? The plan:Immediate funds to help prepare the UK for a possible no-deal Brexit on 31 October. What it means:Just over a week after Mr Johnson become prime minister, the Treasury announced that Â£2.1bn would be spent bolstering border and customs operations, stockpiling critical medical supplies and supporting UK nationals abroad. Money will also be spent on a public awareness campaign ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit outcome. The cost:Ramping up no deal preparations will cost Â£2.1bn. This is on top of the Â£4.2bnTheresa May's previous government had already allocated on preparing for Brexit,external- with or without a deal. In total, the Treasury has now made Â£6.3bn available since 2016. The plan:Â£1.85bn for upgrades and new equipment at hospitals in England. What it means:The funding,externalis divided into two parts - Â£1bn will be available immediately to fund existing upgrade projects and tackle urgent needs. The Nuffield Trust has argued that this Â£1bn is money that NHS providers were promised in return for making savings over the past three years and then told they couldn't spend. But it is nonetheless a pot of money that the NHS did not have available to spend before this announcement, which it now can spend. The other Â£850m will be shared over the next five years between 20 hospitals in England to fund things like a new adult mental health inpatient unit in Manchester and four new hospital wards in Norwich. The cost:Successive governments havefailed to spendthe amount they said they would on capital projects, but if this government does manage to spend the full Â£1.85bn over five years, the Barnett formula would also require it to allocate Â£180m for Scotland, Â£110m for Wales and Â£60m for Northern Ireland, taking the total to Â£2.2bn. The plan:Hire an extra 20,000 police officers by 2022. What it means:There are 122,000 police officers in England and Wales, down from 143,000 in 2010 when Theresa May became home secretary. Mr Johnson repeated in Downing Street his plan to reverse almost all of those cuts. There has been some dispute about the link between police numbers and levels of violent crime, with Theresa May saying there was not a direct link. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said there is ""some link"" between the two. The cost:Mr Johnson has given a figure of Â£1.1bn. For police officers outside London,the lowest pay,externalwas about Â£25,400 in 2016 (although this differs from force to force). That comes to Â£500m a year but these costs will increase once they complete training, which takes about two years. Typically, after four years, the pay will increase to Â£33,700 (again outside London) - so almost Â£700m but this doesn't account for training costs. The Nottinghamshire police force,externalestimated recruitment and training to be about Â£13,000 per officer in 2012 (not including salary received during training). This would come in at about Â£258m for 20,000 new officers but again this would differ from force to force. Conservative MP Kit Malthouse, who supports Mr Johnson, says part-time special constables, who already have police training, would be recruited to become police officers, to help alleviate training costs. The plan:Create an extra 10,000 prison places in England and Wales. What it means:Michael Gove announced,externalthe building of 10,000 new prison places in 2015 and it was a commitment in the Conservative Party's manifesto for the 2017 election. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has now told BBC News that the government is only planning to create about 3,500 of those and that the extra 10,000 will start from now - so about 6,500 of the previously announced places have clearly been scrapped. ""By the end of the programme in the mid-2020s we'll have delivered about 13,500 extra prison places,"" he said. The first new prison will be built at HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire where there is already a maximum security prison. The new prison at Full Sutton was previouslyannounced in 2017. The cost:The programme is supposed to cost ""up to Â£2.5bn"" by the mid-2020s. That's the cost of building or refurbishing cells, not the ongoing cost of running them, which has not yet been announced. The justice secretary maintains that ""this is new money"", but it is not clear how much of the Â£1.3bn previously allocated to building 10,000 new prison places has been spent so far. If Â£2.5bn is actually spent then underthe Barnett formulaabout an extra Â£300m would need to be allocated to Scotland and Northern Ireland. The plan:It is currently government policy,externalto have full-fibre broadband across the UK by 2033 - Mr Johnson says he will have it done by 2025. What it means:Having full-fibre broadband means getting high-speed optical cables going into buildings so there is no use of copper cables. The telecoms regulatorOfcom said,externalthat in May only 7% of UK properties had full-fibre broadband. Increasing that to 100% in six years would be a big project and there has been no detail so far of how Mr Johnson plans to do it. The cost:Mr Johnson has said that government money would be needed to make this happen but has not specified how much. Commercial operators could be expected to fund this work in densely populated areas where they could expect to get a decent rate of return. But in more remote areas, there may have to be government subsidies. The government's current plan,externalestimates that getting full-fibre broadband to the most remote 10% of properties will require it to spend between Â£3bn and Â£5bn - it is reasonable to assume that doing it in six years instead of 14 years would increase that cost. Figures of about Â£30bn have been cited but it is not clear how much of that would be government money and how much would come from commercial investment. The plan:Level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools in England What it means:Mr Johnson wants to make sure per pupil funding is at least Â£5,000 in secondary schools across the country. He also said he wanted to increase funding in primary schools. And there were hints during the leadership campaign that he would reverse previous cuts to school spending, which would be considerably more expensive. MPs on the education select committee saidthat ""a multi-billion cash injection"" was needed. The cost:Taking per pupil funding to Â£5,000 in secondary schools would be relatively cheap - about Â£50m a year. Reversing previous cuts to spending was estimated during the campaign to cost about Â£4.6bn, although teaching unions have said that schools need an extra Â£12.6bn. The plan:Raise the higher income tax rate from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. What it means:At the moment,individuals have to pay 40% income tax on any earnings above Â£50,000,external. So, a person earning Â£55,000 a year, pays 40% on Â£5,000. Under Mr Johnson's plan - outlined during the leadership campaign but not set out in detail since - the point at which the 40% higher rate kicks in would be raised to Â£80,000. This would not benefit Scottish workers because the Scottish government sets its own income tax rates and bands. Mr Johnson also wants to raise the point at which people start paying National Insurance, absorbing some of the cost by also raising the point at which they stop paying NI. National Insurance is a separate tax. It's paid for by workers and companies and is meant to fund state benefits, such as the NHS. Under this new tax regime, someone earning Â£60,000 a year could benefit by Â£1,000 a year, while someone on Â£80,000 or more would gain a maximum of Â£3,000 (because some of the benefits would be lost because of National Insurance increases). What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Laura Kuenssberg: 'Hard part' begins as Johnson wins contest Is there a Brexit war chest? But it's wealthy pensioners who stand to benefit the most - up to Â£6,000 each, according to analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That's because pensioners don't pay National Insurance to begin with. So, if someone already receives a generous work pension, not only would they be subject to less income tax (up to the new threshold), they also would not be affected by the changes to National Insurance. The cost:Changing the tax system in this way would cost about Â£10bn a year, according to Mr Johnson. He says the bill could be funded from Â£26.6bn of ""fiscal headroom"". This ""headroom"" refers to government borrowing, which came in lower than originally expected and had been earmarked by the chancellor for no-deal Brexit planning. However, if Mr Johnson chooses to fund his tax changes with this Â£26.6bn, it would not amount to a permanent solution. That's because the money can be spent once only. So, to pay for the policy in the long term, Mr Johnson would need to raise taxes elsewhere, announce spending cuts or continue to fund it from government borrowing. The plan:Mr Johnson has spoken favourably about cutting corporation tax but has not been specific about how much he would like to cut it by. What it means:The corporation tax rate, which is the tax companies pay on their profits, has been cut from 28% in 2010 to the current rate of 19%. It is due to fall again, to 17%, next year. While the other candidate in the leadership election, Jeremy Hunt, wanted to cut the rate further to 12.5%, Mr Johnson was not as specific. The cost:Mr Johnson claimed at a hustings in Darlington that every time corporation tax has been cut in this country, the amount of revenue raised has increased. That is not the case.While there have been occasions since 2010 when corporation tax has been cut and revenue has risen, in the years after the rate was cut in 2008, revenue fell. The government currently estimates that an extra one percentage point cut in corporation tax would cost Â£3.1bn in 2022-23. In the longer term, some of that money would be clawed back in extra investment, wages or consumption.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland at a ""crossroads moment"" Thousands of independence supporters have heard Nicola Sturgeon call for ""Scotland's future to be put into Scotland's hands"". The first minister told a major rally in Glasgow the time would come to break away from the ""chaos of Westminster"" in a second independence poll next year. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said a new Scottish independence referendum was not ""desirable or necessary"". The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats also oppose a further vote. Ms Sturgeon was one of a number of SNP politicians and independence campaigners to speak at the #indyref2020 rally in George Square. It was thefirst time she had spoken at an independence rally since 2014. The event prompted a counter demonstration by dozens of unionist supporters who waved flags and blew whistles as supporters of Scottish independence gathered. The SNP leader focused on the UK-wide election on 12 December at the event, which was organised byThe National newspaper,external. She has made it clear thatshe wants to hold a poll on the issue next yearand said the general election was a ""crossroads moment"" for Scotland. Ms Sturgeon told the pro-indy crowds: ""Over the next few weeks, it is our job to convince everyone we know to come out on December the 12th and send the biggest, loudest most resounding message to Westminster. ""That it is time for Scotland to choose our own future. It is time for Scotland to be an independent country.

Ministers urged to agree indyref2 question test Election 2019: Questions facing Scotland's parties FMQs: Rolling out the red carpet for indyref2? The first minister told the crowd the general election was ""the most important election for Scotland in our lifetimes"". ""The future of our country is on the line,"" she said. ""And there is no doubt whatsoever that Scotland stands at a crossroads moment."" There were boos from the audience when she claimed a victory for Boris Johnson in the election would result in ""a future where Scotland gets ripped out of our European family of nations against our will, a future where the UK turns in on itself, a future of a hostile environment for migrants"". Instead, she said, there was ""a much better alternative"". Ms Sturgeon said: ""That alternative is not a UK Labour government that can't event make up its mind where it stands on the question of Brexit."" The first minister's speech came after she confirmed that she would send a letter ""before Christmas"" to whoever is in 10 Downing Street, requesting the Scottish Parliament is granted powers to hold another independence referendum. The indyref2020 rally prompted a counter-demonstration by pro-unionists Asked whether she believed Labour would grant the Section 30 order, Ms Sturgeon answered: ""Yes"". ""If people in Scotland demonstrate the desire - as I believe they will in this election - for an independence referendum, then I don't believe Westminster opposition to the principle or to the timetable to that will prove sustainable,"" she said. In response, Jeremy Corbyn said only a Labour government would be able to boost Scotland's economy and see ""the levels of poverty in Scotland, particularly in the big cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee, being reduced"". An unconventional piper joined the pro-independence crowds in George Square He added: ""Scottish independence would mean a massive gap between what Scotland raises in taxation and what the Scottish people need at the present time. ""I think the much better option is a Labour government for the whole of the UK."" A really simple guide to the UK general election How late can you register to vote in a general election? The Tories criticised Nicola Sturgeon for prioritising indyref2 ""above all else"". Scottish Conservative MSP for Glasgow, Annie Wells, said: ""While Nicola Sturgeon is banging on about indyref2, I'm out talking to people about the state of their local schools, the drug deaths crisis and violent crime taking over our streets, and the problems at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. ""Instead of tackling the day-to-day things that Glaswegians care about, Nicola Sturgeon is headlining a nationalist rally.

"Fracking at Cuadrilla Resources site in Lancashire in August caused a 2.9 magnitude earth tremor The government has called a halt to shale gas extraction - or fracking - in England amid fears about earthquakes. The indefinite suspension comes aftera report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA),externalsaid it was not possible to predict the probability or size of tremors caused by the practice. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said it may be temporary - imposed ""until and unless"" extraction is proved safe. Labour, Lib Dems and the Green Party  want a permanent ban. 'We have been guinea pigs for fracking' What is fracking and why is it controversial? Is the future of fracking now in doubt? Fracking firm in 'goodwill payments' after tremor Fracking was suspended at the end of August after activity by Cuadrilla Resources - the only company licensed to carry out the process - at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire caused a magnitude 2.9 earthquake. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said that, after the OGA concluded that further seismic activity could not be ruled out, ""further consents for fracking will not be granted"" unless the industry ""can reliably predict and control tremors"" linked to the process. However, it has stopped short of an outright ban. Asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme why that was, Mrs Leadsom said shale gas is a ""huge opportunity"" for the UK. ""We will follow the science and it is quite clear that we can't be certain. The science isn't accurate enough to be able to assess the fault lines, the geological studies have been shown to be inaccurate. So therefore, unless and until we can be absolutely certain, we are imposing a moratorium,"" she said. Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyntweeted,externalthat the pause was an ""election stunt"" and that Labour would ban fracking permanently. Former Conservative energy minister Sam Gyimah, who is now a Liberal Democrat, said Mr Johnson's ""conversion to environmentalism"" was ""skin deep"". ""It's interesting that just as we approach an election he has decided he is against fracking."" Asked whether the UK should explore methods of delivering fracking safely, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley said fossil fuels ""need to stay in the ground"" and that the government must make an ""absolute commitment"" to end it altogether. By Katie Prescott, BBC business correspondent Andrea Leadsom emphasises that this is not a ban - and the government is 'following the science'. However, scientists say it's hard to see a time with our current technology that fracking in the UK wouldn't cause earthquakes Professor Richard Davies from Newcastle University says: ""The UK is crisscrossed with faults and it's difficult to avoid them because the current imaging techniques used by the industry do not yet provide enough resolution to detect many of them."" The big question for the businesses working in this sector is whether they are happy to spend any more money in this regulatory environment. Do they think it's worth investing, in the hope that the ""science"" will one day find in their favour and the regulation could change? Or will they decide that two moratoriums in 10 years is just too many, and that fracking has no future in the UK. Friends of the Earth said legislation should be passed to make the fracking moratorium permanent. ""For nearly a decade local people across the country have fought a David and Goliath battle against this powerful industry,"" said chief executive Craig Bennett. Charity CPRE said it had long called for fracking to be stopped and said the move would help the UK meet its target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Anti-fracking campaigner Barbara Richardson, who has protested at Preston New Road, said she was ""cautiously optimistic"", adding that local people were ""worried"" about the impact of fracking. ""They want this to go away, they want some respite from this, they've been fighting this for five-and-a-half years,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Claire Stephenson from Frack Free Lancashire said campaigners were celebrating that the fracking industry in the UK is ""finished"", but added that protests will continue until an ""outright ban"" is in place. Susan Holliday, chair of Preston New Action Group said: ""We will only feel able to celebrate once Cuadrilla start work on decommissioning and the site is restored."" Fracking is a process in which liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil trapped within it. Assessment by the British Geological Survey in 2013 suggested there were enough resources in the Bowland Shale across northern England to potentially provide up to 50 years of current gas demand. Butresearch published in Augustestimated there were only five to seven years' supply. The UK's fracking industry, which has said the process could contribute significantly to future energy needs and create thousands of jobs, dismissed the report's findings. Fracking must be halted for 18 hours if it causes a tremor measuring 0.5 magnitude or above. The government announcement is the second time it has placed a moratorium on fracking. The first suspension, which lasted a year, was in November 2011 during the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. The fracking industry has faced fierce opposition from both communities and environmental groups. Local communities and environmental groups have protested against fracking Prime Minister Boris Johnson has in the past supported fracking,writing in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat the discovery of shale gas in the UK was ""glorious news for humanity"". A recent report by the National Audit Office found the UK had spent at least Â£32.7m supporting fracking since 2011. All fracking in Scotland has been suspended since 2013 andthe SNP recently confirmed a policy of ""no support"" for the extraction method. The Welsh Government has also opposed fracking for several years, with a ""moratorium"" in place since 2015, while there is a planning presumption against fracking in Northern Ireland.

The suspension in England will put pressure on Cuadrilla Resources which has so far invested Â£270m in the country's shale gas industry. Cuadrilla Resources has 30 full-time workers but also employs a number of contractors. A spokeswoman for Cuadrilla Resources declined to comment. The BBC understands Cuadrilla and other fracking companies were not told of the government's decision in advance. Ken Cronin, chief executive of UK Onshore Oil and Gas, which represents fracking companies, said: ""Going forward, we are fully committed to working closely with the Oil and Gas Authority and other relevant regulators to demonstrate that we can operate safely and environmentally responsibly.""

"Yoga's popularity does not look like it will wane any time soon. Its physical benefits for flexibility and balance, as well as its spiritual connection, mean it's practised by millions across the world. And that means a need for more and more yoga teachers. But now, there is a warning they may be putting their own hip health at risk. Benoy Matthews, a leading UK-based physiotherapist, warns he is seeing increasing numbers of yoga teachers with serious hip problems - many of whom require surgery - because they are pushing their bodies too hard. Mr Matthews, a specialist hip and knee physiotherapist and member of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists, says he sees four to five yoga teachers a month. He says the problem lies in people repeatedly pushing their bodies into ""prescribed"" positions, when their physiology prevents it. About half of the teachers he sees simply need advice on how to moderate the ""prescribed"" yoga positions, so as not to put too much stress on their joints. But those with more advanced problems need medical treatment and surgery - including total hip replacements. Yoga 'helps my Irritable Bowel Syndrome' Yoga sessions 'could improve golf swing' Andy Murray's 'life-changing' hip surgery has left him pain-free ""People confuse stiffness and pain,"" he says. ""If there is a pinching or blocking feeling in the groin, it shouldn't be ignored. You have to know your limits."" Mr Matthews has specialised in hips and knees for the last eight of his 22 years as a physio. He says it can be easy for yoga practitioners to mistake joint pain, which means they should stop the movement, for stiffness, which they should push through. Benoy Matthews says the key is simply to understand what your body can do ""We all know about the health benefits of yoga - I practise it myself,"" he says. ""But, like anything, it can cause injury. We can't put it on a pedestal. ""I don't want to denounce yoga, after all it's been going for thousands of years. But you have to understand yourself."" Mr Matthews says the problem often boils down to how a person's hips are formed and how flexible they are. ""What's achievable for one might not be achievable for others,"" he says. ""People tend to do the same set positions, rather than what's achievable for them. ""Ego might mean them trying to take a position 'all the way' to the end when they should just stop where it's comfortable. ""Just because the person next to you can reach all the way doesn't mean it's necessary, or desirable, to do the same."" Mr Matthews says the amount of yoga teachers do, as well as the fact they might not be doing any other kind of exercise, can explain the problems that develop. ""They might be doing yoga six days a week and think that's enough, without doing any other kind of exercise, like cardio or cross training,"" he says. ""It's like anything. If you do the same thing again and again, there can be problems. You need to mix it up in terms of the kind of exercise you do. ""The yoga teachers I'm seeing are young - 40, 42. ""If they come limping and can't walk more than 10m [33ft], say, there's no amount of physio that can help them. If it's two years in, even the best physio can't do anything. Sometimes they can have keyhole surgery (hip arthroscopy), or it's a replacement. Mr Matthews suggests new yoga teachers should be assessed. ""You could see what mobility they have and what their body is allowing them to do,"" he says. Natalie Gartshore has been a yoga teacher for 16 years, She thinks the popularity of yoga means it's effectively a victim of its own success. ""I don't think you're told very much when you're training as a teacher about physiology or anatomy,"" she says. ""There is an overuse issue. ""If you got people en masse taking up ballet, you would get the same results."" Natalie, now 45, tore the cartilage in her hip five years ago. She now makes sure she manages her class workload and doesn't work weekends. But she says it's hard for newly qualified teachers to do the same. ""They'll be doing five classes a day, running around, working weekends,"" she says. The British Wheel of Yoga is approved by Sports England, as the practice's governing body. Wendy Haring, its chair of education, says: ""It's probably true in some schools of yoga, where people hold poses for a long time without modification, that's when there are problems."" But learning about anatomy and physiology is a ""major part"" of BWY-approved courses. ""We would teach people how to modify poses,"" Mrs Haring says. She adds though, people teaching yoga do need to take care and advises anyone wanting to train to make sure their courses are Ofqual-approved. Pip White, professional adviser at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, says: ""Yoga is a fantastic activity for people to do, with lots of benefits for your health and general wellbeing. ""However, as with any form of exercise, it's important to do it safely and in this case, also understanding your own limits, as we are all built differently. ""Yoga is not about being in competition with anyone else. If you stay aware of your abilities and practise within your own limits, you will gain all the great benefits this practice has to offer.""

"Labour is pledging to cut UK carbon emissions by 10% through the largest home improvement programme for decades. A Labour government would fund Â£60bn of energy-saving upgrades, such as loft insulation, enhanced double glazing and new heating systems, by 2030. Launching the policy on Sunday, Jeremy Corbyn said it ""will create a sustainable energy network"", adding: ""We cannot go on polluting our planet."" The Conservatives said the plan would ""wreck the economy"" and ""put up bills"". Speaking about the policy - called ""Warm Homes for All"" - in south-west London, Mr Corbyn said that climate change would be a major part of the party's election campaign. ""We cannot go on standing by while climate warming increases,"" the Labour leader said. How much could Labour's nationalisation plan cost? Labour pledges 'zero carbon' homes by 2022 Reality Check: Labour's green energy plans Labour says low-income households will receive a grant to carry out the work on their homes, while wealthier households would receive interest-free loans for enhancements. Households which take out the loan would pay it back through savings on energy bills, the party added. Labour expects the project to cost Â£250bn - an average of Â£9,300 per home - but only Â£60bn would come as a cost to central government, it says. Speaking on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the Â£60bn would come from its Â£250bn National Transformation Fund. Interest-free loans would make up the remaining cost of the policy, she said. She added: ""Overall, we're looking at generating more jobs and supporting businesses through the economy, so that by 2030 the increased tax-take more than recoups that Â£60bn outlay."" A spokesperson for the Tories said, while tackling climate change was vital, ""independent experts and even Labour's own unions say their promises don't stack up"". Labour says its proposals would create 450,000 jobs involved in the installation of energy-saving measures and renewable and low-carbon technologies. Almost all of the UK's 27 million homes would benefit from the pledge, either through a grant to fund works in full, or an interest-free loan, it said. Interest-free loans to improve the energy efficiency of homes are already available in Scotland, where the issue isdevolved to the Scottish government.,external A Labour spokeswoman told the BBC the party would make every effort to work with devolved powers to implement the plan across the whole of the UK. The party said the plan would cut carbon emissions by 10% by the year 2030 and reduce energy bills for 9.6 million low-income households by an average of Â£417 a year. The policy echoes previous announcements from Labour, including a pledge last yearto create over 400,000 skilled jobsthrough investment in renewable energy and making homes energy efficient. Over the past year or so the Labour Party has come out with a series of proposals to improve the energy efficiency of British homes. This plan is far larger - and also far more expensive. It involves, over the next decade, spending Â£250bn to fit every UK house with double-glazing and loft insulation, heat pumps and solar panels. Households with low incomes would not pay anything. Wealthier ones would get interest free loans. Everyone, it's said, would benefit from lower bills and the UK as a whole would see its carbon emissions fall. Much of the country's housing stock is relatively old and upgrading it is seen as essential to meeting our targets on climate change. But critics will say Labour's scheme lacks detail and that the estimates for the costs are unrealistic. The initiative comes a day after the Conservatives called a halt to fracking, a sign that the political parties sense the environment has become a key issue for voters. Outlining where the additional jobs would be created, Labour said an estimated 250,000 skilled jobs would be in the construction industry -  roles like insulation specialists, plasterers, carpenters and electricians. In addition, it claimed the investment would generate another 200,000 jobs ""across the economy"". Ms Long-Bailey said the pledge was ""one of the greatest investment projects since we rebuilt Britain's housing after the Second World War"". She said: ""Labour will offer every household in the UK the chance to bring the future into their homes - upgrading the fabric of their homes with insulation and cutting edge heating systems - tackling both climate change and extortionate bills."" A Conservative Party spokesperson said: ""The reality is that Jeremy Corbyn's plans would wreck the economy, putting up bills for hardworking families - and preventing any real progress on climate change. ""Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives have a proper plan to continue reducing carbon emissions faster than any other G20 country, building on the 400,000 low-carbon jobs we've already created, while keeping bills low."" Rebecca Long-Bailey and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have made renewable energy a key policy On Saturday, Labour said it would ensure all new-build homes in Britainwere ""zero carbon"" within three years. It said a Labour government would introduce ""tough"" standards on new builds which would see homes fitted with solar panels and a ban on gas boilers. The party has previously said it intends to bring energy supply networksinto public ownership. It comes as the governmentcalled a halt to shale gas extraction- commonly known as fracking - in England amid fears about earthquakes. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party want to ban fracking permanently.

"The plans would involve installing ""super-efficient"" insulation in new homes Labour is promising to make all new-build homes ""zero carbon"" within three years, in an effort to curb housing shortages and tackle climate change. A Labour government would introduce ""tough"" standards for new builds which would see homes fitted with solar panels and not having gas boilers. The party says it would save Â£200 a year per house in energy bills. The Conservative Party described the plan as ""unrealistic"" and said it would slow house building. The proposals would mean the day-to-day running of the new homes would not add extra carbon to the atmosphere. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, on the campaign trail in Swindon on Saturday, said: ""There is no greater issue facing this world than the environmental disaster waiting to happen and the climate change that is happening very obviously all around us."" Central heating boilers 'threaten climate goals' Big lifestyle changes 'needed to cut emissions' UK commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 During a speech to supporters at Commonweal Sixth Form College, Mr Corbyn also responded to US President Donald Trump's recent remark thathe would be ""so bad"" as prime minister. Labour is hoping to take Swindon's two Conservative-held seats in next month's election He said Mr Trump was ""entitled to his choice"", adding: ""I'm prepared, as our Labour government, to meet anybody and put to them our views on peace, on justice, on human rights, on environmental sustainability, because our government will be a force for all of those things all over the world."" Mr Corbyn went on to say he would not back Nicola Sturgeon's call for a second referendum on Scottish independence. ""I think the much better option is a Labour government for the whole of the UK,"" he said. The speech also saw the Labour leader promise to end privatisation of the NHS, and lay out his plan to negotiate a new Brexit deal before offering the country a second referendum, which would include an option to stay in the EU. Reaching out to Leave and Remain voters, he said: ""Both of you need a Labour government that's going to bring people together."" Labour says their pledge to make all new-build homes 'zero carbon' by 2022 would be achieved through better efficiency standards and using low carbon and renewable energy sources. New homes would not be fitted with fossil fuel heating systems, such as gas boilers, as standard and would have ""super-efficient insulation"" and triple-glazed windows. The last Labour government introduced regulations to make all homes ""zero carbon"" by 2016, but it was scrapped by the Conservatives six months before it was due to come into force, Labour said. This video can not be played The eco-friendly council estate that won an architecture award Asked about the added cost of installing greener heating, Labour's shadow housing secretary John Healey said it would be a ""relatively small"" sum compared to the total cost of new builds. ""It's totally do-able without big price increases,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. ""We really should be looking to house builders to absorb these costs as well because this is an industry, in recent years, that has made billions in profits and paid millions in bonuses to top executives,"" he said. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""As usual, Labour are setting unrealistic targets that would slow down house-building and put up house prices. ""Boris Johnson and the Conservatives are taking a practical, sensible approach to reducing emissions from homes. We are introducing a 'future homes standard' that will ensure new homes meet reductions in emissions by a third by 2020, and world-leading by 2025.""

"Stephen Morris was handed back his violin in a Waitrose car park A 310-year-old violin worth Â£250,000 that was left on a train in south London has been returned to its owner. The instrument was handed over to professional musician Stephen Morris in a supermarket car park in Beckenham after secret negotiations. Plain-clothes police officers attended in case the handover went wrong, as the man who had the violin said he had made a mistake and apologised. Mr Morris said having the violin back had not yet ""sunk in"". This video can not be played Mr Morris on the ""shock"" of getting back his violin ""I feel a bit battered and bruised,"" he said. ""I haven't had a great deal of sleep since it went missing,"" adding that he would have a beer to celebrate. The violin, which was made by master craftsman David Tecchler in 1709, was left on the London to Orpington train on 22 October when Mr Morris got out at Penge East with his bike. Stephen Morris had said losing the instrument was like ""having my arm cut off"" The 51-year-old from Sydenham, who has played on film scores including The Lord of the Rings and James Bond and recorded with David Bowie and Steve Wonder, was distraught. British Transport Police (BTP) later released a CCTV image of a man believed to have taken the violin as the train approached Bromley South and asked him to get in touch, sparking appeals on social media. The violin, pictured here, had recently been restored The breakthrough came on Thursday when Mr Morris received a direct Twitter message, which read: ""I recognise the person in the picture.  I think it may be somebody I know - I'd like to be of help. I know what it's like to leave valuables on a train."" Over the next 24 hours further contact was made with the person who had sent the message - it's suspected that he was in fact the individual who had taken the violin. Calling himself ""Gene"", which was not his real name, the man agreed to meet Mr Morris on Friday evening at a Waitrose car park near Beckenham train station. In an operation co-ordinated by the musician's friend and former police officer, Mike Pannett, a team of plain-clothes officers were placed on stand-by. ""Mike was the engine room for the whole thing,"" said Mr Morris. The violin is marked with Tecchler's name Shortly after 22:10 BST, the police team watched as ""Gene"", in his mid to late 20s, approached Mr Morris, shook his hand and transferred a holdall containing the violin. ""He was very apologetic, he said he wanted to hand it to me in person,"" he said. The violin and bows were intact and ""in tune"". ""It couldn't have ended in a happier way,"" Mr Morris said BTP said it would be taking no further action against the man because he had taken reasonable steps to contact the violin owner and had handed it back.
