"This video can not be played The Bloodhound car was tested in Newquay, Cornwall, last year A 1,000mph race car project has been saved after an entrepreneur stepped in to buy the business. TheBloodhound supersonic vehicle,external- built with a jet engine bolted to a rocket - is all but finished. Its future was in jeopardy amid a failure to secure investment which forced the firm financing it into administration. But Yorkshire-based entrepreneur Ian Warhurst has bought the project for an ""undisclosed amount"". Mr Warhurst, who sold Barnsley engineering firm Melett earlier in December, said it would have been ""criminal"" not to continue with the record attempt. ""There's a bit more sorting of the car to do, but nothing major, to get to that first step of testing it at high speed,"" he said. ""That's what made it such a shame, because they had got as far as they had. It just had to carry on."" Bloodhound Diary: It's going to get toasty Delay for Bloodhound high-speed trials First public runs for 1,000mph car Administrator Andrew Sheridan said: ""Ian has a strong background in managing highly successful businesses in the automotive engineering sector and he will bring considerable expertise to bear in taking the project forward."" The Bristol-based team behind the Bloodhound project aims to beat the existing land speed world record of 763mph (1,228km/h). It is due to attempt to reach a record-breaking speed in South Africa, where an 18km-long (11-mile), 1,500m-wide (4,921ft) track at Hakskeen Pan in the Northern Cape has been prepared. The vehicle was tested at Newquay Airport Previous test runs at Newquay Airport in 2017 saw Bloodhound reach speeds of 200mph (320km/h). The project planned on running on Hakskeen Pan towards the end of 2019, when the water in the lakebed evaporated and the ground had become dry. The Bloodhound, using a Rolls-Royce Eurofighter engine alongside a rocket, was then due to be tested at 500-600mph (800-965km/h) before approaching its top speed in further test runs during 2020 or 2021.

"The accident on Ben Nevis happened on Sunday A 21-year-old climber has died after falling while tackling a route in Ben Nevis' Tower Gully. Police were alerted to the accident at about 14:25 on Sunday. The man was a student at Cardiff University and had been a member of the university's students' union mountaineering club. He was flown by a coastguard search and rescue helicopter to the Belford Hospital in Fort William where he died from his injuries. The man's climbing partner also fell and survived. He has been receiving treatment at the Belford for ""non-life threatening injuries"". Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team was also involved in the rescue operation.

"A change in how student loans are recorded in the public finances will add Â£12bn to the deficit, following an Office for National Statistics ruling. The amount expected not to be repaid, which could be 45% of lending, will be reclassified as public spending. Student loans will now significantly push up the UK's deficit - providing an incentive to reduce tuition fees. The government said the change would be taken into account by the tuition fees review, due to report early next year. The decision by the statistics agency tackles an anomaly in which the cost of lending to students, to cover fees and maintenance, has been missing from the public finances. It will significantly increase the deficit - which is the difference between what the government spends and what it receives. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee and former education secretary, welcomed the ruling - saying the current loans system lacked scrutiny when the government could ""spend billions of pounds of public money without any negative impact on its deficit target"". The independent economics think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the accounting system has been ""absurdly generous"" to the government's finances. It says the effort to reflect the real cost of the fees system, in which 70% of students will not fully re-pay, would bring public finances closer to ""economic reality"". The change applies across the UK, but most of this will be accounted for by lending to students in England. It might sound like a technical change - but it has major implications for the level of tuition fees in England. The decision by the ONS will provide a juicy carrot for the government to lower fees from Â£9,250 - because under the accounting changes, the higher the level of fees, the higher the lending and the greater the negative impact on the deficit. Is the tuition fees 'financial illusion' about to unravel? Could financial changes affect student loans? What do universities spend tuition fees on? Tuition fee system heading for trillion pound gap in public finances If the government does nothing - and sticks with the current level of fees - the damage to the deficit will rise from Â£12bn at present to Â£17bn in five years, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Student finance is under review and iffees were lowered to Â£6,500or Â£7,500, as has been suggested, it would mean less pressure, at least in presentational terms, on the public finances. It would also leave universities worrying about how their budgets would be compensated. But in terms of the political importance attached to reducing the deficit, tuition fees in their current form might suddenly look much less attractive. The IFS says it is likely to mean the government will look for other options - which could mean lower fees, lower interest charges or fewer students. The think tank also warns that it if the Chancellor had about Â£15bn in room to manoeuvre, much of that will have been wiped out. Almost half of the value of student lending is expected to be written off - and this will now be reclassified as spending, which the ONS says will push up the deficit by Â£12bn. It will end an arrangementaccused of being a ""fiscal illusion""by the House of Lords economic affairs committee. The Lords committee forecast that not counting the cost of loans until they were written off after 30 years would grow into a trillion pound black hole. The Treasury select committee had also warned that in effect most of higher education funding had disappeared from public spending figures. The decision by the ONS will stop ""kicking the can down the road"" on the cost of student finance. The new classifications will divide student loan payments into ""genuine government lending"" for the portion expected to be repaid - while the portion not expected to be repaid, around 45%, will count as spending. While students might look forward to lower fees, universities are warning against a potential loss of funding. Much of university funding in England is through tuition fees - and if fees were cut there would be questions about replacing the shortfall. ""Ministers may now be tempted to cut university funding because it will look better for the deficit, but good policy shouldn't be dictated by accounting rules,"" said Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said the ""180-degree flip"" on accounting will seem ""embarrassing for policymakers"". But he warned it could mean less funding for students as they ""suddenly look much more costly to current taxpayers"". Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, warned against ""knee-jerk reactions"" which could cut spending on students or limit student numbers. Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said it proved the ""student loans system is a fiscal illusion which flatters the government's record"". A government spokesman emphasised that in practical terms, this ""does not affect students, who can still access loans to help with tuition fees and the cost of living and which they will only start repaying when they are earning above Â£25,000"".

"The boy cannot survive for much longer, and must urgently see his mother, the family say The Yemeni mother of a dying boy in California is being prevented from seeing him due to a US ban on visitors from her country, the family says. Two-year-old Abdullah Hassan was born with a brain disease that doctors say he will not survive. His relatives say his mother wants to see him one last time before they take him off life-support. His father says the boy's mother cannot come to the US due to the Trump administration's travel ban. Though Abdullah and his father were born in Yemen, they are American, says the family. ""All she wishes is to hold his hand for the last time,"" the boy's father, Ali Hassan, 22,told the San Francisco Chronicle,externalon Sunday. He said the boy would probably die if he is taken to Egypt, where his mother is currently living. Mr Hassan's wife, Shaima Swileh, is currently seeking a waiver from the US Department of State to travel to the US urgently. Soon after he took office, US President Donald Trump imposed travel restrictions on mainly majority Muslim countries. The executive order went through several versions before being upheld by the US Supreme Court this summer. What is the Trump travel ban? It bans nationals of Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. This video can not be played Muslim students on Trump ban: 'I don't belong here' Saad Sweilem, from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which is advocating for the family to be reunited, said barring Abdullah's mother was ""unfathomably cruel."" Mr Hassan's family came to California in the early 1980s, but maintained close ties with their native Yemen. His son Abdullah was diagnosed with hypomyelination, a brain disease that has affected his ability to breathe. When he was eight months old, the family moved from Yemen to Cairo to escape that country's civil war. Yemen ceasefire delayed after clashes Can Yemen truce deal finally bring peace? About three months ago, Mr Hassan brought his son to the US for treatment, with the expectation that his wife would later join them. But after doctors in Oakland, California, informed him that the boy's condition was terminal, the family applied for her to travel to the US. They say they received a rejection letter from the state department, citing the US president's travel ban. A state department official who did not wish to be named refused to discuss the specific case due to confidentiality laws. But the official told the BBC they make ""every effort to facilitate legitimate travel by international visitors"". ""We are also fully committed to administering US immigration law and ensuring the integrity and security of our country's borders."" What is the Trump travel ban?

The bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen and Maren Ueland were found in the High Atlas mountain range. The families of the two women, from Denmark and Norway, confirmed their identities on social media. A suspect has been arrested in the city of Marrakesh on suspicion of murder, according to Moroccan authorities. The man was being held in custody ""to determine the motive of the crime while investigations continue"", the central bureau of judicial investigation said in a statement. Two further suspects were arrested later, according to Moroccan reports. The women had been sharing a tent 10km (6 miles) from the mountain village of Imlil and their bodies had been found inside the tent on Monday, near the foot of North Africa's highest peak, Mount Toubkal, reports said. The area is popular with hikers and climbers, particularly from Scandinavia. Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway had travelled to Morocco on 9 December with Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, who was 24 and from Denmark.

Mr Markle was invited to his daughter's wedding in May but had to pull out becausehe needed heart surgery. He said: ""I love you very much, you're my daughter and I would really like to hear from you. ""Whatever differences we have, we should be able to work them out."" In the run-up to the wedding Mr Markle becameembroiled in a controversy,externalover reports he had staged paparazzi photos of himself in wedding-related activities, such as being measured for a new suit. Speaking from San Diego in the US, he said: ""For that incident I've apologised 100 times - I don't feel that's worthy of being shunned or ghosted, that's ridiculous."" Ghosting, an expression often used in dating, is when someone suddenly ends all communication with another person.

""I've been trying to reach out for several weeks - every day I try to text her, I just haven't received any comment back,"" he said. ""I just keep asking her to respond back to me and I haven't got any response back. I've sent letters as well."" Prince Charles walked Meghan down the aisle after Thomas Markle wasn't able to attend Mr Markle, who was not paid for the interview, suggested the royal couple could have been influenced by press reports about him. ""The unfortunate thing about my daughter and Harry is that they believe everything they read in the papers,"" he said.

"This video can not be played The BBC Disclosure programme features previously unseen footage New evidence uncovered by BBC Scotland has raised fresh questions about the way police officers treated a man who died in their custody. Fife father-of-two Sheku Bayoh, 31, died in 2015 after being restrained by police in Kirkcaldy. CCTV, other footage and documents obtained by the BBC casts doubt on some of the officers' accounts of the events that led to the death. Police Scotland said they could not comment while the case was ongoing. A BBC Disclosure programmescreened on Monday night featured: Evidence the first officers on scene escalated the situation instead of trying to defuse it CCTV footage which questions officers' claims a female officer was kicked and stamped on by Mr Bayoh Evidence that Mr Bayoh's actions were exaggerated in official police documents Claims that racism may have played a role in the events Thirty-one-year-old Sheku Bayoh died in 2015 after being restrained by police in Kirkcaldy In October, Mr Bayoh's family were told by the Lord Advocate there was not enough evidence to prosecute any of the officers involved. The Crown Office has not confirmed the decision publicly, and says the case remains open. Mr Bayoh's family are likely to ask for the decision to be reviewed but are now calling for a full public inquiry. His sister, Kadi Johnson, said: ""We are still here suffering, his boys are suffering. ""There was no need for Sheku to have died that day. We just want to know how our brother died, that's all."" On the day he died, Mr Bayoh had been at a friend's house in the morning watching a boxing match. He had taken the drugs MDMA and another drug known as Flakka. Bayoh family 'devastated' over no charges 'Patience exhausted' on restraint death The drugs dramatically altered his behaviour, and he became aggressive with a friend. He later left home with a knife from his kitchen, and neighbours called the police. He had discarded the knife by the time police arrived. Mr Bayoh had lived in Scotland since he was 17 Mr Bayoh, who was originally from Sierra Leone but had lived in Scotland since he was 17, was restrained by six officers and lost consciousness. He died at hospital soon after. Days after his death, the Scottish Police Federation (SPF) lawyer Peter Watson told the media that ""a petite female police officer was subjected to a violent and unprovoked attack by a very large man who punched, kicked and stamped on her."" The new evidence obtained by BBC Disclosure casts doubt on this account. CCTV footage shows Mr Bayoh in the street before officers arrived at the scene A leading authority on police restraint and use of force, Eric Baskind, of Liverpool John Moore University, analysed the documents, which included the first statements given by the officers involved. The documents reveal that before Mr Bayoh's alleged stamping attack on the officer, three officers discharged their irritant spray into his face and a fourth drew her baton at him. Mr Baskind said: ""What strikes me from the evidence of the officers is that they approach the scene with the intention of using force. ""He's not running away, he's not, at that moment in time, creating a danger to anyone. ""They get there, they screech to a halt, they get out of the cars with irritant sprays and batons. That to me doesn't seem measured. ""That is not best practice. And all of those actions were very escalatory."" Later the images show Mr Bayoh on the ground being restrained by officers The CCTV shows that Mr Bayoh hits the female officer, known as Officer D, knocking her to the ground. The officer had injuries consistent with being hit on the head. Mr Baskind said this could have been prevented, if the officers had approached Mr Bayoh ""in a different way, in a calming way, to try and find out what was wrong"". The SPF claim about the stamping incident is based on the testimony of two officers, known in the statements as B and C. Officer C said: ""He stomped on her back with his foot with a great deal of force. He put his full bodyweight into the stomp and used his arms to gain leverage."" In her own statement, Officer D does not say she was stamped on. There's no mention of it in the statements of three civilian witnesses who saw the incident either. The CCTV casts serious doubt on this claim. As soon as Officer D is knocked to the ground by Mr Bayoh, it looks as though the action immediately moves elsewhere, and Mr Bayoh is engaged by the other officers, and within five seconds, he is brought down. Officer D appears to get up and walk away with another officer's help. Eric Baskind, a leading authority on police restraint and use of force, has analysed the documents and studied the CCTV Mr Baskind said: ""The quality of the footage is not very good, but you can certainly make out what's going on, and I can see no evidence at all of two stamping attacks on the officer on the ground, let alone two very violent ones, that is described in the papers. ""It looks to me as though the officer's gone down, and pretty straight away Mr Bayoh is taken to the ground by others. ""There certainly seems to me to be a significant discrepancy between what I can see on the footage, and what I've read in the papers."" The BBC also obtained mobile phone footage of the incident, raising questions about how Mr Bayoh was restrained. Officer B, who is 6ft 4in and weighed 25 stone, told investigators he had Mr Bayoh pinned to the ground for ""a maximum of 30 seconds"". Another said the restraint had been, ""appropriate, text book stuff, in line with their training."" A civilian witness saw it differently. She told investigators officers were lying across Mr Bayoh for several minutes. She said: ""I heard him screaming. It sent chills through me. I heard the man shout to get the police off him. They never moved."" Deborah Coles, from the charity Inquest, said: ""I think we cannot ignore the role that race may have played in this death."" Mr Bayoh suffered 23 separate injuries including a cracked rib, head wounds consistent with baton strikes, and petechial haemorrhages, or burst blood vessels in the eyes, which can be a sign of positional asphyxia, or suffocation. Cause of death was noted as ""sudden death in a man intoxicatedâ¦[drugs] whilst under restraint."" After the death, the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) launched an inquiry. Under advice from the SPF lawyer, the officers refused to provide statements to Pirc for 32 days. BBC Disclosure has seen evidence which shows SPF advice to officers was to wait until the toxicology report was returned before giving statements. The BBC has also seen evidence suggesting that Mr Bayoh's actions may have been distorted or exaggerated by police. An internal police document written less than an hour after Bayoh's death said that police attended reports of a male with a ""machete"" in the street, and that the ""male strikes one with machete"". None of the officers saw Mr Bayoh with a knife or machete, nor has there ever been any suggestion he struck one of them with a blade. Police did not respond to questions as to how misinformation like this got into an official police document. Deborah Coles, from the charity Inquest, which investigates deaths in custody, has been supporting the Bayoh family. She told the programme: ""The pattern that we've seen is that the state narrative is very often, when somebody dies after restraint, there is an attempt to demonise or speak ill of the person who's diedâ¦to try and deflect attention away from the actions of the police officers concerned [by] painting a picture of a dangerous man carrying a machete."" Mr Bayoh's sister Kadi Johnson says she has lost faith in the police and the justice system She added: ""I think we cannot ignore the role that race may have played in this deathâ¦and their immediate resort to the use of force. ""Racial stereotyping of black men as beingâ¦big, black, dangerous, informs the way in which they're treated, and the fact that they are over-policed."" The Bayoh family's lawyer Aamer Anwar, told the BBC that racism had been ""the elephant in the room"". He said: ""It always has been. It was the stories, it was the pictures, it was the stereotypical images of a large, black male crazed, acting erratically. It was all those things, the word ""terrorist"" being bandied about. ""Sheku Bayoh's family believes that race is central to this. The black community believes that race is central to this."" His sister Ms Johnson, told the BBC: ""It has made me lose faith in the police and the justice system as a wholeâ¦I don't think he would have died if he hadn't met the police. She added: ""He wasn't himself, the way he was acting, but then no duty of care was given to himâ¦because he was a black man. That's how we feel."" In 2015, the BBC revealed allegations thatone of the officers involved in the restraint, PC Alan Paton, had a history of violence and racism. Claire Baker, MSP for mid Scotland and Fife, said the allegations in the Disclosure programme were ""shocking."" She added: ""I recognise the police do a difficult jobâ¦but something went wrong, which raises questions about whether the police's response was proportionate. ""I think there should be a public inquiry."" The Scottish government said it was considering a public inquiry. Police Scotland said it could not comment while the case remained open. A spokesman offered sympathy for the Bayoh family. The Scottish Police Federation, which represents some of the officers involved in the restraint, said it would be inappropriate to comment until all legal processes were complete, but it added that the BBC sought to publish ""fundamental inaccuracies"" about the case.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: May taking shambolic government to new level Jeremy Corbyn has accused Prime Minister Theresa May of having led the UK into a ""national crisis"" on Brexit. The Labour leader told the Commons she had ""cynically run down the clock"" to force MPs to pick from ""unacceptable outcomes"" - her Brexit deal or no deal. Since delaying last week's Brexit vote, she had won no ""meaningful reassurance"" about MPs' concerns, Mr Corbyn said. Mrs May had been ""dragged, kicking and screaming"" toschedule the vote for the week of 14 Januaryby Labour, he added. She hit back, saying that Labour had ""no alternative and no plan"" and ""the national crisis is an opposition that is irresponsible, that puts its party interest first before the interests of the British people"". Ahead of her Commons statement on Monday, Labour had threatened to push for a confidence vote in the PM if she failed to timetable a vote. Afterwards, a party spokesman said it was ""disgraceful"" that - by that date - a month would have been ""wasted"". And Mr Corbynlater confirmed he had tabled the motion. Kuenssberg: Don't forget there is actually a deal Cameron 'advising PM on Brexit options' MPs had been due to vote on the deal on 11 December but the prime minister postponed the vote, saying it was clear her plan ""would be rejected by a significant margin"". The delay prompted angry Conservative backbenchers to trigger a party leadership challenge, which she survived by a margin of 200 to 117. Mrs May spent the end of last week in Brussels, saying she was focused on getting the additional assurances from EU leaders demanded by MPs to address concerns over the Northern Irish ""backstop"". Many MPs fear that in its current form, the arrangement - a temporary ""insurance policy"" at preventing the return of physical border posts in the event no future EU-UK trade deal came into force - would in reality see the UK subject to EU customs rules for the long term. In her Commons statement, Mrs May insisted she had won fresh guarantees at last week's EU summit, and hoped to secure additional ""political and legal assurance"" in the coming weeks. But Mr Corbyn responded: ""The prime minister has failed to renegotiate her deal, failed to get any meaningful reassurances."" He told MPs: ""The deal is unchanged and not going to change. This House must get on with the vote and move on to consider the realistic alternatives."" Pointing to reports that cabinet ministers had suggested pursuing alternatives, Mr Corbyn added: ""We are left edging closer to the 29 March deadline without a deal and without even an agreed plan in cabinet to get a deal."" The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: ""We thought the prime minister had reached rock bottom, but she's still digging."" Mr Blackford called on Mrs May to ""stop operating in isolation"" and meet opposition leaders to discuss a way forward. The PM said she was happy to meet Mr Blackford but warned they would have a ""fundamental difference of opinion"" on Brexit. He was later granted an emergency debate by Speaker John Bercow to follow up the prime minister's statement. Downing Street has distanced itself from an idea floated by several cabinet ministers for a series of non-binding votes on different Brexit outcomes to try and provide a way forward if the PM's deal is rejected.

"This video can not be played Theresa May announces Brexit vote date MPs will vote on the UK's Brexit deal in the week beginning 14 January, Theresa May has told Parliament. The vote was due to be held last week but was put on hold after Mrs May admitted she was set to lose. Announcing a new date, she said the EU had made it clear the Irish backstop was ""not a plot to trap the UK"", and urged MPs to see Brexit through. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would table a motion of no confidence in the PM for delaying the vote. He told the Commons it was unacceptable that MPs had to wait another month before having their say on Mrs May's deal. He added the PM had ""led the country into a national crisis"". Parliament Live: Rolling updates on Theresa May statement to MPs Corbyn: PM's led UK into national crisis Brexit: A really simple guide Reality Check: How could new referendum work? Kuenssberg: Don't forget there is actually a deal Mr Corbyn's motion - due to be tabled on Tuesday - calls on MPs to declare they have ""no confidence in the prime minister due to her failure to allow the House of Commons to have a meaningful vote straight away"" on the Brexit deal. It focuses on Mrs May personally, rather than the government. BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said that while the motion - if successful - could not end in the collapse of the government, ""it would be another embarrassment for the PM if Labour ends up winning the day"". Earlier, Mr Corbyn said a month would be wasted since the original 11 December vote was postponed, with ""not a single word renegotiated and not a single reassurance given"". ""The deal is unchanged and is not going to change,"" he said. ""The House must get on with the vote and move on to consider the realistic alternatives."" This video can not be played PM on EU: ""There is no plot to keep us in backstop."" Mrs May's Brexit deal sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU - on 29 March 2019 - and includes a declaration on the outline of the future relations between the UK and the EU. But the deal only comes into force if both parliaments approve it. In a Commons statement, Mrs May said MPs would resume the debate - halted last week - in the week of 7 January. The ""meaningful"" vote is due to take place in the following week. Mrs May told MPs: ""It is now only just over 14 weeks until the UK leaves the EU and I know many members of this House are concerned that we need to take a decision soon."" She said she had won fresh guarantees at last week's EU summit over measures to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and she hoped to secure additional ""political and legal assurances"" in the coming weeks. Earlier on Monday, an EU spokesman said it had provided the ""clarifications"" requested on the contentious issue of the Northern Ireland border backstop and ""no further meetings were foreseen"". During her statement, Mrs May faced calls from across the House for the vote to be held immediately. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: May taking shambolic government to new level The SNP's Ian Blackford said the government was a ""laughing stock"" and Parliament needed to ""take control of the situation and find a solution"". Former education secretary Justine Greening said Mrs May had led the UK down a ""political cul-de-sac"" and suggested that criticising alternatives to her deal was ""pointless"", given the level of opposition to it among MPs. ""She now isn't just not listening, she is not allowing debate,"" she said. Watt: Could John Bercow end the Brexit gridlock? Cameron 'advising PM on Brexit options' Former cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Esther McVey urged the PM to accelerate planning for a no-deal exit while another former minister, Andrew Mitchell, urged her to consider suspending the Brexit process to allow for further negotiations. Please upgrade your browser But Mrs May won support from one ""previously sceptical"" Brexiteer, Sir Edward Leigh, who said her efforts to secure a legally-binding protocol on the Irish backstop might pay off, urging her to ""keep calm and carry on"". Earlier, No 10 said it had ""no plans"" for votes on other Brexit outcomes if the PM's deal is rejected after it emerged David Cameron had given advice to his successor. The BBC understands Mr Cameron has been in touch with Mrs May about how a series of ""indicative votes"" on various different Brexit outcomes could be handled if there was deadlock over the terms of the UK's exit. Potential ""Plan B"" options include: pursuing differentNorwayorCanada-stylearrangements with the EU leaving on the basis of a""managed no deal"" delaying Brexit to restart negotiations holda fresh referendum The PM is coming under pressure from ministers to ""test the will of Parliament"" through a series of non-binding votes - which would see MPs pass judgement on the options available in the hope of identifying the most popular. Business Secretary Greg Clark said he backed Mrs May's deal but if Parliament was implacably opposed, it should be ""invited to say what it would agree with"". This video can not be played Could there be a second Brexit vote? ""Businesses expect MPs to take responsibility rather than just be critics,"" he told Radio 4's Today. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd made the same point, saying ""all options"" should remain on the table and if the deal was rejected ""let's think about how we test the will of Parliament to find out where the majority is"" Calls for another referendum have grown in recent weeks amid signs a majority of MPs are opposed both to the deal on the table but also leaving the EU without any kind of agreement. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said a new referendum would be the ""first opportunity for people to vote on the facts, not on the fantasy and the fabrication"". But Mrs May said another vote would do ""irreparable damage to the integrity of our politics"" and not settle the issue. ""Let us not break faith with the British people by trying to stage another referendum,"" she said. ""Another vote which would likely leave us no further forward than the last. And another vote which would further divide our country at the very moment we should be working to unite it."" New Brexit poll logical outcome - Blair There were reports in the Sunday newspapers that two of Mrs May's key allies were planning for another referendum, in the event that her deal cannot get MPs' backing. Both men - Downing Street chief of staff Gavin Barwell and Mrs May's de facto deputy David Lidington - distanced themselves from the reports. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Separately, more than 60 MPs from various parties have written to the PM urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit, saying it would do ""unnecessary economic damage"" to manufacturers in their constituencies. Speaking in the Commons, ex-minister Jonathan Djanogly said the UK was ""haemorrhaging support and investment"" while Oliver Heald said the EU's ""patronising"" attitude to the UK betrayed a lack of urgency to prevent the disruption of a disorderly Brexit.

Labour leader Mr Corbyn said on Monday it was unacceptable for MPs to wait a month to vote, adding the PM had led the UK into a ""national crisis"". But No 10 sources told the BBC the government would not make time for the no-confidence vote. Ministers would not ""go along with silly political games"", they added. Brexit: A really simple guide Reality Check: How could new referendum work? Kuenssberg: Don't forget there is actually a deal Mr Corbyn tabled the motion calling on MPs to declare they have ""no confidence in the prime minister due to her failure to allow the House of Commons to have a meaningful vote straightaway"" on the Brexit deal. The motion focuses on Mrs May personally, rather than the government. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the motion could have been embarrassing for Mrs May, but as things stood, ministers would not allow time for it to be debated. She said No 10 had effectively ""batted the ball back to Labour to see if they have the guts"" to call for a vote of no confidence in the government as a whole. Unlike a vote targeting the PM, a motion of no confidence in the government could bring about an early general election if it is supported by a majority of MPs. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn wants MPs to get a Brexit deal vote before Christmas The SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Greens have tried to force Labour to bring about that situation, by trying to amend Mr Corbyn's motion. But Mr Corbyn said his aim in tabling the motion was to put pressure on her to have a vote on her Brexit deal this week. Mrs May's Brexit deal sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU - on 29 March 2019 - and includes a declaration on the outline of the future relations between the UK and the EU. But the deal only comes into force if both parliaments approve it. Mrs May told MPs they would have the chance to vote on the deal she negotiated with Brussels in the third week of January. Mr Corbyn said by then a month would have been wasted since the original 11 December vote was postponed, with ""not a single word renegotiated and not a single reassurance given"". ""The deal is unchanged and is not going to change,"" he said. ""The House must get on with the vote and move on to consider the realistic alternatives."" However, Mr Corbyn came under fire from other opposition parties for limiting his no-confidence motion to the prime minister. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeontweeted,external: ""Labour tabling a motion just in the PM rather than in the entire government begs the question, which Tory do they want to see as PM?"" And Nigel Dodds, of Northern Ireland's DUP, which has propped up the Conservative government since June 2017, said: ""We are not interested in the parliamentary antics or play-acting of the Labour Party."" But Mr Corbyn told reporters late on Monday: ""We haven't failed to trigger any process. It's this government that is denying Parliament the right to vote on this process, that's why I tabled the motion."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: May taking shambolic government to new level Mrs May appeared to have the support of pro-Brexit backbench critics who last week failed in a bid to oust her as Tory leader. One of them, Steve Baker, said: ""Eurosceptic Conservatives are clear that we accept the democratic decision of our party to have confidence in Theresa May as PM. We will vote against Labour in any confidence motion."" In other Brexit-related news: The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford was granted an emergency debate on Brexit for Tuesday, having said Parliament needed to ""take control of the situation and find a solution"" TheresaMay rejected reports she was taking advicefrom predecessor David Cameron on what to do in the event of a Brexit deadlock in Parliament More than 60 MPs from various parties wrote to the PM urging her to rule out a no-deal Brexit, saying it would do ""unnecessary economic damage"" to manufacturers Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney saidBrexit might have to be delayedif the UK submitted an ""entirely new"" withdrawal proposal In a Commons statement, Mrs May said MPs would resume the debate - halted last week - in the week of 7 January. The ""meaningful"" vote is due to take place the following week. This video can not be played PM on EU: ""There is no plot to keep us in backstop."" Mrs May told MPs: ""It is now only just over 14 weeks until the UK leaves the EU and I know many members of this House are concerned that we need to take a decision soon."" She said she had won fresh guarantees at last week's EU summit over measures to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and she hoped to secure additional ""political and legal assurances"" in the coming weeks. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Earlier on Monday, an EU spokesman said it had provided the ""clarifications"" requested on the contentious issue of the Northern Ireland border backstop and ""no further meetings were foreseen"". By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Keeping up? I don't blame if you if it all seems like procedural nonsense. And frankly, you might not be completely wrong. But what it suggests is that despite widespread frustration on all sides, Jeremy Corbyn is so far stopping short of taking a real shot at toppling May's administration, and is unlikely to do so unless, and until, he thinks he can win. For her part, Theresa May is unlikely to budge on her plan, unless and until she is forced to do so. To the immense irritation of both their supporters and their rivals, even though the Brexit clock is running down, neither of the main party leaders are willing to take the kind of radical move that might unblock the gridlock.

"The report suggests YouTube, Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram and Google+ were affected by Russian interference, as well as Facebook and Twitter Russia used every major social media platform to try to influence the 2016 US election, a report claims. New research says YouTube, Tumblr, Instagram and PayPal - as well as Facebook and Twitter - were leveraged to spread propaganda. The report, released today by the US Senate, exposes the scale of Russian disinformation efforts. Its authors criticise the ""belated and unco-ordinated response"" by tech firms. The report was put together by University of Oxford's Computational Propaganda Project and the social network analysis firm Graphika. It is the first analysis of millions of social media posts provided by Twitter, Google and Facebook to the Senate Intelligence Committee. While Facebook and Twitter have previously disclosed Russian interference,little has been known about the use of other platforms. The report suggests YouTube, Tumblr, PayPal and Google+ were all affected, with Russia adapting techniques from digital marketing to target audiences across multiple channels. ""It's a whole family of social media sites,"" says Philip N Howard, director of the Oxford Internet Institute. ""We think the goal was to make the campaigns seem more legitimate."" Sergei Skripal and the Russian disinformation game Facebook to share Russia-linked political adverts with investigators Russia-linked posts 'reached 126m Facebook users in US' The research detailsa vast campaign spearheaded by the Internet Research Agency(IRA) - a Russian company that has been described by the United States Intelligence Community as a troll farm with ties to the Russian government. The report says Russia had a particular focus on targeting conservatives with posts on immigration, race and gun rights. There were also efforts to undermine the voting power of left-leaning African-American citizens, by spreading misinformation about the electoral process. Another report, also released today by the Senate, by the research firmNew Knowledge,external, similarly highlights Russia's efforts to target African-Americans. It explains how Russia's IRA were focused on ""developing Black audiences and recruiting Black Americans as assets,"" which included encouraging activists to stage rallies. One IRA campaign highlighted in the Oxford and Graphika paper, Black Matters US, existed across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Google+, Tumblr and PayPal. These various accounts would promote each other's posts and events. When Facebook suspended the group on its platform, the group's Twitter account complained about the move and accused the social network of ""supporting white supremacy"". Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election ""What is clear is that all of the messaging clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party - and specifically Donald Trump,"" the report says. ""Trump is mentioned most in campaigns targeting conservatives and right-wing voters, where the messaging encouraged these groups to support his campaign. The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract and ultimately discourage members from voting."" While the data used by the researchers was provided by Facebook, Twitter and Google, their findings criticise the ""belated and uncoordinated response"" from these companies to Russia's disinformation campaign. The researchers highlight details that could have led internet companies to detect interference earlier, such as the use of the Russian rouble to buy advertisements and internet signatures relating to the IRA's base of operations. The BBC has asked Russia's Embassy in the UK for comment. The IRA was among the three companies indicted earlier this year, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Twelve of the agency's employees faced indictment charges, as well as its alleged financier, Yevgeny Prigozhin. ""Social media have gone from being the natural infrastructure for sharing collective grievances and co-ordinating civic engagement, to being a computational tool for social control, manipulated by canny political consultants and available to politicians in democracies and dictatorships alike,"" the report says.

"NHS Highland and Highland Council have issued warnings about the liquid inside electronic cigarettes Pupils at a school in Highlands became seriously ill after drinking vaping fluid contained within electronic cigarettes. Dingwall Academy has sent letters home with its students warning that the liquid is ""highly toxic and can be fatal"". NHS Highland has issued a wider warning about the potential risks of the behaviour. Signs someone has drunk the fluid include vomiting and dizziness. Highland Council said letters went out to pupils' parents and carers on Friday. A spokeswoman said: ""We have had to deal with a small number of incidents over the last couple of days where pupils have become seriously ill in school. ""We believe that the illnesses may have been caused by individuals drinking vaping fluid, which is highly dangerous. ""We have spoken to pupils at assemblies and have sought further advice from the police and NHS Highland."" Dr Jenny Wares, consultant in health protection at NHS Highland, said the health board was alerted to a small number of young people having become ""seriously unwell after ingesting the fluid within electronic cigarettes"". She said: ""When ingested, the contents of the fluid are highly toxic and can be fatal. ""The main risk of toxicity is from the nicotine content although there is a risk of toxicity from other ingredients within the fluid. ""If you have any concerns that an individual has ingested fluid from an electronic cigarette please seek immediate medical attention by calling 999 and don't leave the person alone."" Dr Wares said there were a wide range of possible symptoms including nausea and vomiting, confusion, agitation and headaches, dizziness, excessive sweating, breathing difficulties, altered heart rate and possible fitting. She added: ""Given the seriousness of this situation please ensure this information is shared with your children, young people and their friends."" Kate Forbes, SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch and a former pupil at Dingwall Academy, said the school's rector and staff had acted promptly to alert pupils to the ""dangerous consequences"" of drinking vaping fluid.

"Clean Bandit and Demi Lovato had the most-Shazamed song of 2018 In a world full of smart devices, self-driving cars and voice assistants, Shazam is the closest technology comes to actual magic. The software allows you to hold your phone up to a speaker and answer the age-old question, ""what is this song and who's it by?"" without the humiliation of having to ask the DJ. And in 2018 the answer, most frequently, was ""Solo by Clean Bandit"". The song, which features US star Demi Lovato, was tagged 9.1 million times. That's half a million more than the second most searched-for song, X by Nicky Jam and J Balvin. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

British artists performed five of Shazam's top 10 songs, with Calvin Harris, Dua Lipa and newcomer Tom Walker all making the chart. Anne-Marie and Marshmello's hit single Friends was also the most searched-for track in a single day, racking up 800,000 tags on 8 April. The peak in curiosity came a full two months after the song was released, illustrating how slowly songs filter into the public consciousness in the streaming era. Dua Lipa UK's most-streamed female Why is Apple buying Shazam? In a similar vein, Ed Sheeran's Perfect, which is now 21 months old, was the most sought-after pop song of 2018. The former Christmas number one has been Shazamed a total of 16 million times, raising the question: ""Are there really 16 million people who haven't heard of Ed Sheeran?"" Sadly, the company's press release remained silent on the matter. Drake was the most searched-for artist of the year but failed to make the top 10 - presumably because his searches were split across the 21 tracks on his Scorpion album. J Balvin was the app's second most-popular artist; and scored two entries in the top 10 (although none as a solo artist). Shazam's technology works by analysing the unique sonic fingerprint of a song - which it uses to match the music in its database to the audio you send via your phone. The company was bought by Apple Music last year for a reported $400m (Â£316m). At the time, it had more than 120 million monthly users; and was one of the few music technology companies to be turning a profit. Apple's hope was that the app would drive users to its streaming service, which is currently second only to Sweden's Spotify in terms of subscribers. The takeover was held up by the European Commission over concerns it would give Apple Music an unfair advantage over its rivals, but the acquisition was finally approved in September.

"Lewis Hamilton seemed to refer to Stevenage as ""the slums"" on stage at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards Lewis Hamilton has been criticised by his home town for saying it was his dream to ""get out of the slums"". The Formula 1 racing driver made the comment on stage last night at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards. He seemed to immediately backtrack but the leader of Stevenage Borough Council said it was ""disappointing"" and people felt ""very offended"".

Stevenage: The town that aimed for Utopia Speaking to one of the presenters, Gabby Logan, he said: ""It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums, we would say. ""It was not the slums, but to just come out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team."" Stevenage in Hertfordshire was designated the UK's first new town, in 1946 Stevenage Borough Council leader Sharon Taylor said: ""It is disappointing that Lewis Hamilton referred to Stevenage as 'the slums' at such a high-profile event.

"A British man says he could face up to 15 years in an Indonesian prison after being found with cannabis oil which he says he needed for medical reasons. Pip Holmes, from Cornwall, was arrested for drug smuggling when he went to collect a package containing the oil. The 45-year-old artist says he asked a friend to send it to him while he was living in Bali to help his arthritis. Indonesia has very strict anti-drugs laws and frequently arrests foreigners on drug-related charges. Mr Holmes says he was aware of the penalties and his actions were ""foolish and dumb"". He was detained on 3 December after going to pick up the package, sent from Thailand, which contained essential oil bottles with cannabis oil inside. After spending six days in a police cell, Mr Holmes was transferred to a police hospital rehabilitation facility as his lawyers argued he was a drug user - after he failed a drugs test - rather than a trafficker. However, he is still facing a drug trafficking charge and was paraded in front of the cameras last week for what he calls a ""very surreal and bizarre"" news conference. He sat alongside four other men accused of drug smuggling, which can carry the death penalty in Indonesia. Despite reports that Mr Holmes could be facing that punishment, he says the small quantity of drugs found on him means that is not the case. Pip Holmes (second from right) is put in front of the local media alongside other foreigners Speaking from the rehabilitation centre, where he is locked in a room and guarded by two men but has access to a phone, he told the BBC the press conference was ""really harrowing"". He said he doesn't feel like he is a criminal drug trafficker, but the Indonesian press are painting a picture of him along those lines. ""I just wanted to stand up and say I'm really not in this category, but the law is very different here and it's very harsh. ""It feels like a great injustice, but I'm not in the UK, I'm in Bali, so it's my own fault."" In the UK medicinal cannabis products can be legally prescribed to some patients afterrules were relaxed earlier this year- although access is very limited. The father of two, whose 11-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter live in the UK with his ex-wife, has had arthritis for eight years and says it was caused by years of practising Thai boxing. He says: ""Marijuana makes a considerable difference to the pain - it's not a leisure activity for me."" Mr Holmes is no stranger to travelling - he spent time in Canada earlier this year, while he has a tattoo studio in Thailand - and he arrived in Bali at the end of October planning to spend a couple of months surfing and painting. ""I knew what I was getting into,"" he says. ""I knew there were very strict laws but I chose to come here anyway because the surf is the best in the world."" Indonesian law does not recognise medical marijuana use. He says he is facing a sentence of between five to 15 years atKerobokan prison in Bali- a place Mr Holmes calls ""horrendous"" and ""terrifying"". The BBC has been unable to confirm with the Indonesian authorities what sentence he might face. However at his next court date, expected to be in January, Mr Holmes is hoping to be classed as a marijuana addict and be eligible for a rehabilitation sentence. He says although the police reported that he was found with 31g of medicinal THC oil, that weight included the bottles (28g). Anything smaller than 5g, he says, would make him eligible for a sentence of around 12 months in a rehabilitation facility instead. He says he needs to raise money to fight his case. Pip Holmes, at one of his exhibitions, will be auctioning off some of his paintings to raise money He says: ""I have no idea what is going to happen to me next. ""I'm afraid because I don't know how long it's going to be before I can hug my children again. They are the only thing keeping me going right now."" Allow Twitter content?

"Online fashion retailer Asos has warned of weak profits this financial year after ""unprecedented"" discounting hit its trading in November. After reports of dismal High Street activity last month, the Asos warning indicates the pain is spreading online. The firm said cutting prices to match rivals had not shifted more clothes. In fact, economic uncertainty plus weaker consumer confidence had led to ""the weakest growth in online clothing sales in recent years"". Asos shares fell nearly 40% in morning trading. Chief executive Nick Beighton said the fashion industry was currently experiencing an ""unprecedented level of discounting, something I've not seen before"". In a conference call with industry analysts, he said consumer confidence was ""fragile"". Why are people spending less this Christmas? Why are there so many pre-Christmas sales? Despite sales growth of 14% from September to November, Asos saw ""a significant deterioration"" in November. It had previously forecast sales growth of 20-25% in the year to August 2019. However, it now expects just 15% growth. Its anticipated profit margin was also revised down, from 4% to 2%. Worried voices of retail are becoming a deafening chorus and the lyrics are simple. November was bad - really bad - and not just on the High Street. Online retail darling Asos saw its shares plunge 35% this morning after warning that its profits would undershoot expectations. Comments from chief executive Nick Beighton describing an ""unprecedented level of discounting"" saw other retailers' share prices slump, including those of Boohoo, Next and JD Sports. Last week, Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley said November had been the ""worst November in living memory"" and predicted some retailers would be ""smashed to pieces"". The woes of predominantly bricks-and-mortar retailers (like clothing retailer BonmarchÃ©, which saw its shares halve as it lurched to a Â£4m loss last week) have been well chronicled, but the significance of the Asos update is that it shows the fight for every last pound and every last percentage point of profit margin has spread online. There may yet be a late rush, but evidence so far suggests retailers' annus horribilis is not ending well. ""Whilst trading in September and October was broadly in line with our expectations, November, a very material month for us from both a sales and cash margin perspective, was significantly behind expectations,"" Asos said. ""There has been a high level of discounting and promotional activity across the market. We have increased our own level of promotional activity, leading to a higher discount and continued high clearance mix. ""This increased discounting, coupled with the unseasonably warm weather during the last three months has reduced our ASP [average selling price], which has not been compensated by higher units per basket."" Outside the UK, Asos said trading conditions in Germany and France, which account for about 60% of its EU sales, had become ""significantly more challenging"". Over the three months to 30 November, total group revenue was Â£656m, up from Â£576.7m in the same period last year. Rival firm Boohoo saw its shares tumble 10% in the wake of the Asos announcement. However, it said it was ""pleased to confirm"" that its trading performance remained strong, ""with record Black Friday sales across the group"", and that it continued to trade ""comfortably in line with market expectations"". Asos's bleak assessment comes after Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley described trading in November as ""the worst on record, unbelievably bad"". ""Retailers just cannot take that kind of November,"" Mr Ashley told analysts last week. ""It will literally smash them to pieces."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""After making impressive strides in recent years, a challenging consumer backdrop has finally tripped Asos up. ""Recent data revealed a huge decline in UK retail footfall, which it would have been easy to assume was due to online players taking share at a faster rate. These numbers show it's more complicated, and more worrying, than that. ""It looks like consumer confidence has been knocked to the extent people aren't spending much anywhere, be it in physical stores or online."" Mr Salmon said ""uncertainty around Brexit"" would also be playing a major role. He added: ""It's probably no coincidence Asos's key demographic of 20-somethings generally harbour more concerns over the future of the economy post-Brexit than their parents.""

"MPs debated new figures on homeless deaths in England and Wales They also debated a UN report on the Rohingya refugee crisis in Myanmar Earlier: Andrea Leadsom outlined parliamentary timetable for after Christmas She said MPs' debate on the Brexit deal will resume on January 9th The House of Lords debated Islamophobia in the UK Richard Morris, Sophie Morris and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Members of Parliament (MPs) will vote next week on the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated. House of CommonsParliament With the Commons finished for the day, that's it from us until after Christmas. Today began with questions to trade and equalities ministers, before shadow housing minister Melanie Onn asked an urgent question onnew statisticsabout deaths among homeless people. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom then gave the business statement, repeatedly stressing that MPs will get to vote on the government's Brexit deal in the week beginning January 14. Following that, MPs debated the UN report on the Rohingya refugee crisis, as chosen by the backbench business committee. Parliament returns on Monday 7th of January, do join us then...and have a happy Christmas. Adjournment Debate House of CommonsParliament Bringing the day to the end before MPs head home for Christmas, Labour MP Clive Efford is leading the short adjournment debate. The focus of today's debate is the Source NHS drop-in centre in the Horn Park Estate, which is in Mr Efford's constituency of Eltham, east London. Rohingya refugees UN report debate House of CommonsParliament Bringing the debate to an end, Labour's Rushanara Ali says the focus of the debate has been highlighting the need for a referral to the International Criminal Court She says the minister has ""very ably"" explained the complexities of the issue, but asks ""if not now, when?"" ""We are absolutely determined that the government takes much stronger action and reports back every few months with results, rather than having to go round and round in circles"", she says. ""Genocide cannot be taken lightly. This is why we must act."" Rohingya refugees UN report House of CommonsParliament Foreign Office Minister Mark Field says Bangladesh has shown ""immense generosity"" in hosting so many Rohingya refugees. He says many he has spoken to want to return to Myanmar, as long as they can get guarantees that they won't be persecuted. He says he has told the foreign ministers of Myanmar and Bangladesh that the UK believes not enough is being done to repatriate Rohingya refugees. The UK has so far given Â£129m in assistance, he adds. The government will ""try"" to bring a motion forward at the UN, but there are some ""fundamental strategic difficulties"" which may prevent that, he tells MPs. He says this will be a ""very long journey"" but the UK ""will stay the course"" for the people of Myanmar. Rohingya refugees UN report debate House of CommonsParliament Winding up, shadow foreign office minister Helen Goodman says the government must respond to today's debate ""in full, with action"". She was ""alarmed"" when she heard that discussions had been held between the Bangladesh and Myanmar about repatriation of the Rohingya, in which case she says the main question is: ""are the conditions right for a safe,voluntary and dignified return?"" MPs have today sent a ""resounding no"", she says, and the big question is what should be done now. ""Everything we know about the Myanmar government suggests that we cannot have confidence in an internal inquiry, she says. Labour ""believe that it is now time for a UN Security Council resolution referring Myanmar to the ICC [International Criminal Court]"". She says she understands this is likely to be rejected by other members, but it's important to stand up for what the UK believes. Sanctions should be extended, with assets frozen and individuals travel further restricted, she adds. Rohingya refugees UN report House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Patrick Grady says the Scottish government expects ""all states to comply with human rights law"", and backs EU and US sanctions against Burmese military figures. ""It is clear that further support is needed for the authorities and first responders in Bangladesh,"" he says. He adds that it has been suggested that ""barely half"" of the funding required for these refugee camps has been provided. ""We keep saying it must never happen again, yet, here we are,"" he says, referring to previous instances of such crimes. Rohingya refugees UN report debate House of CommonsParliament DUP MP Jim Shannon says the international community has taken ""woefully insufficient"" action to resolve the crisis or bring the perpetrators of violence to account. ""If there's a war crimes tribunal, I'll be the first person in the queue to give them a good going over"", he says, adding: ""it is absolutely despicable what's been going on."" The British government must push Myanmar to grant the Rohingya citizen rights as soon as possible, he says, requesting to know what has been done on this by the government. He urges the minister to ""take this case to heart"" and to take action, as the UK has a responsibility to do. ""There are hundreds of thousands of people looking towards us, praying for relief"", he adds. There have been discussions throughout this year between Myanmar and Bangladesh about repatriating Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar. Officially, the two countries want to see this process
completed by 2019. A breakthrough came in June, when Myanmar saw progress on
registering all refugees in camps around Rakhine state. Only a tiny number of refugees have so far returned to
Rakhine state, all of them apparently not through official channels. Spokespeople for the Rohingya say that issues on citizenship
need to be addressed before they return. They are also requesting an
international security presence, and proper restitution for their loss - conditions which have so far not been met. Rohingya have continued to cross into Bangladesh during
2018, albeit in smaller numbers. Islamophobia Debate House of LordsParliament Concluding the debate, Conservative peer Lord Sheikh says he is pleased that numerous peers have raised the point that people of other religions ""must stand by the Muslims"". Lord Sheikh says everyone should be accepted in the UK, no matter their faith or race, and that he is pleased that the government has agreed to look into adopting an official definition for Islamophobia. He says it is clear that the issue needs to be researched in more detail, and he hopes the government will do this. The Rohingya, who numbered around one million in Myanmar at the start of 2017, are one of the many ethnic minorities in the country. Rohingya Muslims represent the largest percentage of Muslims in Myanmar, with the majority living in Rakhine state. They have their own language and culture, and say they are descendants of Arab traders and other groups who have been in the region for generations. But the government of Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country, denies the Rohingya citizenship and even excluded them from the 2014 census, refusing to recognise them as a people. It sees them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Islamophobia Debate House of LordsParliament Communities Minister Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth says the work of the British Muslims all-party parliamentary group will be being brought forwards in the new year. He says an agreed definition of Islamophobia ""will make things better"", but needs to be thoroughly discussed. The government is teaming schools situated in areas with a particularly diverse range of faiths with each other to ensure a wider education on religion, he says. Lord Bourne says the diversity of the UK should be celebrated, adding that Islamophobia is ""shameful"" and something the government wants to combat. Rohingya refugees UN report debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Imran Hussain - who represents the constituency with the largest number of Rohingya residents in the UK - says the persecution of the Rohingya is not new, but has reached new highs. He calls the treatment of the Rohingya in Myanmar - also known as Burma - is a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". He says Rohingya ""faced murder, their friends and relatives cut down by gunfire, knives and machetes, and whatever else soldiers and thugs could get their hands on"". He says he asked the government to condemn the action in August last year, and ""even today I cannot think of one occasion when the government has condemned it."" Minister Mark Field intervenes to say the government has condemned senior figures of the Burmese military, but ""it's all very well to condemn...we have a range of other actions...condemnation is never enough."" Mr Hussain says the Burmese government must be held to account with the full power of the international community, with the leaders sent to the International Criminal Court. No longer can the UK ""hide from our global responsibilities"", he says. Islamophobia Debate House of LordsParliament Summing up the debate for Labour, Baroness Chakrabarti says ""racism is on the rise"" and Islamophobia is ""too often in particular denied in our politics and media"". She says there is a value in working towards a widely accepted definition of Islamophobia, and thanks the all-party parliamentary group for their work in this area. She tells peers that people ""should be able to criticise Islam"", but that Islamophobia is about a ""hatred for those who practice that faith"". ""Hating someone is not the same as critiquing ideas, and it is completely unacceptable"", she adds. She says that even though Muslims can belong to any race, Islamophobia is ""rooted"" in racism and she therefore supports this part of the group'sdefinition,external. Islamophobia Debate House of LordsParliament Crossbench peer Baroness Afshar says it is regrettable that Islamophobia is emerging in the UK, a country that has welcomed people from all walks of life. She says the UK has been ""pioneering"" in the collaboration of different cultures, quoting the example of fish and chip shops serving curry sauce. Baroness Afshar questions what other steps the government is taking to combat hate crime against Muslims, noting that individuals in her community are being ""demonized in the name of religion"". Rohingya refugees UN report debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Paul Scully says because the Burmese people are largely in favour of the ejection of the Rohingya from their country, the military are able to hide behind ideas of being a popular movement and rule out any criticism as Western propaganda. He says the UK needs to ""cut through"" this and tell the Burmese authorities that whilst ""we will help you in terms of building up the rule of law...we will always, always call you out when you are just breaking in any certain sense of international law and human rights"". It's vital that those responsible are held to account, he says, but also that an end to the conflict can be reached and that the country is able to move on. Islamophobia Debate House of LordsParliament Non-affiliated peer Baroness Uddin says ""knee jerk policy reactions"" threaten the safety of Muslims in many parts of Europe, leading to the ""social exclusion of a whole community"". She says it was ""alarming"" when in 2015 David Cameron ""inferred that if Muslim women spoke more English it would reduce extremism"". The office of equality and social justice has more to do, she adds, noting that people have been made to think there is a link between Muslims, separatists and terrorists. Baroness Uddin says the work by the British Muslims parliamentary group is ""timely"" and urges the government to listen to what they have to say. Rohingya refugees UN report House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Stephen Twigg, who chairs the international development committee, says the current crisis in Myanmar is the result of ""decades of marginalisation and persecution"" of Rohingya. He says members of his committee were fused entry to Myanmar to see the areas affected. He says when a plan to repatriate refugees was announced in November, ""many of the refugees went and hid in the surrounding forests, at least one committed suicide"". He says that buses arrived at the camp and refugees were offered food to return to Myanmar if they got on the coaches, but the buses returned empty. When refugees return, he says, it must be ""safe, voluntary and dignified"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Geoffrey Rush says the allegations are incorrect Australian actor Geoffrey Rush has denied new allegations that he acted inappropriately towards an actress. Orange is the New Black actress Yael Stone said the incidents took place when she and the Oscar-winning actor starred in a Sydney play in 2010-11. She alleges that Mr Rush danced naked in her presence, watched her shower, and sent her sexual text messages. Earlier this year, actress Eryn Jean Norvill accused Mr Rush of touching her inappropriately - a claim he denies. On Monday, Mr Rush responded to Ms Stone's allegations, saying they were ""incorrect"" and in some instances ""taken completely out of context"". ""Clearly Yael has been upset on occasion by the spirited enthusiasm I generally bring to my work,"" the actor said in a statement released by his lawyer. ""I sincerely and deeply regret if I have caused her any distress."" In interviews with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and The New York Times, Ms Stone alleged that a string of incidents took place during a production of The Diary of a Madman. The Australian actress, then 25, received text messages from her co-star, then 59, that became ""increasingly sexual"" in nature, according to her accounts. Yael Stone is best known for appearing on Netflix series Orange is the New Black She also alleged that the Oscar winner had once held a mirror above her when she was showering in an attempt to see her naked. ""I believe it was made in the spirit of a joke. The fact is it made me incredibly uncomfortable,"" she told the ABC. Ms Stone said she did not complain at the time because she feared it would harm her career. ""There was no part of my brain considering speaking to anyone in any official capacity. This was a huge star,"" she told the US outlet. Mr Rush is currently fighting a defamation case in Australiaagainst a newspaper which published reports of the case involving Ms Norvill. The court is yet to reach a verdict.

Carol Boardman, 75, died in July 2016. Liam Rosney, 33, of Connah's Quay, admitted causing death by careless driving at Mold Crown Court. He had previously faced a charge of causing death by dangerous driving. He and his wife Victoria Rosney were cleared of attempting to pervert the course of justice in July. Rosney had been due to stand trial on Monday but changed his plea when proceedings were about to start. He will be sentenced at a later date. Following the change of plea, Matthew Curtis, prosecuting, said the Crown had carefully considered the position and did not invite a trial in relation to the more serious charge of causing death by dangerous driving. Carol Boardman: ""The most positive person you could ever hope to meet"", her son said Mrs Boardman, a keen cyclist, died after she fell off her bike and Rosney drove over her at a roundabout on 16 July 2016.

"NHS Highland and Highland Council have issued warnings about the liquid inside electronic cigarettes Pupils at a school in Highlands became seriously ill after drinking vaping fluid contained within electronic cigarettes. Dingwall Academy has sent letters home with its students warning that the liquid is ""highly toxic and can be fatal"". NHS Highland has issued a wider warning about the potential risks of the behaviour. Signs someone has drunk the fluid include vomiting and dizziness. Highland Council said letters went out to pupils' parents and carers on Friday. A spokeswoman said: ""We have had to deal with a small number of incidents over the last couple of days where pupils have become seriously ill in school. ""We believe that the illnesses may have been caused by individuals drinking vaping fluid, which is highly dangerous. ""We have spoken to pupils at assemblies and have sought further advice from the police and NHS Highland."" Dr Jenny Wares, consultant in health protection at NHS Highland, said the health board was alerted to a small number of young people having become ""seriously unwell after ingesting the fluid within electronic cigarettes"". She said: ""When ingested, the contents of the fluid are highly toxic and can be fatal. ""The main risk of toxicity is from the nicotine content although there is a risk of toxicity from other ingredients within the fluid. ""If you have any concerns that an individual has ingested fluid from an electronic cigarette please seek immediate medical attention by calling 999 and don't leave the person alone."" Dr Wares said there were a wide range of possible symptoms including nausea and vomiting, confusion, agitation and headaches, dizziness, excessive sweating, breathing difficulties, altered heart rate and possible fitting. She added: ""Given the seriousness of this situation please ensure this information is shared with your children, young people and their friends."" Kate Forbes, SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch and a former pupil at Dingwall Academy, said the school's rector and staff had acted promptly to alert pupils to the ""dangerous consequences"" of drinking vaping fluid.

"This video can not be played Group founder: Hull hotel 'discriminating' against homeless people A hotel is accused of discriminating against homeless people after cancelling their Christmas booking. Carl Simpson, of Raise the Roof Homeless Project, says he was ""gutted"" when the Royal Hotel in Hull cancelled the Â£1,092 booking without explanation. The hotel later said the reason was that it had been told about damage to rooms during the group's Christmas booking at an Ibis hotel last year. Raise the Roof says the allegations are ""lies"". Ibis has also denied the claim. Raise the Roof told the BBC it booked 14 twin rooms for 28 people in twin rooms - hoping to build on the success of last year's event at the Ibis. Delivery man fired for eating food gets sympathy Angry mum spits in face of Christmas elf WATCH: Christmas lights tunnel is 'magical' It said The Royal Hotel originally accepted the booking, and that it had not attempted to conceal the guests' backgrounds. ""We told them up front they were for homeless people,"" Mr Simpson said. ""They were fine with that."" A spokesperson for the hotel said the company had been warned by a ""former project worker"" not to take the booking. Mr Simpson organised rooms for 28 homeless people on Christmas eve and Christmas day in 2017 ""We received a call from a lady... who worked for the charity last year,"" the spokesperson said. ""She had rung to warn us that the group had caused serious problems at the Ibis and that she felt we should not take the booking. ""Among the issues last year were trashing of rooms, fires, theft of hotel goods and property and damage to property. ""The hotel has a number of families and tours staying at the hotel over the Christmas period which we feel would suffer if the booking was taken."" The spokesperson added that the hotel would reinstate the booking, with conditions. The Ibis chain told the BBC it did not recognise the allegations. In a statement, it said: ""We can confirm that we welcomed a group of homeless people for two nights last Christmas booked by Raise the Roof Homeless Project, and that the organisers felt the stay was very successful. ""We don't recognise any allegations that these guests caused serious problems such as fire or theft in the hotel."" One of the homeless people who attended the Ibis hotel last year told the BBC: ""It was the best Christmas present you could get, really. It's such a relief to be off the streets even for that one night."" In a Facebook post on Saturday evening, Mr Simpson said he had been hoping to repeat ""the success of last Christmas"" when he was able to book 28 people into an Ibis hotel for two nights. ""After the stay they were so grateful. Some left staff gifts using the very little money they had, and one asked if he could vacuum the rooms to show his appreciation. ""This means the world to homeless people. Last year we had tears of joy from someone who stood on the edge of the Humber Bridge the night before. ""We have to break the news to people that the hotel has been cancelled."" Mr Simpson said he was yet to receive a refund for the booking, and so was unable to rebook another hotel, adding: ""We need a miracle."" Homeless people in Hull were looking forward to having a roof over their heads for Christmas He said he relied ondonations,externalto make the original booking and he was worried whether the number of rooms needed could be found elsewhere at an affordable price. Since his Mr Simpson's originalFacebook,externalpost, the news of the cancelled booking where it has been shared by more than 1,000 people and online fundraising for the group has received a Â£6,000 boost. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme earlier, he said: ""I wasn't really aware we'd reached that. That's amazing. We just need the rooms now. ""There are lots of reasons people become homeless, not just the ones they seem to be labelled with,"" Mr Simpson said. ""We see people from family break-ups and ex-servicemen."" The Facebook post has inspired others to try to help the homeless this Christmas. Beckie Stewart writes: ""Aren't there people willing to bring in one or two on Christmas eve? I'm sleeping over at my mum's so I'm happy to offer a room.""

"A change in how student loans are recorded in the public finances will add Â£12bn to the deficit, following an Office for National Statistics ruling. The amount expected not to be repaid, which could be 45% of lending, will be reclassified as public spending. Student loans will now significantly push up the UK's deficit - providing an incentive to reduce tuition fees. The government said the change would be taken into account by the tuition fees review, due to report early next year. The decision by the statistics agency tackles an anomaly in which the cost of lending to students, to cover fees and maintenance, has been missing from the public finances. It will significantly increase the deficit - which is the difference between what the government spends and what it receives. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury select committee and former education secretary, welcomed the ruling - saying the current loans system lacked scrutiny when the government could ""spend billions of pounds of public money without any negative impact on its deficit target"". The independent economics think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the accounting system has been ""absurdly generous"" to the government's finances. It says the effort to reflect the real cost of the fees system, in which 70% of students will not fully re-pay, would bring public finances closer to ""economic reality"". The change applies across the UK, but most of this will be accounted for by lending to students in England. It might sound like a technical change - but it has major implications for the level of tuition fees in England. The decision by the ONS will provide a juicy carrot for the government to lower fees from Â£9,250 - because under the accounting changes, the higher the level of fees, the higher the lending and the greater the negative impact on the deficit. Is the tuition fees 'financial illusion' about to unravel? Could financial changes affect student loans? What do universities spend tuition fees on? Tuition fee system heading for trillion pound gap in public finances If the government does nothing - and sticks with the current level of fees - the damage to the deficit will rise from Â£12bn at present to Â£17bn in five years, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Student finance is under review and iffees were lowered to Â£6,500or Â£7,500, as has been suggested, it would mean less pressure, at least in presentational terms, on the public finances. It would also leave universities worrying about how their budgets would be compensated. But in terms of the political importance attached to reducing the deficit, tuition fees in their current form might suddenly look much less attractive. The IFS says it is likely to mean the government will look for other options - which could mean lower fees, lower interest charges or fewer students. The think tank also warns that it if the Chancellor had about Â£15bn in room to manoeuvre, much of that will have been wiped out. Almost half of the value of student lending is expected to be written off - and this will now be reclassified as spending, which the ONS says will push up the deficit by Â£12bn. It will end an arrangementaccused of being a ""fiscal illusion""by the House of Lords economic affairs committee. The Lords committee forecast that not counting the cost of loans until they were written off after 30 years would grow into a trillion pound black hole. The Treasury select committee had also warned that in effect most of higher education funding had disappeared from public spending figures. The decision by the ONS will stop ""kicking the can down the road"" on the cost of student finance. The new classifications will divide student loan payments into ""genuine government lending"" for the portion expected to be repaid - while the portion not expected to be repaid, around 45%, will count as spending. While students might look forward to lower fees, universities are warning against a potential loss of funding. Much of university funding in England is through tuition fees - and if fees were cut there would be questions about replacing the shortfall. ""Ministers may now be tempted to cut university funding because it will look better for the deficit, but good policy shouldn't be dictated by accounting rules,"" said Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said the ""180-degree flip"" on accounting will seem ""embarrassing for policymakers"". But he warned it could mean less funding for students as they ""suddenly look much more costly to current taxpayers"". Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, warned against ""knee-jerk reactions"" which could cut spending on students or limit student numbers. Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said it proved the ""student loans system is a fiscal illusion which flatters the government's record"". A government spokesman emphasised that in practical terms, this ""does not affect students, who can still access loans to help with tuition fees and the cost of living and which they will only start repaying when they are earning above Â£25,000"".

"Malaysia has filed criminal charges against Goldman Sachs and two former employees in connection with a corruption and money laundering probe at the country's investment fund, 1MDB. The US bank has been under scrutiny for its role in helping to raise funds for the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB). It is being investigated in at least six countries. Goldman Sachs called the charges ""misdirected"" and said it would ""vigorously defend them"". ""The firm continues to co-operate with all authorities investigating these matters,"" the bank added. Malaysia filed the charges against Goldman Sachs and its former bankers Tim Leissner and Roger Ng. Mr Leissner served as Goldman's South East Asia chairman, and left the bank in 2016. Mr Ng was a managing director at Goldman until his departure in May 2014. Malaysia also filed charges against local financier Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low who maintains his innocence, and former 1MDB employee Jasmine Loo Ai Swan. Last month, Mr Leissner, Mr Ng and Mr Low were served with criminal charges in the US in relation to 1MDB. Mr Leissner pleaded guilty in the US to conspiring to launder money and violating anti-bribery laws. Jho Low (right) is seen with Wolf of Wall Street star Leonardo DiCaprio in 2013 US prosecutors said Mr Leissner and Mr Ng worked with Mr Low to bribe government officials to win 1MDB business for Goldman Sachs. Authorities in the US said billions of dollars were embezzled from the state fund - which was set up by the Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009 - and were used to buy a list of expensive properties, and even finance the Wolf of Wall Street movie. They allege that among the things bought by the money were: L'Ermitage hotel property and business Park Lane Hotel assets in New York Four California properties Four New York properties One London property A private jet EMI assets, including royalties Van Gogh painting Two Monet paintings Malaysia's attorney general Tommy Thomas said in a statement: ""The charges arise from from the proceeds of three bonds issued by the subsidiaries of 1MDB, which were arranged and underwritten by Goldman Sachs."" The scandal has prompted investigations around the world and played a role in the election defeat earlier this year of Mr Razak who is accused of pocketing $700m (Â£517m) from the fund. By Natalie Sherman Malaysia has made its indictment against Goldman Sachs public - the first time a government has brought criminal charges against the bank over the 1MDB scandal. Now investors are waiting to see what the US Department of Justice will do. The case US prosecutors outlined last month,externalagainst bankers Tim Leissner, Roger Ng and Malaysian financier Jho Low left Goldman's role up for debate. Tim Leissner, the former chairman of Goldman Sach's South East Asia operation, is married to model and fashion designer Kimora Lee Simmons Goldman Sachs underwrote around $6bn in bonds issued by 1MDB in three separate offerings between 2012 and 2013. The Department of Justice accused the men of working around Goldman's compliance office to do the deals. But it also noted that ""other employees"" had helped execute transactions in connection with 1MDB  and in his guilty plea, Mr Leissner said his actions were ""very much in line"" with the bank's culture. So will US officials decide the bank had weak oversight? Already, the investigation has clouded the reputation of departing chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, while adding to troubles at the bank, which has performed relatively poorly compared to its rivals this year. That said, a decade of post-financial crisis scandals has left Wall Street's banks bigger and more profitable than ever. If the US Department of Justice chooses, for example, to level a fine against Goldman Sachs, it is questionable just how much impact that would really have on the financial giant.

"Police said Jasmin Mistry's fraud was ""bizarre"" and ""shocking"" A woman who pretended to have brain cancer and claimed about Â£250,000 from family and friends has been jailed. Jasmin Mistry, 36, created messages from a fictitious doctor to convince people she was terminally ill. Her con was uncovered when it emerged a brain scan, which she said was her own, had been taken from Google. At Snaresbrook Crown Court on Friday, Mistry was jailed for four years. She had admitted one count of fraud by false representation. The Met Police said Mistry, of Mallard Road, Loughborough, first told her husband she had cancer in 2013 and supported this using a WhatsApp message sent, apparently, by her doctor. In further fake messages, the ""doctor"" said Mistry had only six months to live but could be treated in the US at a cost of about Â£500,000. Latest news from the East Midlands Her husband then contacted family and friends to ask for donations for her treatment, raising Â£253,122 in total. However, the messages from the medic had actually been sent by Mistry, using a different SIM card, according to the Met. Suspicions were raised when her husband's friend found her brain scan on Google. Police said a tumour showed on the scan was ""so severe that it would be fatal for the person with it"". Mistry was arrested in November 2017 and told officers she was not terminally ill and did not know why she had lied. Det Con Jon Bounds said: ""Mistry went to extreme lengths to manipulate those closest to her emotionally and financially to defraud her now former husband and his family out of a large sum of money."" He called it a ""bizarre"" and ""shocking"" case. Scotland Yard said 20 members of Mistry's extended family and eight others were found to have given her money.

"This video can not be played Solihull murders: CCTV footage shows moments before stabbings A man was jailed for life after admitting the ""brutal"" murders of his ex-partner and her mother. Khaola Saleem, 49, and Raneem Oudeh, 22, were fatally stabbed outside Mrs Saleem's home in Solihull on 27 August. Ms Oudeh married Janbaz Tarin, 21, in an Islamic ceremony, but broke up with him when she discovered he had a secret wife and children in Afghanistan. Tarin ""spent the day hunting"" down Ms Oudeh and her mother who were on the phone to police when he attacked. He went on the run after killing them and was arrested three days later. At Birmingham Crown Court Tarin, of Evelyn Road, Sparkhill, Birmingham, admitted murdering Ms Oudeh - a mother to a toddler - and her mother. He was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 32 years. In a victim impact statement, Mrs Saleem's sister Nour Norris said: ""The list of broken hearts goes on and on. That night this killer played god and he destroyed an entire family. ""Let us send a message that those who abuse and murder women will face justice."" Ms Oudeh's ex-partner Janbaz Tarin was charged with murder Mrs Justice Carr told Tarin his crimes had ""devastated"" the victims' family. She went on: ""When Mrs Saleem stepped in, no doubt in an attempt to protect her daughter, you stabbed her, whilst holding on to Raneem by one of her ankles and dragging her along."" The judge added: ""Your final act was to stab Raneem again, twice in the chest, before running away."" West Midlands Police said it was ""a brutal murder of two defenceless ladies by a man who had spent the day hunting them down"". The circumstances of the stabbing are being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. Ms Oudeh and her mother were attacked at Mrs Saleem's Northdown Road home shortly after 00:30 BST and died at the scene. Post-mortem tests found they died from multiple stab wounds. Tarin and Ms Oudeh met at Solihull College and were married in an Islamic ceremony in 2016 but their marriage was not recognised in UK law. Ms Oudeh, who had a two-year-old son from a previous marriage, and mother-of-six Mrs Saleem were both born in Syria. Ms Oudeh had left Tarin in the weeks before the murders after learning about his other wife and children in Afghanistan. The women died outside Khaola Saleem's house in Northdown Road He was abusive towards Ms Oudeh during their relationship and after they split up he repeatedly hassled her. She then applied for a non-molestation order against him. Tarin flouted that court order and - in the hours leading up to the killings - Ms Oudeh made three calls to police. That night Tarin followed Mrs Saleem and her daughter to a shisha lounge before hunting them down elsewhere, police said. Det Ch Supt Mark Payne said police were in contact with Ms Oudeh from the shisha lounge and had been trying to reach her, but failed to catch up with her before Tarin did. Janbaz Tarin was arrested by police after three days on the run Ms Norris, who now cares for Ms Oudeh's son, said in the first six months of the year-long marriage her niece was ""hiding her misery"". She added: ""He used to threaten her many times - 'if you leave me, I will kill you and your family'. ""One day she said to me, Auntie, I feel my life's going to end."" Fearing for her safety Ms Oudeh went to stay with her mother, with whose help she took out the court order. In the shisha lounge there was a confrontation involving Tarin, Ms Oudeh and her mother. Tarin was swiftly ejected by staff after being overheard making threats to kill Ms Oudeh. Ms Oudeh took out the court order against Tarin with the help of her mother He left the bar, armed himself with a knife and drove to Mrs Saleem's home where he stabbed Ms Oudeh outside the front door and then attacked Mrs Saleem as she tried to save her daughter. Tarin was captured on CCTV running away and went into hiding, triggering a huge manhunt by West Midlands Police. Asked if she believed the police and authorities had failed to do enough to stop Tarin, Mrs Norris replied: ""Yes we do."" ""We do feel that and we feel there's a lot of women out there as well probably going through the same thing, who agree with us."" The judge described Ms Oudeh as ""intelligent"" and ""independent"" and had been ""working through college whilst also caring for her baby son"", who, the judge said, ""she adored"". She added Mrs Saleem was a ""wonderful woman"" who was ""well known in the community, working with the homeless, poor and needy"".

"Malaysia has filed criminal charges against Goldman Sachs and two former employees in connection with a corruption and money laundering probe at the country's investment fund, 1MDB. The US bank has been under scrutiny for its role in helping to raise funds for the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB). It is being investigated in at least six countries. Goldman Sachs called the charges ""misdirected"" and said it would ""vigorously defend them"". ""The firm continues to co-operate with all authorities investigating these matters,"" the bank added. Malaysia filed the charges against Goldman Sachs and its former bankers Tim Leissner and Roger Ng. Mr Leissner served as Goldman's South East Asia chairman, and left the bank in 2016. Mr Ng was a managing director at Goldman until his departure in May 2014. Malaysia also filed charges against local financier Low Taek Jho, also known as Jho Low who maintains his innocence, and former 1MDB employee Jasmine Loo Ai Swan. Last month, Mr Leissner, Mr Ng and Mr Low were served with criminal charges in the US in relation to 1MDB. Mr Leissner pleaded guilty in the US to conspiring to launder money and violating anti-bribery laws. Jho Low (right) is seen with Wolf of Wall Street star Leonardo DiCaprio in 2013 US prosecutors said Mr Leissner and Mr Ng worked with Mr Low to bribe government officials to win 1MDB business for Goldman Sachs. Authorities in the US said billions of dollars were embezzled from the state fund - which was set up by the Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2009 - and were used to buy a list of expensive properties, and even finance the Wolf of Wall Street movie. They allege that among the things bought by the money were: L'Ermitage hotel property and business Park Lane Hotel assets in New York Four California properties Four New York properties One London property A private jet EMI assets, including royalties Van Gogh painting Two Monet paintings Malaysia's attorney general Tommy Thomas said in a statement: ""The charges arise from from the proceeds of three bonds issued by the subsidiaries of 1MDB, which were arranged and underwritten by Goldman Sachs."" The scandal has prompted investigations around the world and played a role in the election defeat earlier this year of Mr Razak who is accused of pocketing $700m (Â£517m) from the fund. By Natalie Sherman Malaysia has made its indictment against Goldman Sachs public - the first time a government has brought criminal charges against the bank over the 1MDB scandal. Now investors are waiting to see what the US Department of Justice will do. The case US prosecutors outlined last month,externalagainst bankers Tim Leissner, Roger Ng and Malaysian financier Jho Low left Goldman's role up for debate. Tim Leissner, the former chairman of Goldman Sach's South East Asia operation, is married to model and fashion designer Kimora Lee Simmons Goldman Sachs underwrote around $6bn in bonds issued by 1MDB in three separate offerings between 2012 and 2013. The Department of Justice accused the men of working around Goldman's compliance office to do the deals. But it also noted that ""other employees"" had helped execute transactions in connection with 1MDB  and in his guilty plea, Mr Leissner said his actions were ""very much in line"" with the bank's culture. So will US officials decide the bank had weak oversight? Already, the investigation has clouded the reputation of departing chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, while adding to troubles at the bank, which has performed relatively poorly compared to its rivals this year. That said, a decade of post-financial crisis scandals has left Wall Street's banks bigger and more profitable than ever. If the US Department of Justice chooses, for example, to level a fine against Goldman Sachs, it is questionable just how much impact that would really have on the financial giant.

"This video can not be played Members of the public filmed the fire as it took hold Chester Zoo says Â£120,000 pledged by well-wishers following a fire will be spent on ""conservation projects"". The blaze broke out in the Monsoon Forest area on Saturday, destroying much of its roof. Orangutans, macaques, gibbons and larger birds were saved, but some frogs, fish, snakes and small birds died. Firefighters said the blaze was ""accidental"" but more time was needed to determine the exact cause. An online appeal by the zoo, which reopened on Sunday, raised more than Â£100,000 in 24 hours - double its target - and is nearing Â£120,000. The blaze broke out in the Monsoon Forest area on Saturday, destroying much of its roof Jamie Christon, the zoo's chief operating officer, told the BBC the cost of repairing the fire-hit building would be covered by insurance. He said: ""The money and the fact we opened the JustGiving page was based on the overwhelming number of requests from people saying, how can we donate to the zoo...how can we help your cause and your missions? ""That money will spent on conservation projects, either here or around the world."" The Monsoon Forest habitat is the UK's largest zoological building, according to the attraction Mr Christon said the zoo was working with Cheshire Police and the fire service to complete an investigation into what happened. He said one of the main areas of focus would be moving and rehoming animals within the zoo. ""It's quite a complex task. For example, we have got 51 primate moves - that's 51 moves of large mammal species across the zoo over the next few days to make sure their welfare is maintained,"" he said. Some animals will stay in Monsoon Forest as the fire only affected the right-hand side of the building. The tourist attraction, which has more than 21,000 animals, said all the creatures led to safety were being relocated within the 125-acre site and described the loss of others as ""heartbreaking"". In an earlier statement,external, Mr Christon said the zoo was ""devastated"" some insects, frogs, fish and small birds could not be saved. ""These include a number of question mark cockroaches, Amano shrimps, betta hendra fish, cinnamon frogs, tentacled snakes and birds such as grosbeak starlings,"" he said. He added that the animals were ""part of conservation breeding programmes"" and said the zoo ""will look to be part of those vital projects once again in the near future"". The zoo has more than 21,000 animals Orangutans at the zoo were among those saved More than 15 fire crews and ambulance staff attended after the blaze broke out just before 11:30 GMT on Saturday. One person was treated for smoke inhalation. The zoo said an investigation would take place in the coming weeks and part of the Monsoon Forest area and Islands zone remain shut. The Monsoon Forest habitat is the UK's largest zoological building, according to the attraction. It opened in August 2015.

"HS2 is the biggest infrastructure project in Europe An early cost estimate MPs had when they were approving the HS2 high-speed rail project was ""enormously wrong"", a former HS2 boss has told BBC Panorama. Doug Thornton said the costing underestimated the value of many properties HS2 needed to purchase along the proposed route and thousands more had not been budgeted for. Mr Thornton said the figure MPs saw was hundreds of millions of pounds too low. He was later dismissed. HS2 rejects claims MPs were misled. It says it followed the correct process to keep Parliament updated on budgetary changes. What do we know about HS2? Is the HS2 rail project in trouble? Another former senior HS2 insider agreed that the company had had estimates that were higher than the early costing that MPs had at the time. HS2 is the biggest infrastructure project in Europe. The government says it will cost Â£56bn, with the first phase from London to Birmingham coming in at Â£27bn. The spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, investigated the land and property programme earlier this year. It found estimated property costs did increase significantly but concluded HS2 was not required to provide its updated estimates to MPs. Doug Thornton, a former HS2 boss, believes the early cost estimate MPs had was misleading However, Mr Thornton said he refused to use figures he believed were misleading. ""I have never seen anything like it"", he told the BBC. ""I was absolutely appalled... that numbers could be advanced in such a loose and slapdash fashion."" ""There was a gap of almost 100% in terms of the wrong numbers of properties that the organisation had not budgeted for. ""We started to talk about it to our finance team, we talked about it to HR, we talked about it to line managers, so it was there, we were calling it out,"" he said. Mr Thornton was subsequently sacked by HS2. The joint chairman of HS2 and Crossrail resigned earlier this month The Sunday Times previously reported,externalthat it had seen documents in which Mr Thornton said HS2's official budget for buying land and buildings was based on ""rudimentary map-based analysis by interns"". These new claims come amid recent turmoil at the company responsible for the project. When the joint chairman of HS2 and the troubled Crossrail project, Sir Terry Morgan, resigned earlier this month he warned of possible cost issues ahead for HS2,talking of the ""challenge inside the project"" to stay on time and on budget. The railway company is involved in the biggest land and property acquisition programme since World War Two, buying a total of 70 sq km of land. Ron Ryall says HS2 offered him far less than his property is worth Panorama has spoken to a number of people whose properties are in the path of the high-speed railway, who have complained of low valuations and delays in compensation after finding out their homes and premises were needed by HS2. Ron Ryall's Elizabethan home is in the path of the viaduct that will carry the railway in Buckinghamshire. He said HS2 had offered him far less than the property is worth. Meanwhile, Paul Tropman who owns Wood Waste, a wood recycling business on the outskirts of Birmingham, said he had been left hundreds of thousands pounds out of pocket after his business was forced to relocate. ""I think they've overspent and the only way they can get their money back is by robbing the likes of us,"" he told the BBC. Paul Tropman's business was forced to relocate because of HS2 HS2 is still working to settle their cases. Chief executive Mark Thurston said the company always paid a fair price and has only had to use its compulsory purchase powers in a small number of cases. Mr Thurston did recently acknowledge a cost gap within the project as a whole and that he is in talks with contractors to reduce costs. But he told Panorama: ""I'm not worried about overspending, I'm confident we've got a budget we can stand by.""

"Workers on zero-hour contracts, agency employees or ""gig economy"" workers are to be better protected by a package of workplace reforms, the government says. Under new legislation to be introduced on Monday, staff would have to be told details of their rights from their first day in a job, including eligibility for paid and sick leave. Workers would also be given the right to request more predictable hours. But Labour and the unions say the planned reforms do not go far enough. The reforms are based on the findings of a review into modern working practices led by Matthew Taylor, a former aide to ex-PM Tony Blair and chief executive of the Royal Society of Arts. Ministers say the new legislation will: close a loophole that had allowed agency staff to be paid less than permanent employees ensure firms will have to provide a ""statement of rights"" on the first day of a person's employment, setting out what paid leave they are entitled to, including for illness, maternity and paternity leave increase the maximum fine employers face at a tribunal from Â£5,000 to Â£20,000, if they are found to have demonstrated ""malice, spite or gross oversight"" ensure that companies will have to calculate holiday pay based on 52 weeks, as opposed to 12 weeks, so people in ""seasonal or atypical roles get the paid time off they are entitled to"" Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""Today's largest upgrade in workers' rights in over a generation is a key part of building a labour market that continues to reward people for hard work, that celebrates good employers and is boosting productivity and earning potential across the UK."" Does flexible working come at a cost? The Taylor review: At-a-glance guide What is the 'gig' economy? However, Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: ""The right to request guaranteed working hours is no right all. ""Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist. "" ""Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour,"" she added. Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director at the CBI, said: ""[Businesses] welcome a new law giving all workers the right to request more predictable working hours, which will help to facilitate the conversations that are essential to ensuring flexibility benefits both parties. But he said: ""Legislation to amend employment status rules risks making the law less able to adapt to new forms of work in the future."" The government agrees with the Taylor review that completely banning zero-hour contracts ""would negatively impact more people than it helped"". It also said that platform-based working - including the likes of ride-sharing app Uber or food delivery business Deliveroo - offers ""genuine two-way flexibility"" for firms and workers. Zero-hour contracts, where an employer does not have to offer work and an employee has no obligation to work when asked, are highly controversial. The Archbishop of Canterbury called the contracts ""the reincarnation of an ancient evil"". Is it the end of the 9 to 5 working day?

"This video can not be played Group founder: Hull hotel 'discriminating' against homeless people A hotel is accused of discriminating against homeless people after cancelling their Christmas booking. Carl Simpson, of Raise the Roof Homeless Project, says he was ""gutted"" when the Royal Hotel in Hull cancelled the Â£1,092 booking without explanation. The hotel later said the reason was that it had been told about damage to rooms during the group's Christmas booking at an Ibis hotel last year. Raise the Roof says the allegations are ""lies"". Ibis has also denied the claim. Raise the Roof told the BBC it booked 14 twin rooms for 28 people in twin rooms - hoping to build on the success of last year's event at the Ibis. Delivery man fired for eating food gets sympathy Angry mum spits in face of Christmas elf WATCH: Christmas lights tunnel is 'magical' It said The Royal Hotel originally accepted the booking, and that it had not attempted to conceal the guests' backgrounds. ""We told them up front they were for homeless people,"" Mr Simpson said. ""They were fine with that."" A spokesperson for the hotel said the company had been warned by a ""former project worker"" not to take the booking. Mr Simpson organised rooms for 28 homeless people on Christmas eve and Christmas day in 2017 ""We received a call from a lady... who worked for the charity last year,"" the spokesperson said. ""She had rung to warn us that the group had caused serious problems at the Ibis and that she felt we should not take the booking. ""Among the issues last year were trashing of rooms, fires, theft of hotel goods and property and damage to property. ""The hotel has a number of families and tours staying at the hotel over the Christmas period which we feel would suffer if the booking was taken."" The spokesperson added that the hotel would reinstate the booking, with conditions. The Ibis chain told the BBC it did not recognise the allegations. In a statement, it said: ""We can confirm that we welcomed a group of homeless people for two nights last Christmas booked by Raise the Roof Homeless Project, and that the organisers felt the stay was very successful. ""We don't recognise any allegations that these guests caused serious problems such as fire or theft in the hotel."" One of the homeless people who attended the Ibis hotel last year told the BBC: ""It was the best Christmas present you could get, really. It's such a relief to be off the streets even for that one night."" In a Facebook post on Saturday evening, Mr Simpson said he had been hoping to repeat ""the success of last Christmas"" when he was able to book 28 people into an Ibis hotel for two nights. ""After the stay they were so grateful. Some left staff gifts using the very little money they had, and one asked if he could vacuum the rooms to show his appreciation. ""This means the world to homeless people. Last year we had tears of joy from someone who stood on the edge of the Humber Bridge the night before. ""We have to break the news to people that the hotel has been cancelled."" Mr Simpson said he was yet to receive a refund for the booking, and so was unable to rebook another hotel, adding: ""We need a miracle."" Homeless people in Hull were looking forward to having a roof over their heads for Christmas He said he relied ondonations,externalto make the original booking and he was worried whether the number of rooms needed could be found elsewhere at an affordable price. Since his Mr Simpson's originalFacebook,externalpost, the news of the cancelled booking where it has been shared by more than 1,000 people and online fundraising for the group has received a Â£6,000 boost. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme earlier, he said: ""I wasn't really aware we'd reached that. That's amazing. We just need the rooms now. ""There are lots of reasons people become homeless, not just the ones they seem to be labelled with,"" Mr Simpson said. ""We see people from family break-ups and ex-servicemen."" The Facebook post has inspired others to try to help the homeless this Christmas. Beckie Stewart writes: ""Aren't there people willing to bring in one or two on Christmas eve?

"Yemen has been devastated by a four-year conflict Saudi Arabia has reacted angrily after the US Senate voted to withdraw military aid for the war in Yemen, where the Saudis are leading a coalition fighting rebels. The Senate also blamed the Saudi crown prince for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident. Saudi Arabia described the vote as ""interference"" based on ""untrue allegations"". Thursday's Senate resolution was mostly symbolic and is unlikely to become law. However, it is seen as a rebuke to Donald Trump's Saudi policies. It was the first time a chamber of the US Congress had agreed to pull US forces from a military conflict under the 1973 War Powers Act. Senators rebuke Trump with Yemen vote Jamal Khashoggi: The story so far Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen, and has received logistical and intelligence support from the US. The kingdom has also come under pressure since Khashoggi, a US resident and columnist for the Washington Post, was killed while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in Turkey on 2 October. In a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, the foreign ministry said: ""The kingdom condemns the latest position of the US Senate."" It said that such a position ""was built on untrue allegations"", and that Saudi Arabia rejected ""any interference in its internal affairs"". Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, and the Saudi government has insisted that he knew nothing about Khashoggi's killing. ""The Kingdom has previously asserted that the murder of Saudi citizen Jamal Khashoggi is a deplorable crime that does not reflect the Kingdom's policy nor its institutions and reaffirms its rejection of any attempts to take the case out of the path of justice in the Kingdom,"" the foreign ministry said. The US has so far not publicly responded to the Saudi statement. A non-binding resolution called upon Mr Trump to remove all US forces engaging in hostilities in Yemen, except for those combating Islamist extremists. Some of President Trump's fellow Republicans defied him to pass the measure with Democrats by 56-41. The US suspended refuelling Saudi war planes last month, and Thursday's resolution - if it were ultimately passed into law - would prohibit that practice from resuming. President Trump has consistently defended US business and military ties with Saudi Arabia The Senate then unanimously passed a resolution blaming the Saudi crown prince for Khashoggi's murder, and insisting that the kingdom hold accountable those responsible. Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor has said Khashoggi was killed on the orders of a rogue intelligence officer. Turkish officials however say they have evidence, including gruesome audio recordings, that the journalist was killed by a team of Saudi agents on orders that came from the highest levels. His body has not yet been found. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. US media have said the CIA believes the Saudi crown prince ordered his killing. However, President Trump has dismissed the report, saying the CIA had not drawn firm conclusions. President Trump has vowed to veto the measures, and they are unlikely at present to pass the House of Representatives, which on Wednesday blocked a vote on the matter. But independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who co-sponsored the measures, said he expected the resolutions to succeed once Democrats formally take over control of the House in January following their mid-term elections victory. This video can not be played Senators slam Saudi crown prince as ""crazy"" and a ""wrecking ball"" The Trump administration had argued the bill on Yemen would undercut US support for the Saudi-led coalition against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. White House officials have emphasised US economic ties to the kingdom. Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has continued to cultivate ties with the prince, according to the US media.

"Gourmet Burger Kitchen said it would shut 17 sites The number of restaurant businesses becoming insolvent jumped by a quarter in 2018 as consumers shunned the High Street, new figures show. Accountancy firm Moore Stephens said there had been 1,219 insolvencies, ranging from standalone restaurants up to large investor-backed chains - up from 985 in 2017. It blamed overcapacity at a time when Britons are eating out less. Restaurant critic Jay Rayner said more operators could struggle next year. In 2018, a spate of big restaurant chains were forced to strike rescue deals - known as company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) - with their creditors as they faced unsustainable debts. Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Jamie Oliver in talks to sell restaurants Gourmet Burger Kitchenearmarked 17 sites for closurewhileCarluccios is shutting 34outlets. Prezzo said itwould close 94- about a third of the chain - including all 33 outlets of its Tex-Mex brand Chimichanga. Moore Stephens said that insolvencies were at their highest level since it began tracking the sector in 2010. It blamed an influx of private equity investment that had led to some restaurant chains opening too many sites that were now failing to break even. It also said interest rate rises and Brexit concerns had ""put a dent"" consumer spending growth, as operators faced rising overheads such as the minimum wage and ingredient costs. Head of restructuring and insolvency Jeremy Willmont said: ""Restaurants have always been prone to high failure rates but vacant restaurants used to be rapidly replaced by a new contender. For now, that process seemed to have stalled and many sites are empty. ""Under such tough trading conditions, restaurants should be cautious about building up debt. They can very quickly become overextended as costs continue to rise."" Restaurant critic Jay Rayner told the BBC that many restaurants - and particularly mid-market chains - operated on ""extremely tight profit margins"". ""They might be worth a lot but their margins are so tight that they are subject to real pain if there are sudden changes in the market place."" He said that while an independent, standalone restaurant might be able cut its costs and struggle on, investor-backed businesses had to cut their losses fast. ""I don't believe in crystal-ball gazing, but I think the last few months of the year will be good for restaurants, but in January many are going to find themselves staring down the barrel of Brexit. ""I think we could see a lot more businesses go to the wall and a lot of jobs lost."" Trouble for high street restaurants.

"Originally based in Wales, Laura Ashley grew from a small factory in Carno Fashion and home furnishings retailer Laura Ashley will close about 40 stores in the UK as it plans to expand its presence in China. Laura Ashley, which is owned by Malayan United Industries (MUI), has already closed some 40 UK stores since 2015. High Street stores in the UK have had a difficult year as consumer confidence wanes and fewer shoppers visit. A recent report has shown that some 14 shops are closing every day in the UK amid the tough trading climate. Andrew Khoo Boo Yeow, MUI's newly appointed executive chairman, told reporters in Malaysia earlier this month that he expected the business to see some tough headwinds across the next two years. He also said MUI would be restructuring some arms of its business and rationalising assets. Mr Khoo told the Press Association that the number of UK stores would be reduced from 160 to 120, but that the remaining stores would be expanded. New Look may lose more than 120 UK stores UK's 'unhealthiest' High Streets revealed ""It's more about showcasing the brand,"" he said. ""It doesn't really matter if [customers] buy online or offline, we just want them to get inspired. ""It's a challenging environment and it could become more challenging,"" he said. The firm said it would would look at moving staff from any stores that are closing to larger outlets. Mr Khoo told PA the company was ""moving to Asia in a much bigger way"". ""We have a regional office in Singapore [that is] focused purely on ecommerce into China. ""Once we get a significant foothold in digital retail in China, we can look at the physical stores rollout."" Critics have said the Laura Ashley brand has failed to stay relevant Originally based in Wales, Laura Ashley grew from a small factory in Carno to become one of the world's leading clothing brands in the 1970s and 1980s. But analysts have said the brand has failed to stay relevant. The retailer had hoped the launch of a new digital platform in the second half of 2018 would help boost its offerings, but critics have said the firm's e-commerce offerings are not up to standard yet. At the beginning of this year Laura Ashley issued a profit warning after reporting disappointing 2017 Christmas trading figures. The news sent shares reeling.At one point they fell 26%, pulled back to a 4% loss and were down 8% by the close. More recently, the retailer has invested in hotels. The first Laura Ashley branded hotel was opened in 2013. The firm currently has two: Laura Ashley The Manor in Elstree and Laura Ashley The Belsfield in the Lake District.

"A senior politician from India's Congress party has been jailed for life in the most significant conviction to date over the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Sajjan Kumar, who was an MP at the time, was found guilty of inciting crowds to kill Sikhs. In a scathing verdict, the Delhi high court judges said the accused evaded justice due to ""political patronage"". More than 3,000 Sikhs were killed following the assassination of then PM Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. They were angry at her decision to send the army into the Golden Temple - Sikhism's holiest shrine - to flush out militants earlier in the year. The killing of Mrs Gandhi, who belonged to the Congress - now India's main opposition party- saw mobs attack and murder members of the Sikh community across the country. The worst violence took place in the capital, Delhi, where more than 2,700 Sikhs are believed to have died. For 34 years, high-profile politicians accused of involvement in the anti-Sikh riots had evaded justice - on Monday this changed with Sajjan Kumar's conviction. However his lawyer told journalists that he would appeal against the verdict in the Supreme Court. There are a number of cases against Kumar relating to the riots - Monday's verdict is specifically over the killing of a family of five in Delhi. Congress still struggling to escape the past Congress leader 'incited' 1984 anti-Sikh riots Delhi 1984: Memories of a massacre,external Kumar, 73, had been previously acquitted by a lower court for his role in the riots, but the verdict was challenged by the country's top investigative agencywhich said he had been involved in a conspiracy of ""terrifying proportions"" with the police. Jagdish Kaur, whose son and husband were among five family members brutally killed, described the verdict as ""a little balm applied after a long time to our scars"". ""At least one high-profile accused will now go to jail,"" she said. Nirpreet Kaur, another victim whose father was burnt alive by mobs before her eyes, wept as she thanked the court for delivering justice after 34 years. Her case remains in the court system. Ms Kaur told BBC Punjabi's Sarbjit Dhaliwal she was happy that Kumar had received a life sentence because a ""death penalty would have meant he would have died in a moment, but now he will suffer"". Kumar was convicted after several eyewitnesses testified against him for inciting mobs in Delhi's Sultanpuri area. This video can not be played How the anti-Sikh riots fanned out across Delhi One witness said she had seen him addressing a crowd, telling them that Sikhs had killed ""his mother"" - a reference to Mrs Gandhi. Delhi high court Judges S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel found Kumar guilty of ""criminal conspiracy, promoting enmity and acts against communal harmony"" and ordered him not to leave the city and surrender by 31 December. ""In the summer of 1947, hundreds of thousands of civilians were massacred during the Partition of India... Thirty seven years later, India was witness to another enormous human tragedy... A majority of the perpetrators of these horrific mass crimes, enjoyed political patronage and escaped trial,"" the judges said. ""This court is of the view that the mass killings of Sikhs in Delhi and elsewhere in November 1984 were, in fact, 'crimes against humanity'. They will continue to shock the collective conscience of society for a long time to come,"" they added. Finance minister Arun Jaitley welcomed the verdict. However, opposition leader and Congress party president Rahul Gandhi is yet to make a statement. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Apart from Kumar, several other high-profile Congress politicians are accused of involvement in the violence. Among them is Kamal Nath, who was sworn in as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh state on Monday. Jagdish Tytler, who was the minister of state for overseas Indian affairs at the time, is also one of the main accused in a number of cases. Both deny any involvement. Sikhs are a religious minority in India,externaland at 21 million, they make up close to 2% of the population. There are significant Sikh communities in Canada, the UK, US and Australia. Atul Sangar, Editor, BBC Punjabi The conviction and life imprisonment awarded to Kumar, along with jail terms awarded to five others, comes as some solace to the Sikh community, but will not act as a closure on that dark chapter. Thousands of  Sikhs, whose family members were killed by rampaging mobs in November 1984, have welcomed this judgement. However, their deep sense of anguish and hurt over the massacre and then this long fight for justice is unlikely to go away easily. There are other cases pending in the courts, including one against former Congress minister Jagdish Tytler, who denies any hand in anti-Sikh violence. Though more than 400 accused have been sentenced by courts in these cases, victims have repeatedly complained that adequate steps were never taken to bring high-profile Congress leaders to justice.

"Online fashion retailer Asos has warned of weak profits this financial year after ""unprecedented"" discounting hit its trading in November. After reports of dismal High Street activity last month, the Asos warning indicates the pain is spreading online. The firm said cutting prices to match rivals had not shifted more clothes. In fact, economic uncertainty plus weaker consumer confidence had led to ""the weakest growth in online clothing sales in recent years"". Asos shares fell nearly 40% in morning trading. Chief executive Nick Beighton said the fashion industry was currently experiencing an ""unprecedented level of discounting, something I've not seen before"". In a conference call with industry analysts, he said consumer confidence was ""fragile"". Why are people spending less this Christmas? Why are there so many pre-Christmas sales? Despite sales growth of 14% from September to November, Asos saw ""a significant deterioration"" in November. It had previously forecast sales growth of 20-25% in the year to August 2019. However, it now expects just 15% growth. Its anticipated profit margin was also revised down, from 4% to 2%. Worried voices of retail are becoming a deafening chorus and the lyrics are simple. November was bad - really bad - and not just on the High Street. Online retail darling Asos saw its shares plunge 35% this morning after warning that its profits would undershoot expectations. Comments from chief executive Nick Beighton describing an ""unprecedented level of discounting"" saw other retailers' share prices slump, including those of Boohoo, Next and JD Sports. Last week, Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley said November had been the ""worst November in living memory"" and predicted some retailers would be ""smashed to pieces"". The woes of predominantly bricks-and-mortar retailers (like clothing retailer BonmarchÃ©, which saw its shares halve as it lurched to a Â£4m loss last week) have been well chronicled, but the significance of the Asos update is that it shows the fight for every last pound and every last percentage point of profit margin has spread online. There may yet be a late rush, but evidence so far suggests retailers' annus horribilis is not ending well. ""Whilst trading in September and October was broadly in line with our expectations, November, a very material month for us from both a sales and cash margin perspective, was significantly behind expectations,"" Asos said. ""There has been a high level of discounting and promotional activity across the market. We have increased our own level of promotional activity, leading to a higher discount and continued high clearance mix. ""This increased discounting, coupled with the unseasonably warm weather during the last three months has reduced our ASP [average selling price], which has not been compensated by higher units per basket."" Outside the UK, Asos said trading conditions in Germany and France, which account for about 60% of its EU sales, had become ""significantly more challenging"". Over the three months to 30 November, total group revenue was Â£656m, up from Â£576.7m in the same period last year. Rival firm Boohoo saw its shares tumble 10% in the wake of the Asos announcement. However, it said it was ""pleased to confirm"" that its trading performance remained strong, ""with record Black Friday sales across the group"", and that it continued to trade ""comfortably in line with market expectations"". Asos's bleak assessment comes after Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley described trading in November as ""the worst on record, unbelievably bad"". ""Retailers just cannot take that kind of November,"" Mr Ashley told analysts last week. ""It will literally smash them to pieces."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""After making impressive strides in recent years, a challenging consumer backdrop has finally tripped Asos up. ""Recent data revealed a huge decline in UK retail footfall, which it would have been easy to assume was due to online players taking share at a faster rate. These numbers show it's more complicated, and more worrying, than that. ""It looks like consumer confidence has been knocked to the extent people aren't spending much anywhere, be it in physical stores or online."" Mr Salmon said ""uncertainty around Brexit"" would also be playing a major role.

"Online fashion retailer Asos has warned of weak profits this financial year after ""unprecedented"" discounting hit its trading in November. After reports of dismal High Street activity last month, the Asos warning indicates the pain is spreading online. The firm said cutting prices to match rivals had not shifted more clothes. In fact, economic uncertainty plus weaker consumer confidence had led to ""the weakest growth in online clothing sales in recent years"". Asos shares fell nearly 40% in morning trading. Chief executive Nick Beighton said the fashion industry was currently experiencing an ""unprecedented level of discounting, something I've not seen before"". In a conference call with industry analysts, he said consumer confidence was ""fragile"". Why are people spending less this Christmas? Why are there so many pre-Christmas sales? Despite sales growth of 14% from September to November, Asos saw ""a significant deterioration"" in November. It had previously forecast sales growth of 20-25% in the year to August 2019. However, it now expects just 15% growth. Its anticipated profit margin was also revised down, from 4% to 2%. Worried voices of retail are becoming a deafening chorus and the lyrics are simple. November was bad - really bad - and not just on the High Street. Online retail darling Asos saw its shares plunge 35% this morning after warning that its profits would undershoot expectations. Comments from chief executive Nick Beighton describing an ""unprecedented level of discounting"" saw other retailers' share prices slump, including those of Boohoo, Next and JD Sports. Last week, Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley said November had been the ""worst November in living memory"" and predicted some retailers would be ""smashed to pieces"". The woes of predominantly bricks-and-mortar retailers (like clothing retailer BonmarchÃ©, which saw its shares halve as it lurched to a Â£4m loss last week) have been well chronicled, but the significance of the Asos update is that it shows the fight for every last pound and every last percentage point of profit margin has spread online. There may yet be a late rush, but evidence so far suggests retailers' annus horribilis is not ending well. ""Whilst trading in September and October was broadly in line with our expectations, November, a very material month for us from both a sales and cash margin perspective, was significantly behind expectations,"" Asos said. ""There has been a high level of discounting and promotional activity across the market. We have increased our own level of promotional activity, leading to a higher discount and continued high clearance mix. ""This increased discounting, coupled with the unseasonably warm weather during the last three months has reduced our ASP [average selling price], which has not been compensated by higher units per basket."" Outside the UK, Asos said trading conditions in Germany and France, which account for about 60% of its EU sales, had become ""significantly more challenging"". Over the three months to 30 November, total group revenue was Â£656m, up from Â£576.7m in the same period last year. Rival firm Boohoo saw its shares tumble 10% in the wake of the Asos announcement. However, it said it was ""pleased to confirm"" that its trading performance remained strong, ""with record Black Friday sales across the group"", and that it continued to trade ""comfortably in line with market expectations"". Asos's bleak assessment comes after Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley described trading in November as ""the worst on record, unbelievably bad"". ""Retailers just cannot take that kind of November,"" Mr Ashley told analysts last week. ""It will literally smash them to pieces."" George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""After making impressive strides in recent years, a challenging consumer backdrop has finally tripped Asos up. ""Recent data revealed a huge decline in UK retail footfall, which it would have been easy to assume was due to online players taking share at a faster rate. These numbers show it's more complicated, and more worrying, than that. ""It looks like consumer confidence has been knocked to the extent people aren't spending much anywhere, be it in physical stores or online."" Mr Salmon said ""uncertainty around Brexit"" would also be playing a major role. He added: ""It's probably no coincidence Asos's key demographic of 20-somethings generally harbour more concerns over the future of the economy post-Brexit than their parents.""

"Sunday's protest was the largest since the new laws were adopted last week About 10,000 people have rallied in Hungary's capital Budapest against new labour laws, which have been labelled ""slave"" legislation by opponents. The crowds marched towards parliament and the state TV headquarters, in what was the fourth and largest protest since the laws were passed last week. Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters near the TV station. New rules mean companies can demand up to 400 hours of overtime a year and delay payment for it for three years. The government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban says the labour reform will benefit workers as well as companies who need to fill a labour shortage. Viktor Orban's Hungary: The full story Hungary country profile Sunday's demonstration was led by trade unionists and students. Police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators outside the state TV headquarters The event was dubbed ""Happy Xmas Prime Minister"". Mr Orban is seen by his opponents as becoming increasingly authoritarian. Such demonstrations are rare in Hungary, where Mr Orban's policies enjoy widespread support, despite repeated condemnation from other EU nations. In elections earlier this year, the prime minister's Fidesz party won a two-thirds majority in parliament, which he often uses to force his agenda through. Last week's vote was particularly contentious. Opposition politicians caused chaos in parliament, preventing the Speaker from reaching the podium while blowing whistles to disrupt proceedings. In the end, the law was pushed through. That evening, hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the parliament building, and protests have continued since. The labour shortages the government seeks to address with the new law are rooted in long-term trends. Hungary's population has been in decline for years, as deaths outpace births, according to the European statistics agency. Its unemployment rate, at 4.2% in 2017, is one of the lowest in the EU. Hungary is also experiencing a ""brain drain"" as well-educated people take advantage of free movement within Europe. The problem is serious enough to have prompted a 2015 programme to encourage young people to return home, offering housing and employment support. The governing Fidesz party has said the protests are the work of foreign mercenaries paid by Hungarian-born US billionaire George Soros. Mr Soros denies this, and says the Hungarian authorities are using him as a scapegoat.

"A 46-year-old man has won a landmark case in Singapore A gay Singaporean man has won a landmark court case which will allow him to adopt a child he fathered through a surrogate. The man, 46, and his long-term partner carried out the process in the US at a cost of $200,000 (Â£159,000), as surrogacy is illegal in Singapore. He tried to legally adopt the child but the bid was rejected last year, leaving him with no legal parental rights. Same-sex marriages are not recognised in Singapore and gay sex is illegal. The four-year-old child is considered illegitimate in the eyes of the law as the surrogate mother and biological father are not married. The mother - who waived all her rights under the surrogacy deal - is also foreign, making the child ineligible to automatically qualify for Singaporean citizenship. The egg donor has never been identified. The father was left with no legal rights parental, though was allowed to make decisions on the child's behalf. The 46-year-old, who has been in a relationship with another Singaporean man for about 13 years, will have sole parental rights of the child when an adoption takes place. Under Singapore law, children can be adopted by singles or by married couples. However, as the man cannot legally marry his partner - he would have to file his adoption as an individual. The man's initial bid to adopt his child was rejected last December, though the judge at the time said the decision was not a judgement on what ""a family unit ought to be"". Instead, Judge Shobha Nair said it was about the ethics of commercial surrogacy. Why one man could not adopt his own child Reality Check: Commonwealth countries where it is illegal to be gay What is Singapore's Pink Dot rally? On Monday, Singapore's High Court ruled that the man - who cannot be identified - would be able to adopt his child. ""Our decision should not be taken as an endorsement of what the appellant and his partner set out to do,"" said Chief Justice Sunderesh Menon in his judgement. He said that there was ""significant weight"" put towards the concern that the ruling would ""not violate the public policy against the formation of same-sex family units"". However, he added that in this case, there was a ""statutory imperative to promote the welfare of the child... to regard his welfare as first and paramount"". Speaking to the BBC, lawyer Ivan Cheong said his client was ""overjoyed and happy that at the end of a long adoption process, the child's welfare is upheld"". ""At the end of the day, it is about what is in the child's best interest,"" Mr Cheong of Eversheds Harry Elias LLP said. ""Being recognised as a legitimate child and having his long term residential status met have always been our client's primary concerns."" The gay rights movement has gained significant momentum across some parts of Asia, though gay marriage still remains illegal - and a highly contentious issue - in socially conservative Singapore. Although sex between men is criminalised, the law is not enforced and there are gay bars and clubs in Singapore, as well as an annual pride rally.

"A senior politician from India's Congress party has been jailed for life in the most significant conviction to date over the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Sajjan Kumar, who was an MP at the time, was found guilty of inciting crowds to kill Sikhs. In a scathing verdict, the Delhi high court judges said the accused evaded justice due to ""political patronage"". More than 3,000 Sikhs were killed following the assassination of then PM Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. They were angry at her decision to send the army into the Golden Temple - Sikhism's holiest shrine - to flush out militants earlier in the year. The killing of Mrs Gandhi, who belonged to the Congress - now India's main opposition party- saw mobs attack and murder members of the Sikh community across the country. The worst violence took place in the capital, Delhi, where more than 2,700 Sikhs are believed to have died. For 34 years, high-profile politicians accused of involvement in the anti-Sikh riots had evaded justice - on Monday this changed with Sajjan Kumar's conviction. However his lawyer told journalists that he would appeal against the verdict in the Supreme Court. There are a number of cases against Kumar relating to the riots - Monday's verdict is specifically over the killing of a family of five in Delhi. Congress still struggling to escape the past Congress leader 'incited' 1984 anti-Sikh riots Delhi 1984: Memories of a massacre,external Kumar, 73, had been previously acquitted by a lower court for his role in the riots, but the verdict was challenged by the country's top investigative agencywhich said he had been involved in a conspiracy of ""terrifying proportions"" with the police. Jagdish Kaur, whose son and husband were among five family members brutally killed, described the verdict as ""a little balm applied after a long time to our scars"". ""At least one high-profile accused will now go to jail,"" she said. Nirpreet Kaur, another victim whose father was burnt alive by mobs before her eyes, wept as she thanked the court for delivering justice after 34 years. Her case remains in the court system. Ms Kaur told BBC Punjabi's Sarbjit Dhaliwal she was happy that Kumar had received a life sentence because a ""death penalty would have meant he would have died in a moment, but now he will suffer"". Kumar was convicted after several eyewitnesses testified against him for inciting mobs in Delhi's Sultanpuri area. This video can not be played How the anti-Sikh riots fanned out across Delhi One witness said she had seen him addressing a crowd, telling them that Sikhs had killed ""his mother"" - a reference to Mrs Gandhi. Delhi high court Judges S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel found Kumar guilty of ""criminal conspiracy, promoting enmity and acts against communal harmony"" and ordered him not to leave the city and surrender by 31 December. ""In the summer of 1947, hundreds of thousands of civilians were massacred during the Partition of India... Thirty seven years later, India was witness to another enormous human tragedy... A majority of the perpetrators of these horrific mass crimes, enjoyed political patronage and escaped trial,"" the judges said. ""This court is of the view that the mass killings of Sikhs in Delhi and elsewhere in November 1984 were, in fact, 'crimes against humanity'. They will continue to shock the collective conscience of society for a long time to come,"" they added. Finance minister Arun Jaitley welcomed the verdict. However, opposition leader and Congress party president Rahul Gandhi is yet to make a statement. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Apart from Kumar, several other high-profile Congress politicians are accused of involvement in the violence. Among them is Kamal Nath, who was sworn in as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh state on Monday. Jagdish Tytler, who was the minister of state for overseas Indian affairs at the time, is also one of the main accused in a number of cases. Both deny any involvement. Sikhs are a religious minority in India,externaland at 21 million, they make up close to 2% of the population. There are significant Sikh communities in Canada, the UK, US and Australia. Atul Sangar, Editor, BBC Punjabi The conviction and life imprisonment awarded to Kumar, along with jail terms awarded to five others, comes as some solace to the Sikh community, but will not act as a closure on that dark chapter. Thousands of  Sikhs, whose family members were killed by rampaging mobs in November 1984, have welcomed this judgement. However, their deep sense of anguish and hurt over the massacre and then this long fight for justice is unlikely to go away easily. There are other cases pending in the courts, including one against former Congress minister Jagdish Tytler, who denies any hand in anti-Sikh violence. Though more than 400 accused have been sentenced by courts in these cases, victims have repeatedly complained that adequate steps were never taken to bring high-profile Congress leaders to justice.

"Researchers linked an overactive immune system with ME-like symptoms An overactive immune system may help explain the cause of chronic fatigue syndrome, scientists from King's College London have suggested. Many sufferers of CFS, or ME, say their condition began with a challenge to their immune system like an infection. The scientists studied 55 patients with Hepatitis C who were given a drug that causes a similar response to a virus. Eighteen of those patients had an overactive immune system and went on to develop CFS-like symptoms. Chronic fatigue syndrome is a long-term illness characterised by extreme tiredness. Scientists from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College recruited 55 patients who had hepatitis C. A treatment for hepatitis C is the drug interferon-alpha which challenges the immune system in the same way as a powerful infection. The team measured fatigue and immune markers before, during and after treatment, tracking which people developed the persistent CFS-like illness. In the 18 patients who developed CFS-like symptoms the team found a much stronger immune response to the medication. Significantly these patients also had an overactive immune system before the treatment started. MP campaigns for new ME treatment Chronic fatigue trial results 'not robust' Chronic fatigue: 'Held hostage by ME' Lead researcher Dr Alice Russell from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN) said: ""For the first time, we have shown that people who are prone to develop a CFS-like illness have an overactive immune system, both before and during a challenge to the immune system. ""Our findings suggest that people who have an exaggerated immune response to a trigger may be more at risk of developing CFS."" Senior researcher, Prof Carmine Pariante, added: ""This is a light in the fog, a direction of travel. Although screening is a long way off, our results are the first step in identifying those at risk and catching the illness in its crucial early stages."" What is ME? Myalgic encephalomyelitis or ME is also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) The long-term illness affects about 250,000 people in the UK As well as fatigue, it can cause sleep problems and muscle and joint pain Living with CFS/ME can be difficult. Extreme tiredness and other physical symptoms can make it hard to carry out everyday activities There is currently no cure for ME Source: NHS Choices Dr Charles Shepherd, the ME Association's medical adviser, said: ""This research adds to the growing weight of scientific evidence which indicates that the body's immune system is playing an important role in the causation of ME/CFS."" The study is one of five research projects funded by the Medical Research Council into the causes of ME. In June, Scottish National Party MP Carol Monaghan led an emotional Westminster Hall debate into a common treatment, graded exercise therapy (Get), which is available on the NHS. She argued it was often damaging and in need of revision. Others have defended the treatment. The health watchdog, NICE, is currently updating its guidelines for treatment of CFS in England, but publication is not due until 2020.

"Directors of firms that cold-call consumers can now be fined up to Â£500,000 under new rules that have come into force. A ban on unsolicited phone callscame into effect in September,externalthis year. But some directors whose firms were shut down were able to evade fines by declaring bankruptcy - and then starting up a new company. The Information Commissioner's Office said the new rules would make it easier to punish those responsible. ""We welcome this amendment to the law which will increase the tools we have to protect the public,"" said Andy Curry, who heads up the nuisance calls team at the information watchdog. ""It will mean we can recover the fine more easily and also make it much harder for unscrupulous operators to set up in business again."" Cold-calling ban comes into operation Cold-calling ban to include texts and emails Last year, more than 3.9 billion nuisance calls and texts were made to UK households, according to the telecoms regulator, Ofcom. The nuisance phone calls are typically about payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling or accident claims. However, in the past six months the most frequent calls have come from firms claiming to be BT, HMRC or TalkTalk, according to consumer group Which?. The number of complaints about such calls fell in October, following the ban. Nevertheless in that month alone there were still more than 15,000 complaints about nuisance calls, broken down as follows: 7,547 complaints about automated calls 6,980 about live calls 1,245 about text messages Which? urged the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) to issue the maximum fine of Â£500,000 wherever possible, to act as a further deterrent. ""The introduction of fines for bosses of these companies is a significant step, and the regulator must now act swiftly to properly police and fine those who flout the law - demonstrating that there is no place in our society for these practices,"" said Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services.

"Hundreds gathered in Strasbourg to honour the victims on Sunday A fifth victim has died following the gun attack on the Christmas market in the French city of Strasbourg, the Paris prosecutor's office has said. His brother named him as Barto Pedro Orent-Niedzielski, a 36-year-old Polish-born man. The suspect in last Tuesday's attack, Cherif Chekatt, was shot dead by police on Thursday. Four members of his family were released on Saturday and two others close to him were freed on Sunday. Only one other person remains in detention. What we know so far On Sunday, hundreds of people gathered around a makeshift shrine in Strasbourg to honour the victims with readings and songs. Barto Pedro Orent-Niedzielskidied at about 18:00 local time on Sunday (17:00 GMT). He had spent five days in a coma and never recovered. His family had kept him on life support so that those close to him could come to say goodbye at the Hautepierre hospital in the city. Kamal Naghchbandwas a garage mechanic originally from Afghanistan. The father of three had been visiting the market with his family and was shot in the head. Anupong Suebsamarn, 45, was a Thai national on holiday with his wife. Antonio Megalizzi, a 29-year-old Italian journalist, was critically injured in the attack and his death was announced three days later. A retired bank worker aged 61, from Strasbourg, also died. About 10 people remain injured, several seriously. Who are the victims? As a result of two significant eyewitness reports, an extensive police operation involving a helicopter was launched in the Neudorf area - where the suspect was last seen - on Thursday evening. At about 21:00, the suspect was killed in an exchange of fire with police on rue du Lazaret, France's anti-terror prosecutor RÃ©my Heitz said. He was later identified through his fingerprints. The officers found an old gun, still loaded, some ammunition and a knife on his body. Seven people were initially arrested in connection with the attack. Cherif Chekatt's parents and two of his brothers were among those detained, but have since been freed. At about 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on 11 December, a man opened fire close to the famed Christmas market. Mr Heitz said the man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"") as he opened fire. The suspect was armed with a gun and a knife and escaped the area after jumping into a taxi. As he fled he came into contact with four soldiers, Mr Heitz said, and began firing at them. The soldiers fired back, apparently hitting him in the arm. The attacker told the taxi driver he had killed 10 people, and also said he had been injured during a firefight with soldiers. He ordered the taxi driver to drop him near the police station in Neudorf. When he got out of the vehicle, he fired at police officers before escaping. Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services. He was on the ""fiche S"" watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security. He had 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and had spent considerable time in prison as a result. Strasbourg shooting: Face to face with gunman The Islamic State group's self-styled news agency, Amaq, on Thursday said that Chekatt was ""an Islamic State soldier"" who had ""carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting citizens of coalition countries"" fighting its militants in Syria and Iraq.

"Brazilian ""spiritual healer"" Joao Teixeira de Faria, pictured with supporters, has turned himself in to police A Brazilian faith healer accused of sexually abusing more than 300 women has handed himself in to police, local media report. Joao Teixeira de Faria, known as ""John of God"", was declared a fugitive on Saturday after missing a deadline to surrender to the authorities. The cascade of claims against him began earlier in December, whena dozen women said the self-styled spiritual healer had abused themat his clinic. Mr Faria denies the allegations. The medium is based in the central town of Abadiania, west of the capital Brasilia, but has followers worldwide. Brazil's O Globo newspaper reports that the medium withdrew 35 million reais ($8.9m; Â£7m) from several bank accounts on Wednesday - convincing authorities that he could be planning to flee Brazil, or hide the money in case of future compensation claims. Authorities responded with an arrest warrant on Friday. On Sunday, mobile phone footage broadcast on Brazil's Globo TV showed Mr Faria, looking weary, getting out of a car and surrendering to police on a dirt road in Abadiania. He was transported to police headquarters in Goiania, the capital of Goias state. Brazil country profile The medium can be heard on video saying that when he heard the abuse allegations ""I surrendered to divine justice - and, as promised, I now place myself in the hands of earthly justice"". His lawyer, Alberto Toron, said he would file an appeal on Monday. He said he hoped Mr Faria might be held under house arrest, instead of in prison. Last week a Dutch photographer, Zahira Leeneke Maus, told Globo TV that Mr Faria had manipulated her into performing sex acts and then raped her. Nine Brazilian women, who remained anonymous, also told the channel that the medium abused them on the premise of transferring his ""cleansing"" energy. Brazilian TV channels broadcast the medium's arrival at a police station, a day after he was officially ruled a fugitive O Globo newspaper later said it had spoken to two more women with similar allegations. The 76-year-old's representatives said he ""vehemently rejects [allegations of] any improper practice during his treatments"". Mr Faria, who is not a medical doctor, has previously been fined and jailed for operating without a licence. US TV host Oprah Winfrey travelled to Brazil in 2013 to meet him, and witnessed him performing so-called ""psychic surgery"" at his clinic. According to ABC News,Mr Faria claims that the spirits of more than 30 doctors and other entities can enter his body,external, and that they perform the healings.

"Gourmet Burger Kitchen said it would shut 17 sites The number of restaurant businesses becoming insolvent jumped by a quarter in 2018 as consumers shunned the High Street, new figures show. Accountancy firm Moore Stephens said there had been 1,219 insolvencies, ranging from standalone restaurants up to large investor-backed chains - up from 985 in 2017. It blamed overcapacity at a time when Britons are eating out less. Restaurant critic Jay Rayner said more operators could struggle next year. In 2018, a spate of big restaurant chains were forced to strike rescue deals - known as company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) - with their creditors as they faced unsustainable debts. Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Jamie Oliver in talks to sell restaurants Gourmet Burger Kitchenearmarked 17 sites for closurewhileCarluccios is shutting 34outlets. Prezzo said itwould close 94- about a third of the chain - including all 33 outlets of its Tex-Mex brand Chimichanga. Moore Stephens said that insolvencies were at their highest level since it began tracking the sector in 2010. It blamed an influx of private equity investment that had led to some restaurant chains opening too many sites that were now failing to break even. It also said interest rate rises and Brexit concerns had ""put a dent"" consumer spending growth, as operators faced rising overheads such as the minimum wage and ingredient costs. Head of restructuring and insolvency Jeremy Willmont said: ""Restaurants have always been prone to high failure rates but vacant restaurants used to be rapidly replaced by a new contender. For now, that process seemed to have stalled and many sites are empty. ""Under such tough trading conditions, restaurants should be cautious about building up debt. They can very quickly become overextended as costs continue to rise."" Restaurant critic Jay Rayner told the BBC that many restaurants - and particularly mid-market chains - operated on ""extremely tight profit margins"". ""They might be worth a lot but their margins are so tight that they are subject to real pain if there are sudden changes in the market place."" He said that while an independent, standalone restaurant might be able cut its costs and struggle on, investor-backed businesses had to cut their losses fast. ""I don't believe in crystal-ball gazing, but I think the last few months of the year will be good for restaurants, but in January many are going to find themselves staring down the barrel of Brexit. ""I think we could see a lot more businesses go to the wall and a lot of jobs lost."" Trouble for high street restaurants.

"Yemen has been devastated by a four-year conflict Saudi Arabia has reacted angrily after the US Senate voted to withdraw military aid for the war in Yemen, where the Saudis are leading a coalition fighting rebels. The Senate also blamed the Saudi crown prince for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident. Saudi Arabia described the vote as ""interference"" based on ""untrue allegations"". Thursday's Senate resolution was mostly symbolic and is unlikely to become law. However, it is seen as a rebuke to Donald Trump's Saudi policies. It was the first time a chamber of the US Congress had agreed to pull US forces from a military conflict under the 1973 War Powers Act. Senators rebuke Trump with Yemen vote Jamal Khashoggi: The story so far Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition fighting Houthi rebels in Yemen, and has received logistical and intelligence support from the US. The kingdom has also come under pressure since Khashoggi, a US resident and columnist for the Washington Post, was killed while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in Turkey on 2 October. In a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency, the foreign ministry said: ""The kingdom condemns the latest position of the US Senate."" It said that such a position ""was built on untrue allegations"", and that Saudi Arabia rejected ""any interference in its internal affairs"". Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is Saudi Arabia's de facto leader, and the Saudi government has insisted that he knew nothing about Khashoggi's killing. ""The Kingdom has previously asserted that the murder of Saudi citizen Jamal Khashoggi is a deplorable crime that does not reflect the Kingdom's policy nor its institutions and reaffirms its rejection of any attempts to take the case out of the path of justice in the Kingdom,"" the foreign ministry said. The US has so far not publicly responded to the Saudi statement. A non-binding resolution called upon Mr Trump to remove all US forces engaging in hostilities in Yemen, except for those combating Islamist extremists. Some of President Trump's fellow Republicans defied him to pass the measure with Democrats by 56-41. The US suspended refuelling Saudi war planes last month, and Thursday's resolution - if it were ultimately passed into law - would prohibit that practice from resuming. President Trump has consistently defended US business and military ties with Saudi Arabia The Senate then unanimously passed a resolution blaming the Saudi crown prince for Khashoggi's murder, and insisting that the kingdom hold accountable those responsible. Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor has said Khashoggi was killed on the orders of a rogue intelligence officer. Turkish officials however say they have evidence, including gruesome audio recordings, that the journalist was killed by a team of Saudi agents on orders that came from the highest levels. His body has not yet been found. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. US media have said the CIA believes the Saudi crown prince ordered his killing. However, President Trump has dismissed the report, saying the CIA had not drawn firm conclusions. President Trump has vowed to veto the measures, and they are unlikely at present to pass the House of Representatives, which on Wednesday blocked a vote on the matter. But independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who co-sponsored the measures, said he expected the resolutions to succeed once Democrats formally take over control of the House in January following their mid-term elections victory. This video can not be played Senators slam Saudi crown prince as ""crazy"" and a ""wrecking ball"" The Trump administration had argued the bill on Yemen would undercut US support for the Saudi-led coalition against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. White House officials have emphasised US economic ties to the kingdom. Mr Trump's adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has continued to cultivate ties with the prince, according to the US media.

" By Jessica Lussenhop Hesperia, California, is a dusty city of fewer than 100,000 people in the Mojave Desert, about a two-hour drive northeast of downtown Los Angeles. Far from the glitz of Hollywood, it’s a city of squat houses with high chain-link fences surrounding dirt yards. The purple snow-capped San Bernardino mountains loom on almost every horizon. On the week I visited, a big white tent was selling freshly cut Christmas trees in a vacant lot between a Chevron station and a Wendy’s fast-food restaurant. The smell of pine sap hovered over the arid plateau. I’d come to the High Desert because it’s the home of one of the internet’s most recent - and most reviled - viral stars: Jered Threatin, a hard rock musician who performs simply under the name “Threatin”. A month earlier, Threatin had become an international laughing stock, after a small army of internet sleuths revealed that he had tried to fake his way to stardom using paid Facebook likes, YouTube views and bots. He had uploaded deceptively edited film footage that appeared to show him playing to sold-out crowds, lied about a non-existent award and album sales, completely fabricated an entire US tour, and used it all to secure a 10-city tour of Europe and the UK. As it would turn out, that was all just the tip of the iceberg. By the end of it, his bandmates had abandoned him, his final stops in France, Italy and Germany were cancelled, and the internet was in a frenzy over the young man’s downfall. “The guy’s clearly a delusional rich kid,” scolded a commenter on one of the dozens of articles that helped unravel the hoax. “A simple conman,” read another. “I'm surprised he hasn't gotten the hell kicked out of him yet. I'll do it for free.” His own brother, Scott, an extreme metal musician still living back in their hometown of Moberly, Missouri, had warned me not to bother coming to California to speak to his now-infamous younger sibling. “It's all smoke and mirrors with Jered,” he wrote to me via Facebook. “He'll lead you to believe there’s something big to get you to bite... only for you to be let down. Be careful.” Scott went as far as to wonder if Jered might rent out some kind of party mansion in anticipation of my arrival, to convince me that he really was an international rock star. But my GPS instructions led me to an ordinary-looking, single-storey house on the side of a thunderous four-lane freeway lined with fast-food restaurants and superstores. When I rang the doorbell, a woman with long reddish-blonde hair and librarian’s glasses answered the door. It was Kelsey, Jered’s wife. I recognised her from her Instagram account, which had briefly gone dark as the internet mob descended upon her, demanding to know her level of complicity in her husband’s scam. Threatin - whose real name is Jered Eames - stepped into the hallway behind her. The 29-year-old was shorter than I expected, about 5ft 9in (1.75m), wearing the same black leather motorcycle jacket he wore in his promotional photos over a black T-shirt and black trousers. He has one of those ageless faces that would make you believe he was either 19 or 50, depending on what you were being told. His distinctive hair cascaded down his back. “Nice to meet you,” he said, extending a pale hand. “I’m Jered. But you know that.” As we briefly toured the Eames’ immaculate and sparsely decorated home - framed portraits of Jered hung throughout, rows of identical black T-shirts and cargo pants hung in the walk-in wardrobe - I still didn’t know what to expect. Would he be defensive? Apologetic? Was he embarrassed or oblivious? Over the many hours of conversation that followed, I discovered that he was none of these things. Even all the cunning of internet detectives hadn’t been able to fully uncover the truth behind Jered Threatin, and the strange and sparklingly unique trainwreck that was the Breaking the World Tour. When I told him point blank that there was no way I could completely trust what he was telling me, he was unperturbed. “I understand that,” he shrugged. “That’s part of the fascination.” Weeks earlier, when the immolation of Threatin was in full effect, even the people he had tricked into supporting his disastrous bid for fame had to give him credit - the attempt was impressive in both its intricacy and its audacity. “This whole thing is just surreal,” said Rob Moore, lead singer of the band Dogsflesh, which opened for Threatin on one of the early tour stops. “He’s basically duped the whole of the music industry. He’s duped everybody, myself included.” Months before Threatin boarded a plane bound for Heathrow, London, material sent out to venues and prospective support bands claimed that Eames had “signed to SPV Records (Whitesnake, Scorpions, Motorhead)” and that his “last single charted Top 40 in 7 countries”. “The world rarely sees so much talent wrapped into one person,” read his website, alongside photos of a wan young man with long, straw-coloured hair glowering into the camera. The site reported sales of more than 55,000 copies of his debut EP. His Facebook page had nearly 40,000 likes and his YouTube channel was filled with clips of Threatin playing to packed arenas of screaming fans. “I would let Jered Threatin do literally ANYTHING to me!” one of dozens of fan comments gushed. It was this kind of online fandom that helped convince guitarist Joe Prunera that playing with Threatin might be the kind of break he’d been waiting for. It began with a Facebook friend request from someone named Lisa Golding. Prunera, a 36-year-old AV technician at the Wynn Las Vegas resort and casino, had moved out West years earlier with aspirations of a career in music, and noticed immediately that Golding was an agent with a company called Aligned Artist Management based in Beverly Hills. As soon as he approved her request, Golding sent Prunera a message. “We have a signed hard rock artist on our roster that is looking for a new rhythm guitarist for their upcoming tour in Europe this November,” Golding wrote. “If you are interested I would like to set you up with an audition/meeting with the band in Los Angeles.” Prunera immediately called the number at the bottom of the message, spoke to Golding, and agreed to make the four-hour drive for the audition. A second employee of Aligned Artist Management named Joe Abrams took care of the logistics via email, writing that while the tour would pay only $300 (£239) in total, all Prunera’s expenses would be covered for the two-week itinerary. On 21 July, Prunera arrived on the Sunset Boulevard location of SIR Studios. When he texted Golding to tell her he’d arrived, it was Kelsey who met him and walked him back to the rehearsal studio where Jered was waiting. “He was very down to earth, very nice and easy to get along with,” recalled Prunera. “My initial thought was this is someone I could actually see myself hanging out with.” At dinner that night, Eames offered Prunera the job. For someone who’d put some of his own rock star dreams on the back burner to make ends meet, it felt like a great opportunity. The fact that he’d never heard of Threatin didn’t bother him. “I was thinking: ‘OK, he’s a signed artist, he’s got a label behind him, a manager, a promoter.’ I’m thinking that he’s not huge, but he’s on his way,” said Prunera. Threatin also hired bassist Gavin Carney, a local from outside LA, and Dane Davis, a drummer based in Las Vegas. All three were approached by Golding and Abrams, who’d found their videos on YouTube. None of the band members ever met anyone from Aligned in person, but were nevertheless excited by the opportunity, and the prospect that if Threatin took off, it could become a regular, paying gig. The quartet started practising in Hesperia every other weekend from July until October, then the Eameses put them up in the guest bedrooms and on their living room sofa for a full week before departure. The band practised non-stop until it was time to leave for the airport in Los Angeles. “It was exciting, it was cool,” recalled Carney, a 24-year-old car mechanic, who hadn’t travelled much outside of California before. “My first tour ever, we’re going to Europe and the UK - that’s pretty crazy.” At the time, the only thing that struck any of the three hired band members as odd was a surprise announcement that their promised $300 fee was now actually their food budget. Davis says he was upset, knowing that $300 would hardly last a week in an expensive city like London. (Eames disputed this account, saying the band members always knew the money was for per diem.) “But I’m the kind of person where I’ve given my word that I’m going on this tour, and my word means something to me,” he said. “I didn’t want it to end up screwing over the band.” After two days of London sightseeing in the hired Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van driven by Kelsey, the band arrived for the first show of the tour at The Underworld in Camden. While the band was backstage taking giddy pre-show selfies, Jon Vyner, The Underworld’s booking manager, was expecting a fairly sizeable crowd for a Thursday night. The gig had been arranged a month earlier by Threatin’s booking agent, Casey Marshall, from an LA-based company called StageRight Bookings. Marshall had paid the venue’s £780 ($979) hire fee and informed Vyner via email that they’d pre-sold 291 tickets for the evening. That would have packed the venue to well over half its capacity, and Vyner had staffed the doors and bar accordingly. “We would have been overjoyed if that many people actually turned up,” he said. Marshall had also arranged for two support bands to play, and when Prunera and Davis slipped into the audience to check them out, both noticed there were only a handful of spectators. “I kind of thought to myself: ‘Maybe this is a band that’s not really that popular and they’re kind of just starting out,’” recalled Davis. But by the time Threatin took to the stage for their first real performance together, the audience had actually dwindled further. Prunera, who’d simply assumed that Threatin’s fan base in the UK must be massive, was disappointed, but tried to put it out of his mind. “I thought: ‘Who knows, it’s a Thursday night, maybe nobody’s out, people gotta work tomorrow,’” he said. “We weren’t stressing out because these things can happen.” Behind the scenes, however, Vyner was “quite angry”. “I told Casey by email never to contact us again,” he said. Oblivious to the trouble brewing, the band moved on to the next stop at Trillians in Newcastle upon Tyne. Marshall had hired Rob Moore’s Dogsflesh as the opener. As a seasoned musician touring since 1982, Moore took the time to check Threatin out before accepting the show offer, and was pleased with what he saw. “Loads and loads of hits and views and likes and comments. We thought: ‘Yeah, this guy’s obviously the real thing,’” he said. “We thought if we can get on with their booking agent in America, maybe they can open up a few more doors for us.” Once again, however, as the support band came on, the venue was nearly empty. After Threatin failed to acknowledge the members of Dogsflesh after their set - a backstage faux pas - Moore decided to pack up and leave without staying to watch the headliner. As he walked out, Moore says he saw five people in the audience, two of whom were members of his own band. Things finally boiled over at the band’s fourth gig, The Exchange in Bristol, where Marshall had told the venue to expect 180 pre-sold ticket holders. Billy Jon Bingham, frontman for the band Ghost of Machines, says his band took the Bristol gig unpaid as an opportunity for more exposure and a chance to sell merchandise. But he arrived to see that there was no queue and the Hollywood promoter was nowhere to be found. Ten minutes before they were due to take the stage, a manager at The Exchange waved him over. “He pulled me aside and said: ‘They haven’t sold any tickets. I’ve asked him to cough up the money that we’ve lost or we’re losing on the bar, otherwise they’re gonna close the venue,’” he recalled. Bingham says he saw Eames, who up until this point had been slinking around the venue with his hood up, go to a cash point and withdraw the £400 needed for the show to go on. Bartender Jonathan Minto, who had come in to help handle the expected crowd, overheard his manager quibbling with Eames over the additional cost. But Minto said that at the time he believed they’d all been “taken for a ride by a shady promoter”. That evening, Threatin took the stage to an audience of absolutely no-one. “My initial reaction was to feel sorry for him and the band, because having no-one turn up at your show is pretty demoralising,” wrote Minto in a message to the BBC. “But then… during his set, we started the internet sleuthing.” Minto said that when he and the other idle bartenders watched the clip that appeared to show Threatin playing to a sold-out crowd in an arena somewhere, they saw that Eames never appeared in the same shot as the throngs of fans in the pit. “He had literally just spliced footage of a crowd of at least 20,000 people rocking out at a real gig with close-up footage of Jered playing in front of wall,” said Minto. The next morning, he posted a long Facebook message, laying out everything he’d found out the previous night, thinking his friends in the music industry would get a kick out of it. “Threaten [sic] is essentially a fake band. 38,000 likes on Facebook which have ALL been paid for,” he wrote. “The 100 or so people attending the event page (and all the other event pages for their tour) are all based in Brazil. Every comment on their youtube videos is phoney.” The post began to spread. After reading it, Tim Williams, editor-in-chief of the blog Sick Chirpse in London, went on the websites of the companies that allegedly represented Threatin: Aligned Artist Management, StageRight Bookings, Magnified Media PR and his label, Superlative Music Recordings. “It looked like it was made by a kid in 10 minutes,” said Williams of the websites. “It was very suspicious.” When Williams googled the other bands allegedly signed with Superlative, nothing came up. All four websites were registered to the same anonymous GoDaddy account. On 9 November - a little over a week into the tour - Sick Chirpse,MetalSucksand NME all posted the first articles exposing what Williams called “the bizarre story of Jered Threatin”. Minto said he and other workers at The Exchange had also been contacting the venues further along the tour route to warn them not to believe anything that Threatin’s management was telling them. He says his phone began going crazy with notifications. “People were really digging into who he was and finding out crazy information nearly every minute,” he said. A mountain of damning evidence began piling up. The news outlet that had awarded Threatin “Rock Artist of the Year” in 2017? Fake. The profile photo of Lisa Golding from her Facebook page? Lifted from a Montreal photographer’s website. The physical address for StageRight Bookings in Los Angeles actually belonged to a suicide prevention charity. By the time the band arrived for its fifth gig in Birmingham, Carney could tell something was up. “It just didn’t feel like we were welcome,” he said. Cracks began to form within the band as soon as they disembarked from the ferry in Northern Ireland. Davis switched his mobile phone back on to find that his inbox was full of emails from concerned friends as well as derisive internet trolls, haranguing him for his role in the “fake band”. As he read the story in NME, Davis became alarmed that he “had no idea who Jered is, or what he’s capable of”. While Kelsey and Jered were checking in to the home they had rented for the band, Davis showed Prunera and Carney one of the links that had been sent to him. “At that point I just told them: ‘Let’s keep quiet and just try to find out as much as possible and get a game plan together,’” he said. “From then on we communicated through text.” An awkward scene unfolded that evening in the living room, with all three hired bandmates furiously texting back and forth to one another, while trying to play it cool with Jered and Kelsey sitting just feet away. “I get online and sure enough, it’s everywhere. It’s all over the internet,” said Prunera. “I’m like: ‘What is going on?’” Davis’ mother had flown from Las Vegas to Belfast to see her son play, but instead, he conscripted her to help the band gather their luggage and flee the rented house without a confrontation with Jered. But before that could happen, Jered came downstairs and asked if anyone else had been getting any weird emails. “Jered seemed like he was just as confused,’” recalled Prunera. “He said he was a victim. We said: ‘Dude this is over.’” Davis left that night with his family. Prunera followed the next morning, checking into a hotel and ultimately relying on an aunt to fund his trip back home. Only Carney, who felt unsure about what he was reading versus what Jered was saying, agreed to stay. But without a drummer or the other guitarist, the Breaking the World tour officially broke down. By then, the story had gone fully viral. MetalSucks filed a dozen follow-up stories, breathlessly chronicling the band’s every blunder. Threatin became the talk of music podcasts and YouTube channels. The New York Times called it “a most puzzling hoax even for 2018”. When journalists discovered that Jered Threatin’s real name was Jered Eames, it didn’t take long to track down his older brother, Scott, to their hometown of Moberly, Missouri. He seemed unsurprised by his younger brother’s antics. “I caught an article pretty early on, and once I saw the picture on there I kind of rolled my eyes,” he said. “I was hoping it would blow over.” Credit: Tom Couture Scott, who plays guitar for the extreme metal band NEVALRA and under the stage name Wicked One for the black metal band Thy Antichrist, said he hasn’t spoken to his brother in about six years - since Jered and Kelsey packed up and abruptly moved to California in 2012. According to Scott, the rift began over the extreme metal group, Saetith, Scott and Jered formed together, an outfit that in Scott’s estimation had real promise and had started building a reputation. They even travelled to Puerto Rico together on a 2011 tour. But things soured when Scott went online and saw that Jered had changed the band’s Facebook page to show that he - not Scott - had played guitar on their upcoming recordings. “He was my best friend, honestly. I was pretty isolated,” says Scott. “Almost overnight it went from best friend to not speaking.” He says he still hopes that someday his wayward sibling will come home, for their parents’ sake. “He’s still my brother,” he said. Back in Europe, Carney went sightseeing with the Eames. They toured an Irish castle, and visited the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Carney says it was fun. The epic disintegration of the tour was discussed only shallowly, and Carney did not confront Jered. But the final straw came when Jered released what was up until this point his first and only statement on the debacle. It was just three sentences long: “What is Fake News? I turned an empty room into an international headline. If you are reading this, you are part of the illusion.” The internet collectively groaned. But for Carney’s mother, it was a sign that the whole thing had gone too far - she insisted Carney let her fly him back home to Los Angeles. He acquiesced. But Carney seemed to be the last person still willing to believe that Threatin’s management existed, or that the whole tour hadn’t simply fallen victim to an unscrupulous promoter. Not long after returning, he even posted a video of himself covering his “favourite” Threatin songs on YouTube. “There’s still a lot of questions. I don’t really want to come to any conclusions until I know,” he told me at the time. “I want to hear what he has to say.” By the time I’d heard about the saga, Eames seemed to be in the defensive crouch familiar to anyone who’s watched a viral internet-shaming unfold - his Twitter and Instagram accounts had been made private. A series of YouTube interviews with him (which turned out to be Eames interviewing himself) had disappeared from the web. Yet at the same time, his critics were finding themselves blocked from his Facebook page, a sign that from somewhere on the cancelled tour route, the wounded frontman was watching. During this time, he was also ignoring all requests for interviews from journalists. I sent him a direct message on Twitter anyway, not expecting to hear back. He responded within hours. “I'll be back in LA next week.” About two weeks after he’d returned home, Jered Eames sat at his dining room table drinking a Coke and scrolling through the reams of vitriol that come up when you plug “Threatin” into Facebook’s search bar. Kelsey sat beside him as one of their four cats swished around the couple’s feet. “Threatin is a total fraud,” Jered read aloud, a slight Missouri twang still discernible in his voice. “We stupidly hired our venue out to his agent Casey Marshall based in America - I assume Casey is Threatin’s mother.” He read further silently. “They think my parents paid for the whole thing, that’s hilarious,” he said. Jered moved out of his parents’ house and into a house with Kelsey when the two were still in high school. He claims the tour was funded with the money they squirrelled away when he was flipping burgers at a Moberly Burger King and installing court-mandated breathalyser devices in people’s cars. Neither of them is in touch with their families back in the Midwest. “I’m very much a loner,” said Jered. “Not only do I not want friends, I don’t want family either.” He admits that friction within his family did precipitate his cutting off contact with Scott and his parents, but he says that what really sent him to California was a sudden, violent coughing fit that landed him bent over the sink, choking out blood. Without going to a doctor, he said, he simply assumed he was dying and decided to make some dramatic decisions. “I just went: ‘Am I really happy doing what I’m doing with my life?’ And I went: ‘No, I’m not. I’m gonna move to Los Angeles.’ Everything I thought about doing, I’m doing right now.” The Eames live a very small life together. They say they do not socialise with anyone but each other. They rarely go out, and when they do, it’s to drive around and talk. The fact that the single motivating factor in Jered’s life is an insatiable need for fame, yet he has no friends, is a paradox he acknowledges, but has no explanation for. Tapping away on his laptop, Jered tried - and repeatedly failed - to log in to one of the hundreds of fake Facebook profiles he’d started over the past year, since the launch of the album he’d written and recorded, playing all the instruments himself, in the huge studio space on the east side of the house. Although he made a few unsuccessful attempts to promote Breaking the World through traditional means, he quickly decided to go a different route. “Why do I need some gatekeeper to tell me that it’s what they want it to be, or it’s good enough for them?” he remembered thinking. “I’m going to find my own way to do things.” Earlier in our meeting, he’d reached under his bed and fished out five notebooks. He flipped one open on a random page and showed me that line after line was filled in with email addresses, their passwords, and a little lock symbol to denote that they’d been locked down or flagged as spam, and were now defunct. In the early days, these accounts had been used in the comment sections of YouTube and on Facebook to sing Threatin’s praises. He kept the names of his fake Facebook accounts in an app on his phone as well: Mark Jaime. Sarina Goodman. Laura Wales. Ann Corbi. Casey Johnston. Jessica Rice. Josephine Gossan. James Grundy. Alicia Tanlor. Jered had also gone through the house pulling burner phones out of various drawers, all of which he said were used as a means to create the fake accounts, which require a unique phone number. “There should be more,” Kelsey had muttered as she looked down at a pile of eight phones. In my conversation with the couple, they quickly admitted the hoax. Indeed, all the likes and the views and the comments were paid for, made by bots or Jered himself. Casey Marshall, Joe Abrams, and Lisa Golding were also all Jered (Kelsey had provided Golding’s voice over the phone). None of the companies tied to Threatin really existed. He created the label first, to release his debut album online in August of 2017, and the universe of phoney companies and contacts had expanded from there. When he tried to generate press, he invented a publicist. When he needed to book some gigs, he created a booking agent. He viewed the entire ecosystem of the music industry - the managers, booking agents, promoters, even photographers and videographers - as just a series of roles he can fill himself. “If a band approaches a venue and says: ‘Hey, we wanna play this venue,’ you’re going to get ignored,” he says. “All it has to do is look like it’s coming from a booking agency - doesn’t even matter what booking agency, even a fake one - and then you’ll get talked to and you can get things booked. Simple as that.” As he explained his tactics, Jered was relaxed, confident - not the slightest bit embarrassed. But that’s because he had something he was eager to show me - a series of emails that he said he sent out under yet another alias, a Gmail account belonging to “E. Evieknowsit”. “URGENT: News tip,” the subject line read. “The musician going by the name Threatin is a total fake. He faked a record label, booking agent, facebook likes, and an online fanbase to book a European tour. ZERO people are coming to the shows and it is clear that his entire operation is fake,” he wrote, including links to all his phoney websites. “Please don’t let this man fake his way to fame... Please Expose him.” The first such message he showed me was dated 2 November, a day into the Breaking the World Tour, and a week before the first news reports were published. He says he sent the messages out to a database of reporters’ emails he keeps in a massive Excel spreadsheet on his laptop - to outlets like the Huffington Post, Spin, Consequence of Sound, Rolling Stone, The Guardian, Pitchfork, New York Times, MetalSucks and, yes, the BBC. Although it was unclear if the tips directly resulted in coverage, some of the emails appear to have predated articles. During the tour, when the bandmates weren’t looking or in another room, Eames claimed he was on his phone on Facebook under his various aliases, stoking the controversy. If he is to be believed, the public shaming of Jered Threatin was nothing but a carefully orchestrated publicity stunt. He’d even had Kelsey at the ready with a video camera, in the hope that someone at one of the venues might try to fight him and create a viral video to boot. “I manufactured my own destruction,” he said proudly. “My idea was, how am I going to fill these empty rooms? I’m going to fill them with eyes from the digital world. That was the objective from the beginning.” Were the things I’d taken as signs of humiliation - the closing of his social media accounts, the disappearance of the obviously fake YouTube interviews - actually Jered herding eyeballs towards his music, which he left up? As of writing, Threatin’s single Living is Dying has been viewed more than 1.2 million times. Ignoring interview requests was another form of stoking the fire. “As soon as the questions are answered, the story’s less interesting,” he said. Which brought us to the awkward fact of my sitting in his house, listening to his explanation. Maybe by writing the very story you are now reading,I’ve played a part in carrying out Jered Threatin’s master plan. Jered claims to be in meetings day after day with movie producers looking to fictionalise the saga, bookers who want him out on the road to capitalise on his notoriety, and music producers and labels who want to talk about his next album. Kelsey has hours of footage, from the auditions at SIR Studios all the way through the tour, which they intend to use in a documentary. She even taped him sending out news tips about his own fraudulence from their hotel in Newcastle. “There is no villain character anymore in rock music, or really in all music,” he says smugly. “I’m trying to vilify myself.” When I press him to find out if he feels bad about deceiving anyone - especially his former bandmates - he is unrepentant, and claims he offered to pay for them to fly home after the tour fell apart. “The job is the same either way, and the only difference is the number of people standing in front of you,” he said. “When they [the band] are saying: ‘I want to be a touring musician, I want to be famous and I want this and that’ - that’s what [they] got.” Although Eames provided emails, receipts, videos and other documentation to back up his story, ultimately it is still possible that the tale he laid out is not true. Perhaps the “E. Evieknowsit” messages were backdated. He didn’t allow me to take photos of the inside of his notebooks, because some of those accounts are still active, roving the internet, and a part of what he said are forthcoming publicity stunts. For his part, brother Scott was utterly unconvinced when I relayed Jered’s version of events. “He’s a master manipulator,” said Scott. “I want to be the voice of reason here. This is like every other profession and you’ve lied to everyone in your profession, so I don’t know where he’s going with this. He can be the internet sensation if he wants, but he’s not going be the musician that he wants to be.” In our last conversation, however, Jered dismissed the idea instantly that the music might not be good enough to carry him forward. “I came home to literally thousands and thousands of CD sales. I have a cult following,” he said. His only regret, he said, is that he didn’t show up to one of the cancelled shows, where his internet infamy would have generated a proper audience - perhaps the final stop in Italy. He would have liked to have gone on stage, faced the crowd, and refused to play a note. “I just would have gotten booed off stage, or bottled, and it would have been a beautiful piece of stage art,” he said wistfully. “It’s like, I show up and I play for no-one. And then when there’s an audience, I don’t play for anyone.” When I left the Eames’ home, I drove back to my hotel, where I was meeting the last person on earth who seemed to still believe in Threatin - former bassist Gavin Carney. He’d driven up with his father to answer my questions from another town outside LA. He had worn a suit and a floral print tie for the occasion, and seemed especially young in the moment, standing in the hotel lobby next to his father. I told him that only a short while ago, Jered had confirmed that the whole debacle - including the fake management companies and labels, the empty venues, the crush of media attention - had all been orchestrated. Sitting on a couch in the hotel suite, he looked crushed. “Wow,” he said. “It’s crazy. It’s amazing, if that’s the case, the amount of lies he was able to keep track of and be able to consistently repeat. It’s... it’s very shocking.” I repeated what Jered had said to me - that neither he, nor Prunera nor Davis would have got as famous if Threatin hadn’t turned into a three-ring circus. Carney agreed that in his case, Jered was essentially right. “I’ve been approached. I don’t mean to name drop, but, by a lot of people who are sort of high up,” he said. “I did get on the news. I’m here talking to you right now.” He thought for a moment. “Personally I wouldn’t want to do anything like that. I prefer to be kind of a goody two-shoes,” he said. “I put videos up, I try to put myself out there as honestly as I can and hopefully find somebody who wants to work with me. That’s the way I prefer to do it.” Of the three band members, Carney was the only one that Jered said he would like to play with again. But he acknowledged that Carney would probably never agree to it. In our entire conversation, it was the only time I thought Eames sounded unsure of himself. When I asked Carney if he could ever be friends with Jered, he said he didn’t know. “It’s hard for me to say now. It’s hard to know what is true and what isn’t.” Update: 19 December 2018 “The publicity stunt for this is done,” Jered Eames assured me at the end of our interview. “Anything I’ve said to you is factual.” To prove that he was indeed the one that tipped off the media to the hoax Eames forwarded me 16 different news tips sent from the “E. Evieknowsit” account. Four of them were sent to two different general BBC news tip email addresses, and the earliest of those was dated 4 November - five days before the first stories broke. My colleagues looked for the emails, but because those inboxes are routinely purged, they had nothing. After we first published our story, I began reaching out to reporters at the other outlets who had allegedly been sent emails. The earliest one was reportedly sent on 2 November to the “tips” inbox for the entertainment magazine Variety. “Yes, we got this email,” a helpful Variety reporter wrote back, attaching a copy with the exact same text that Jered had shared with me. Then I looked closer. The timestamp on Jered’s copy said it was sent on “Fri, Nov 2, 2018 at 12:16 PM”. The copy from the Variety reporter read, “Sat, Nov 17, 2018 at 4:32 PM”. An editor at MetalSucks, which did some of the earliest breaking stories on Threatin, could not find an alleged 7 November email that Jered shared with me. Instead, he found a different email from Evie in their inbox, pointing him to a YouTube clip from one of Threatin’s empty shows. It was dated 17 November. As I went down the line, I found that the New York Times, Ultimate Classic Rock and Metal Insider all got the “E. Evieknowsit” email on 17 November. But by this date, these outlets had already extensively covered the Threatin story. Finally, the BBC’s IT specialists managed to recover two deleted messages from “E. Evieknowsit”. Both were sent on 17 November, less than an hour apart.When I texted Jered to tell him what I’d found, he said he would respond. He never did. Built with Shorthand",Negative,3.1157997e-05
"HS2 is the biggest infrastructure project in Europe An early cost estimate MPs had when they were approving the HS2 high-speed rail project was ""enormously wrong"", a former HS2 boss has told BBC Panorama. Doug Thornton said the costing underestimated the value of many properties HS2 needed to purchase along the proposed route and thousands more had not been budgeted for. Mr Thornton said the figure MPs saw was hundreds of millions of pounds too low. He was later dismissed. HS2 rejects claims MPs were misled. It says it followed the correct process to keep Parliament updated on budgetary changes. What do we know about HS2? Is the HS2 rail project in trouble? Another former senior HS2 insider agreed that the company had had estimates that were higher than the early costing that MPs had at the time. HS2 is the biggest infrastructure project in Europe. The government says it will cost Â£56bn, with the first phase from London to Birmingham coming in at Â£27bn. The spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, investigated the land and property programme earlier this year. It found estimated property costs did increase significantly but concluded HS2 was not required to provide its updated estimates to MPs. Doug Thornton, a former HS2 boss, believes the early cost estimate MPs had was misleading However, Mr Thornton said he refused to use figures he believed were misleading. ""I have never seen anything like it"", he told the BBC. ""I was absolutely appalled... that numbers could be advanced in such a loose and slapdash fashion."" ""There was a gap of almost 100% in terms of the wrong numbers of properties that the organisation had not budgeted for. ""We started to talk about it to our finance team, we talked about it to HR, we talked about it to line managers, so it was there, we were calling it out,"" he said. Mr Thornton was subsequently sacked by HS2. The joint chairman of HS2 and Crossrail resigned earlier this month The Sunday Times previously reported,externalthat it had seen documents in which Mr Thornton said HS2's official budget for buying land and buildings was based on ""rudimentary map-based analysis by interns"". These new claims come amid recent turmoil at the company responsible for the project. When the joint chairman of HS2 and the troubled Crossrail project, Sir Terry Morgan, resigned earlier this month he warned of possible cost issues ahead for HS2,talking of the ""challenge inside the project"" to stay on time and on budget. The railway company is involved in the biggest land and property acquisition programme since World War Two, buying a total of 70 sq km of land. Ron Ryall says HS2 offered him far less than his property is worth Panorama has spoken to a number of people whose properties are in the path of the high-speed railway, who have complained of low valuations and delays in compensation after finding out their homes and premises were needed by HS2. Ron Ryall's Elizabethan home is in the path of the viaduct that will carry the railway in Buckinghamshire. He said HS2 had offered him far less than the property is worth. Meanwhile, Paul Tropman who owns Wood Waste, a wood recycling business on the outskirts of Birmingham, said he had been left hundreds of thousands pounds out of pocket after his business was forced to relocate. ""I think they've overspent and the only way they can get their money back is by robbing the likes of us,"" he told the BBC. Paul Tropman's business was forced to relocate because of HS2 HS2 is still working to settle their cases. Chief executive Mark Thurston said the company always paid a fair price and has only had to use its compulsory purchase powers in a small number of cases. Mr Thurston did recently acknowledge a cost gap within the project as a whole and that he is in talks with contractors to reduce costs. But he told Panorama: ""I'm not worried about overspending, I'm confident we've got a budget we can stand by.""

"Police have checked in on Pete Davidson after the comedian posted a worrying message on Instagram. Fans raised concerns about the 25-year-old following a now-deleted post in which he's widely reported as saying he didn't ""want to be on this earth anymore"". New York City police told Radio 1 Newsbeat that Pete, who has borderline personality disorder, is safe. Pete split from ex-fiance Ariana Grande earlier this year. It's reported that he wrote: ""I really don't want to be on this earth anymore. ""I'm doing my best to stay here for you but I actually don't know how much longer I can last. ""All I've ever tried to do was help people. Just remember I told you so."" Pete speaks openly about living with borderline personality disorder The Saturday Night Live star appears to have since deleted his entire Instagram account. Hours after the post, Pete appeared in a sketch on the comedy show and introduced guest Miley Cyrus. Fans and celebrities posted their support for him on social media. Allow Twitter content?

Pete spoke about his borderline personality disorder, which affects mood and how you interact with others,earlier this month. He wrote on Instagram: ""I've spoken about BPD and being suicidal publicly only in the hopes that it will help bring awareness and help to kids like myself who don't want to be on this earth. ""No matter how hard the internet or anyone tries to make me kill myself. I won't. I'm upset I even have to say this."" Symptoms of BPD can be grouped into four areas, according to the NHS: emotional instability, disturbed patterns of thinking, impulsive behaviour, and intense but unstable relationships. Pete's ex-fiance Ariana Grande appears to have sent a message of support to the comedian in now-deleted tweets. Ariana and Pete broke up earlier this year It appears she went to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York, where Saturday Night Live is filmed, to support him. ""I'm downstairs and I'm not going anywhere if you need anyone or anything. I know you have everyone you need and that's not me, but I'm here too,"" she wrote. Ariana's ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, was found dead at his home in September afteran accidental overdoseinvolving cocaine, alcohol and an opioid drug called fentanyl. Pete and Ariana started dating in May and got engaged in June, but split up in October. Following their break-up, the native New Yorker said he'd been getting ""online bullied and in public by people for nine months"". Newsbeat has contacted NBC for comment.
