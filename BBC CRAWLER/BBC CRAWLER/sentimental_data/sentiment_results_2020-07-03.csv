"The Washington Redskins American football team will review its name after demands from major sponsors. Its headline sponsor, Fedex, joined a fresh wave of calls to scrap a team moniker long-criticised as racist. The Washington DC-based team has faced years of pressure over a name seen as offensive to Native Americans. The latest calls come amid a fresh focus on racism sparked by worldwide protests. FedEx made the request at the behest of its own investors. Dan Snyder, owner of the Washington Redskins, said: ""This process allows the team to take into account not only the proud tradition and history of the franchise but also input from our alumni, the organization, sponsors, the National Football League (NFL) and the local community."" At the turn of the millennium, FedEx paid $205m (Â£165m) for the naming rights to the Redskins' 82,000-seat stadium in Maryland. The deal expires in 2025. But that is not the delivery giant's only tie to the team. The boss and founder of FedEx, Frederick Smith also owns a minority stake in the Redskins. The team has been under pressure to change its name for decades. Native Americans and supporters protesting against Redskins' name and logo Six years ago, FedEx shareholders voted to allow the Redskins to keep its name after the shipping giant received a complaint from the Wisconsin-based Oneida Indian tribe. But as firms assess their stance on issues around race, following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the worldwide Black Lives Matter protests, FedEx has now called for the team to rebrand. Seeing red: The power of a name What Native Americans think of the word 'redskin' Should the R-word be banned? Last week, 87 investment firms and shareholders wrote to FedEx, along with fellow Redskins' sponsors Nike and PepsiCo, calling on the firms to sever ties with the Redskins, according to trade publication AdWeek. ""'Redskins' remains a dehumanising word, characterizing people by skin colour and a racial slur with hateful connotations,"" the letter written to PepsiCo said. ""We have been in conversations with the NFL and Washington management for a few weeks about this issue,"" a PepsiCo spokesperson said. ""We believe it is time for a change. We are pleased to see the steps the team announced today, and we look forward to continued partnership."" As of Thursday, Nike's website did not display any Redskins merchandise. The Washington-based team was the only one of the 32 NFL teams no longer listed in the site's index. Nike did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment. In the past, the team's owner Mr Snyder has remained steadfast on keeping the name, calling it a ""badge of honour"". Seeing red: The power of a name Should the R-word be banned?

"Tesco has reportedly asked suppliers to agree price cuts as it steps up its battle with budget supermarkets. The move is part of its shift to an ""everyday low pricing strategy"", which will see it use fewer promotions. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""We are committed to open, fair and transparent partnerships with all of our suppliers."" Tesco has given suppliers a deadline of 10 July to agree,according to the Grocer.,external Several suppliers told the trade publication that they faced pressure from the supermarket to lower their prices. Some raised concerns over the timescale of the demands, as well as a lack of clarity over how the change in promotions would work in practice. Tesco shoppers buying more during fewer trips Tesco sells Polish supermarket business Tesco launched its ""Aldi price match"" promise in March, where products including fresh and freezer food are matched against those offered at the budget supermarket. The supermarket announced in June that it has extendedthe scheme to nearly 500 Tesco and branded products in response to increasing competition. ""We have also reduced the number of short-term promotions, as we focus our investment on everyday low prices instead,"" it said. A Tesco spokesperson told BBC News: ""We have been speaking to suppliers about how we can work together to continue giving our customers great value. ""We don't believe that our customers should pay more for a brand in Tesco than anywhere else."" They added: ""We are committed to open, fair and transparent partnerships with all of our suppliers, and that collaborative approach will continue as we look for new and innovative ways to bring our customers great value."" Tesco reported strong first quarter sales last week. The supermarket said that while the number of trips made by shoppers fell by nearly a third in the 13 weeks to 30 May, the amount being bought rose 64%. In a trading update, Tesco said group sales had risen 8% to Â£13.4bn in the period, but warned that coronavirus-related costs were set to hit Â£840m this year. Neil Shah, director of research at Edison Group, said that investors ""should keep a close eye on the company, since the group operates in a crowded market with retailers Aldi and Lidl continuing to gain market share and current results might not be replicated when the UK is lifted from lockdown.""

"Pubs in England have been closed since March to slow the spread of Covid-19 A council has apologised for telling people that coronavirus will be ""waiting for you"" at the pub when they reopen this weekend. Sheffield City Council said Covid-19 would be ""happiest"" about rule changes which come into force on Saturday. A number of landlords responded angrily to the social media post, which has since been deleted. The council said the post was ""badly worded but was done with the best intentions"". On Thursday, the council tweeted: ""The virus loves crowded places and thrives on close contact. ""It won't be queuing to get inside the pub - it will already be there waiting for you."" The post also included a short video warning people: ""Don't put yourself at risk for the sake of a pint."" The post has since been deleted John Harrison, co-owner of the Beer House, said: ""I was shocked to see the tweet after we'd spent weeks working tirelessly to make sure our business is a safe environment, going above and beyond the government guidelines. ""It felt like a real kick in the gut for the hospitality industry in Sheffield that is on its knees."" Liz Aspden, landlady at The Harlequin, said the tweet was ""very damaging to a trade which is just trying to get back on its feet and made no recognition of the fact that we'll be doing our utmost to create a safe environment"". ""Publicans have been spending long hours - and significant amounts of money - planning to re-open their pubs safely within the guidelines set out by the government,"" she said.

"That's a wrap: The National Theatre in London Empty theatre buildings nationwide have been covered in colourful messages of support, as they remain closed due to Covid-19 concerns. The National Theatre in London has been wrapped in bright pink barrier tape, which reads ""Missing Live Theatre"". The project, led by stage designers group Scene Change, also includes the Manchester Royal Exchange and Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh. As well as the Lyric Belfast, the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff and Theatre Royale Plymouth. Venues have been shut since March, with many warning that they will go out of business in the coming months without support. The art intervention was unveiled on the same day that the National Theatre confirmed  400 casual staff will soon lose their jobs. ""We have committed to paying our casual staff until the end of August, but very sadly due to the changes in the government Job Retention Scheme, we simply cannot afford to offer financial support beyond that point, when we won't be back performing as usual,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. She added they hoped ""additional financial support from government may be forthcoming"" to allow performing again ""in a limited way"" but said ""it is set to be many months before it will be possible to perform to audiences at usual capacities, so regrettably a proportion of job losses are unavoidable"". Speaking to BBC News on Friday, Oscar-winning actor, writer and theatre director Sir Mark Rylance warned that 70% of venues could be closed by Christmas, meaning 290,000 jobs in the sector are at risk, with redundancies being made already. Sir Mark, who also revealed he will reprise his role in Jerusalem next year at some point, stressed that theatres can't go back to usual, and they are going to have to change how they operate and what stories they tell in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""They are devastatingly badly affected,"" said Rylance. ""We have discovered that what the pandemic has brought to the surface too, is that 70% of the workers in theatre are freelance,"" he added. ""They've not benefitted from any furlough scheme or any of the job retention schemes that the buildings and the permanent staff have benefitted from, so people are really in trouble, and they're going to be in more trouble in August and September."" Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester A close-up of the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester Lyric in Belfast In a statement, Scene Change declared: ""This is a moment of reset in our industry and we believe the design community can be an essential part of the transformation that will see theatre buildings being reopened and the ways in which theatre can be reimagined,"" ""As shapers of theatrical space through the use of people and place, our work is pivotal in connecting an entire ecosystem within the theatre industry. We are ideally positioned to be at the heart of any discussions about how theatre operates in the future."" Lyceum in Edinburgh Theatre Royale Plymouth Sherman Theatre in Cardiff The tapes will stay up for a week and then be taken to envelop other theatres. Venues throughout London's West End will join in on Saturday, while The RSC, Sadler's Wells, Theatr Clwyd and Theatre Royal Stratford East will take part the following week, along with Sheffield Theatres, and the Ambassador Theatre Group. Tom Piper, one of the team behind the campaign, told the BBC's Colin Paterson the design was ""inspired by the fact that the National Theatre was sort of wrapped with hazard warning tape it looked like a toxic sort of waste site"". ""And we know that theatres are not toxic places, they are places of great healing, where people will come together with a sense of community and that's what we're all missing at the moment,"" added Piper, who also who helped create the2014 sea of ceramic poppies outside the Tower of London. He encouraged people to go along and see the outdoor ""guerrilla"" artwork for themselves, from a safe distance. ""It's a gesture of love for these buildings really and to highlight that they're empty, they need to be full of people,"" he said. Last week, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden published a five-stage plan for a ""phased return"", which will initially let performances take place outdoors, with indoors performances to follow later. Theatre and music reopening plan 'meaningless' However, the roadmap for the return of live theatre and music was met with calls for financial support and a timetable for reopening, with many dismissing the plan as inadequate.

"A father who initially paid Â£4.99 for his 11-year-old daughter to use a smartphone app was shocked to discover a bill for thousands of pounds a month later. Steve Cumming, 72, said he let her make what he thought was a one-off payment on his debit card to a firm called Roblox. After looking at his balance a month later, he saw thousands had been charged. Roblox says it will refund him. Roblox is an online multiplayer game with about 100 million users worldwide. It is especially popular with children. Its business model relies on in-app purchases. Roblox is free to download, but users can then spend money during play. Roblox is a multiplayer platform where players can create their own games and join in with others Mr Cumming wrote to BBC Radio 2's The Jeremy Vine Show to explain that his 11-year-old daughter had unwittingly run up the enormous bill while playing the game during lockdown. ""My daughter told me all her friends were playing this game and she wanted to spend Â£4.99,"" he said. ""She made that purchase using my debit card on 16 April and I thought nothing more of it."" During the pandemic lockdown he decided to sign up to online banking. ""I'm not very tech-savvy. Due to coronavirus I couldn't visit the bank and I didn't want to use cash machines, so I decided to sign up to online banking,"" he said. When he first logged in, almost a month after that initial payment to Roblox, he was shocked to discover that Â£4,642 had gone and he was in his overdraft. ""When I first logged in nearly a month later I was astonished to see hundreds and hundreds of separate transactions, all between Â£0.99 and Â£9.99. I couldn't understand it. I thought I'd been scammed."" He realised he had lost about Â£3,500 so he phoned his bank, HSBC, to cancel his card. Despite doing that a further Â£1,000 or so left his account and was paid to Roblox via Google Play, he says. Mr Cumming didn't realise his bank account was being charged with purchases from within the game ""My daughter was really upset when we told her about the financial consequences. She thought she was playing with monopoly money - it didn't seem real to her. How can these companies be allowed to trap minors in these games? To trap people who are vulnerable?"" he said. He said he also thinks the government should step in and change the law. ""I get by on my pension. But this is a lot of money to me. I had earmarked it for a holiday when this pandemic is all over. I wanted to pay for my daughter to have a break. We can't now and I'm in my overdraft. Steve admits that he didn't read the terms and conditions of the sale when he allowed his daughter to initially spend Â£4.99 on his debit card. But he says he's amazed that in a game designed to be played by children it would even be possible to spend thousands of pounds across a thousand transactions over the course of just a few weeks. After being approached for comment by the BBC, the company said it would issue a refund. ""We strive to prevent unauthorized purchases, by taking measures such as not storing billing information, and work directly with parents to provide appropriate refunds whenever possible, which is the case in this instance,"" Roblox told the BBC. ""We encourage parents to review their payment settings on third-party services, such as Google Play, as they typically have an option to require a password for each purchase made and/or to prevent any information from being saved in browser settings that could allow them to be reused."" His bank HSBC said: ""We sympathise with Mr Cumming and appreciate these payments have come as a surprise to him. We have received a claim for a dispute for these payments and we will be taking a closer look at the circumstances surrounding this matter in accordance with Visa dispute regulations.""

"The easing of lockdown rules in England is the ""biggest step yet on the road to recovery"", the prime minister has said. Many businesses - including pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas - can reopen from Saturday. Boris Johnson said the public ""must not let them down"" by being complacent about social distancing, and he would ""not hesitate"" to reimpose restrictions if the number of Covid-19 cases rises. ""Targeted local"" measures would replace ""blanket national"" ones, he said. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, who spoke alongside Mr Johnson at Friday's Downing Street briefing, said no-one watching would think the easing was a risk-free step but that ""there is no perfect, exact way of doing it"". He also warned of the risk of coronavirus spreading in pubs. ""There's no doubt these are environments whose principal job it is to bring people together. That's a great thing to do socially, but it's also a great thing from the virus's point of view,"" he said. ""And therefore we do have to have a really clear and really disciplined approach to try and maintain social distancing whilst also enjoying pubs."" Council apologises for coronavirus pub tweet What are the new rules when pubs reopen? NI's hotels and bars reopen their doors 'We'll be cutting hair from midnight' Mr Johnson said: ""The success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly."" ""We must not let them down,"" he said, adding that he wanted people to ""enjoy summer safely"". Pubs have been told they must waituntil 06:00 BSTto reopen as a ""precaution"" to avoid midnight parties. And pub-goers are being encouraged to book tables in advance, while live gigs and standing at the bar will not be allowed. The 35,000 or so pubs and small bars trading in England have been closed since 20 March - a day when 645 positive coronavirus cases were announced. On Friday, 544 new coronavirus cases were announced, the lowest daily figure since 17 March - while there were 137 further deaths confirmed, taking the UK total past 44,000. As well as the easing of restrictions on the hospitality industry, social distancing rules will change from 2m to ""one metre plus"" - meaning you should take additional precautions when people are within less than 2m. The rule changes come days aftera local lockdown was put in place in Leicesterbecause of a spike in cases, with residents advised not to travel and businesses and schools remaining closed. Mr Johnson said ""good progress"" was being made towards the reopening of other businesses - such as gyms, nail salons and night clubs - and that a timetable will be set out next week. Outbreaks of coronavirus are inevitable. The virus is now at much lower levels, but it has not gone away and may never go away. Until we have a vaccine it will always pose a threat. We have already seen outbreaks in Leicester, Weston-super-Mare and Kirklees. Relaxing lockdown will make them more common. Remember, this is a virus that thrives on close contact - the more people we come into contact with, the more coronavirus will spread. It was true in March, when lockdown came in, and it is true now. However, outbreaks are not a massive problem as long as they can be contained. If they can be spotted and rapidly stopped then an outbreak may cause local disruption, but not ""National Lockdown Two"". This will be the challenge for NHS test and trace. However, some scientists are concerned lockdown is being lifted too quickly and that we are not yet able to stay on top of the virus. The danger is failing to stop an outbreak could lead to coronavirus spreading widely and cases surging. During the briefing, the prime minister laid out a five-step approach to tackling local outbreaks. This will involve authorities monitoring data, engaging with local agencies and carrying out testing. At the fourth stage, targeted restrictions, Mr Johnson said activities will be restricted ""at particular locations"" with ""individual premises"" made to close. The final stage would be a local lockdown, which he said would be ""carefully calibrated depending on the scientific circumstances of each outbreak"". This video can not be played England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty: ""Nobody believes this is a risk-free step"" Prof Whitty said the country would see both health and economic problems as a result of the pandemic and the government was trying to ""walk this narrow path"". ""What this is is an attempt to balance, as best we can, in a way that makes it possible for society to be as close as possible to normal, whilst living alongside this virus - which we will have to continue to do,"" he said. Englandâs quarantine-free list of places published Sturgeon attacks 'shambolic' air bridges decision Recreational cricket to resume - PM He added that there is a ""real possibility"" of a second wave - which ""goes up sharply"" if people do not take social distancing measures seriously. ""This possibility will exist with us for a very long time, so we have to prepare for that,"" he said. ""The best thing to do is to make that as unlikely as possible.""

"Cricket clubs in Wales have not been able to play since lockdown restrictions were introduced in March Recreational sport will be allowed to resume in Wales from Monday as lockdown restrictions continue to be eased. TheWelsh Government announced on Fridaythat outdoor team sports would be allowed to resume from 13 July. Previously only non-team outdoor sports - such as tennis and bowls - werepermitted below elite level. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the guidelines for the return of football, rugby and cricket would be issued by those sports' governing bodies. ""They [guidelines] allow low-contact sport, so football is okay,"" he said. ""A rugby scrum is a different matter. Coronavirus would be very happy indeed to see people doing that, so that will not be part of what we are reopening. ""The advice and the guidelines will come from the governing bodies of those sports."" No rugby union at any level has been played in Wales since coronavirus restrictions were introduced in March. While professional players have already returned to training, these are the first steps towards a resumption for those who play semi-professionally or recreationally. The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) said it would host a webinar on Monday with ""club operations managers representing rugby clubs throughout Wales"" to ""share how this update impacts on the phased 'Return to Rugby' plans previously shared with clubs"". WRU rugby operations manager Julie Paterson said: ""It is vital that we keep player welfare and the impact on public health at the heart of our planning. ""Rugby is a close-proximity sport, even with modified rules, so a considered, phased approach is vital. ""We are determined to be part of the solution to Covid-19 so we are looking at all measures that need to be in place to ensure that players are physically prepared to safely return to contact as and when social distancing is no longer mandated by government. ""We know from discussions with clubs that they are keen to get back to rugby as soon as it is safe to do so. ""Our role is to ensure that we issue clear guidelines to safeguard the game and the general public and make rugby facilities as robust as possible. ""We urge clubs to remain patient and to actively take part in the online meetings we have organised."" Following Friday's Welsh Government announcement, Cricket Wales chief executive Leshia Hawkins said: ""We are absolutely thrilled with the news, and as I know the cricket family in Wales will be. ""There has been an extraordinary amount of work by Cricket Wales staff and club and league volunteers behind the scenes over the last few months to get us to today. I must say a huge thank you to them. ""My team and I will now urgently work with colleagues at the England and Wales Cricket Board, to analyse the detail of the written guidance from Welsh Government on sport's return, when it is issued, and ensure that the guidance for cricket in Wales is signed off and published as soon as is possible."" On its website, Cricket Wales has published some of the""key adaptations"",externalfor recreational cricket's return, ""in conjunction with latest Welsh Government regulations and guidance"". The guidance includes a need for individuals involved to ""undergo a personal symptom check prior to matches and not take part if they demonstrate any Covid-19 symptoms"". It also stipulates ""players should socially distance - including not celebrating wickets with traditional high-fives"". And like international cricketers, such as England and the West Indies players who are currently playing the first Test of their series, recreational players have been told not to use saliva to shine the ball. Cricket Wales says ""full guidance will be issued as soon as possible"". Cricket clubs in Wales will hope to salvage part of the season even though most formal league competitions will not take place. Professional and elite team sportshave already been allowed to resume in Wales, providing safety protocols are followed. Glamorganreturned to part-time trainingearlier this month following confirmation of county cricket restarting on 1 August. The Football Association of Wales said it ""welcomed"" the resumption of team sports in Wales. ""The FAW and FAW Trust await the revised Welsh Government's coronavirus regulations, together with the Welsh Government's updated guidance, and will be working through the changes to translate this into easily understandable information to advise both clubs and individuals as soon as possible,"" read a statement.

"People are now allowed to travel to Wales' beaches and other beauty spots ""Stay local"" travel restrictions have been lifted in Wales, meaning people can travel to see friends and family or visit beauty spots for the first time since March. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said people will be able to ""travel as far as they like for all purposes"". Previously, the guidelines required people to stay within five miles of their home. But with many other restrictions for the hospitality and tourism sectors remaining in place, what does this mean for your plans to see loved ones or go on holiday? Lifting of Wales' travel limits to get final go-ahead No decision on Wales' overseas travel restrictions Coronavirus: What do the stats tell us in Wales? Bookings can be made to stay in self-contained holiday accommodation in Wales for dates from 11 July, two days ahead of what was previously announced. This video can not be played What do eased travel restrictions mean for me? Self-contained refers to accommodation without any shared facilities, so includes caravans and motorhomes if they have their own toilets. But it is also dependent onscientific and medical adviceat the time. No announcement has been made for holiday accommodation with shared facilities. However, hotels, B&Bs and hostels that can provide en-suite rooms and provide room service meals can open from 11 July. The same goes for boats and some glamping accommodation with their own kitchens and bathrooms that no other guests use. Conwy Castle is a key tourist attraction in north Wales Only if you are forming an""extended household"". Extended households allow people to have physical contact, exercise, cook and eat together, and also stay overnight in each other's homes. People can only be in one extended household, which cannot be changed once arranged. Anyone living inhouses of multiple occupation (HMOs)is allowed to form their own extended households separate from their housemates. The phased reopening of pubs will start on Monday 13 July starting with outdoor spaces owned by the business and subject to existing licences. It is dependent on coronavirus conditions continuing ""to be favourable"". The reopening of indoor services will be considered later, depending on the success of outdoor opening. Folly Farm in Pembrokeshire is one of Wales' most visited tourist attractions Outdoor visitor attractions, including zoos, theme parks and country parks, are now allowed to reopen. But the Welsh Government has stressed that the rules on social distancing and hand hygiene remain in place and will have to be followed. Ministers have said a decision on reopening indoor attractions would be considered at the next review of the regulations on Thursday 9 July. Yes.  People can now ""travel as far as they like for all purposes"". In England a number of businesses - including restaurants, pubs, hairdressers and cinemas - have been allowed to open their doors. Yes. Yes. Cardiff Airport has officially reopened to passengers, saying airlines will ""slowly restart flying passenger services, increasing in August"". The airport remained open throughout the lockdown to support essential flying, including critical cargo and medical flights. Transport Minister Ken Skates has said it was forpeople to take ""individual responsibility""when considering whether they should fly. Yes.People in England can now travel to some European countrieswithout having to spend 14 days in quarantine on their return, but no decision has been made on this in Wales. The Foreign Office has alsochanged its advice against all but essential travel to a number of countries. Speaking at Friday's daily briefing, Mark Drakeford said he wanted to allow the scheme to operate in Wales but it had been""impossible"" to get a ""sensible answer""on how UK ministers intended to make the changes.

"Spain is among the countries which can be visited without having to quarantine for 14 days on your return A full list of countries for which quarantine will not apply to people arriving back in England has been published. Countries including Greece, Spain, France and Belgium areon the list,external, which comes into effect from 10 July. But countries such as China, US, Sweden and Portugal are not, meaning arrivals from those have to isolate for 14 days. Scotland and Wales are yet to decide whether to ease travel restrictions and described the changes as ""shambolic"". The quarantine rules will also remain in place in Northern Ireland for visitors arriving from outside of the UK and Republic of Ireland. Where can I go on holiday? A guide to destinations The countries you can visit The restrictions came into place in early June in a bid to stop coronavirus entering the country as the number of cases was falling. Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Instead of quarantining arrivals from the whole world, we will only quarantine arrivals from those countries where the virus is sadly not under control."" People travelling from the 59 places and 14 British overseas territorieson the listwill not have to quarantine on arrival in England unless they have travelled through a place which is not exempt. Passengers will still be required to provide contact information on arrival in England. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) Some of those on the list include popular short-haul destinations such as Turkey and Cyprus, as well as long-haul locations including Australia, Barbados, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand and Vietnam. However, some countries will require visitors to isolate on arrival or will bar them from entering at all, such as New Zealand. The Foreign Office is expected to update its travel guidance on Saturday, including naming which countries will have a reciprocal arrangement with the UK and not require British visitors to quarantine on arrival. What quarantine lifting means to passengers 'Refunds unlikely' if travellers have to self-isolate How is lockdown being lifted across Europe? A list of countries which will be exempt from the Foreign Office's advice against ""all but essential travel"" from Saturdayhas also been published,external. The advice has been lifted for Portugal but only for the Azores and Madeira. Portugal's Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""We are very disappointed with the decision of the British authorities. We think it is senseless and unfair. ""It is quite absurd the UK has seven times more cases of Covid-19 than Portugal so we think this is not the way in which allies and friends are treated."" His prime minister, AntÃ³nio Costa,tweeted,externalcomparing the UK's number of coronavirus cases with that of the Algarve, a popular holiday destination, saying: ""You are welcome to spend a safe holiday in the Algarve."" The government said information for travel into Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be published in due course by the devolved administrations. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said finalising the list of countries had been delayed -after scrapping the quarantine was announced last week- in the hope that the four UK nations could reach a joint decision. He said there was ""still an opportunity"" for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to co-ordinate and therefore make the changes more simple. But the first ministers of both Scotland and Wales have criticised the government, with Nicola Sturgeon saying Scotland could not be dragged along by the UK government's""shambolic decision making"". Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said the approachhad been ""utterly shambolic"". However, he added it was likely the Welsh government would impose the same measures as in England, provided the chief medical officer for Wales gave approval. Mr Johnson said in a televised coronavirus briefing from Downing Street that the nations of the UK were following ""very similar paths but at different speeds"". Asked if a family from Scotland could drive to England and fly out and back from an overseas country to get around different quarantine rules the prime minister said that while he knew the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales had a ""slightly different take"" on it the ""convoy is very much going in the same direction"". ""I'm sure we'll get there together and common sense will apply."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? The introduction of the quarantine on 8 June was met with criticism from the travel, tourism and hospitality industries and the easing of restrictions on arrivals from some countries has been welcomed. A statement on behalf of airlines Ryanair, easyJet and British Airways said the move to quarantine people had been ""irrational"" and had seriously damaged the economy and industry. It added the carriers wanted clarification on how countries included on the lists were selected. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airline UK, said the lists gave ""a clear path to opening further predominantly long-haul destinations in the weeks ahead"". TUI UK and Ireland managing director Andrew Flintham said the company was pleased the government had confirmed ""summer holidays are saved"" and said it was a ""significant step forward"" for the industry. The chief executive of Booking Holdings, which owns the brands Booking.com and Kayak.com, called for a coordinated effort from governments around the world to set out principles as to why someone can travel from one country to another. Glenn Fogel told BBC World News current measures were ""totally chaotic"" but he welcomed England's announcement saying the UK is ""an important part of the global tourism industry"". VisitBritain director Patricia Yates said the lifting of travel restrictions for some of the ""largest and most valuable visitor markets"" was a ""timely boost"" for the industry. Pilots union, the British Airline Pilots Association, said it was an important first step and said it was working with authorities to make sure the return to operations would be safe for pilots, passengers and crew. An Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) spokeswoman said there was likely to be a strong demand for holidays and it was important people considered how this might affect their plans. ""It is especially important that customers also check the latest Foreign Office travel advice before booking, to establish if there are entry restrictions or self-isolation procedures on arrival, or any other measures they need to comply with, in the destination they are planning to visit,"" she said. A High Court challenge by British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair against the government's 14-day quarantine is set to be withdrawn, their barrister Tom Hickman QC said.

"People seen repeatedly breaking the Leicester lockdown could be fined up to Â£3,200 Legislation ensuring Leicester's local lockdown can be enforced by law has been rushed through Parliament. The new regulations come into force on Saturday, as the rest of the country begins to see an easing of lockdown. People or businesses that repeatedly flout the new law could receive fines of up to Â£3,200. Limits on social gatherings and a ban on the reopening of hotels, pubs and restaurants are all included in the new legislation. Leicester became subject to the UK's first local lockdown on Monday following a spike in Covid-19 cases. Police have said theyare bracing themselves for a busy weekendas pubs stay closed in Leicester but reopen across the country, with more officers on duty than during a typical New Year's Eve. Officers would be policing the stricter lockdown measures as well as overseeing the relaxation of rules outside of the restricted zone. Hospital bosses in the city also said they were preparing for ""typical behaviours of New Year's Eve"". People in Leicester have been told to stay at home since Monday The regulations for the city were passed as a new statutory instrumenteasing lockdown for the rest of the countrycame into force on Friday. People in Leicester who live on their own, or single parents, can still form a social bubble with one other household, the legislation says.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Sturgeon brands air bridge process 'shambolic' The UK government's decision-making on air bridges has been ""shambolic"", Scotland's first minister has claimed. Nicola Sturgeon criticised the speed at which Westminster expected Scottish ministers to make a decision on lifting quarantine on overseas visitors. But she said the Scottish government was ""very likely"" to agree to relaxing restrictions for people arriving in Scotland from ""low risk"" countries. She said it needed to carefully scrutinise ""medium risk"" countries. Under the UK government's plan, from 10 July people arriving in England from 50 countries including Spain, Italy and France will no longer have to isolate for 14 days. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have not yet agreed to the proposals, with Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford saying it had been""impossible"" to get a ""sensible answer""on how UK ministers intended to make the changes. Englandâs quarantine-free list of places published Drakeford: 'Impossible to get sensible answer on air bridges' Where can I fly to from Scotland's airports? LIVE: Updates on coronavirus in Scotland Downing Street has said devolved governments should ""make and explain their own decisions"" on requirements for people to quarantine when returning from abroad. Meanwhile, the boss of two of Scotland's leading airports has warned that failure to adopt a four nations approach will put further jobs at risk. And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce called on the Scottish government to ""align with a UK-wide approach as a matter of urgency"" to help protect the economy. The business organisation added: ""Politics must be put to one side by all in order to give Scottish businesses the ability to drive up demand and do what they do best, making Scotland the best place to invest and do business.'' The quarantine rules are due to be relaxed in England - but not Scotland At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had to make ""difficult and complex"" decisions on the issue - but the UK government's position kept changing. The list of countries that Westminster asked Scotland to sign up to on Thursday was different to that announced on Friday, she added. ""When so much is at stake as it is right now we can't allow ourselves to be dragged along in the wake of, to be quite frank about it, another government's shambolic decision process,"" she said. ""We want to welcome visitors again from around the world and we also want to allow our own citizens to travel. ""We also want, if possible for obvious practical reasons, to have alignment on these matters with the rest of the UK."" She said she hoped a decision could be made ""quickly"". The Scottish government has assessed the prevalence of coronavirus in Scotland as five times lower than it is in England, the first minister added. About 50 countries are expected to be on the list of ""air-bridges"" Asked about Nicola Sturgeon's criticism of the UK government, the prime minister's spokesman said that ""the changes we're making now are cautious and will allow people to travel to an exempt country without the need to self isolate on their return."" ""It is for devolved administrations to make and explain their own decisions around the measures that they are putting in place,"" he said. ""We have been working with all devolved administrations on quarantine from the outset and we continue to do so,"" he said. Earlier, Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had been given 30 minutes to look at a list of countries under consideration for ""air bridges"" before being asked to make a decision on Wednesday night. He toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethe Scottish government wanted to take a ""four nations"" approach and he asked for more time consider the issue. UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps said there was still time for the devolved nations to join the plans. ""Remember this isn't changing until the 10 July so there's still an opportunity for them to do that and they may well,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we see countries come on board. ""I very much hope we can do this as four nations at the same time I think that would very much simplify it for people but they will need to make that decision themselves."" Meanwhile, Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports - which owns Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports - said regional variations will endanger livelihoods. He added: ""Having a piecemeal approach will compound the devastating impact the blanket quarantine measures have had on our aviation, tourism and hospitality sectors. ""People are rightly concerned for their health, however, they're also fearful for their jobs.

"Pubs in England have been closed since March to slow the spread of Covid-19 A council has apologised for telling people that coronavirus will be ""waiting for you"" at the pub when they reopen this weekend. Sheffield City Council said Covid-19 would be ""happiest"" about rule changes which come into force on Saturday. A number of landlords responded angrily to the social media post, which has since been deleted. The council said the post was ""badly worded but was done with the best intentions"". On Thursday, the council tweeted: ""The virus loves crowded places and thrives on close contact. ""It won't be queuing to get inside the pub - it will already be there waiting for you."" The post also included a short video warning people: ""Don't put yourself at risk for the sake of a pint."" The post has since been deleted John Harrison, co-owner of the Beer House, said: ""I was shocked to see the tweet after we'd spent weeks working tirelessly to make sure our business is a safe environment, going above and beyond the government guidelines. ""It felt like a real kick in the gut for the hospitality industry in Sheffield that is on its knees."" Liz Aspden, landlady at The Harlequin, said the tweet was ""very damaging to a trade which is just trying to get back on its feet and made no recognition of the fact that we'll be doing our utmost to create a safe environment"".

"Jean Castex (L) from the centre right replaces Edouard Philippe as part of the president's reshuffle French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has tendered his resignation after heading President Emmanuel Macron's government for three years. The president swiftly named centre-right mayor Jean Castex to lead a new team of ministers after a reshuffle. Although Mr Philippe was considered more popular than the president, the ruling party had poor local election results at the weekend. President Macron promised a ""new path"" in an interview published on Friday. Mr Philippe met the president early in the morning and they agreed the government would resign. A reshuffle has been expected for some time, and it is common practice for a French president to replace a prime minister during the five-year term in office known as the ""quinquennat"". The ElysÃ©e palace said in a statement that Mr Philippe had ""today handed in the government's resignation to the president of the republic, who accepted it"", adding that he would stay in place until a new government was appointed. Hours after Mr Philippe's resignation, it was announced that the Law Court of the Republic, which deals with claims of ministerial misconduct, would open an inquiry into the way his government handled the pandemic. Along with the outgoing prime minister, those under investigation include AgnÃ¨s Buzyn, who stepped down as health minister in February, and her successor Olivier VÃ©ran, senior public prosecutor FranÃ§ois Molin said. France has reported 202,673 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 29,875 deaths. Mr Castex, 55, is little known in France, but he is a senior civil servant and has played a key role in the government's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. He has picked up the nickname ""Mr Deconfinement"", after Mr Philippe chose the Republicans party mayor from Prades in the Pyrenees to co-ordinate France's strategy of lifting the lockdown. He attended the same elite university as Mr Macron and Mr Philippe and, like Mr Philippe, was previously a member of the right-wing Republicans party. On Friday evening, Mr Castex warned in a speech that ""the health crisis is, unfortunately, not over"" and that ""the economic and social crisis is already here"". ""Priorities will therefore have to evolve, ways of working will have to be adapted. We will have to unite the nation to fight this crisis that is setting in,"" he added. Mr Macron came to power three years ago but now faces an economic crisis after the coronavirus pandemic. In the interview with regional newspapers, he spoke of a ""very tough"" recovery for France, and focused on the immediate priority of saving jobs, as well as economic, social and environmental reconstruction. Greens score gains in French local election Macron loses majority as defectors form new party Mr Philippe's future as prime minister had been in doubt for several weeks and he will now take up the post of mayor in Le Havre, after winning the local vote on Sunday. A removal van and cardboard boxes were seen arriving at his Matignon residence on Friday indicating he was preparing to move out. Allow Twitter content?

Amid the chaos of coronavirus, President Macron talked of ""reinvention"" and a ""new path"". Few here doubted that it would mean a new government. Edouard Philippe was a good fit for Mr Macron during this crisis: a technocrat from the centre right who was seen as a steady pair of hands during the coronavirus epidemic, but he had started to outshine the president - a dangerous place to be at any time, let alone a time that calls for change. Mr Macron is facing a complex set of demands. On one hand, he wants to ""reinvent"" himself for the last two years of his mandate, and has been projecting a softer version of himself; more open to listening and admitting mistakes, more focused on green issues and social justice. President Macron and Mr Philippe have worked together in government for the past three years On the other hand, centre-right votes are likely to be key to any re-election bid and, after several years of pushing hard for his liberal economic reforms, a blatant change of tack at this stage could look less like reinvention and more like confusion. Having already promised massive investment in France's health service, committed to pursuing pension reforms - at least in some form, and facing the worst recession in France since World War Two, Mr Macron needs someone he can rely on, someone who can take the flak if needed. That's what prime ministers are meant to do. Edouard Philippe broke the rules. As he heads towards the next presidential race, Mr Macron won't want to be outshone again. ""For three years he's been by my side... we've carried out important, historic reform often in very difficult circumstances. We have a relationship of trust that's in a way unique in terms of the French Republic,"" the president said of Mr Philippe in his newspaper interview. Under France's constitution,the prime minister is appointed by the president,externalto run the government and co-ordinate its actions under policies set out by the head of state. The new prime minister may be relatively unknown but he has plenty of experience in national government. Seen as a social conservative in the Republicans party, he was part of President Nicolas Sarkozy's team at the ElysÃ©e palace and served as deputy to the health minister. Mr Macron's young LREM party has struggled to maintain the initial support it won from voters after his presidential victory in 2017. Dogged by ministerial resignations, it has also seen a number of defections in the National Assembly, losing its outright majority in May. The party failed to win any major city in Sunday's local elections, in which Green candidates and their left-wing allies made significant gains. An opinion poll for Le Figaro and France Info on Thursday suggested three quarters of French voters were looking for political change from the president. Although many of those surveyed wanted greater focus on social and environmental change, 59% were happy for Mr Philippe to stay in his job.

"A number of supermarkets have removed some coconut water and oil from their shelves after it emerged the products were made with fruit picked by monkeys. The monkeys are snatched from the wild and trained to pick up to 1,000 coconuts a day, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said. The animal rights group said pigtailed macaques in Thailand were treated like ""coconut-picking machines"". In response Waitrose, Ocado, Co-op and Boots vowed to stop selling some goods. Meanwhile, Morrisons said it had already removed products made with monkey-picked coconuts from its shelves. In a statement, Waitrose said: ""As part of our animal welfare policy, we have committed to never knowingly sell any products sourced from monkey labour."" Co-op said: ""As an ethical retailer, we do not permit the use of monkey labour to source ingredients for our products."" Woman hatches ducks from Waitrose eggs Calls to shut down 'dirty fur trade' In a tweet earlier on Friday, the prime minister's fiancÃ©e Carrie Symonds, a conservationist, called on all supermarkets to boycott the products. Sainsbury's subsequently told the BBC: ""We are actively reviewing our ranges and investigating this complex issue with our suppliers."" Asda said: ""We expect our suppliers to uphold the highest production standards at all times and we will not tolerate any forms of animal abuse in our supply chain."" It pledged to remove certain brands from its shelves until it has investigated the allegations of cruelty. Ms Symonds later took to Twitter again to urge Tesco to make a similar pledge: ""Come on @Tesco! Over to you! Please stop selling these products too,"" she wrote. A Tesco spokesperson told the BBC: ""Our own-brand coconut milk and coconut water does not use monkey labour in its production and we don't sell any of the branded products identified by Peta. ""We don't tolerate these practices and would remove any product from sale that is known to have used monkey labour during its production."" Peta said it had found eight farms in Thailand where monkeys were forced to pick coconuts for export around the world. Male monkeys are able to pick up to 1,000 coconuts a day, Peta says. It's thought that a human can pick about 80. It said it also discovered ""monkey schools"", where the animals were trained to pick fruit, as well as ride bikes or play basketball for the entertainment of tourists. ""The animals at these facilities - many of whom are illegally captured as babies - displayed stereotypic behaviour indicative of extreme stress,"" Peta said. ""Monkeys were chained to old tyres or confined to cages that were barely large enough for them to turn around in."" ""One monkey in a cage on a lorry bed was seen frantically shaking the cage bars in a futile attempt to escape, and a screaming monkey on a rope desperately tried to run away from a handler."" In one case, the organisation was told that monkeys would have their canine teeth pulled out if they tried to bite handlers. ""These curious, highly intelligent animals are denied psychological stimulation, companionship, freedom, and everything else that would make their lives worth living, all so that they can be used to gather coconuts,"" said Peta director Elisa Allen. ""Peta is calling on decent people never to support the use of monkey labour by shunning coconut products from Thailand.""

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Sturgeon brands air bridge process 'shambolic' The UK government's decision-making on air bridges has been ""shambolic"", Scotland's first minister has claimed. Nicola Sturgeon criticised the speed at which Westminster expected Scottish ministers to make a decision on lifting quarantine on overseas visitors. But she said the Scottish government was ""very likely"" to agree to relaxing restrictions for people arriving in Scotland from ""low risk"" countries. She said it needed to carefully scrutinise ""medium risk"" countries. Under the UK government's plan, from 10 July people arriving in England from 50 countries including Spain, Italy and France will no longer have to isolate for 14 days. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have not yet agreed to the proposals, with Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford saying it had been""impossible"" to get a ""sensible answer""on how UK ministers intended to make the changes. Englandâs quarantine-free list of places published Drakeford: 'Impossible to get sensible answer on air bridges' Where can I fly to from Scotland's airports? LIVE: Updates on coronavirus in Scotland Downing Street has said devolved governments should ""make and explain their own decisions"" on requirements for people to quarantine when returning from abroad. Meanwhile, the boss of two of Scotland's leading airports has warned that failure to adopt a four nations approach will put further jobs at risk. And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce called on the Scottish government to ""align with a UK-wide approach as a matter of urgency"" to help protect the economy. The business organisation added: ""Politics must be put to one side by all in order to give Scottish businesses the ability to drive up demand and do what they do best, making Scotland the best place to invest and do business.'' The quarantine rules are due to be relaxed in England - but not Scotland At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had to make ""difficult and complex"" decisions on the issue - but the UK government's position kept changing. The list of countries that Westminster asked Scotland to sign up to on Thursday was different to that announced on Friday, she added. ""When so much is at stake as it is right now we can't allow ourselves to be dragged along in the wake of, to be quite frank about it, another government's shambolic decision process,"" she said. ""We want to welcome visitors again from around the world and we also want to allow our own citizens to travel. ""We also want, if possible for obvious practical reasons, to have alignment on these matters with the rest of the UK."" She said she hoped a decision could be made ""quickly"". The Scottish government has assessed the prevalence of coronavirus in Scotland as five times lower than it is in England, the first minister added. About 50 countries are expected to be on the list of ""air-bridges"" Asked about Nicola Sturgeon's criticism of the UK government, the prime minister's spokesman said that ""the changes we're making now are cautious and will allow people to travel to an exempt country without the need to self isolate on their return."" ""It is for devolved administrations to make and explain their own decisions around the measures that they are putting in place,"" he said. ""We have been working with all devolved administrations on quarantine from the outset and we continue to do so,"" he said. Earlier, Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had been given 30 minutes to look at a list of countries under consideration for ""air bridges"" before being asked to make a decision on Wednesday night. He toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethe Scottish government wanted to take a ""four nations"" approach and he asked for more time consider the issue. UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps said there was still time for the devolved nations to join the plans. ""Remember this isn't changing until the 10 July so there's still an opportunity for them to do that and they may well,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we see countries come on board. ""I very much hope we can do this as four nations at the same time I think that would very much simplify it for people but they will need to make that decision themselves."" Meanwhile, Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports - which owns Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports - said regional variations will endanger livelihoods. He added: ""Having a piecemeal approach will compound the devastating impact the blanket quarantine measures have had on our aviation, tourism and hospitality sectors. ""People are rightly concerned for their health, however, they're also fearful for their jobs.

"That's a wrap: The National Theatre in London Empty theatre buildings nationwide have been covered in colourful messages of support, as they remain closed due to Covid-19 concerns. The National Theatre in London has been wrapped in bright pink barrier tape, which reads ""Missing Live Theatre"". The project, led by stage designers group Scene Change, also includes the Manchester Royal Exchange and Royal Lyceum Theatre Edinburgh. As well as the Lyric Belfast, the Sherman Theatre in Cardiff and Theatre Royale Plymouth. Venues have been shut since March, with many warning that they will go out of business in the coming months without support. The art intervention was unveiled on the same day that the National Theatre confirmed  400 casual staff will soon lose their jobs. ""We have committed to paying our casual staff until the end of August, but very sadly due to the changes in the government Job Retention Scheme, we simply cannot afford to offer financial support beyond that point, when we won't be back performing as usual,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. She added they hoped ""additional financial support from government may be forthcoming"" to allow performing again ""in a limited way"" but said ""it is set to be many months before it will be possible to perform to audiences at usual capacities, so regrettably a proportion of job losses are unavoidable"". Speaking to BBC News on Friday, Oscar-winning actor, writer and theatre director Sir Mark Rylance warned that 70% of venues could be closed by Christmas, meaning 290,000 jobs in the sector are at risk, with redundancies being made already. Sir Mark, who also revealed he will reprise his role in Jerusalem next year at some point, stressed that theatres can't go back to usual, and they are going to have to change how they operate and what stories they tell in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. ""They are devastatingly badly affected,"" said Rylance. ""We have discovered that what the pandemic has brought to the surface too, is that 70% of the workers in theatre are freelance,"" he added. ""They've not benefitted from any furlough scheme or any of the job retention schemes that the buildings and the permanent staff have benefitted from, so people are really in trouble, and they're going to be in more trouble in August and September."" Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester A close-up of the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester Lyric in Belfast In a statement, Scene Change declared: ""This is a moment of reset in our industry and we believe the design community can be an essential part of the transformation that will see theatre buildings being reopened and the ways in which theatre can be reimagined,"" ""As shapers of theatrical space through the use of people and place, our work is pivotal in connecting an entire ecosystem within the theatre industry. We are ideally positioned to be at the heart of any discussions about how theatre operates in the future."" Lyceum in Edinburgh Theatre Royale Plymouth Sherman Theatre in Cardiff The tapes will stay up for a week and then be taken to envelop other theatres. Venues throughout London's West End will join in on Saturday, while The RSC, Sadler's Wells, Theatr Clwyd and Theatre Royal Stratford East will take part the following week, along with Sheffield Theatres, and the Ambassador Theatre Group. Tom Piper, one of the team behind the campaign, told the BBC's Colin Paterson the design was ""inspired by the fact that the National Theatre was sort of wrapped with hazard warning tape it looked like a toxic sort of waste site"". ""And we know that theatres are not toxic places, they are places of great healing, where people will come together with a sense of community and that's what we're all missing at the moment,"" added Piper, who also who helped create the2014 sea of ceramic poppies outside the Tower of London. He encouraged people to go along and see the outdoor ""guerrilla"" artwork for themselves, from a safe distance. ""It's a gesture of love for these buildings really and to highlight that they're empty, they need to be full of people,"" he said.

"Corinna Baker-Sinclair says Sykes should have acted earlier Ryanair will clear 90% of its backlog of cash refunds by the end of July for people who were unable to travel during lockdown. It was heavily criticised, along with other airlines, for its failure to pay those entitled to a refund anytime close to the seven-day legal deadline. Ryanair said it had made ""significant progress"" in clearing the backlog for those booked with the airline directly. Meanwhile, Sykes Cottages has also vowed to offer refunds. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that, until recently, the holiday lettings firm had been refusing to provide full cash refunds to all customers whose break had to be cancelled due to coronavirus restrictions. It had faced a backlash from customersunhappy with their treatmentregarding holidays booked during lockdown too. The airline sector has been severely hit by the coronavirus crisis Airline passengers who have had flights cancelled have the right to rebook, accept a voucher for future travel, or receive a refund. Ryanair customers complained that the airline hadmade it difficult to claim the refund option, and the airline later said it had faced unprecedented demand from travellers wanting their money back. Now it has said extra staff were trained to clear the backlog, and that it was processing refunds ""as fast as we can"". ""We are pleased to have made such significant progress over the month of June in eliminating the backlog of cash refunds due to the Covid-19 flight cancellations,"" said Ryanair's chief executive Eddie Wilson. ""Over 90% of passengers who booked directly with Ryanair and who requested a cash refund for travel between March and June will receive their refunds before the end of July."" If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines will be struggling to meet that deadline. You can accept, or refuse, vouchers or a rebooking but a voucher will probably be invalid if the airline later goes bust If you decide against going on a future flight, which is not yet cancelled, then there is no right to a refund. Different airlines have different rules over what you can do, but many are waiving any charges for changing to a later flight or having a voucher instead. Your travel insurance is unlikely to cover you If you have a package holiday cancelled by the provider, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days Holiday lettings firm Sykes Cottages has changed its policy in recent days and has now given a formal undertaking to the CMA to refund customers whose holidays could not go ahead, and to convert credit vouchers to cash, assuming the voucher has not been used. If the company had not changed its policy, the watchdog said it could have launched court proceedings against it. The commitments apply to several businesses and brands owned by Sykes, including the Pure Cottages Group and Carbis Bay Holidays, as well as Sykes Cottages itself. Corinna Baker-Sinclair, from Winsford in Cheshire, was one of those seeking a refund. ""I was really pleased. I was glad that I was getting my money back, but also by the same token it's been such a long, stressful time,"" she told BBC Radio 4'sYou and Yours programme. ""I had absolute sympathy for all companies who found themselves in a terrible situation, however I just feel that Sykes handled the response just so badly."" Graham Donoghue, chief executive of Sykes Holiday Cottages, said: ""The last few months have been some of the most stressful for UK holidaymakers and most challenging for the sector's agents and operators. ""While the majority of customers with bookings starting during the current lockdown period have successfully rearranged their holiday to a later date, we recognise that not all those have been able to or wanted to. Throughout June, more than 5,000 customers have received a full refund.

"People seen repeatedly breaking the Leicester lockdown could be fined up to Â£3,200 Legislation ensuring Leicester's local lockdown can be enforced by law has been rushed through Parliament. The new regulations come into force on Saturday, as the rest of the country begins to see an easing of lockdown. People or businesses that repeatedly flout the new law could receive fines of up to Â£3,200. Limits on social gatherings and a ban on the reopening of hotels, pubs and restaurants are all included in the new legislation. Leicester became subject to the UK's first local lockdown on Monday following a spike in Covid-19 cases.

"Artwork: The government wants OneWeb to run a sat-nav service as well as deliver broadband The UK is spending $500m (Â£400m) on a stake in failed satellite firm OneWeb as part of a plan to replace use of the EU's Galileo sat-nav system. OneWeb went bankrupt in March while trying to build a spacecraft network to deliver broadband. The UK is part of a consortium with India's Bharti Global which won a bidding war for the company. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said it would help deliver the ""first UK sovereign space capability"". UK starts work on buying own sat-nav system Could the world cope if GPS stopped working? UK industry loses out in European satellite bids In a statement, Mr Sharma said: ""This deal underlines the scale of Britain's ambitions on the global stage. ""Our access to a global fleet of satellites has the potential to connect millions of people worldwide to broadband, many for the first time, and the deal presents the opportunity to further develop our strong advanced manufacturing base right here in the UK."" The consortium involving the UK government was the highest bidder in an auction for the bankrupt company. Matters will be clarified on 10 July, when the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York rules on the sale. If the Bharti Global-led option goes through, the UK government will own an equity stake of 45% in the new operation. The UK government sees satellites as a way to meet commitments on the roll-out of super-fast broadband and believes OneWeb's constellation could also deliver a precise Positioning, Navigation and Timing service, also known as sat-nav. The latter has become a political imperative for No 10 since losing membership of Europe's Galileo satellite-navigation system on departure from the EU in January. Although Galileo's free and open signals remain accessible to the UK, its more secure signals, known as PRS, intended for military and government agency use, are only available to member states. UK ministers want to replace this capacity with a home-grown system. While exceptionally good news for the staff of OneWeb, the decision of the UK government to get involved in the company has raised eyebrows in the wider space sector. Some of the more established actors have questioned the financial viability of the broadband mega-constellation projects. SpaceX is building an even bigger network and Amazon has long talked about rolling out its own version. These are extremely expensive endeavours involving multiple rocket launches - and it's an ongoing commitment. The satellites need to be refreshed, to replace ageing and failed units, but also to take advantage of new technological developments. Such big investments make OneWeb a major gamble for taxpayers, detractors argue. The $500m (Â£400m), they believe, could be spent more fruitfully if spread across a wider set of less risky British space projects. The interesting angle, of course, is the idea that OneWeb's network could also double as a satellite-navigation service. It's not impossible technically, but it is challenging. The UK's Satellite Applications Catapult is preparing a white paper to illustrate one potential way of using the initial OneWeb constellation to deliver precise timing for use in the country's power, telecoms and finance industries. But experts warn that a bumpy road lies ahead on the issue of the frequencies used to transmit Positioning, Navigation and Timing signals - one that will require international agreement. OneWeb, which has its HQ in west London and parallel operations in Virginia, US, had initially raised $3.2bn (Â£2.6bn) of investment to build its mega-constellation. Seventy-four satellites in an initial network of 648 had been launched when the company announced recourse to bankruptcy protection, blaming the Covid crisis for the inability to raise additional financial support. Most experts believe a further $3bn at least is needed to bring the full constellation into use. Assuming there are no regulatory blockages put in the path of the consortium plan, OneWeb should soon be able to start pulling back staff who were laid off, and to resume the manufacture and launch of its satellites. The spacecraft are currently made in Florida in a partnership with European aerospace giant Airbus. OneWeb is headquartered in a former BBC building in west London There has been talk of this production, or at least some of it, being moved to Britain in future as part of the new arrangements Adrian Steckel, CEO of OneWeb, said: ""We are delighted to have concluded the sale process with such a positive outcome that will benefit not only OneWeb's existing creditors, but also our employees, vendors, commercial partners, and supporters worldwide who believe in the mission and in the promise of global connectivity."" Airbus in the UK welcomed the outcome of the auction. Managing Director Richard Franklin said: ""The UK government's vision in backing this project will drive innovation and new ways of thinking about how space can contribute even more to the UK economy, and the country's defence requirements, as well as playing a part in delivering broadband internet to communities across the country.

"Artwork: The government wants OneWeb to run a sat-nav service as well as deliver broadband The UK is spending $500m (Â£400m) on a stake in failed satellite firm OneWeb as part of a plan to replace use of the EU's Galileo sat-nav system. OneWeb went bankrupt in March while trying to build a spacecraft network to deliver broadband. The UK is part of a consortium with India's Bharti Global which won a bidding war for the company. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said it would help deliver the ""first UK sovereign space capability"". UK starts work on buying own sat-nav system Could the world cope if GPS stopped working? UK industry loses out in European satellite bids In a statement, Mr Sharma said: ""This deal underlines the scale of Britain's ambitions on the global stage. ""Our access to a global fleet of satellites has the potential to connect millions of people worldwide to broadband, many for the first time, and the deal presents the opportunity to further develop our strong advanced manufacturing base right here in the UK."" The consortium involving the UK government was the highest bidder in an auction for the bankrupt company. Matters will be clarified on 10 July, when the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York rules on the sale. If the Bharti Global-led option goes through, the UK government will own an equity stake of 45% in the new operation. The UK government sees satellites as a way to meet commitments on the roll-out of super-fast broadband and believes OneWeb's constellation could also deliver a precise Positioning, Navigation and Timing service, also known as sat-nav. The latter has become a political imperative for No 10 since losing membership of Europe's Galileo satellite-navigation system on departure from the EU in January. Although Galileo's free and open signals remain accessible to the UK, its more secure signals, known as PRS, intended for military and government agency use, are only available to member states. UK ministers want to replace this capacity with a home-grown system. While exceptionally good news for the staff of OneWeb, the decision of the UK government to get involved in the company has raised eyebrows in the wider space sector. Some of the more established actors have questioned the financial viability of the broadband mega-constellation projects. SpaceX is building an even bigger network and Amazon has long talked about rolling out its own version. These are extremely expensive endeavours involving multiple rocket launches - and it's an ongoing commitment. The satellites need to be refreshed, to replace ageing and failed units, but also to take advantage of new technological developments. Such big investments make OneWeb a major gamble for taxpayers, detractors argue. The $500m (Â£400m), they believe, could be spent more fruitfully if spread across a wider set of less risky British space projects. The interesting angle, of course, is the idea that OneWeb's network could also double as a satellite-navigation service. It's not impossible technically, but it is challenging. The UK's Satellite Applications Catapult is preparing a white paper to illustrate one potential way of using the initial OneWeb constellation to deliver precise timing for use in the country's power, telecoms and finance industries. But experts warn that a bumpy road lies ahead on the issue of the frequencies used to transmit Positioning, Navigation and Timing signals - one that will require international agreement. OneWeb, which has its HQ in west London and parallel operations in Virginia, US, had initially raised $3.2bn (Â£2.6bn) of investment to build its mega-constellation. Seventy-four satellites in an initial network of 648 had been launched when the company announced recourse to bankruptcy protection, blaming the Covid crisis for the inability to raise additional financial support. Most experts believe a further $3bn at least is needed to bring the full constellation into use. Assuming there are no regulatory blockages put in the path of the consortium plan, OneWeb should soon be able to start pulling back staff who were laid off, and to resume the manufacture and launch of its satellites. The spacecraft are currently made in Florida in a partnership with European aerospace giant Airbus. OneWeb is headquartered in a former BBC building in west London There has been talk of this production, or at least some of it, being moved to Britain in future as part of the new arrangements Adrian Steckel, CEO of OneWeb, said: ""We are delighted to have concluded the sale process with such a positive outcome that will benefit not only OneWeb's existing creditors, but also our employees, vendors, commercial partners, and supporters worldwide who believe in the mission and in the promise of global connectivity."" Airbus in the UK welcomed the outcome of the auction. Managing Director Richard Franklin said: ""The UK government's vision in backing this project will drive innovation and new ways of thinking about how space can contribute even more to the UK economy, and the country's defence requirements, as well as playing a part in delivering broadband internet to communities across the country.

"The easing of lockdown rules in England is the ""biggest step yet on the road to recovery"", the prime minister has said. Many businesses - including pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas - can reopen from Saturday. Boris Johnson said the public ""must not let them down"" by being complacent about social distancing, and he would ""not hesitate"" to reimpose restrictions if the number of Covid-19 cases rises. ""Targeted local"" measures would replace ""blanket national"" ones, he said. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, who spoke alongside Mr Johnson at Friday's Downing Street briefing, said no-one watching would think the easing was a risk-free step but that ""there is no perfect, exact way of doing it"". He also warned of the risk of coronavirus spreading in pubs. ""There's no doubt these are environments whose principal job it is to bring people together. That's a great thing to do socially, but it's also a great thing from the virus's point of view,"" he said. ""And therefore we do have to have a really clear and really disciplined approach to try and maintain social distancing whilst also enjoying pubs."" Council apologises for coronavirus pub tweet What are the new rules when pubs reopen? NI's hotels and bars reopen their doors 'We'll be cutting hair from midnight' Mr Johnson said: ""The success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly."" ""We must not let them down,"" he said, adding that he wanted people to ""enjoy summer safely"". Pubs have been told they must waituntil 06:00 BSTto reopen as a ""precaution"" to avoid midnight parties. And pub-goers are being encouraged to book tables in advance, while live gigs and standing at the bar will not be allowed. The 35,000 or so pubs and small bars trading in England have been closed since 20 March - a day when 645 positive coronavirus cases were announced. On Friday, 544 new coronavirus cases were announced, the lowest daily figure since 17 March - while there were 137 further deaths confirmed, taking the UK total past 44,000. As well as the easing of restrictions on the hospitality industry, social distancing rules will change from 2m to ""one metre plus"" - meaning you should take additional precautions when people are within less than 2m. The rule changes come days aftera local lockdown was put in place in Leicesterbecause of a spike in cases, with residents advised not to travel and businesses and schools remaining closed. Mr Johnson said ""good progress"" was being made towards the reopening of other businesses - such as gyms, nail salons and night clubs - and that a timetable will be set out next week. Outbreaks of coronavirus are inevitable. The virus is now at much lower levels, but it has not gone away and may never go away. Until we have a vaccine it will always pose a threat. We have already seen outbreaks in Leicester, Weston-super-Mare and Kirklees. Relaxing lockdown will make them more common. Remember, this is a virus that thrives on close contact - the more people we come into contact with, the more coronavirus will spread. It was true in March, when lockdown came in, and it is true now. However, outbreaks are not a massive problem as long as they can be contained. If they can be spotted and rapidly stopped then an outbreak may cause local disruption, but not ""National Lockdown Two"". This will be the challenge for NHS test and trace. However, some scientists are concerned lockdown is being lifted too quickly and that we are not yet able to stay on top of the virus. The danger is failing to stop an outbreak could lead to coronavirus spreading widely and cases surging. During the briefing, the prime minister laid out a five-step approach to tackling local outbreaks. This will involve authorities monitoring data, engaging with local agencies and carrying out testing. At the fourth stage, targeted restrictions, Mr Johnson said activities will be restricted ""at particular locations"" with ""individual premises"" made to close. The final stage would be a local lockdown, which he said would be ""carefully calibrated depending on the scientific circumstances of each outbreak"". This video can not be played England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty: ""Nobody believes this is a risk-free step"" Prof Whitty said the country would see both health and economic problems as a result of the pandemic and the government was trying to ""walk this narrow path"". ""What this is is an attempt to balance, as best we can, in a way that makes it possible for society to be as close as possible to normal, whilst living alongside this virus - which we will have to continue to do,"" he said. Englandâs quarantine-free list of places published Sturgeon attacks 'shambolic' air bridges decision Recreational cricket to resume - PM He added that there is a ""real possibility"" of a second wave - which ""goes up sharply"" if people do not take social distancing measures seriously.

"Pubs in England will not be allowed to open until 06:00 BST on Saturday, No 10 has confirmed. Most of the latest lockdown easing measures will come into force at 00:01 across the country. But Downing Street said the later opening time for pubs was a ""sensible precaution"" to avoid midnight parties. Boris Johnson will urge the public to act ""safely and sensibly"" at a press conference at 17:00 on Friday. Many businesses - including restaurants, pubs, hairdressers and cinemas - will be allowed to open their doors for the first time since March. The pub industry said the reopening was ""fantastic"" but urged customers to respect staff and changes in practices. Pub-goers are being encouraged to book tables in advance, while live gigs and standing at the bar will not be allowed. Downing Street said normal licensing rules would still apply, so pubs can only serve alcohol at the usual time they are allowed, but some establishments open early to serve breakfasts and coffee. What are the new rules when pubs reopen? Coronavirus lockdown: All you need to know about new measures Greater Manchester Police leave cancelled for pubs reopening How are the social distancing rules changing? InNorthern Ireland, pubs, bars, hotels and cafes are reopening on Friday while, in Scotland, hospitality venues with outdoor space will open their doors on Monday. No date has yet been set in Wales. The 35,000 or so pubs and small bars trading in England have been closed since 20 March. The majority of them will be opening up again on Saturday, after the prime minister announced a significant relaxation of lockdown measures last week, along with an easing of social distancing rules from 2m to ""one metre plus"". Speaking on LBC Radio, Mr Johnson rejected suggestions that opening pubs on a Saturday was a recipe for trouble, suggesting it would have made little difference to wait until Monday. ""I hope people will do this safely and sensibly...My message is let's not blow it now folks"". Dubbed ""Super Saturday"" in some quarters, there may be nerves in Number 10 as they look to see how people respond to a further easing of lockdown. Hence, later on Friday, Boris Johnson will urge people to be ""responsible"". Messaging and tone are important in a public health crisis; and Labour's accused the prime minister of getting his messaging and tone wrong before crowds flocked to Bournemouth beach in June. Of course, in all directions, there are risks. Yes, there's the risk of seeing the virus spread but there are also the risks that come with keeping the economy in the deep freeze. But another reason ministers will want to avoid any scenes of disorder or disarray; no government wants to look like it's losing control. At the No 10 briefing later, Mr Johnson will be joined by chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. The PM is expected to say the move to ease lockdown is about ""supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country"". ""Just as when we first locked down, we will only succeed in reopening if everyone works together. Because we are not out of the woods yet. The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that."" The PM will also reiterate that the government ""will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re-imposing restrictions"" if there is a spike in the virus as a result of the changes. The rule change comes days after a local lockdown was put in place in Leicester because of a spike in cases. Businesses and schools in the city will have to remain closed, with residents advised not to travel. This video can not be played Some pubs are experimenting with an app-ordering system 'We'll be cutting hair from midnight' Emergency service chiefs have also appealed to pub goers to behave responsibly this weekend. In a joint statement, representatives of the police, fire and ambulance services urged people to drink in moderation, to observe social distancing and reassess their plans if conditions are not safe. The BBC's Danny Savage said the emergency services were preparing in the same way they would do for the Friday night before Christmas. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SCHOOLS:Which are reopening, when? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? The British Beer and Pubs Association has urged people to respect the hygiene measures in place and to be supportive of landlords and pub staff. ""If we all work together we can ensure that the reopening of pubs and hospitality is a success and an enjoyable experience for everyone,"" it said. However, there are signs that some people will be reluctant to return. Pollsters Ipsos-Mori said 60% of the 1,000 people they spoke to said they would be uncomfortable going to a bar or restaurant. Each UK nation's lockdown measures differ, including varying rules on the reopening of food and drink outlets. In Northern Ireland,pubs and restaurants are reopening on Friday. In Scotland, beer gardens and outdoor restaurants will be allowed to reopen from 6 July, and indoor areas can be used from 15 July.

Those who are eligible to enter the US - such as US citizens flying in from the UK - must be prepared to quarantine for 14 days. Even US travellers arriving from some US states must quarantine. And, since the US is not exempt from the UK's quarantine, anyone returning to the UK will have to self-isolate for 14 days. What's more, the Foreign Office still advises against non-essential travel to the US. The US has reported more than 5.8 million cases of coronavirus, and more than 179,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Sturgeon brands air bridge process 'shambolic' The UK government's decision-making on air bridges has been ""shambolic"", Scotland's first minister has claimed. Nicola Sturgeon criticised the speed at which Westminster expected Scottish ministers to make a decision on lifting quarantine on overseas visitors. But she said the Scottish government was ""very likely"" to agree to relaxing restrictions for people arriving in Scotland from ""low risk"" countries. She said it needed to carefully scrutinise ""medium risk"" countries. Under the UK government's plan, from 10 July people arriving in England from 50 countries including Spain, Italy and France will no longer have to isolate for 14 days. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have not yet agreed to the proposals, with Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford saying it had been""impossible"" to get a ""sensible answer""on how UK ministers intended to make the changes. Englandâs quarantine-free list of places published Drakeford: 'Impossible to get sensible answer on air bridges' Where can I fly to from Scotland's airports? LIVE: Updates on coronavirus in Scotland Downing Street has said devolved governments should ""make and explain their own decisions"" on requirements for people to quarantine when returning from abroad. Meanwhile, the boss of two of Scotland's leading airports has warned that failure to adopt a four nations approach will put further jobs at risk. And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce called on the Scottish government to ""align with a UK-wide approach as a matter of urgency"" to help protect the economy. The business organisation added: ""Politics must be put to one side by all in order to give Scottish businesses the ability to drive up demand and do what they do best, making Scotland the best place to invest and do business.'' The quarantine rules are due to be relaxed in England - but not Scotland At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had to make ""difficult and complex"" decisions on the issue - but the UK government's position kept changing. The list of countries that Westminster asked Scotland to sign up to on Thursday was different to that announced on Friday, she added. ""When so much is at stake as it is right now we can't allow ourselves to be dragged along in the wake of, to be quite frank about it, another government's shambolic decision process,"" she said. ""We want to welcome visitors again from around the world and we also want to allow our own citizens to travel. ""We also want, if possible for obvious practical reasons, to have alignment on these matters with the rest of the UK."" She said she hoped a decision could be made ""quickly"". The Scottish government has assessed the prevalence of coronavirus in Scotland as five times lower than it is in England, the first minister added. About 50 countries are expected to be on the list of ""air-bridges"" Asked about Nicola Sturgeon's criticism of the UK government, the prime minister's spokesman said that ""the changes we're making now are cautious and will allow people to travel to an exempt country without the need to self isolate on their return."" ""It is for devolved administrations to make and explain their own decisions around the measures that they are putting in place,"" he said. ""We have been working with all devolved administrations on quarantine from the outset and we continue to do so,"" he said. Earlier, Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had been given 30 minutes to look at a list of countries under consideration for ""air bridges"" before being asked to make a decision on Wednesday night. He toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethe Scottish government wanted to take a ""four nations"" approach and he asked for more time consider the issue. UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps said there was still time for the devolved nations to join the plans. ""Remember this isn't changing until the 10 July so there's still an opportunity for them to do that and they may well,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we see countries come on board. ""I very much hope we can do this as four nations at the same time I think that would very much simplify it for people but they will need to make that decision themselves."" Meanwhile, Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports - which owns Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports - said regional variations will endanger livelihoods. He added: ""Having a piecemeal approach will compound the devastating impact the blanket quarantine measures have had on our aviation, tourism and hospitality sectors. ""People are rightly concerned for their health, however, they're also fearful for their jobs.

"Pubs in England will not be allowed to open until 06:00 BST on Saturday, No 10 has confirmed. Most of the latest lockdown easing measures will come into force at 00:01 across the country. But Downing Street said the later opening time for pubs was a ""sensible precaution"" to avoid midnight parties. Boris Johnson will urge the public to act ""safely and sensibly"" at a press conference at 17:00 on Friday. Many businesses - including restaurants, pubs, hairdressers and cinemas - will be allowed to open their doors for the first time since March. The pub industry said the reopening was ""fantastic"" but urged customers to respect staff and changes in practices. Pub-goers are being encouraged to book tables in advance, while live gigs and standing at the bar will not be allowed. Downing Street said normal licensing rules would still apply, so pubs can only serve alcohol at the usual time they are allowed, but some establishments open early to serve breakfasts and coffee. What are the new rules when pubs reopen? Coronavirus lockdown: All you need to know about new measures Greater Manchester Police leave cancelled for pubs reopening How are the social distancing rules changing? InNorthern Ireland, pubs, bars, hotels and cafes are reopening on Friday while, in Scotland, hospitality venues with outdoor space will open their doors on Monday. No date has yet been set in Wales. The 35,000 or so pubs and small bars trading in England have been closed since 20 March. The majority of them will be opening up again on Saturday, after the prime minister announced a significant relaxation of lockdown measures last week, along with an easing of social distancing rules from 2m to ""one metre plus"". Speaking on LBC Radio, Mr Johnson rejected suggestions that opening pubs on a Saturday was a recipe for trouble, suggesting it would have made little difference to wait until Monday. ""I hope people will do this safely and sensibly...My message is let's not blow it now folks"". Dubbed ""Super Saturday"" in some quarters, there may be nerves in Number 10 as they look to see how people respond to a further easing of lockdown. Hence, later on Friday, Boris Johnson will urge people to be ""responsible"". Messaging and tone are important in a public health crisis; and Labour's accused the prime minister of getting his messaging and tone wrong before crowds flocked to Bournemouth beach in June. Of course, in all directions, there are risks. Yes, there's the risk of seeing the virus spread but there are also the risks that come with keeping the economy in the deep freeze. But another reason ministers will want to avoid any scenes of disorder or disarray; no government wants to look like it's losing control. At the No 10 briefing later, Mr Johnson will be joined by chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. The PM is expected to say the move to ease lockdown is about ""supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country"". ""Just as when we first locked down, we will only succeed in reopening if everyone works together. Because we are not out of the woods yet. The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that."" The PM will also reiterate that the government ""will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re-imposing restrictions"" if there is a spike in the virus as a result of the changes. The rule change comes days after a local lockdown was put in place in Leicester because of a spike in cases. Businesses and schools in the city will have to remain closed, with residents advised not to travel. This video can not be played Some pubs are experimenting with an app-ordering system 'We'll be cutting hair from midnight' Emergency service chiefs have also appealed to pub goers to behave responsibly this weekend. In a joint statement, representatives of the police, fire and ambulance services urged people to drink in moderation, to observe social distancing and reassess their plans if conditions are not safe.

The British Beer and Pubs Association has urged people to respect the hygiene measures in place and to be supportive of landlords and pub staff. ""If we all work together we can ensure that the reopening of pubs and hospitality is a success and an enjoyable experience for everyone,"" it said. However, there are signs that some people will be reluctant to return. Pollsters Ipsos-Mori said 60% of the 1,000 people they spoke to said they would be uncomfortable going to a bar or restaurant. Each UK nation's lockdown measures differ, including varying rules on the reopening of food and drink outlets. In Northern Ireland,pubs and restaurants are reopening on Friday. In Scotland, beer gardens and outdoor restaurants will be allowed to reopen from 6 July, and indoor areas can be used from 15 July. The Welsh government has promised talks with the hospitality sector about a ""potential phased"" reopening, but no dates have yet been given.

"People in Leicester have been told to stay at home since Monday Police say they are bracing themselves for a busy weekend as pubs stay closed in Leicester but reopen across the country. More officers would be on duty than during a typical New Year's Eve, Leicestershire Police said. Hospital bosses in the city also said they were preparing for ""typical behaviours of New Year's Eve"". Leicester became subject to the UK's first local lockdown on Monday following a spike in Covid-19 cases. Police said officers would be policing the stricter lockdown measures as well as overseeing the relaxation of rules outside of the restricted zone. Leicester's hospitals said the reopening of pubs outside of the city could have ""a big impact on the public"" and A&E admissions. Acting chief executive of the hospitals' trust Rebecca Brown said: ""We're working with East Midlands Ambulance Service and the police to make sure that we're ready to support not only a surge in Covid, but also a surge in typical behaviours of New Year's Eve.""

"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Sturgeon brands air bridge process 'shambolic' The UK government's decision-making on air bridges has been ""shambolic"", Scotland's first minister has claimed. Nicola Sturgeon criticised the speed at which Westminster expected Scottish ministers to make a decision on lifting quarantine on overseas visitors. But she said the Scottish government was ""very likely"" to agree to relaxing restrictions for people arriving in Scotland from ""low risk"" countries. She said it needed to carefully scrutinise ""medium risk"" countries. Under the UK government's plan, from 10 July people arriving in England from 50 countries including Spain, Italy and France will no longer have to isolate for 14 days. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have not yet agreed to the proposals, with Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford saying it had been""impossible"" to get a ""sensible answer""on how UK ministers intended to make the changes. Englandâs quarantine-free list of places published Drakeford: 'Impossible to get sensible answer on air bridges' Where can I fly to from Scotland's airports? LIVE: Updates on coronavirus in Scotland Downing Street has said devolved governments should ""make and explain their own decisions"" on requirements for people to quarantine when returning from abroad. Meanwhile, the boss of two of Scotland's leading airports has warned that failure to adopt a four nations approach will put further jobs at risk. And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce called on the Scottish government to ""align with a UK-wide approach as a matter of urgency"" to help protect the economy. The business organisation added: ""Politics must be put to one side by all in order to give Scottish businesses the ability to drive up demand and do what they do best, making Scotland the best place to invest and do business.'' The quarantine rules are due to be relaxed in England - but not Scotland At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government had to make ""difficult and complex"" decisions on the issue - but the UK government's position kept changing. The list of countries that Westminster asked Scotland to sign up to on Thursday was different to that announced on Friday, she added. ""When so much is at stake as it is right now we can't allow ourselves to be dragged along in the wake of, to be quite frank about it, another government's shambolic decision process,"" she said. ""We want to welcome visitors again from around the world and we also want to allow our own citizens to travel. ""We also want, if possible for obvious practical reasons, to have alignment on these matters with the rest of the UK."" She said she hoped a decision could be made ""quickly"". The Scottish government has assessed the prevalence of coronavirus in Scotland as five times lower than it is in England, the first minister added. About 50 countries are expected to be on the list of ""air-bridges"" Asked about Nicola Sturgeon's criticism of the UK government, the prime minister's spokesman said that ""the changes we're making now are cautious and will allow people to travel to an exempt country without the need to self isolate on their return."" ""It is for devolved administrations to make and explain their own decisions around the measures that they are putting in place,"" he said. ""We have been working with all devolved administrations on quarantine from the outset and we continue to do so,"" he said. Earlier, Scottish Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said he had been given 30 minutes to look at a list of countries under consideration for ""air bridges"" before being asked to make a decision on Wednesday night. He toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethe Scottish government wanted to take a ""four nations"" approach and he asked for more time consider the issue. UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps said there was still time for the devolved nations to join the plans. ""Remember this isn't changing until the 10 July so there's still an opportunity for them to do that and they may well,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we see countries come on board. ""I very much hope we can do this as four nations at the same time I think that would very much simplify it for people but they will need to make that decision themselves."" Meanwhile, Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports - which owns Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports - said regional variations will endanger livelihoods. He added: ""Having a piecemeal approach will compound the devastating impact the blanket quarantine measures have had on our aviation, tourism and hospitality sectors. ""People are rightly concerned for their health, however, they're also fearful for their jobs. ""This isn't just about people being able to go on a summer holiday, it's about safely re-establishing the routes that drive trade and investment."" HOLIDAYS:Will I get a summer break?

"Some residents of rural communities have expressed concerns about the return of tourists during the pandemic The five-mile travel limit has been lifted and self-contained holiday accommodation can now reopen as virus restrictions in Scotland are eased. Visits to care homes can also now resume, and physical distancing rules for young people have been relaxed. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged Scots to ""behave responsibly"" and be ""sensitive"" to rural communities. The changes to the travel rulesdo not apply in parts of Dumfries and Gallowaydue to a local outbreak of Covid-19. Further changes to lockdown rules - including the reopening of bars and restaurants - are set to be phased in later in July. Which lockdown rules will change next - and when? Up until today, people in Scotland have been advised against travelling more than five miles from home for leisure purposes. However with the infection rate low and fewer than 1,500 people currently thought to be capable of spreading the virus, this restriction is being eased. Self-catering accommodation which does not have any shared facilities, such as holiday cottages and caravans, can also now reopen. But visitors have been warned thatLoch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park,externalcampsite and camping permit areas remain off limits, despite the easing of the five-mile travel restriction. Car parks and toilets will reopen from Friday in the national park but camping is not expected to be allowed again until 17 July. Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing said the changes were ""good news"" for a ""hard-pressed"" sector, but warned that ""the onus is on all of us to follow the guidance and ensure the virus continues to be suppressed"". The Farmhouse Cafe has been using its Highland cow to assist with social distancing He added: ""When travelling, it is essential that plans are made in advance and checks are done on what facilities are open, like public toilets and car parking availability. ""Please ensure you make use of booking systems where available prior to your journey and avoid busy beaches, parks and forests. If you arrive somewhere and it's crowded, it is essential that you try and find another place."" One cafe owner on the island of Tiree has come up with a novel way of ensuring customers socially-distance as they queue for takeaways. Fiona Armstrong, owner of the Farmhouse Cafe in Balemartine, is using her Highland cow to keep people apart. Brian Fairburn got the chance to visit his mum Moira Fairburn face-to-face for the first time in months Visits to care homes can also resume from Friday, although strict rules will be in place after the facilities were badly hit by the virus. Residents can have one named ""key visitor"" attend if their home has been virus-free for 28 days, but they will have to remain outdoors, 2m (6ft 6in) away and must wear a face covering throughout the visit. At Murray House and Evanthea House care home in Kelso there were no hugs, but lots of smiles as Brian Fairburn got the chance to catch up with his mum Moira face-to-face. ""It's been a long time, because we are used to seeing each other all the time but we can't do anything about it,"" said Moira. ""Things will change but this will have to do for now."" Despite keeping his distance, Brian Fairburn was delighted to see his mother doing so well Son Brian said: ""It was good to see her again and good to see her in such good spirits. It was quite uplifting to see her the way she was."" There have also been changes for young children, with physical distancing rules being scrapped for those under 12 when meeting other children or adults outdoors. Ms Sturgeon said she hoped this move would ""help children enjoy the summer holidays a bit more"" so they could ""play more normally with friends"". Noah, aged 6, was among children able to hug their grandparents for the first time on Friday Meanwhile young people aged 12 to 17 are allowed to meet people from an unlimited number of households in a day, as long as groups do not exceed eight and physical distancing is maintained. Visits to care homes in Scotland to resume in July Distancing rules relaxed for children in Scotland Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is only because so many of us have stuck to the rules so far, that we are able to take these steps out of lockdown. ""And only if we continue to stick to the rules will we be able to drive the virus down further, and live less restricted lives in the weeks and months ahead. ""For more businesses to reopen, for public services to get back to normal, for more of us to be able to meet indoors, for our children to go back to school full-time - all of those collective benefits depend on the decisions we make as individuals now and in the days and weeks to come."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: Kids and teenagers - what are the new rules? Scotland is coming out of lockdown at a slower pace than England, something Ms Sturgeon has said she hopes will be ""more likely to be sustainable than if we went faster"". Outdoor hospitality, such as beer gardens and outdoor areas of cafes, can begin trading again from Monday. Further changes are expected to be confirmed by Ms Sturgeon in a statement at Holyrood on Thursday, 9 July. These will include allowing people to meet with two other households indoors from 10 July, and with extended groups outdoors, as long as physical distancing is maintained. Shopping centres are likely to be allowed to re-open from 13 July, and indoor areas of pubs and restaurants on 15 July. Hairdressers and barbers, museums, galleries, cinemas, monuments and libraries and the rest of the tourist industry will also be able to resume business on that date, subject to the continued suppression of the virus.

"People in Leicester have been told to stay at home since Monday Police say they are bracing themselves for a busy weekend as pubs stay closed in Leicester but reopen across the country. More officers would be on duty than during a typical New Year's Eve, Leicestershire Police said. Hospital bosses in the city also said they were preparing for ""typical behaviours of New Year's Eve"". Leicester became subject to the UK's first local lockdown on Monday following a spike in Covid-19 cases. Police said officers would be policing the stricter lockdown measures as well as overseeing the relaxation of rules outside of the restricted zone. Leicester's hospitals said the reopening of pubs outside of the city could have ""a big impact on the public"" and A&E admissions. Acting chief executive of the hospitals' trust Rebecca Brown said: ""We're working with East Midlands Ambulance Service and the police to make sure that we're ready to support not only a surge in Covid, but also a surge in typical behaviours of New Year's Eve."" Leicester outbreak timeline: Who knew what, and when? Why has Leicester had a coronavirus spike? Leicester lockdown: Town 'guilty by association' British Transport Police is also deploying extra officers to Leicester railway station to check advice on non-essential travel is being followed. It said rail users could expect to see an ""enhanced presence"" after the government said lockdown residents should only travel when essential. National Express's newly Covid-compliant coaches will not visit Leicester A number of pubs located just outside the lockdown boundary have decided not reopen this weekend. They include The Royal Oak in Kirby Muxloe and JD Wetherspoon venue The White House in Scraptoft. A JD Wetherspoon company spokeswoman said: ""The pub is not technically within the lockdown area but it is located so very close to the red line border that we felt it responsible not to reopen on Saturday."" No decision has been made on when the pub will reopen. The White House sits just outside the lockdown boundary The Royal Oak will open on Monday - 48 hours later than bosses had originally planned to welcome back regulars. ""We just can't take the risk of loads of people coming and not being able to get in,"" said landlady Sarah Flavell. ""It's difficult because you want to get going again as quickly as you can because you need the money but you've got to be able to do it properly and safely."" Sarah Flavell had been getting ready to reopen on Saturday Meanwhile, door staff at a number of bars in Nottingham will be checking ID to keep out people from Leicester. Rob Glasby, manager of Playhouse Bar and Kitchen and spokesman for an unofficial union representing hospitality staff in the city, said it was an important precaution aimed at keeping staff and other customers safe. Mr and Mrs Smith were looking forward to a short stroll to the neighbouring village, which is now out of bounds except for essential journeys Sue Smith gets a good view of the lockdown boundary - it extends to the bottom of her garden. ""We could climb over the fence and be free,"" she joked. ""But we won't."" Mrs Smith, 57, and her husband Denis have not left their house in Thurncourt in 15 weeks because Mr Smith, 70, has been shielding. ""So near and yet so far,"" said Mrs Smith. ""This further lockdown is disappointing but necessary."" Read more about residentsliving on the lockdown border. Nottinghamshire Police Chief Constable Craig Guildford said his force would also be monitoring the situation. ""If there's any intelligence that comes from Leicestershire about, for instance, a minibus of people coming to Nottingham for a night out, clearly we'd want to move into our education mode for those individuals,"" he said. National Express has also said its coach services will not stop at Leicester during the lockdown period. Leicester City's home game against Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoonwill go ahead as planned. The restrictions are due to be reviewed by the government from 18 July.

"Pubs in England will not be allowed to open until 06:00 BST on Saturday, No 10 has confirmed. Most of the latest lockdown easing measures will come into force at 00:01 across the country. But Downing Street said the later opening time for pubs was a ""sensible precaution"" to avoid midnight parties. Boris Johnson will urge the public to act ""safely and sensibly"" at a press conference at 17:00 on Friday. Many businesses - including restaurants, pubs, hairdressers and cinemas - will be allowed to open their doors for the first time since March. The pub industry said the reopening was ""fantastic"" but urged customers to respect staff and changes in practices. Pub-goers are being encouraged to book tables in advance, while live gigs and standing at the bar will not be allowed. Downing Street said normal licensing rules would still apply, so pubs can only serve alcohol at the usual time they are allowed, but some establishments open early to serve breakfasts and coffee. What are the new rules when pubs reopen? Coronavirus lockdown: All you need to know about new measures Greater Manchester Police leave cancelled for pubs reopening How are the social distancing rules changing? InNorthern Ireland, pubs, bars, hotels and cafes are reopening on Friday while, in Scotland, hospitality venues with outdoor space will open their doors on Monday. No date has yet been set in Wales. The 35,000 or so pubs and small bars trading in England have been closed since 20 March. The majority of them will be opening up again on Saturday, after the prime minister announced a significant relaxation of lockdown measures last week, along with an easing of social distancing rules from 2m to ""one metre plus"". Speaking on LBC Radio, Mr Johnson rejected suggestions that opening pubs on a Saturday was a recipe for trouble, suggesting it would have made little difference to wait until Monday. ""I hope people will do this safely and sensibly...My message is let's not blow it now folks"". Dubbed ""Super Saturday"" in some quarters, there may be nerves in Number 10 as they look to see how people respond to a further easing of lockdown. Hence, later on Friday, Boris Johnson will urge people to be ""responsible"". Messaging and tone are important in a public health crisis; and Labour's accused the prime minister of getting his messaging and tone wrong before crowds flocked to Bournemouth beach in June. Of course, in all directions, there are risks. Yes, there's the risk of seeing the virus spread but there are also the risks that come with keeping the economy in the deep freeze. But another reason ministers will want to avoid any scenes of disorder or disarray; no government wants to look like it's losing control. At the No 10 briefing later, Mr Johnson will be joined by chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. The PM is expected to say the move to ease lockdown is about ""supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country"". ""Just as when we first locked down, we will only succeed in reopening if everyone works together. Because we are not out of the woods yet. The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that."" The PM will also reiterate that the government ""will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re-imposing restrictions"" if there is a spike in the virus as a result of the changes. The rule change comes days after a local lockdown was put in place in Leicester because of a spike in cases. Businesses and schools in the city will have to remain closed, with residents advised not to travel. This video can not be played Some pubs are experimenting with an app-ordering system 'We'll be cutting hair from midnight' Emergency service chiefs have also appealed to pub goers to behave responsibly this weekend. In a joint statement, representatives of the police, fire and ambulance services urged people to drink in moderation, to observe social distancing and reassess their plans if conditions are not safe. The BBC's Danny Savage said the emergency services were preparing in the same way they would do for the Friday night before Christmas. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

"Artwork: The government wants OneWeb to run a sat-nav service as well as deliver broadband The UK is spending $500m (Â£400m) on a stake in failed satellite firm OneWeb as part of a plan to replace use of the EU's Galileo sat-nav system. OneWeb went bankrupt in March while trying to build a spacecraft network to deliver broadband. The UK is part of a consortium with India's Bharti Global which won a bidding war for the company. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said it would help deliver the ""first UK sovereign space capability"". UK starts work on buying own sat-nav system Could the world cope if GPS stopped working? UK industry loses out in European satellite bids In a statement, Mr Sharma said: ""This deal underlines the scale of Britain's ambitions on the global stage. ""Our access to a global fleet of satellites has the potential to connect millions of people worldwide to broadband, many for the first time, and the deal presents the opportunity to further develop our strong advanced manufacturing base right here in the UK."" The consortium involving the UK government was the highest bidder in an auction for the bankrupt company. Matters will be clarified on 10 July, when the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York rules on the sale. If the Bharti Global-led option goes through, the UK government will own an equity stake of 45% in the new operation. The UK government sees satellites as a way to meet commitments on the roll-out of super-fast broadband and believes OneWeb's constellation could also deliver a precise Positioning, Navigation and Timing service, also known as sat-nav. The latter has become a political imperative for No 10 since losing membership of Europe's Galileo satellite-navigation system on departure from the EU in January. Although Galileo's free and open signals remain accessible to the UK, its more secure signals, known as PRS, intended for military and government agency use, are only available to member states. UK ministers want to replace this capacity with a home-grown system. While exceptionally good news for the staff of OneWeb, the decision of the UK government to get involved in the company has raised eyebrows in the wider space sector. Some of the more established actors have questioned the financial viability of the broadband mega-constellation projects. SpaceX is building an even bigger network and Amazon has long talked about rolling out its own version. These are extremely expensive endeavours involving multiple rocket launches - and it's an ongoing commitment. The satellites need to be refreshed, to replace ageing and failed units, but also to take advantage of new technological developments. Such big investments make OneWeb a major gamble for taxpayers, detractors argue. The $500m (Â£400m), they believe, could be spent more fruitfully if spread across a wider set of less risky British space projects. The interesting angle, of course, is the idea that OneWeb's network could also double as a satellite-navigation service. It's not impossible technically, but it is challenging. The UK's Satellite Applications Catapult is preparing a white paper to illustrate one potential way of using the initial OneWeb constellation to deliver precise timing for use in the country's power, telecoms and finance industries. But experts warn that a bumpy road lies ahead on the issue of the frequencies used to transmit Positioning, Navigation and Timing signals - one that will require international agreement. OneWeb, which has its HQ in west London and parallel operations in Virginia, US, had initially raised $3.2bn (Â£2.6bn) of investment to build its mega-constellation. Seventy-four satellites in an initial network of 648 had been launched when the company announced recourse to bankruptcy protection, blaming the Covid crisis for the inability to raise additional financial support. Most experts believe a further $3bn at least is needed to bring the full constellation into use. Assuming there are no regulatory blockages put in the path of the consortium plan, OneWeb should soon be able to start pulling back staff who were laid off, and to resume the manufacture and launch of its satellites. The spacecraft are currently made in Florida in a partnership with European aerospace giant Airbus. OneWeb is headquartered in a former BBC building in west London There has been talk of this production, or at least some of it, being moved to Britain in future as part of the new arrangements Adrian Steckel, CEO of OneWeb, said: ""We are delighted to have concluded the sale process with such a positive outcome that will benefit not only OneWeb's existing creditors, but also our employees, vendors, commercial partners, and supporters worldwide who believe in the mission and in the promise of global connectivity."" Airbus in the UK welcomed the outcome of the auction. Managing Director Richard Franklin said: ""The UK government's vision in backing this project will drive innovation and new ways of thinking about how space can contribute even more to the UK economy, and the country's defence requirements, as well as playing a part in delivering broadband internet to communities across the country. ""We look forward to supporting OneWeb in the next phase of their business and growing the UK contribution to this market-changing business."" OneWeb launched its first 74 satellites in three batches Lockheed Martin UK Chief Executive Peter Ruddock said he hoped the OneWeb investment would not impact the much-anticipated UK national space policy or plans for a broader national space programme. ""Hopefully, it is more an indication of the level of ambition we can expect, as the UK government looks to secure additional investment, from companies like Lockheed Martin, to support future opportunities for growth in the space sector. ""Industry will be looking for the government, including the MoD, to work with us to sustain confidence in the UK space sector and future commercial and defence space programmes."" Chi Onwurah MP, Labour's shadow minister for science, commented: ""There are serious concerns about the government's decision to spend Â£400m buying a stake in this company. We were promised Galileo would be replaced by a UK-based programme, but this is not that. ""We need a 'Back to Work Budget' with a laser-like focus on UK jobs. The government needs to urgently explain how and why this decision was taken."" Bharti, through Bharti Airtel, is the third largest mobile operator in the world, with over 425 million customers. OneWeb's statement on Friday said Bharti Airtel's networks would in future act as the testing ground for all the satellite company's new products, services, and applications.

"The great crested newt is rare in Europe The prime minister has been accused of inventing an allegation that wildlife rules are holding back house-building. In his recent speech on job creation, Boris Johnson said: ""Newt-counting delays are a massive drag on the prosperity of this country."" But environmental groups say the allegation is a political trick with no basis in fact. And BBC News has been unable to find recent evidence that wildlife surveys are unduly delaying development. The Local Government Association said it was not aware of any evidence that newt surveys were unnecessarily holding back projects. 'Newt risk map' scheme launched Spaniel Sherlock Bones sniffing out rare newts And a property industry source said it had many concerns over planning, but newt surveys were towards the bottom of the list. ""The PM's speech was pure fiction,"" Craig Bennett, head of the Wildlife Trusts, which runs conservation projects and education projects, told the BBC. ""It may sound funny referring to newts, but actually it was rather sinister. In the environment movement we know referring to newts is a dog whistle to people on the right of his party who want environmental protections watered down."" Boris Johnson thinks newt counts are a drag on construction Number 10 says Mr Johnson's remarks were based on government enquiries into red tape. Historically, would-be developers would have to wait for a survey to check whether their plans might disturb great crested newts, which are uncommon in Europe. A 2017 review said newt survey delays could typically last nearly 15 weeks, which could make it hard to secure investment. One house builder reported the cost in 2013 at an average of Â£2,261.55 per newt relocated. This took into account consultant fees, land purchase for the relocated newts and contracting costs for the physical relocation. Another large builder reported a sum of Â£500,000 spent on one site where just five newts were found. But the wildlife watchdog Natural England says recently it's been working hard to restrict delays and costs. It's using a method in which samples of pond water are taken and analysedto detect fragments of newt DNA.,external The process is so fast that the organisation is often able to carry out research in advance so developers can get instant information. Are the biggest newt species in the UK and have been around for approximately 40 million years During the breeding season males develop a jagged crest which has a break at the base of the tail and females take on a ""bulky"" appearance Adults grow up to 15cm (6in) in length Their skin is black or dark brown with a rough, warty appearance and their underside is bright orange with irregular black blotches Populations have disappeared from many sites across Europe due to habitat loss and intensification of farming practices Source:Froglife,external A springer spaniel called Freyais also playing a part.,externalShe works for Wessex Water, sniffing out newts in ponds. The firm says that, thanks to Freya, it can conclude its surveys in days, not weeks. What's more, if great crested newts are discovered, that doesn't sterilise development on the site. Under recent rules, the developer can proceed so long as they provide alternative sites in a way that leaves nature better off than before. These changes may explain why newt surveys are no longer a great concern for many house builders. Newt rules have been under attack in the past frompoliticians complaining that the UK has ""gold-plated"" EU regulations. But the head of Natural England, Tony Juniper, told the BBC: ""We have to find the best ways of pulling together our environmental ambition at the same time as the economic one. These two things have to be pursued together, not traded off against each other."" Green groups furious with Mr Johnson are meeting Environment Secretary George Eustice next week to express their concerns about his speech. Jeremy Biggs from the Freshwater Habitats Trust told BBC News the processing time for a newt search in the South Midlands was now down to 10 days. But the former chair of Natural England, Andrew Sells, said there were still delays in some areas. He said: ""The problem lies with local authorities. The new testing systems are there to be used, but they haven't been rolled out in all places."" Update: At the time of writing, no government department had offered evidence for the Prime Minister's allegation that newts were causing serious delays. The story has since been amended following updated information from Number 10, which said his remarks were based on previous government enquiries into red tape.

"Artwork: The government wants OneWeb to run a sat-nav service as well as deliver broadband The UK is spending $500m (Â£400m) on a stake in failed satellite firm OneWeb as part of a plan to replace use of the EU's Galileo sat-nav system. OneWeb went bankrupt in March while trying to build a spacecraft network to deliver broadband. The UK is part of a consortium with India's Bharti Global which won a bidding war for the company. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said it would help deliver the ""first UK sovereign space capability"". UK starts work on buying own sat-nav system Could the world cope if GPS stopped working? UK industry loses out in European satellite bids In a statement, Mr Sharma said: ""This deal underlines the scale of Britain's ambitions on the global stage. ""Our access to a global fleet of satellites has the potential to connect millions of people worldwide to broadband, many for the first time, and the deal presents the opportunity to further develop our strong advanced manufacturing base right here in the UK."" The consortium involving the UK government was the highest bidder in an auction for the bankrupt company. Matters will be clarified on 10 July, when the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York rules on the sale. If the Bharti Global-led option goes through, the UK government will own an equity stake of 45% in the new operation. The UK government sees satellites as a way to meet commitments on the roll-out of super-fast broadband and believes OneWeb's constellation could also deliver a precise Positioning, Navigation and Timing service, also known as sat-nav. The latter has become a political imperative for No 10 since losing membership of Europe's Galileo satellite-navigation system on departure from the EU in January. Although Galileo's free and open signals remain accessible to the UK, its more secure signals, known as PRS, intended for military and government agency use, are only available to member states. UK ministers want to replace this capacity with a home-grown system. While exceptionally good news for the staff of OneWeb, the decision of the UK government to get involved in the company has raised eyebrows in the wider space sector. Some of the more established actors have questioned the financial viability of the broadband mega-constellation projects. SpaceX is building an even bigger network and Amazon has long talked about rolling out its own version. These are extremely expensive endeavours involving multiple rocket launches - and it's an ongoing commitment. The satellites need to be refreshed, to replace ageing and failed units, but also to take advantage of new technological developments. Such big investments make OneWeb a major gamble for taxpayers, detractors argue. The $500m (Â£400m), they believe, could be spent more fruitfully if spread across a wider set of less risky British space projects. The interesting angle, of course, is the idea that OneWeb's network could also double as a satellite-navigation service. It's not impossible technically, but it is challenging. The UK's Satellite Applications Catapult is preparing a white paper to illustrate one potential way of using the initial OneWeb constellation to deliver precise timing for use in the country's power, telecoms and finance industries. But experts warn that a bumpy road lies ahead on the issue of the frequencies used to transmit Positioning, Navigation and Timing signals - one that will require international agreement. OneWeb, which has its HQ in west London and parallel operations in Virginia, US, had initially raised $3.2bn (Â£2.6bn) of investment to build its mega-constellation. Seventy-four satellites in an initial network of 648 had been launched when the company announced recourse to bankruptcy protection, blaming the Covid crisis for the inability to raise additional financial support. Most experts believe a further $3bn at least is needed to bring the full constellation into use. Assuming there are no regulatory blockages put in the path of the consortium plan, OneWeb should soon be able to start pulling back staff who were laid off, and to resume the manufacture and launch of its satellites. The spacecraft are currently made in Florida in a partnership with European aerospace giant Airbus. OneWeb is headquartered in a former BBC building in west London There has been talk of this production, or at least some of it, being moved to Britain in future as part of the new arrangements Adrian Steckel, CEO of OneWeb, said: ""We are delighted to have concluded the sale process with such a positive outcome that will benefit not only OneWeb's existing creditors, but also our employees, vendors, commercial partners, and supporters worldwide who believe in the mission and in the promise of global connectivity."" Airbus in the UK welcomed the outcome of the auction. Managing Director Richard Franklin said: ""The UK government's vision in backing this project will drive innovation and new ways of thinking about how space can contribute even more to the UK economy, and the country's defence requirements, as well as playing a part in delivering broadband internet to communities across the country. ""We look forward to supporting OneWeb in the next phase of their business and growing the UK contribution to this market-changing business."" OneWeb launched its first 74 satellites in three batches Lockheed Martin UK Chief Executive Peter Ruddock said he hoped the OneWeb investment would not impact the much-anticipated UK national space policy or plans for a broader national space programme. ""Hopefully, it is more an indication of the level of ambition we can expect, as the UK government looks to secure additional investment, from companies like Lockheed Martin, to support future opportunities for growth in the space sector. ""Industry will be looking for the government, including the MoD, to work with us to sustain confidence in the UK space sector and future commercial and defence space programmes."" Chi Onwurah MP, Labour's shadow minister for science, commented: ""There are serious concerns about the government's decision to spend Â£400m buying a stake in this company. We were promised Galileo would be replaced by a UK-based programme, but this is not that. ""We need a 'Back to Work Budget' with a laser-like focus on UK jobs. The government needs to urgently explain how and why this decision was taken."" Bharti, through Bharti Airtel, is the third largest mobile operator in the world, with over 425 million customers. OneWeb's statement on Friday said Bharti Airtel's networks would in future act as the testing ground for all the satellite company's new products, services, and applications.

"Some residents of rural communities have expressed concerns about the return of tourists during the pandemic The five-mile travel limit has been lifted and self-contained holiday accommodation can now reopen as virus restrictions in Scotland are eased. Visits to care homes can also now resume, and physical distancing rules for young people have been relaxed. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged Scots to ""behave responsibly"" and be ""sensitive"" to rural communities. The changes to the travel rulesdo not apply in parts of Dumfries and Gallowaydue to a local outbreak of Covid-19. Further changes to lockdown rules - including the reopening of bars and restaurants - are set to be phased in later in July. Which lockdown rules will change next - and when? Up until today, people in Scotland have been advised against travelling more than five miles from home for leisure purposes. However with the infection rate low and fewer than 1,500 people currently thought to be capable of spreading the virus, this restriction is being eased. Self-catering accommodation which does not have any shared facilities, such as holiday cottages and caravans, can also now reopen. But visitors have been warned thatLoch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park,externalcampsite and camping permit areas remain off limits, despite the easing of the five-mile travel restriction. Car parks and toilets will reopen from Friday in the national park but camping is not expected to be allowed again until 17 July. Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing said the changes were ""good news"" for a ""hard-pressed"" sector, but warned that ""the onus is on all of us to follow the guidance and ensure the virus continues to be suppressed"". The Farmhouse Cafe has been using its Highland cow to assist with social distancing He added: ""When travelling, it is essential that plans are made in advance and checks are done on what facilities are open, like public toilets and car parking availability. ""Please ensure you make use of booking systems where available prior to your journey and avoid busy beaches, parks and forests. If you arrive somewhere and it's crowded, it is essential that you try and find another place."" One cafe owner on the island of Tiree has come up with a novel way of ensuring customers socially-distance as they queue for takeaways. Fiona Armstrong, owner of the Farmhouse Cafe in Balemartine, is using her Highland cow to keep people apart. Brian Fairburn got the chance to visit his mum Moira Fairburn face-to-face for the first time in months Visits to care homes can also resume from Friday, although strict rules will be in place after the facilities were badly hit by the virus. Residents can have one named ""key visitor"" attend if their home has been virus-free for 28 days, but they will have to remain outdoors, 2m (6ft 6in) away and must wear a face covering throughout the visit. At Murray House and Evanthea House care home in Kelso there were no hugs, but lots of smiles as Brian Fairburn got the chance to catch up with his mum Moira face-to-face. ""It's been a long time, because we are used to seeing each other all the time but we can't do anything about it,"" said Moira. ""Things will change but this will have to do for now."" Despite keeping his distance, Brian Fairburn was delighted to see his mother doing so well Son Brian said: ""It was good to see her again and good to see her in such good spirits. It was quite uplifting to see her the way she was."" There have also been changes for young children, with physical distancing rules being scrapped for those under 12 when meeting other children or adults outdoors. Ms Sturgeon said she hoped this move would ""help children enjoy the summer holidays a bit more"" so they could ""play more normally with friends"". Noah, aged 6, was among children able to hug their grandparents for the first time on Friday Meanwhile young people aged 12 to 17 are allowed to meet people from an unlimited number of households in a day, as long as groups do not exceed eight and physical distancing is maintained. Visits to care homes in Scotland to resume in July Distancing rules relaxed for children in Scotland Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is only because so many of us have stuck to the rules so far, that we are able to take these steps out of lockdown. ""And only if we continue to stick to the rules will we be able to drive the virus down further, and live less restricted lives in the weeks and months ahead. ""For more businesses to reopen, for public services to get back to normal, for more of us to be able to meet indoors, for our children to go back to school full-time - all of those collective benefits depend on the decisions we make as individuals now and in the days and weeks to come."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: Kids and teenagers - what are the new rules? Scotland is coming out of lockdown at a slower pace than England, something Ms Sturgeon has said she hopes will be ""more likely to be sustainable than if we went faster"". Outdoor hospitality, such as beer gardens and outdoor areas of cafes, can begin trading again from Monday. Further changes are expected to be confirmed by Ms Sturgeon in a statement at Holyrood on Thursday, 9 July. These will include allowing people to meet with two other households indoors from 10 July, and with extended groups outdoors, as long as physical distancing is maintained. Shopping centres are likely to be allowed to re-open from 13 July, and indoor areas of pubs and restaurants on 15 July. Hairdressers and barbers, museums, galleries, cinemas, monuments and libraries and the rest of the tourist industry will also be able to resume business on that date, subject to the continued suppression of the virus.

"Face masks are an increasingly common sight throughout Europe Across Europe, lockdown measures are being lifted cautiously, in phases. Businesses are reopening and many children are back in school. Many of Europe's internal borders opened again in mid-June.

Here is how Europeans are emerging from life under lockdown. Borussia Dortmund (yellow) v Paderborn: Bundesliga football is behind closed doors Germanybegan reopening smaller shopsin April: in early May control of lifting the lockdown was handed to the 16 federal states. However, Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed that an ''emergency brake'' would be applied anywhere with a surge in new infections. A surge in cases linked to a meat processing plant near the town of GÃ¼tersloh causedregional authorities to reimpose local lockdownson 23 June. Foreign minister Heiko Maas lifteda travel banfor EU member states and specified European countries including the UK.

What caused Germany's biggest virus outbreak? Italy imposed a strict and lengthy lockdown on 7 March - initially in the north, then nationwide - with a ban on walking or exercising more than 200m (656ft) from home. In early May, some restrictions were relaxed and people are now able to travel for longer distances, as well as visit their relatives in small numbers.

"The great crested newt is rare in Europe The prime minister has been accused of inventing an allegation that wildlife rules are holding back house-building. In his recent speech on job creation, Boris Johnson said: ""Newt-counting delays are a massive drag on the prosperity of this country."" But environmental groups say the allegation is a political trick with no basis in fact. And BBC News has been unable to find recent evidence that wildlife surveys are unduly delaying development. The Local Government Association said it was not aware of any evidence that newt surveys were unnecessarily holding back projects. 'Newt risk map' scheme launched Spaniel Sherlock Bones sniffing out rare newts And a property industry source said it had many concerns over planning, but newt surveys were towards the bottom of the list. ""The PM's speech was pure fiction,"" Craig Bennett, head of the Wildlife Trusts, which runs conservation projects and education projects, told the BBC. ""It may sound funny referring to newts, but actually it was rather sinister. In the environment movement we know referring to newts is a dog whistle to people on the right of his party who want environmental protections watered down."" Boris Johnson thinks newt counts are a drag on construction Number 10 says Mr Johnson's remarks were based on government enquiries into red tape. Historically, would-be developers would have to wait for a survey to check whether their plans might disturb great crested newts, which are uncommon in Europe. A 2017 review said newt survey delays could typically last nearly 15 weeks, which could make it hard to secure investment. One house builder reported the cost in 2013 at an average of Â£2,261.55 per newt relocated. This took into account consultant fees, land purchase for the relocated newts and contracting costs for the physical relocation. Another large builder reported a sum of Â£500,000 spent on one site where just five newts were found. But the wildlife watchdog Natural England says recently it's been working hard to restrict delays and costs. It's using a method in which samples of pond water are taken and analysedto detect fragments of newt DNA.,external The process is so fast that the organisation is often able to carry out research in advance so developers can get instant information. Are the biggest newt species in the UK and have been around for approximately 40 million years During the breeding season males develop a jagged crest which has a break at the base of the tail and females take on a ""bulky"" appearance Adults grow up to 15cm (6in) in length Their skin is black or dark brown with a rough, warty appearance and their underside is bright orange with irregular black blotches Populations have disappeared from many sites across Europe due to habitat loss and intensification of farming practices Source:Froglife,external A springer spaniel called Freyais also playing a part.,externalShe works for Wessex Water, sniffing out newts in ponds. The firm says that, thanks to Freya, it can conclude its surveys in days, not weeks. What's more, if great crested newts are discovered, that doesn't sterilise development on the site. Under recent rules, the developer can proceed so long as they provide alternative sites in a way that leaves nature better off than before. These changes may explain why newt surveys are no longer a great concern for many house builders. Newt rules have been under attack in the past frompoliticians complaining that the UK has ""gold-plated"" EU regulations. But the head of Natural England, Tony Juniper, told the BBC: ""We have to find the best ways of pulling together our environmental ambition at the same time as the economic one. These two things have to be pursued together, not traded off against each other."" Green groups furious with Mr Johnson are meeting Environment Secretary George Eustice next week to express their concerns about his speech. Jeremy Biggs from the Freshwater Habitats Trust told BBC News the processing time for a newt search in the South Midlands was now down to 10 days. But the former chair of Natural England, Andrew Sells, said there were still delays in some areas. He said: ""The problem lies with local authorities. The new testing systems are there to be used, but they haven't been rolled out in all places."" Update: At the time of writing, no government department had offered evidence for the Prime Minister's allegation that newts were causing serious delays. The story has since been amended following updated information from Number 10, which said his remarks were based on previous government enquiries into red tape.

"More police in locked-down Leicester 'than New Year's Eve' England's quarantine scrapped for arrivals from 50 'low risk' countries Public should 'act responsibly' as England's lockdown is eased, says PM Coronavirus sniffer dogs trial going 'very well' Welsh pub with car park in England unable to fully reopen Updates on Friday 3 July Jennifer Meierhans and Kathryn Hamlett Jennifer MeierhansBBC News Thanks for joining us today for updates on coronavirus. Have a good weekend and stay safe. Social distancing guidance in England is changing to ""1 metre plus"" and pubs, restaurants and hotels can reopen. Rules are different in each UK nation - and rules will not ease inLeicester, which is currently under a local lockdown. From Saturday, two households of any size can now meet inside in England. You can meet different households at different times and overnight stays are allowed. No more than two households should meet at any one time, and it is important that you don't see anyone if you have anycoronavirus symptoms. But social distancing still applies with everyone you don't live with - even your grandchildren. So for the time being, unless they are in yoursupport bubble, you can't hug them.Read the new social distancing rules. A giant ""thank you"" has been added to the roof at the Eden Project in Cornwall. The sign, in 4m-high white letters alongside a blue heart, has been created by the Eden team to ""express its gratitude to everyone helping people and communities through the coronavirus pandemic and all the challenges that have arisen from it"". Peter Stewart, the Eden Projectâs campaigns and communications director, said: âWe thank the selfless people who are helping the country through the crisis, all those in our wonderful NHS, the care workers, the key workers, the volunteers, the neighbours, the family members and friends."" Local Democracy Reporting ServiceChris Binding The Nightingale Hospital in Sunderland will remain on standby as an ""insurance policy"", health chiefs have said. The 460-bed centre, near Nissanâs Washington plant,was launched in May, and will start taking patients if the regionâs hospitals are unable to cope with Covid-19 cases. While long-term plans for the centre are uncertain, health chiefs have stressed that the use of the facility is ""still in the picture"". Peter Sutton, director of planning and business development at South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust, said: âIt is very much still there in terms of if we need it as a system and for the wider North East, itâs still there as a facility to be used."" Pubs in England will be allowed to open from 06:00 BST on Saturday, No 10 has confirmed. Downing Street said most of the latest lockdown easing measures will come into force at 00:01 across the country. But a spokesman said the later opening time for pubs was a ""sensible precaution"" to avoid midnight parties. Boris Johnson will urge the public to act ""safely and sensibly"" at a press conference at5pm on Friday. The
reopening of a pier in East Sussex has been postponed due to a forecast of bad
weather. Crowds
were due to gather on Grade II-listed Hastings Pier tomorrow for the first time
since lockdown. But a forecast of wind and rain has forced organisers to postpone the event until 6 July. Hastings mayor Nigel Sinden and National Piers Society chairman Tim Wardley will conduct a ribbon-cutting ceremony. A full list of countries for which quarantine will not apply to people arriving back in England has been published. Countries including Greece, Spain and Belgium are on the list but Portugal is not. Most travellers to the UK currently have to self-isolatefor two weeks. The daughter of a man who died from coronavirus after being taken ill on a cruise shipsays life since his death has been ""absolute hell"". Georgina Forsythe, 36, of Warwickshire, says more needs to be done to recognise those who lost their lives to the virus, including her dad John Langford who died in Miami in May. She hopes people will hold a minute's silence and light a candle on 4 July. ""I know people want to get back to normal, but we can't,"" she said. Nicola Sturgeon says Scotland has a long-standing reputation
for being an open and welcoming country, and wants to welcome visitors from
around the world again, and allow Scots to travel. The first minister also wants to have alignment with the
rest of the UK, but wants to ensure Scotland does not risk the progress made in tackling Covid-19, which she says has been âsignificant but
hard-earnedâ. One of the key risks we have to manage is the possibility of new cases coming into Scotland from outside, she says, particularly from countries where the virus is more prevalent than it is here. An added factor is there is not a uniform picture of infection rates across the UK. âWe assess the prevalence of the virus in Scotland right now is five times lower than in England, and Northern Ireland faces a similar issue,â she says. It may be that where the UK government is admitting visitors to England without quarantine that they judge wonât increase the risk of infection levels there, it would create that risk in Scotland, adds the first minister. How has coronavirus spread in the UK? We've put together some graphics explaining the spread - and the government's response to it. Amy WoodfieldBBC News Confusion over the Leicester lockdown boundary zone has extended to a service station on the M1. The zone, drawn up by Leicestershire County Council, has been branded ""stupid"" by residents living on a street wheresome houses are in lockdown and others are not. When asked by BBC Radio Leicester if situations like this could have been avoided, council leader Nick Rushton said: ""No, you have to put a line somewhere and there are some areas that are like that. ""Look at Leicester Forest East Service Station - one side is in, one side is out, it's just unfortunate. ""The rules are if you arrive on the south, on the side in the restriction zone, you're not supposed to cross the bridge to go over to the other side."" This has been disputed by Welcome Break, which runs the service station. A spokesperson said both sides of Leicester Forest East Service Station were open and customers could walk across the bridge. ""In line with guidance from the Department for Transport and Public Health England, Leicester Forest East - north and south - currently remain open as we provide an essential service for drivers,"" the spokesperson added. The prospect of a summer holiday abroad has moved a big step closer, as the government eases quarantine rules in England. From Saturday, the Foreign Office's warning against all but essential international travel will be lifted for some countries. And from 10 July, people returning to England from certain countries will not need to self-isolate. We won't see the full list of more then 50 countries that will be exempt until later on Friday, buthere's what we do knowfor Europe's most popular warm weather destinations. Allow Twitter content?

Hairdressers reopen this weekend and one salon told us it had had 50,000 calls to their appointment line in an hour. But we've also spoken to some who say they'd prefer to stick with their home haircuts from lockdown. From a 12-year-old cutting her octogenarian grandmotherâs hair to a seven-year-old getting a style overhaul by her mum, these are their stories. This video can not be played With foreign holidays up in the air this summer, could campsites and caravans provide a ""staycation"" solution if the coronavirus lockdown eases? In a boost for Britons facing uncertainty over holidays, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said on Wednesday that ministers have a ""very ambitious plan"" to get UK tourism back on track as early as July. With a planned two-week quarantine for arrivals from abroad expected to begin soon, and hotels still closed to guests,there are signs some people are hoping to embrace the great outdoors. Daniel WainwrightBBC England Data Unit About 73,400 weddings and 300 same-sex civil partnership ceremonies are believed to have been postponed in England since lockdown began. The Office for National Statistics has based the estimated on the average number of weddings taking place during the period of 23 March to 3 July in the past four years. They include an estimated 1,800 same-sex marriages and 71,600 opposite-sex marriages. From tomorrow weddings in England can take place with a maximum of 30 people, but social distancing has to be maintained and there can be no singing unless it's behind a screen. The figures do not include people getting married abroad or same-sex couples converting a civil partnership to marriage. Civil partnerships between opposite-sex couples were also excluded as they have only been possible since 31 December 2019.  Lora JonesBusiness reporter, BBC News Hairdressers and barbers in England will be allowed to reopen from 4 July - and some don't want to wait a moment longer. Carole Rickaby, who owns Tusk Hair in Camden, north London, will be opening the doors of her salon at the stroke of midnight. ""It is just a fun thing to do [but] we're busy anyway. We are completely booked up from 7:00 in the morning until about 8pm because we're spreading our clients out as well, taking longer over each appointment."" Four stylists will work socially-distanced in the salon and allow up to 15 minutes between each client for cleaning. Cuts will be booked in in the morning, with colour treatments thattake longer in the afternoon. The emergency department at Cornwall's main hospital is predicting demand ""like New Year's Eve"" as lockdown restrictions are eased this weekend. Tourism bosses said about 80,000 people were expected to visit, with many hotels and campsites accepting guests. Toby Slade, from the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust (RCHT), urged people to ""be sensible about risky activities"". Visitors who fall ill and cannot travel have been warned they will have to pay for accommodation while they isolate. Read more here. A family who painted the arch around their front door in tribute to the NHS during the coronavirus pandemic say they are shocked the council has told them to paint over it. The Hemmings, from Bewdley, said they wanted to ""make people smile"" by painting the rainbow. Photos of the door were shared on social media and in the local press. But Wyre Forest District Council said listed building rules meant the paintworkcould not remain. People struggling with high-cost credit or car finance are to be given more time to pay, under proposals from the UK's financial watchdog. The Financial Conduct Authority plans to extend the deadline to apply for a payment freeze until 31 October.

"State media said Kim warned against a hasty relaxing of restrictions North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has hailed his country's ""shining success"" in dealing with Covid-19, according to state news agency KCNA. Speaking at a politburo meeting, Mr Kim said the country had ""prevented the inroad of the malignant virus and maintained a stable situation"". North Korea closed its borders and put thousands into isolation six months ago as the virus swept across the globe. It claims that it has no virus cases, though analysts say this is unlikely. Mr Kim is said to have ""analysed in detail the six month-long national emergency anti-epidemic work"" at a politburo meeting on Thursday. He said the success in handling the virus was ""achieved by the far-sighted leadership of the Party Central Committee"". But he stressed the importance of maintaining ""maximum alert without... relaxation on the anti-epidemic front"", adding that the virus was still present in neighbouring countries. ""He repeatedly warned that hasty relief of anti-epidemic measures will result in unimaginable and irretrievable crisis,""said the KCNA report on Friday.,external Has coronavirus spread through North Korea? No-one really knows. The country has been closed off since 30 January. Very few people have made it in or out. The International Federation of the Red Cross had volunteers in the border area working on virus prevention measures and there have been a number of unconfirmed reports of cases within the country. But most accounts of life in the capital in recent weeks appear to show life carrying on as normal. Whatever the reality of the situation, Pyongyang wants to appear confident that it has crushed Covid-19. Domestically this is a strong message that the strict measures Kim Jong-un took to keep the virus at bay have worked. The rest of the world may be in the grip of a pandemic and Mr Kim wants his people to know he has saved them from that. But it has come at a cost. All border traffic has been cut off. That means getting essential supplies into the impoverished state have been impossible. Diplomatic sources have told me that there are stockpiles of PPE and medical supplies, including vaccines built up at the border unable to get through. There were numerous reports of panic-buying of international goods at department stores in Pyongyang. Shelves being stripped bare as produce is restricted. It's also worth noting that only 12 defectors have made it to South Korea between April and June this year - the lowest number on record. The North Korean people may not be suffering from coronavirus, but they are now even more cut off from the outside world. In late January, North Korea moved quickly against the virus - sealing off its borders and later quarantining hundreds of foreigners in the capital, Pyongyang. It also put tens of thousands of its own citizens into isolation and closed schools. North Korea has now reopened schools, but has kept a ban on public gatherings and made it compulsory for people to wear masks in public places, said a Reuters report on 1 July quoting a World Health Organization official. The WHO also reported that the country has now tested just 922 people for the virus - all of whom have reportedly tested negative. North Korea, which shares a long border with China, has long maintained that it has not suffered from a single case of the virus. Scepticism over N Korea's claim to be virus free However, Oliver Hotham, managing editor of specialist news site NK News, told the BBC earlier this year that this was probably not true. ""It's very unlikely that it has seen no cases because it borders China and South Korea. [Especially with China], given the amount of cross border trade... I really don't see how it's possible they could have prevented it,"" he said. ""[But] they really did take precautions early [so] I think its possible they've prevented a full on outbreak.""

"18,276 people have now tested positive for Covid-19, an increase of 12 from yesterday There has been one more Covid-19 death in Scotland in the last 24 hours Nicola Sturgeon says it is ""very likely"" that her government will agree to the UK government's low-risk list of ""air bridges"" Children under 12 no longer need to social distance outdoors People will be able to travel for more than five miles for leisure or recreation The use of self-contained holiday accommodation is now allowed BBC Scotland News What rights do you have if your holidays plans or rules change, as a new Covid variant affects travel? That's all from us on the live page today. Here is a reminder of some of the day's main developments: Boris Johnson was asked in his media briefing whether a family in Scotland could drive to England to fly out and back from an overseas country to get around quarantine difficulties in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon earlier described the UK government's decision-making on air bridges as ""shambolic"". I know that the devolved administrations in Scotland, and I think also in Wales, have a slightly different take on this, but my observation through the long weeks and months of cooperation on this is that the convoy is very much going in the same direction, maybe at slightly different speeds. I'm sure we'll get there together and common sense will apply."" Boris Johnson, Prime Minister Noah and Isaac, aged 6 and 2, from Motherwell, were among children across Scotland finally able to give their grandparents a hug today. They were delighted to meet up for cuddles in the rain with gran Ellen and grandad Bobby. Ellen said: ""It's just like Christmas Day."" BBC Radio Scotland ""For us, it's the worst possible outcome for Scotland,"" says Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports, which owns Aberdeen and Glasgow Airports, following thefirst minister's criticismof the UK government's handling of air bridges. Thefull list of countriesfor which quarantine will not apply to people arriving back in England has now been published, but both the Scottish and Welsh governments have described the Westminster approach as""shambolic"". Nicola Sturgeon wants more time to consider the public health ramifications of the move but concedes it is ""very likely"" her administration will soon agree to relaxing restrictions for people arriving in Scotland from ""low risk"" nations. ""We needed and expected clear, unambiguous rules for people to follow and a four-nations approach,"" Mr Provan told BBC Radio Scotland. It's not about who's to blame, it's about making sure we get the economy up and running again. Every day of indecision is another day that thousands of jobs are either lost or put at risk Derek Provan, Chief executive of AGS Airports Conservative MSP Rachael Hamilton insists that policies must be flexible, given the shifting nature of the coronavirus crisis. The Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Tourism said: ""It's time for Nicola Sturgeon to stop the blame game, roll up her sleeves and act decisively. ""We cannot let petty political point-scoring get in the way of hard working Scots wanting to take a holiday."" The use of virtual
courts for summary criminal cases has been recommended for extension, after pilots in Aberdeen and Inverness were hailed a success. Derek Pyle, Sheriff Principal for Grampian, Highland and Islands, said the aim should be that
virtual trials ""become the default method of judicial determination in summary
crimeâ. He is working with the Crown and defence agents to
extend the use of virtual trials, while examining the full
extent to which virtual trials can be used while coronavirus is still prevalent, and in the
future. His report recommends that virtual trials should be
rolled out across the country in the autumn. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Radio Scotland The mandatory wearing of face coverings in shops from 10 July will add ""more flashpoints"" that could lead to confrontation and abuse, worries Stewart Forrest from the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers. Mr Forrest says shop staff in Scotland are already experiencing a high level of abuse as they manage queues and social distancing. He also makes the point that masks will make it difficult to ask for ID in the case of restrictive sales, which may lead to aggravation.

Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor Nicola Sturgeon made it abundantly clear today she is unimpressed by the UK government's handling of discussions about which countries will have an 'air bridge' with the UK to avoid quarantine measures. What did BBC Scotland political editor Brian Taylor make of the first minister's stance? The Scottish government is perfectly entitled to take its own position on these matters, because quarantine handling â health and policing - are determined by Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon said the UK government was changing its mind daily, on the list and plans, describing their decision-making process as shambolic. She said it was completely unacceptable to expect Scotland just to sign up to it without any notice or discussion or serious thought. It is possible there could be a different list of countries for England and Scotland but I really think that is unlikely.  It will be so complex and difficult for people to understand, and I wonder whether it could be policed in any case. I would expect Nicola Sturgeon to make an announcement pretty rapidly. She wants to align, but she wants to look at the detail first.  It is causing a pretty big row. The first minister says sheâs entitled to draw attention to the fact they were asked to sign up with half an hourâs notice to a completely different list of names at a meeting on Wednesday. This is causing a rammy, frankly, between the two governments.""  Hearts and Partick Thistle were bottom of the Premiership and Championship when last season was curtailed Hearts and Partick Thistle have lost their fight to have their respective relegations overturned by the courts. Lord Clark said that the clubs are contractually obliged to comply with the rules of the SPFL and Scottish FA. That means the hearing will go to an independent tribunal set up through the Scottish FA rules, but the association will not adjudicate in the case. Hearts and Thistle claimed unfair prejudice after clubs agreed to end the season early due to the coronavirus crisis, resulting in their relegation, and wanted the case heard in open court. A motion by the three clubs whose promotions could be scrapped - Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers - to have the case dropped was also dismissed by the judge.

The list of countries the UK government deems safe for travel from to England,externalincludes some that were widely expected, such as France, Italy, Spain and Germany. Others on the list are countries that have been praised for their ability to control the spread of coronavirus, such as South Korea and Vietnam. But it also has some inclusions that might be surprising - and some notable omissions. Turkey was left off the European Union's safe travel list, with the government there expressing its disappointment. But it's on the list for quarantine-free travel to England from 10 July. And although Greece has seen very few infections, there was doubt whether it would appear on the list as it will not approve direct flights from the UK until at least mid-July. Portugal, meanwhile, has had fewer coronavirus cases than some European holiday destinations and it is open to UK citizens without quarantine. But it has not been granted a travel corridor amid concerns over rising infection rates. Sweden is the other notable European nation to be omitted: it has had a more relaxed approach to coronavirus restrictions, and its infection rate is higher than in the UK. Countries such as the US and Brazil, which are experiencing tens of thousands of infections daily, were expected omissions. But there is also no travel corridor with China, which has seen very few cases of coronavirus since the Wuhan outbreak came under control. Travellers from England will be able to fly back from Hong Kong or Macau without quarantine, however. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, says it is ""very likely"" that her government will agree to the UK government's low-risk list of ""air bridges"". Allow Twitter content?

guidance is that there should be no camping in tents, where campers
would have to rely on shared facilities. Wild camping is also banned as numbers cannot be managed.

Gordon Watson, chief executive of the National Park Authority, said: âI know with the school holidays and
many peopleâs original holiday plans having to be cancelled camping is an
appealing alternative option. ""It is a fantastic way to enjoy the National Park

provide helpful information on how to enjoy camping safely and responsibly. âHowever now is not the time for that."" National Park car

"Almost a quarter of the Airbus jobs in Broughton are being lost A total of 1,730 jobs will be cut at two of aerospace giant Airbus's UK factories, the company has confirmed. It is part ofplans to axe 15,000 jobs worldwidein response to the hit it has taken during the coronavirus pandemic. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the 1,435 jobs being cut at Broughton, Flintshire and urged the UK government to ""get to grips"" with the economic crisis. A further 295 jobs will go in Filton, Bristol. Previously, the company said the jobs would go by summer 2021. Airbus, which employs 6,080 workers at Broughton, hopes the majority will come via voluntary redundancies or staff retiring early. But another 500 agency workers who were furloughed will not be returning. It said in a statement: ""This split reflects the significant impact the Covid crisis has had on the UK's commercial aircraft manufacturing activities, which are concentrated in Broughton. ""Airbus will continue to meet regularly with its trade union partners in the UK in order to identify solutions that will help us implement this adaptation while minimising the social impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the company."" Sir Keir told a call with voters in Flintshire on Thursday evening he feared it was the beginning of an economic crisis ""the like of which we haven't seen for many, many years"". ""It's one of the reasons that we've been saying to the [UK] government, it is all very well saying build build buildâ¦ but at the moment the thing that matters more than anything else is preserving jobs and having a laser-like focus on preserving and protecting jobs."" One of Airbus's senior vice presidents admitted ""it's going to be a difficult period,"" but added that the company remained ""confident in the future"" of the Broughton site. Paul McKinlay, head of major component told BBC Wales: ""If we didn't act, the viability and future of Airbus would be at stake. It's set at the right level, we believe, for when - we really hope - that recovery starts to come in two to three years, that we're ready for that brighter future."" He welcomed support given to the industry and company by both the Welsh and UK governments. ""With such devastating news and impact on our industry, any opportunity of support would be welcomed,"" he said. ""But I think if you look at the aviation sector and how much it's been devastated by this dreadful virus then I think there's quite a strong case for why the aviation sector needs support."" Earlier, Eluned Morgan, Wales' international relations minister, called the announcement ""devastating"". Baroness Morgan said it was ""a larger number of jobs than we feared may happen"" and the Welsh Government would be ""working with the UK government to make sure that we keep on pressing to see if we can get more specific support for the sector"". The cuts in Broughton represent almost a quarter of the workforce. Filton currently employs 3,200 people. The job losses in Broughton have been described as ""a hammer blow"" for the area Supports an estimated 6,000 jobs in its supply chain and spending in the local community Helped contribute Â£845m to Wales' GDP in 2015 - equivalent to 1.6% of the Welsh economy Has invested more than Â£2bn over the past 15 years at the Broughton plant Machinery and transport equipment makes up almost half of all goods Wales sells abroad Llyr Gruffydd, North Wales Member of the Senedd, said it was ""gut-wrenching"" that 1,435 jobs were being cut at Broughton. The Unite union described it as ""another act of industrial vandalism"" against the UK aerospace sector. Its regional secretary for Wales, Peter Hughes, said no one ever thought it would be ""this bad."" ""Yesterday when the announcement was 'over 1,700,' we knew that was bad, and then today over 1,400 from here, (it) is just a massive number,"" he said. ""Especially when you think that's probably about a third of the workforce. ""It is catastrophic."" Mr Hughes said the union would be pushing for no compulsory redundancies and called on the UK Government to ""make sure they deliver for Welsh workers."" There would be ""a domino effect"". ""This is going to knock all of the other dominoes down,"" he said. ""There's going to be massive knock-on effects. ""Every one worker here is six in the supply chain, you can do the sums yourself."" Some 134,000 people work for Airbus worldwide, with about 10% of them in the UK. The factory in Broughtonmakes wings for the Airbus A380- the world's largest passenger plane. The Filton site is responsible for wing assembly and equipping the Airbus A400M, a military transport plane. In April, the company warned it was ""bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed"" as it struggled with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. It said on Tuesday that production had dropped by 40% in recent months and it did not expect air traffic to get back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 at the earliest. On Tuesday,EasyJet announced it had started consultations on plans to close basesat Stansted, Southend and Newcastle, with Unite saying nearly 1,300 UK crew members faced losing their jobs. The Airbus A400M is equipped at the company's Filton site Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said: ""Airbus is a huge part of north Wales' economy and provides thousands of well-paid, high-skilled jobs. This announcement is a real blow for Broughton and surrounding communities. ""We need to do all we can to support those who face losing their job at this difficult time. I hope both the UK and Welsh governments will respond quickly to put additional support in place."" Delyn MP Rob Roberts called Airbus ""a vital part of the economy in our part of the country, and I am therefore deeply concerned for workers at the plant at Broughton, their families, and our wider community"". In other industrial news: Celsa Steel UK, which employs 800 out of its 1,000-strong workforce in south Wales is to receive an emergency loan from the UK government, which the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said would allow it to continue trading. Unions say they are ""bitterly disappointed"" at the rejection of proposals to keep open the Northwood Hygiene Products tissue factory at Penygroes, Gwynedd,which is set to close with 94 job losses.

"Some residents of rural communities have expressed concerns about the return of tourists during the pandemic The five-mile travel limit has been lifted and self-contained holiday accommodation can now reopen as virus restrictions in Scotland are eased. Visits to care homes can also now resume, and physical distancing rules for young people have been relaxed. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged Scots to ""behave responsibly"" and be ""sensitive"" to rural communities. The changes to the travel rulesdo not apply in parts of Dumfries and Gallowaydue to a local outbreak of Covid-19. Further changes to lockdown rules - including the reopening of bars and restaurants - are set to be phased in later in July. Which lockdown rules will change next - and when? Up until today, people in Scotland have been advised against travelling more than five miles from home for leisure purposes. However with the infection rate low and fewer than 1,500 people currently thought to be capable of spreading the virus, this restriction is being eased. Self-catering accommodation which does not have any shared facilities, such as holiday cottages and caravans, can also now reopen. But visitors have been warned thatLoch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park,externalcampsite and camping permit areas remain off limits, despite the easing of the five-mile travel restriction. Car parks and toilets will reopen from Friday in the national park but camping is not expected to be allowed again until 17 July. Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing said the changes were ""good news"" for a ""hard-pressed"" sector, but warned that ""the onus is on all of us to follow the guidance and ensure the virus continues to be suppressed"". The Farmhouse Cafe has been using its Highland cow to assist with social distancing He added: ""When travelling, it is essential that plans are made in advance and checks are done on what facilities are open, like public toilets and car parking availability. ""Please ensure you make use of booking systems where available prior to your journey and avoid busy beaches, parks and forests. If you arrive somewhere and it's crowded, it is essential that you try and find another place."" One cafe owner on the island of Tiree has come up with a novel way of ensuring customers socially-distance as they queue for takeaways. Fiona Armstrong, owner of the Farmhouse Cafe in Balemartine, is using her Highland cow to keep people apart. Brian Fairburn got the chance to visit his mum Moira Fairburn face-to-face for the first time in months Visits to care homes can also resume from Friday, although strict rules will be in place after the facilities were badly hit by the virus. Residents can have one named ""key visitor"" attend if their home has been virus-free for 28 days, but they will have to remain outdoors, 2m (6ft 6in) away and must wear a face covering throughout the visit. At Murray House and Evanthea House care home in Kelso there were no hugs, but lots of smiles as Brian Fairburn got the chance to catch up with his mum Moira face-to-face. ""It's been a long time, because we are used to seeing each other all the time but we can't do anything about it,"" said Moira. ""Things will change but this will have to do for now."" Despite keeping his distance, Brian Fairburn was delighted to see his mother doing so well Son Brian said: ""It was good to see her again and good to see her in such good spirits. It was quite uplifting to see her the way she was."" There have also been changes for young children, with physical distancing rules being scrapped for those under 12 when meeting other children or adults outdoors. Ms Sturgeon said she hoped this move would ""help children enjoy the summer holidays a bit more"" so they could ""play more normally with friends"". Noah, aged 6, was among children able to hug their grandparents for the first time on Friday Meanwhile young people aged 12 to 17 are allowed to meet people from an unlimited number of households in a day, as long as groups do not exceed eight and physical distancing is maintained. Visits to care homes in Scotland to resume in July Distancing rules relaxed for children in Scotland Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is only because so many of us have stuck to the rules so far, that we are able to take these steps out of lockdown. ""And only if we continue to stick to the rules will we be able to drive the virus down further, and live less restricted lives in the weeks and months ahead. ""For more businesses to reopen, for public services to get back to normal, for more of us to be able to meet indoors, for our children to go back to school full-time - all of those collective benefits depend on the decisions we make as individuals now and in the days and weeks to come."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: Kids and teenagers - what are the new rules? Scotland is coming out of lockdown at a slower pace than England, something Ms Sturgeon has said she hopes will be ""more likely to be sustainable than if we went faster"". Outdoor hospitality, such as beer gardens and outdoor areas of cafes, can begin trading again from Monday. Further changes are expected to be confirmed by Ms Sturgeon in a statement at Holyrood on Thursday, 9 July. These will include allowing people to meet with two other households indoors from 10 July, and with extended groups outdoors, as long as physical distancing is maintained. Shopping centres are likely to be allowed to re-open from 13 July, and indoor areas of pubs and restaurants on 15 July. Hairdressers and barbers, museums, galleries, cinemas, monuments and libraries and the rest of the tourist industry will also be able to resume business on that date, subject to the continued suppression of the virus.

""I hope people will do this safely and sensibly...My message is let's not blow it now folks"". Dubbed ""Super Saturday"" in some quarters, there may be nerves in Number 10 as they look to see how people respond to a further easing of lockdown. Hence, later on Friday, Boris Johnson will urge people to be ""responsible"". Messaging and tone are important in a public health crisis; and Labour's accused the prime minister of getting his messaging and tone wrong before crowds flocked to Bournemouth beach in June. Of course, in all directions, there are risks. Yes, there's the risk of seeing the virus spread but there are also the risks that come with keeping the economy in the deep freeze. But another reason ministers will want to avoid any scenes of disorder or disarray; no government wants to look like it's losing control. At a No 10 briefing later, Mr Johnson will be joined by chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. The PM is expected to say the move to ease lockdown is about ""supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country"". ""Just as when we first locked down, we will only succeed in reopening if everyone works together. Because we are not out of the woods yet. The virus is still with us and the spike in Leicester has shown that."" The PM will also reiterate that the government ""will not hesitate in putting on the brakes and re-imposing restrictions"" if there is a spike in the virus as a result of the changes. The rule change comes days after a local lockdown was put in place in Leicester because of a spike in cases. Businesses and schools in the city will have to remain closed, with residents advised not to travel.

In a joint statement, representatives of the police, fire and ambulance services urged people to drink in moderation, to observe social distancing and reassess their plans if conditions are not safe. The BBC's Danny Savage said the emergency services were preparing in the same way they would do for the Friday night before Christmas. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? The British Beer and Pubs Association has urged people to respect the hygiene measures in place and to be supportive of landlords and pub staff. ""If we all work together we can ensure that the reopening of pubs and hospitality is a success and an enjoyable experience for everyone,"" it said. However, there are signs that some people will be reluctant to return. Pollsters Ipsos-Mori said 60% of the 1,000 people they spoke to said they would be uncomfortable going to a bar or restaurant. Each UK nation's lockdown measures differ, including varying rules on the reopening of food and drink outlets. In Northern Ireland,pubs and restaurants are re-opening on Friday. In Scotland, beer gardens and outdoor restaurants will be allowed to reopen from 6 July, and indoor areas can be used from 15 July. The Welsh government has promised talks with the hospitality sector about a ""potential phased"" reopening, but no dates have yet been given.

"State media said Kim warned against a hasty relaxing of restrictions North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has hailed his country's ""shining success"" in dealing with Covid-19, according to state news agency KCNA. Speaking at a politburo meeting, Mr Kim said the country had ""prevented the inroad of the malignant virus and maintained a stable situation"". North Korea closed its borders and put thousands into isolation six months ago as the virus swept across the globe. It claims that it has no virus cases, though analysts say this is unlikely. Mr Kim is said to have ""analysed in detail the six month-long national emergency anti-epidemic work"" at a politburo meeting on Thursday. He said the success in handling the virus was ""achieved by the far-sighted leadership of the Party Central Committee"". But he stressed the importance of maintaining ""maximum alert without... relaxation on the anti-epidemic front"", adding that the virus was still present in neighbouring countries. ""He repeatedly warned that hasty relief of anti-epidemic measures will result in unimaginable and irretrievable crisis,""said the KCNA report on Friday.,external Has coronavirus spread through North Korea? No-one really knows. The country has been closed off since 30 January. Very few people have made it in or out. The International Federation of the Red Cross had volunteers in the border area working on virus prevention measures and there have been a number of unconfirmed reports of cases within the country. But most accounts of life in the capital in recent weeks appear to show life carrying on as normal. Whatever the reality of the situation, Pyongyang wants to appear confident that it has crushed Covid-19. Domestically this is a strong message that the strict measures Kim Jong-un took to keep the virus at bay have worked. The rest of the world may be in the grip of a pandemic and Mr Kim wants his people to know he has saved them from that. But it has come at a cost. All border traffic has been cut off. That means getting essential supplies into the impoverished state have been impossible. Diplomatic sources have told me that there are stockpiles of PPE and medical supplies, including vaccines built up at the border unable to get through. There were numerous reports of panic-buying of international goods at department stores in Pyongyang. Shelves being stripped bare as produce is restricted. It's also worth noting that only 12 defectors have made it to South Korea between April and June this year - the lowest number on record. The North Korean people may not be suffering from coronavirus, but they are now even more cut off from the outside world. In late January, North Korea moved quickly against the virus - sealing off its borders and later quarantining hundreds of foreigners in the capital, Pyongyang. It also put tens of thousands of its own citizens into isolation and closed schools. North Korea has now reopened schools, but has kept a ban on public gatherings and made it compulsory for people to wear masks in public places, said a Reuters report on 1 July quoting a World Health Organization official. The WHO also reported that the country has now tested just 922 people for the virus - all of whom have reportedly tested negative. North Korea, which shares a long border with China, has long maintained that it has not suffered from a single case of the virus. Scepticism over N Korea's claim to be virus free However, Oliver Hotham, managing editor of specialist news site NK News, told the BBC earlier this year that this was probably not true. ""It's very unlikely that it has seen no cases because it borders China and South Korea. [Especially with China], given the amount of cross border trade... I really don't see how it's possible they could have prevented it,"" he said. ""[But] they really did take precautions early [so] I think its possible they've prevented a full on outbreak."" Scepticism over N Korea's claim to be virus free China concerned over N Korea coronavirus outbreak Could North Korea handle a Covid-19 outbreak?

"This video can not be played The shadow chancellor says the reward for workers after the coronavirus pandemic âcannot be a redundancy noticeâ. More targeted economic support is required to prevent job losses in the wake of Covid-19, the shadow chancellor has said. In a speech, Labour's Anneliese Dodds demanded that job retention schemes be extended in parts of the UK hit by local lockdowns. She called on ministers to end a ""one-size-fits-all approach"" on help to shore up jobs. The chancellor is due to outline an economic support package next week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised to bring forward infrastructure investment to create ""thousands of high-paid high-skilled jobs"". The government's furlough scheme is paying 80% of the wages of more than nine million workers but is due to be pared back from August, and will finish at the end of October. UK businesses cut more than 12,000 jobs in two days This is the moment to be ambitious â PM UK economy hit by worst contraction in 41 years Ms Dodds' speech came after UK companies announcedthousands of job cutsthis week, with many firms cutting jobs now to reduce costs. From 1 August, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension contributions for their staff. They will then have to pay 10% of furloughed employees' salaries from September - rising to 20% in October. In her speech, Ms Dodds blamed the latest round of job losses on the government ""refusing to shift from its one-size-fits-all approach"". She added that workers in struggling sectors ""cannot and should not be treated the same way"" as those in sectors ""already back to full capacity"". ""To avoid the same flood of redundancy notices for workers within smaller companies later on this month, government must act now"". She called on the chancellor to ensure projects announced as part of his recovery package are carbon neutral or help reduce emissions. Ms Dodds also said jobs schemes should be extended in areas in localised lockdown, so that spikes in the virus in there ""don't wash away businesses and jobs in their wake"". The owner of Cafe Rouge became the latest UK firm to announce job cuts on Thursday. In an economic statement on Wednesday next week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is due to set out ""the next stage in our plan to secure the recovery"". In a speech earlier this week, Boris Johnson promised a Â£5bn ""new deal"" to build homes and infrastructure to help aid a post-Covid economic recovery. He also outlined plans for an ""opportunity guarantee"" to ensure every young person had the chance of an apprenticeship or placement. Responding to Ms Dodds' comments, Conservative Party co-chairman Amanda Milling said the government had a ""clear plan to protect and create jobs"". ""Every Labour government has left unemployment higher than when it entered. Sir Keir Starmer would be no different,"" she added. Mr Johnson has insisted the furlough scheme must come to an end in October - saying it would not be ""healthy"" to extend it further. The hospitality sector, including pubs and restaurants, is reopening in Northern Ireland on Friday, with England following on Saturday. In Scotland, beer gardens and outdoor restaurants will be allowed to reopen from 6 July. Indoor areas are due to  follow from 15 July. Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants in Wales are due to be able to reopen outdoors from 13 July.

"Carlos Ghosn fled from Japan to Lebanon last December Japan has asked the US to extradite a former special forces soldier and his son for allegedly helping ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn flee Japan last year. Ex-Green Beret Michael Taylor and his son Peter were held in Massachusetts in May, several months after Japan had issued warrants for their arrest. The US authorities confirmed a formal extradition request was submitted. Mr Ghosn, who was detained in Japan on financial misconduct charges in 2018, made a dramatic escape last year. The former Nissan boss denies the charges against him. Despite being under house arrest and monitored 24 hours a day, on 29 December he managed to fly to the Lebanese capital Beirut via Turkey. How did Carlos Ghosn escape from Japan? The fall of the god of cars Ghosn: Decision to flee was hardest of my life Details of the Taylors' alleged involvement in the escape are unclear. But Japanese prosecutors have said the two were in Japan at the time and helped Mr Ghosn evade security checks as he left. In May,prosecutors in Turkey charged seven people over the escape. The suspects - four pilots, two flight attendants, and an airline executive - are also accused of helping Mr Ghosn flee. They go on trial in Istanbul on Friday, with Turkish prosecutors seeking up to eight years in jail for the four pilots and the airline executive. eJet firm: Rogue employee helped Ghosn flee Nissan seeks $90m damages from Carlos Ghosn Full details of the escape have never been fully explained. Mr Ghosn, who holds Brazilian, French and Lebanese nationalities, ran Renault and Nissan as part of a three-way car alliance. He is accused of misreporting his compensation package, but has insisted he can never get a fair hearing in Japan. Since his arrival in Lebanon, he has told reporters he was a ""hostage"" in Japan, where he was left with a choice between dying there or running. How did Carlos Ghosn escape from Japan?

"Some residents of rural communities have expressed concerns about the return of tourists during the pandemic The five-mile travel limit has been lifted and self-contained holiday accommodation can now reopen as virus restrictions in Scotland are eased. Visits to care homes can also now resume, and physical distancing rules for young people have been relaxed. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged Scots to ""behave responsibly"" and be ""sensitive"" to rural communities. The changes to the travel rulesdo not apply in parts of Dumfries and Gallowaydue to a local outbreak of Covid-19. Further changes to lockdown rules - including the reopening of bars and restaurants - are set to be phased in later in July. Which lockdown rules will change next - and when? Up until today, people in Scotland have been advised against travelling more than five miles from home for leisure purposes. However with the infection rate low and fewer than 1,500 people currently thought to be capable of spreading the virus, this restriction is being eased. Self-catering accommodation which does not have any shared facilities, such as holiday cottages and caravans, can also now reopen. But visitors have been warned thatLoch Lomond & The Trossachs National Park,externalcampsite and camping permit areas remain off limits, despite the easing of the five-mile travel restriction. Car parks and toilets will reopen from Friday in the national park but camping is not expected to be allowed again until 17 July. Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing said the changes were ""good news"" for a ""hard-pressed"" sector, but warned that ""the onus is on all of us to follow the guidance and ensure the virus continues to be suppressed"". The Farmhouse Cafe has been using its Highland cow to assist with social distancing He added: ""When travelling, it is essential that plans are made in advance and checks are done on what facilities are open, like public toilets and car parking availability. ""Please ensure you make use of booking systems where available prior to your journey and avoid busy beaches, parks and forests. If you arrive somewhere and it's crowded, it is essential that you try and find another place."" One cafe owner on the island of Tiree has come up with a novel way of ensuring customers socially-distance as they queue for takeaways. Fiona Armstrong, owner of the Farmhouse Cafe in Balemartine, is using her Highland cow to keep people apart. Brian Fairburn got the chance to visit his mum Moira Fairburn face-to-face for the first time in months Visits to care homes can also resume from Friday, although strict rules will be in place after the facilities were badly hit by the virus. Residents can have one named ""key visitor"" attend if their home has been virus-free for 28 days, but they will have to remain outdoors, 2m (6ft 6in) away and must wear a face covering throughout the visit. At Murray House and Evanthea House care home in Kelso there were no hugs, but lots of smiles as Brian Fairburn got the chance to catch up with his mum Moira face-to-face. ""It's been a long time, because we are used to seeing each other all the time but we can't do anything about it,"" said Moira. ""Things will change but this will have to do for now."" Despite keeping his distance, Brian Fairburn was delighted to see his mother doing so well Son Brian said: ""It was good to see her again and good to see her in such good spirits. It was quite uplifting to see her the way she was."" There have also been changes for young children, with physical distancing rules being scrapped for those under 12 when meeting other children or adults outdoors. Ms Sturgeon said she hoped this move would ""help children enjoy the summer holidays a bit more"" so they could ""play more normally with friends"". Noah, aged 6, was among children able to hug their grandparents for the first time on Friday Meanwhile young people aged 12 to 17 are allowed to meet people from an unlimited number of households in a day, as long as groups do not exceed eight and physical distancing is maintained. Visits to care homes in Scotland to resume in July Distancing rules relaxed for children in Scotland Ms Sturgeon said: ""It is only because so many of us have stuck to the rules so far, that we are able to take these steps out of lockdown. ""And only if we continue to stick to the rules will we be able to drive the virus down further, and live less restricted lives in the weeks and months ahead. ""For more businesses to reopen, for public services to get back to normal, for more of us to be able to meet indoors, for our children to go back to school full-time - all of those collective benefits depend on the decisions we make as individuals now and in the days and weeks to come."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: Kids and teenagers - what are the new rules? Scotland is coming out of lockdown at a slower pace than England, something Ms Sturgeon has said she hopes will be ""more likely to be sustainable than if we went faster"". Outdoor hospitality, such as beer gardens and outdoor areas of cafes, can begin trading again from Monday. Further changes are expected to be confirmed by Ms Sturgeon in a statement at Holyrood on Thursday, 9 July. These will include allowing people to meet with two other households indoors from 10 July, and with extended groups outdoors, as long as physical distancing is maintained. Shopping centres are likely to be allowed to re-open from 13 July, and indoor areas of pubs and restaurants on 15 July. Hairdressers and barbers, museums, galleries, cinemas, monuments and libraries and the rest of the tourist industry will also be able to resume business on that date, subject to the continued suppression of the virus.

"The UN has been under scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct in recent years The United Nations has placed two of its workers on unpaid leave over allegations of sexual misconduct in an official car in Israel. The men were filmed in a UN-marked vehicle on a main street by Tel Aviv's seafront. In the video, a woman in a red dress is seen straddling a man in the back seat of the car. The UN launched an investigation into the 18-second video after it was shared widely on social media last month. StÃ©phane Dujarric, the spokesman for the UN's secretary general,said he was ""shocked and deeply disturbed"" by the footage. Now the UN says the men in the video have been identified as staff members of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), UN military observers based in Israel. The two staff members have been suspended without pay until the investigation into the incident has concluded. Mr Dujarric told the BBC on Thursday their suspension was appropriate ""given the seriousness of the allegations of failing to observe the standards of conduct expected of international civil servants"". ""UNTSO has re-engaged in a robust awareness-raising campaign to remind its personnel of their obligations to the UN Code of Conduct,"" Mr Dujarric said. Third of UN workers sexually harassed UN peacekeepers sexual abuse cases rise The UN has strict policies against sexual misconduct by its staff members. Staff may be disciplined if they are found to be in breach of conduct rules. They may be repatriated or banned from UN peacekeeping operations, but it is the responsibility of their home nation to take further disciplinary or legal action. The UN says it has ""zero tolerance"" for sexual misconduct within its ranks The UN has long been under scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct by its peacekeepers and other staff. There have been frequent allegations in recent years. In 2019, there were 175 allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse against UN staff members,a report said,external. Of those allegations, 16 were substantiated, 15 were unsubstantiated and all others were still being investigated. Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres has pledged to take a ""zero-tolerance"" approach to sexual misconduct within the UN's ranks.
