"The victims had been on a cycle tour of the Central Asian country (file image) Four foreign cyclists killed after a car hit them in Tajikistan on Sunday may have been victims of a deliberate attack, local officials say. Two Americans, a Swiss and a Dutch citizen died on Sunday in the Danghara district, about 70km (43 miles) south-east of the capital Dushanbe. Three other tourists were also injured by the car, which then drove off. Two people suspected of involvement in the incident were later killed by authorities in a special operation. The Islamic State (IS) group has claimed it carried out the attack on ""citizens of the crusader coalition"". According to the interior ministry, another four people were arrested in the same operation and a damaged car believed to have been involved was recovered. Another three suspects were ""rendered harmless"" after being traced to a village, officials said. It is unclear exactly what this means, however, Prague-based privately-owned Tajik news website Akhbor suggested they had been killed. How President Emomali Rakhmon consolidated his power Tajik leader's 'full title' rule comes into force Tajikistan profile Interior Minister Ramazon Rahimzoda said police were looking into various possible reasons for the incident - a road accident, robbery or a ""terrorist act"". He said the suspects ""had knives and firearms"". A video which appears to be of the same incident seems to capture the moment the car is driven into the unsuspecting cyclists. The grainy footage also seems to show a number of people already on the ground. According to the minister, three of the tourists died instantly and one on the way to a nearby hospital. ""One had knife wounds, he received medical help, now his condition is stable,"" Mr Rahimzoda told reporters. ""Another person is in a state of shock, he is receiving medical help as well. A third person, who fell behind the group, was not harmed so he was taken to the local (police) station, questioned and set free."" On Monday, Tajikistan's President Emomali Rakhmon sent notes of condolence to the US, the Netherlands and Switzerland. The victims were on a tour in the Central Asian country in a group with three other tourists from France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. In a statement,,externalthe US embassy in Dushanbe said: ""We can confirm that two American cyclists were killed in the Danghara district on 29 July. Due to privacy concerns, we are unable to share further details."" The Dutch foreign ministry confirmed one of its citizens had died, telling news agency AFP that the man, 56, had been travelling with his 58-year-old partner. Authorities gave no further details about the victims. Tajikistan has struggled with poverty and instability since the former Soviet republic became independent in 1991. It had declared 2018 a ""year of tourism"", AFP said.

"One of the van driver's victims gets drenched A van driver in the Canadian city of Ottawa has been sacked after they were filmed repeatedly splashing pedestrians. Contracting company Black & McDonald said in a Facebook post that the individual concerned is ""no longer employed"" with them after a video of their anti-social behaviour went viral,Canadian broadcaster CBC reports,external. A 45 second clip, filmed on a rear-facing dashcam, shows the unidentified driver veering into the kerb on a rainy day to drench pedestrians at least three times.At the very end of the clip,external, the company's logo is clearly seen on the side of the vehicle. The video has been viewed over 750,000 times, and Black & McDonald subsequently made an apology for their driver's behaviour on its Facebook page. It says: ""We apologise to everyone impacted by the recent incident in Ottawa of unacceptable driving by one of our van drivers... This is an isolated incident and the individual is no longer employed with Black & McDonald."" A spokesperson also said the company had been co-operating with the police over the incident.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""No preconditions, if they want to meet, I'll meet"" Donald Trump has offered to meet Iran's leaders with ""no preconditions"" and ""any time they want"". ""I'd meet with anybody. I believe in meetings,"" the US president told reporters at the White House. Mr Trump's conciliatory approach comes afterhe and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani traded hostile warningsearlier this month. In May, the US left a deal which curbed Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Washington is preparing to re-impose sanctions on Tehran within days - despite objections from the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany, which also signed the 2015 agreement. The US is deeply suspicious of Iranian activity in the Middle East and is an ally of Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of Iran's foes. Trump threatens Iran: Twitter responds Iran faces up to its options Who are the winners and losers? ""If they want to meet, we'll meet,"" Mr Trump said. Hamid Aboutalebi, an adviser to President Rouhani, tweeted in response to Mr Trump that""returning to the nuclear deal"" and ""respecting the Iranian nation's rights"" would pave way for talks,external. Such a meeting would be the first between US and Iranian leaders since before the 1979 Iranian revolution. Mr Trump's abrupt change in tone also echoes the run-up to his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, another diplomatic first, which took place after the two leaders had previously traded insults and threats. This video can not be played Iranian Americans on Trump's policies Shortly afterwards Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he would support a meeting if Iran showed it was willing to change its behaviour. The ""president wants to meet with folks to solve problems"",he told CNBC,external. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter I was sitting in the East Room when Mr Trump said he'd be happy to meet Mr Rouhani, and I was almost not surprised. Most people would be cautious about such a meeting, especially if they'd just got into a word-battle of the kind Mr Trump has engaged in. But from watching Mr Trump over the past two years, I know he has confidence in his abilities as a negotiator and believes people respond well to his ambition. ""People may not always think big themselves,"" he wrote in his 1987 book The Art of the Deal. ""But they can still get very excited by those who do."" His other meetings with controversial leaders may have been problematic. But this hasn't deterred him from trying again. Last week Mr Trump responded angrily to Mr Rouhani, who had earlier warned of the consequences of a conflict with his country. Mr Trump tweeted in capitals that Iran would ""suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before"" if it threatened the US. Mr Rouhani had told Iranian diplomats: ""America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars."" In MayMr Pompeo laid out 12 conditions for any ""new deal"" with Iran, including the withdrawal of its forces from Syria and an end to its support for rebels in Yemen. Mr Trump has consistently opposed the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw the US release billions of dollars of frozen assets in exchange for curbs on Iran's nuclear programme The Trump administration regards Iran as a destabilising force in the Middle East, arguing the nuclear deal enabled Iran to pursue a more assertive regional policy. Iran has sent hundreds of troops and thousands of volunteer militiamen to Syria, and has strengthened its military presence there Gulf states have accused Iran of backing Yemen's Houthi rebels with both money and weapons, though Iran has denied this. Saudi Arabia, a key US ally, is a major adversary of Iran and has repeatedly warned about Iran's intentions In May, Mr Trump called the nuclear accord - or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - a ""horrible, one-sided deal"". He alleged that the deal did not restrict Iran's ""destabilising activities"" in the region enough. Analysts also cited the influence of White House Iran hawks including Mr Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Mr Trump's tendency to target major policies of his predecessor Barack Obama. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has said Iran is honouring its commitments. What is the nuclear accord? Pain for some of Europe's biggest companies Has Iran's economy been better off under the deal? Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, with exports worth billions of dollars each year. It is already feeling economic pressures, and has seen large-scale protests over rising prices and a decline in the value of its currency, the rial.

"Nika Nikulshina, Olga Kurachyova and Olga Pakhtusova were detained shortly after leaving prison Members of the Russian activist group Pussy Riot, jailed after running on to the pitch during the World Cup final, say they have been detained again as they walked free from prison. Pyotr Verzilov, Nika Nikulshina, Olga Kurachyova and Olga Pakhtusova were jailed for 15 days earlier this month. Authorities said they violated the rules for spectators at sporting events and wore police uniforms illegally. Pussy Riot said it was a protest against human rights abuses in Russia. How Pussy Riot managed to burst into final It is unclear exactly why the activists, who have also been banned from attending sports events for three years, have been detained again. Verzilov tweeted that he and the other activists, who were in a different detention centre, were all held as they tried to leave. The group of activists interrupted the World Cup final In a later tweet[in Russian],external, he said they were not facing any charges. ""The Luzhniki police station says that there's an order to keep us in overnight - until some procedures take place in the morning,"" he said. ""They will keep all four (of us) in overnight, the police say. But there are no charges."" The four were originally arrested after interrupting the second half of the Croatia v France match, held in Moscow, Russia, for about 25 seconds on 15 July. They wore police-style uniforms - white shirts, black trousers and epaulettes. One protester managed to do a high-five hand gesture with France star Kylian MbappÃ© before being led off the pitch. Pyotr Verzilov said on Twitter they were being held overnight But Verzilov was grabbed in anger by Croatia defender Dejan Lovren. After the incident Lovren told reporters: ""I just lost my head and I grabbed the guy and I wished I could throw him away from the stadium."" Verzilov later told the BBC they were ""speaking for Russia"". ""Throughout the World Cup, which I really enjoyed, there wasn't a word of political criticism [against the government],"" he said in an interview conducted in jail. ""I categorically disagree with Western countries who call for a boycott of Russian sporting events. But to avoid criticising what's going on in Russia today is wrong.""

"The EU Naval taskforce's current headquarters are in London The UK will lose command of the EU naval task force - set up to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia - as it exits the European Union. The headquarters - currently in Northwood, north London - will move to Rota in Spain, with some operations heading to Brest, in France. The European Council made the move ""following the decision by the UK to withdraw from the EU"". The Ministry of Defence said it was a ""natural consequence"" of Brexit. The BBC understands around 40 UK staff will be found jobs elsewhere. Somali piracy: A broken business model? Is Africa facing a new wave of piracy? Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles The task force - known as EU Navfor - was set up in 2008. The council has extended its mission until 2020, but will continue from its two new hubs from the spring of next year, led by Spanish Vice Admiral Anotnio Martorell Lacave. Its current operational commander, Major General Charlie Stickland, said: ""The transition is being planned with the utmost consideration to ensure it is smooth and seamless with continued cooperation and collaboration with all stakeholders throughout the region."" BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said the move was ""not a surprise to the UK"", which is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, but it is ""still a blow"". He said the statement from EU Navfor left ""no doubt"" that the move was because of Brexit, He added: ""The government has signalled it is still willing to contribute to future EU defence and security operations. ""But this is a sign it won't be easy."" The operation has the backing of 19 EU nations and two partner nations. Member states have contributed warships to protect shipping and to escort World Food Programme vessels providing aid to Somalia. A spokesman from the Ministry of Defence said the leadership of the operation ""has always been and will continue to be a matter for the European Union"". He added: ""The relocation of its headquarters away from Northwood, and a change in the nationality of the mission's commander, are natural consequences of the UK's decision to leave the EU. ""Yet while certain details of our relationship with the EU are changing, our unwavering commitment to European security does not.""

"The man walked towards the student and was captured striking her on the cafe's video A French student has spoken out after she was harassed by a man in a Paris street and then hit in the face when she told him to stop. Marie Laguerre shared CCTV video of the man slapping her outside a cafe in the north-east of the capital. The video has gone viral and coincides with a government push to impose on-the-spot fines for street harassment. ""The first fines should be handed out this autumn,"" said Equalities Minister MarlÃ¨ne Schiappa. Offenders will have to pay between â¬90 (Â£80; $105) and â¬750 under a package of measures that was backed by French MPs in May and is set to complete its passage through parliament this week. The initiative has resonated among French women as the #MeToo movement and its French equivalent #BalanceTonPorc (""rat on your pig"") have gathered pace. Ms Laguerre, 22, had been returning home last Tuesday in the 19th district of Paris when a man started making obscene and degrading comments and ""noises with sexual connotations"", she explained in an interview with French radio on Monday. France plans law on street harassment One French woman in eight raped - report ""It wasn't the first time - that day, that week, or that month, It had been building up. I got angry and said 'shut up'. I didn't think he'd hear, but he did,"" she told French TV. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

At that point the man became angry and threw an ashtray, missing her by inches, she added. After exchanging insults, the man walked towards her and was captured striking her on the cafe's video. ""I know he's going to hit me. I could have run off but there was no question of that. I wasn't going to look down and certainly wasn't going to apologise,"" she said.  He hit her forcefully on the cheek and continued shouting at her. While people sitting in the cafe remonstrated with the man, she went home but quickly decided to go back to the cafe to take witness statements and complain to the police. Everyone at the cafe had found her response normal, she said, and the owner gave her the video to help catch the attacker. It has now been viewed more than a million times. Ms Laguerre said fighting back against such aggression was hard, but all women were affected by it and it was time to say stop. ""I can't keep quiet and we mustn't stay silent,"" she wrote on Facebook. The equalities minister told Le Parisien newspaper she was outraged by the attack and said the aim of the new law was to impose a clear social ban on harassment. She said a number of women had complained of being groped in the street as France celebrated its World Cup victory earlier this month, and called for witnesses to come forward for all cases of sexual assault. Paris prosecutors have responded to the attack on Marie Laguerre by opening an inquiry into sexual harassment and armed violence, although the man has yet to be traced. French psychiatrist Muriel Salmona told the Huffington Post that people may have a mixed reaction when faced with harassment. ""You feel fear, a threat, but also anger and also exasperation. Even more so if it happens several times in the course of one day,"" she explained. Some people may be unable to react because of shock, or what she calls ""emotional amnesia"". Others might not respond because they fear the harasser becoming violent, as happened with Ms Laguerre. Such reactions are completely normal, Ms Salmona says, adding that harassers seek to ""create a state of fear"". Even those who do respond may continue to experience fear or anxiety. Ms Laguerre says that she still feels ""on edge"" following her experience, telling FranceInfo: ""I don't feel very comfortable walking outside."" French anti-harassment group #Stopharcelementderue (Stop Street Harassment) offers the following advice,externalto anyone who finds themselves feeling threatened in a public place: If you feel unsafe, ignore the harasser and go to a safe place such as a shop or restaurant If you feel safe enough, respond calmly and firmly but without apologising It recommends getting support from passers-by or fellow passengers if possible. It warns that insulting the harasser could generate a violent response, but says that should this happen - or if a harasser threatens or follows you - the best response is to contact the police.

"Dani and Jack are the only couple to have stayed together since the first episode A record-breaking 3.6 million people watched Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham win the final of this year's Love Island. More viewers were watching the show on ITV2 than were watching BBC One, BBC Two or ITV in the same time slot. The pair originally ""coupled up"" on the first episode eight weeks ago and walked away with the Â£50,000 prize. Dani Dyer - daughter of actor Danny Dyer - and pen salesman Jack Fincham have remained together ever since, becoming a firm favourite with viewers. So much so, in fact, that the final saw ITV2 reach its biggest ever overnight audience. An average of 2.6 million watched last year's final, which saw Kem Cetinay and Amber Davies triumph. How will the Love Island contestants cash in? Derry cinema packed out for Love Island Dani and Jack held off competition from Laura and Paul (who came second), Kaz and Josh (who came third), and Megan and Wes. ""It's been an amazing experience, I feel so lucky and grateful, it's honestly been amazing,"" Dani told presenter Caroline Flack. ""Everything's been a highlight for me... the ups and downs, you take the good with the bad in here."" After Dani and Jack were announced as the winners, Jack was given the choice of keeping the prize money for himself, or sharing it with Dani. He opted for the latter - meaning the couple will share the Â£50,000. Jack said the moment he realised he was in love with Dani was when the male and female contestants were separated, with the boys being taken off to an alternative villa. ""When I was at Casa Amor I was so down, I was like 'I'm meant to be enjoying this', but I was just having a [rubbish] time,"" Jack said. ""When I was there, I didn't realise how much I'd miss her, and I just thought, you know what, I love her."" Your Love Island questions answered 'I wish I'd never gone on reality TV' Asked what would be their biggest challenge after leaving the villa, Jack joked: ""Living with her."" The pair confirmed they now plan to start house hunting together. Dani and Jack were the bookies' favourite to win. They had one or two hiccups along the way - including the recent lie detector task. But asked whether they now completely trust each other, Jack said: ""One hundred million percent."" The islanders were seen taking part in a salsa dancing class in the final episode of the series The final episode saw the remaining contestants prepare for the Love Island summer ball - which involved a crash course in salsa dancing. The female contestants then went dress shopping ahead of the islanders' final night in the villa. Later that evening, the couples were seen reflecting on their journeys in the villa before making declarations of love. Dani and Laura were seen going dress shopping with the other female contestants The four remaining couples then came together (suitably attired) to make their declarations of love ""Jack, when I first entered the villa eight weeks ago, I never imagined that in a million years I would have met someone as special as you. ""From our first date together on the beach, to our trip in a hot air balloon, we have already made so many special memories, and I can't wait for even more. ""I have had the summer of my life in here and I owe so much of that to you, Jack."" ""You are everything that I've ever wanted in a girl. Getting to know you and fall in love with you has been one of the most wonderful things to ever happen in my life. ""Firstly, you are an absolute sort. You are so caring and selfless, you have such a beautiful smile. ""When I see you happy, it makes me feel a way that I've never felt about someone before."" Wes described the last eight weeks as ""the best summer ever"" Earlier in the episode, Wes Nelson, one of the few contestants to have remained in the villa for the duration of the series, said: ""This has been the best summer ever. ""This has been the best experience ever. And I've met the best girl ever. It's just been one bundle of the best."" On Twitter, Jack and Dani's win went down well with most viewers - although many pointed out it was hardly a surprise. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"James Gunn (right) with the Guardians of the Galaxy cast The Guardians of the Galaxy cast has called for James Gunn to be reinstated as director of the movie after he was sacked this month over old tweets. Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Zoe Saldana and Vin Diesel signed an open letter in support of Gunn. The stars said they were shocked by his removal 10 days ago. The Walt Disney Co fired him from the third movie in the series after tweets from 2008-11 resurfaced in which he joked about rape and paedophilia. WARNING: Some readers may find the language below offensive. Off-screen heroes reveal Marvel magic Who could follow The Avengers' success?

They said they wished to express ""our love, support and gratitude for James"". ""Each of us looks forward to working with our friend James again in the future,"" they wrote. ""James is likely not the last good person to be put on trial,"" the cast members said. ""Given the growing political divide in this country, it's safe to say instances like this will continue, although we hope Americans from across the political spectrum can ease up on the character assassination and stop weaponising mob mentality."" James Gunn has worked on the Guardians of the Galaxy films and the Avengers franchise Pratt added in an Instagram post: ""Although I don't support James Gunn's inappropriate jokes from years ago, he is a good man."" Left-leaning Gunn has been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, and the director's old tweets were identified by conservative critics. Many of the posts, which include jokes about the Holocaust and Aids, are too offensive to be reprinted by the BBC. But one tweet read: ""I like when little boys touch me in my silly place."" Another said: ""The best thing about being raped is when you're done being raped and it's like, 'whew this feels great, not being raped!'"" Guardian star Chris Pratt is one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn said the tweets were ""indefensible"" and ""inconsistent with our studio's values"". Gunn wrote and directed both of the first two Guardians of the Galaxy films. The third film is due out in 2020. The first instalment was one of Marvel's most successful films, reaping $770m (Â£540m) at the worldwide box office. Gunn has also worked on the hugely successful Avengers franchise. The filmmaker issued a statement earlier this month about the scandal. ""I have apologised for humour of mine that hurt people,"" he said. ""I truly felt sorry and meant every word of my apologies."" Some 350,000 people have signed a Change.org petition for Disney to rehire Gunn.

"A man acquitted of rape has lost his Supreme Court appeal to remove any reference to the case from his enhanced criminal records check. The qualified teacher, who cannot be named, was found not guilty of a rape in 2011 after a Crown Court trial. When he applied for a job following his acquittal, details of the allegation and verdict were included in his criminal records certificate. He claims the reference infringed his right to respect for private life. On Monday the Supreme Courtunanimously dismissed the appeal.,externaland ruled that disclosing the man's acquittal was proportionate in the context of his job application. The court ruled that the chief police officer who had decided to include the information about the acquittal on the criminal check form was justified in doing so. But the Supreme Court said the case raises ""more general concerns"", and ""careful thought"" needs to be given when disclosing allegations in cases where the person has later been acquitted. Tutors 'should face criminal checks' Criminal record checks ruled 'unlawful' The man, who is married with children, is a trained teacher but was working as a taxi driver at the time the allegation was made. It was alleged he had raped someone who had been a passenger in his taxi. He said there had never been any sexual contact and he was found not guilty at trial. Following the acquittal, he applied for an Enhanced Criminal Record Certificate (ECRC) - a type of criminal record check for employers, often required for jobs which involve contact with children or vulnerable people. The ECRC was issued with details of the rape charge and not guilty verdict. The man objected to the information being included, arguing he had not been convicted and that it failed to give a full account of the evidence in the trial. He said it infringed his right to respect for private and family life, as well as his right to presumption of innocence. ""When I apply for jobs, this rape allegation is disclosed on my CRB and therefore employers will not consider me,"" the man wrote in a letter in 2011 when he appealed against the criminal record check. The Court of Appeal ruled against him in 2016, saying it was reasonable and proportionate. The man appealed again against the ruling and the case went to the Supreme Court. Handing down the judgment on Monday, Lord Carnwath, sitting with four other justices, said the information about the charge and acquittal ""was in no way secret"" and a ""matter of public record"". But the court said the issues that the case raised ""further consideration outside the scope of this appeal"". Lord Carnwath said there was a lack of information and guidance about how employers should treat criminal records checks which state the person was found not guilty of a charge. ""Even if the ECRC is expressed in entirely neutral terms, there must be a danger that the employer would infer that the disclosure would not have been made unless the chief officer had formed a view of likely guilt,"" he said. Lord Carnwath added: ""We have been shown reports which emphasise the importance of not excluding the convicted from consideration for employment, but they say nothing about the acquitted, who surely deserve greater protection from unfair stigmatisation.""

"The woman, who is from Leeds and is now 20, has had to assume a new identity A husband and wife have been jailed for tricking their daughter into travelling to Bangladesh in order to force her into marriage. The couple were described as ""monsters"" by their daughter who they had threatened to kill if she did not go ahead with the arrangement. The father was jailed for four-and-a-half years and the mother for three-and-a-half years at Leeds Crown Court. None of those involved in the case can be named. More stories from Yorkshire The then 18-year-old daughter had to be rescued from a remote village in an operation by the British High Commission involving armed police, the judge heard, The woman, who is from Leeds and is now aged 20, described in a victim impact statement how she had assumed a new identity and lived in fear of her family. She said: ""I know I will always have to remain cautious but, knowing those monsters are going to be in prison, I feel the uttermost freedom in my heart. ""I want other girls to know that forcing someone to marry is wrong."" The woman was taken to Bangladesh with other family members for what they had been told was a holiday. But the parents had made extensive plans for her wedding to a first cousin. She reacted against the plan and her father hit her, with her mother's encouragement, the court heard. Her father said he would ""chop her up in 18 seconds"" if she continued to reject the proposed marriage, the judge was told. The woman managed to alert the police through her boyfriend in the UK and the court was played some of the messages she left on his phone. Judge Simon Phillips QC said of the recordings: ""Her terror and distress is palpable."" Judge Phillips heard how the woman escaped with only the clothes she was wearing and a Leeds bus pass. The woman said: ""I was betrayed by the two people who are supposed to protect, love and keep you safe."" She was born in the UK, lived a Westernised-lifestyle and was hoping to go to university, the court heard. Dafydd Enoch QC, defending her father, told the court: ""These events are not borne out of malice, hate, greed or prejudice. They were borne of deep-seated culture."" The pair were found guilty of forced marriage and a count of using violence, threats or coercion to force their daughter into marriage, following a three-week trial earlier this year. Peter Mann, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said ""This successful prosecution and the custodial sentences imposed send a clear message that forced marriage is a very serious crime and those responsible will be prosecuted."" It is thought to be only the second case of its kind. A woman was jailed for four-and-a-half yearsat Birmingham Crown Court after forcing her daughter to marry in Pakistan in the first successful prosecution.

"Struggling House of Fraser is understood to have been approached by Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley over a fresh investment deal. The sports chain owns an 11.1% stake in House of Fraser, which last month detailed plans to close 31 of its 59 shops as part of a rescue deal. According to Sky News,,externalHouse of Fraser needs Â£50m to prevent it collapsing. But sources close to the department store chain have denied the chain's survival is under threat. House of Fraser to close 31 stores House of Fraser store closure plan backed Landlords challenge House of Fraser rescue The department store chain has previously said it has no short-term funding issues. Creditors have already backed House of Fraser's restructuring, buta group of landlords is taking them to courtover the plan which has thrown it into doubt. The landlords claim the plan - which will see their rents slashed - is unfair to them. The department store chain is currently awaiting a Â£70m investment from Chinese investor, C.banner, which also owns toy shop Hamley's. C.banner said in May it planned to take a majority stake in House of Fraser, but has said it will not go ahead with the deal until the store closure and rent reduction rescue plan is agreed. Mr Ashley is believed to have approached House of Fraser around four weeks ago, before landlords challenged the retailer's rescue deal. He is understood to have told House of Fraser's advisers he could ""offer something better"" than C.banner. Mr Ashley could not be reached for comment. House of Fraser is using company voluntary arrangements (CVAs), a form of insolvency proceedings, to overhaul its business. CVAs are being increasingly used by struggling retailers as a way to close stores, but landlords argue that they are being abused as a quick way to cut rents. House of Fraser is one of a number of retailers struggling amid falling consumer confidence, rising overheads, the weaker pound and the growth of online shopping. Electronics chain Maplin and toy chain Toys R Us both collapsed into administration earlier this year. Other High Street chains such as Mothercare and Carpetright have been forced to close stores in order to survive. The House of Fraser Group has annual sales of Â£1.2bn. It employs about 5,000 people directly and also has 12,500 concession staff.

"The EU Naval taskforce's current headquarters are in London The UK will lose command of the EU naval task force - set up to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia - as it exits the European Union. The headquarters - currently in Northwood, north London - will move to Rota in Spain, with some operations heading to Brest, in France. The European Council made the move ""following the decision by the UK to withdraw from the EU"". The Ministry of Defence said it was a ""natural consequence"" of Brexit. The BBC understands around 40 UK staff will be found jobs elsewhere. Somali piracy: A broken business model? Is Africa facing a new wave of piracy? Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles The task force - known as EU Navfor - was set up in 2008. The council has extended its mission until 2020, but will continue from its two new hubs from the spring of next year, led by Spanish Vice Admiral Anotnio Martorell Lacave. Its current operational commander, Major General Charlie Stickland, said: ""The transition is being planned with the utmost consideration to ensure it is smooth and seamless with continued cooperation and collaboration with all stakeholders throughout the region."" BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said the move was ""not a surprise to the UK"", which is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, but it is ""still a blow"". He said the statement from EU Navfor left ""no doubt"" that the move was because of Brexit, He added: ""The government has signalled it is still willing to contribute to future EU defence and security operations. ""But this is a sign it won't be easy."" The operation has the backing of 19 EU nations and two partner nations. Member states have contributed warships to protect shipping and to escort World Food Programme vessels providing aid to Somalia. A spokesman from the Ministry of Defence said the leadership of the operation ""has always been and will continue to be a matter for the European Union"". He added: ""The relocation of its headquarters away from Northwood, and a change in the nationality of the mission's commander, are natural consequences of the UK's decision to leave the EU. ""Yet while certain details of our relationship with the EU are changing, our unwavering commitment to European security does not.""

In astatement,external, he said communication with some residents was difficult as some were ""too traumatised"". He added the events had a ""massive emotional impact"" on him. Mr Williams's statement described how he had been handed slips of paper with information provided by residents during their 999 calls. He wrote the details on a wall in the foyer of Grenfell Tower and was attempting to confirm people's identities as they left the building. Grenfell firefighter 'mission' to save girl Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? ""At times I would ask the casualties themselves as they walked past, but communication was difficult as they were either too traumatised to speak or unable to understand due to the language barrier,"" he said. ""There was a woman carrying a little boy. As the woman walked past me crying, I asked them where the rest of their family were, to which the little boy said: 'All dead'."" Later in the night a station manager sent across a new list with details of every person they knew of who still needed rescuing. Mr Williams wrote: ""There were far more numbers on the second list. This clearly showed there was a breakdown in communication."" The fire in North Kensington, west London, killed 72 people on 14 June last year. Mr Williams also told of how firefighters gave their helmets to children. One girl was alone and in her pyjamas as she was being carried out of the building by a fire fighter, Mr Williams, an officer of 18 years' service based at Fulham Fire Station, said. ""She looked to be in shock as her eyes were wide open. To protect her from the falling debris, I gave her my helmet before the firefighter carried her out the main entrance."" He added: ""Shortly after the incident I started to feel really angry that I did not go in and rescue someone. When I was asleep I started to have visualisations of the little girl's face who I had given my helmet to."" Mr Williams acknowledged crews had not received training about safely rescuing someone through ""a toxic environment 20-plus floors high"". He said the absence of a working fire lift meant rescue teams clogged a single stairwell and this ""prevented their ability to fight the fire and conduct rescues"". The foyer of Grenfell Tower became ""heavily congested with fire fighters and casualties"", Mr Williams said. He said being told it was too dangerous to commit rescue crews above the 10th floor ""was difficult for me to hear and I expressed my dissatisfaction"".

"Women in England should be allowed to take abortion pills at home rather than in the clinic, as they already can in Scotland and Wales, experts say. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) is calling on the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, to change legislation and create parity. Current laws require women to take two doses of medication in a clinic to end a pregnancy. This means some experience cramping and bleeds on their journey home. One woman from London, who chose to remain anonymous, told us: ""Within a few minutes, I began miscarrying. I was bleeding heavily and the cramping was disabling. ""My friend had to help me walk from the car to his flat. It was humiliating and unnecessary.  I remember feeling ashamed of myself and that maybe the pain and humiliation was necessary."" RCOG president Prof Lesley Regan said: ""We sincerely hope that one of the first things the new health secretary will do is to demonstrate his commitment to women's health by enabling women to take misoprostol, the second drug used to effect an early medical abortion, at home. ""He has the opportunity to follow Wales and Scotland's compassionate lead, giving women access to the care they want and need."" Anti-abortion group Society for the Protection of Unborn Children Scotland is challenging the changes already introduced in Scotland and says they trivialise abortion and leave women with physical and mental harm. SPUC Scotland chief executive John Deighan said: ""In legal terms we believe the policy is outside the scope of the 1967 Abortion Act, so principally doctors have to act in accordance with the law and so does the Scottish government."" Early medical abortions take place in the first nine weeks of pregnancy and involve two sets of medication. Under the 1967 Abortion Act, terminations can be carried out only on licensed premises. In England, women must take both doses in a clinic or hospital but the Scottish and Welsh governments now permit the final dose to be administered at home. Prof Sharon Cameron, a consultant gynaecologist in Edinburgh, said the changes, which came into effect in Scotland in October 2017, had increased trust between staff and patients. ""Women are hugely appreciative of this service. We know that we are significantly improving the wellbeing of thousands of women requesting an abortion each year in Scotland."" Dr Jonathan Lord, a consultant gynaecologist based in Truro, Cornwall, said some of his patients had not made it home in time after taking the medication in his clinics. ""In a rural community such as Cornwall, where the travel times can be quite long and some of our patients are wholly reliant on public transport, it means they can be caught short on the journey home. ""Whereas if they were allowed to take the tablets at home, they have the privacy of their own home but also they don't have the incredible trauma and embarrassment of losing the abortion on public transport."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""Around 180,000 women have an abortion each year in England - our priority is always to ensure that care is safe and of a high quality. We will continue to monitor the evidence surrounding home-use.""

"Nika Nikulshina, Olga Kurachyova and Olga Pakhtusova were detained shortly after leaving prison Members of the Russian activist group Pussy Riot, jailed after running on to the pitch during the World Cup final, say they have been detained again as they walked free from prison. Pyotr Verzilov, Nika Nikulshina, Olga Kurachyova and Olga Pakhtusova were jailed for 15 days earlier this month. Authorities said they violated the rules for spectators at sporting events and wore police uniforms illegally. Pussy Riot said it was a protest against human rights abuses in Russia. How Pussy Riot managed to burst into final It is unclear exactly why the activists, who have also been banned from attending sports events for three years, have been detained again. Verzilov tweeted that he and the other activists, who were in a different detention centre, were all held as they tried to leave. The group of activists interrupted the World Cup final In a later tweet[in Russian],external, he said they were not facing any charges. ""The Luzhniki police station says that there's an order to keep us in overnight - until some procedures take place in the morning,"" he said. ""They will keep all four (of us) in overnight, the police say. But there are no charges."" The four were originally arrested after interrupting the second half of the Croatia v France match, held in Moscow, Russia, for about 25 seconds on 15 July. They wore police-style uniforms - white shirts, black trousers and epaulettes. One protester managed to do a high-five hand gesture with France star Kylian MbappÃ© before being led off the pitch. Pyotr Verzilov said on Twitter they were being held overnight But Verzilov was grabbed in anger by Croatia defender Dejan Lovren. After the incident Lovren told reporters: ""I just lost my head and I grabbed the guy and I wished I could throw him away from the stadium."" Verzilov later told the BBC they were ""speaking for Russia"". ""Throughout the World Cup, which I really enjoyed, there wasn't a word of political criticism [against the government],"" he said in an interview conducted in jail. ""I categorically disagree with Western countries who call for a boycott of Russian sporting events. But to avoid criticising what's going on in Russia today is wrong.""

"Some people joined queues at 02:00 local time waiting for the polls to open at 07:00 local time Voter turnout was 75% in Zimbabwe's first general election since long-serving ruler Robert Mugabe was ousted, officials say. Polls have closed and counting is now under way. It is expected to be a tight contest between the incumbent Emmerson Mnangagwa and his main rival, Nelson Chamisa. Foreign observers have hailed the election as an opportunity for Zimbabwe to break with its repressive past. The official result is due within five days. A run-off election will be held on 8 September should none of the 23 candidates win more than 50% of the votes. Parliamentary and local elections were also taking place on Monday. Polls officially shut at 17:00 GMT but some remained open to allow people already in queues to vote. This video can not be played Why Zimbabwe's election is historic Opinion polls gave Mr Mnangagwa, who heads the ruling Zanu-PF party, a narrow lead over Mr Chamisa, the candidate of the opposition MDC Alliance. Both leaders are running for the presidency for the first time. Voting as it happened Can post-Mugabe vote heal divisions? 'Magic owls' and other things about Zimbabwe's election On Sunday, Mr Mugabe, who first came to power after independence in 1980, said he would not vote for his successor. Mr Mugabe, regarded as one of the last ""Big Men"" of African politics, was forced out of office last November by Mr Mnangagwa with the help of the military. By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News In Domboshawa village, about an hour's car drive from the capital, Harare, many had been in the queue even before sunrise. The first group of voters were mainly elderly people but there were some youngsters too. Surrounded by mountains and rolling hills, the villagers were in good spirits, chatting and laughing, as they waited to vote in a primary school that had been converted into a polling station. This video can not be played What do voters in rural Zimbabwe want? Having covered the 2008 and 2013 election, I met families who shared horrid stories of assault and intimidation for pledging allegiance to any party other than Zanu-PF. But there is an air of optimism about this election. ""This election is different, there hasn't been violence. It's a good sign,"" one voter told me. Crowds whistled and broke into chants of ""Chamisa"" when the 40-year-old MDC leader cast his ballot on the outskirts of Harare, amidst a media scrum. Nelson Chamisa hopes to become Zimbabwe's youngest president ""We will win this election to the extent it's free and fair... it's a done deal,"" he told the BBC. He later alleged on Twitter that long queues in Harare suggested a ""deliberate attempt to suppress and frustrate the urban vote"". Allow Twitter content?

In contrast, Mr Mnangagwa, thought to be 75, voted in a quiet polling station at a school in the central city of Kwekwe. At one stage, he was seen taking his head out of the voting booth to check where he should put his cross on the ballot. President Emmerson Mnangagwa is trying to rebuild Zimbabwe's credibility in the West After the polls closed, he tweeted that Zimbabweans had ""voted in the spirit of tolerance, mutual respect and peace"". He urged citizens to be patient and wait for the official result to be declared. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The country expected a high turnout of first-time voters. More than 5.6 million Zimbabweans were registered, almost half of those under the age of 35. People had to re-register for this year's poll as the electoral commission introduced a biometric system to eliminate any ""ghost voters"" - though the opposition still alleges there are irregularities in the voters' roll. The Zimbabwe Election Commission (Zec) says it will deliver a credible poll. Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zanu-PF Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his party faction is known as ""Lacoste"" Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after the 2008 election Thought to be 75 years old, he promises to deliver jobs, and is seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on supporters of ex-President Mugabe. The 'crocodile' who snapped back Nelson Chamisa, MDC Alliance His skull was fractured when beaten up by state security agents in 2007 Became an MP at 25, a cabinet minister at 31 and could become the youngest president at 40 A recently qualified pastor, he has been using the hashtag #GodIsInIt for his campaign Has promised to rebuild the country's devastated economy, but has been criticised for making extravagant promises - such as the introduction of a high-speed bullet train and bringing the Olympics to Zimbabwe. The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Hundreds of international observers were deployed for the first time in 16 years to ensure the vote went smoothly. European Union (EU) chief observer Elmar Brok said it was too soon to make a judgement but voting had been ""very smooth"" in some areas, and ""totally disorganised"" in other areas, Reuters news agency reports. As well as worries about the voters' roll, the opposition has expressed concern over the security of ballot papers and voter intimidation in mainly rural areas. More than 5.6 million voters have registered Liberia's former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who was monitoring the poll on behalf of the US-based National Democratic Institute, told the BBC that the long queues showed Zimbabweans were enthusiastic about voting, without any kind of repression. ""I think this is an exciting moment for Zimbabweans to change the course of their country through their votes,"" she told the BBC. Mr Mnangagwa invited the observers as part of his attempts to end Zimbabwe's isolation, and to secure investments to rebuild the shattered economy. Mr Mugabe had a poor relationship with Western powers, accusing them of undermining Zimbabwe's sovereignty and trying to topple him. Hustling for cash to survive Is it easier to poke fun after Mugabe? The story behind the scarf There is an overwhelming sense, especially among young people, that Mr Mugabe, 94, is out of touch, and a new Zimbabwe is waiting to be born, our correspondent says. He voted with his wife Grace and daughter Bona in Highfield, a high-density township in Harare - the first time he will have voted for a presidential candidate other than himself. This video can not be played Robert Mugabe refused to back Emmerson Mnangagwa On Sunday,Mr Mugabe gave a surprise news conferencewhere he refused to support his former ally Mr Mnangagwa, indicating Mr Chamisa was the only viable candidate. ""I cannot vote for those who tormented me... I hope the choice of voting tomorrow will thrust away the military government and bring us back to constitutionality,"" Mr Mugabe said.

"The firm is reinstating 75% of the routes it withdrew after its new timetable caused disruption. Services scrapped after a timetable shake-up at Northern rail have begun running again, but passengers have faced more cancellations. Northernremoved 168 services last month to try to relieve chaoscaused by the timetable's introduction in May. The train company said 30 services were cancelled on Monday as of 16:00 BST, with nine due to a signal failure. But the Northern Fail app, run by a passenger, said 53 trains were fully or partially cancelled by 10:00.

The remaining 25% of its cancelled services will not restart until September. Meanwhile, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has written to the prime minister asking her to personally intervene over the ""chaos"" caused by Northern this summer. Downing Street said Theresa May understands the ""anger and frustration"" of rail travellers and believes the continuing delays are unacceptable.

Rise in late trains since new timetables Rail timetable chaos inquiry launched Over the summer thousands of passengers have applied for compensation from Northern, which made the first pay-outs last week. Northern, which hasfaced calls for it to be stripped of its franchise, says a ""more gradual"" reintroduction of its timetable will ensure a more stable and reliable service. Northern said some of those cancellations have been because of signalling problems which is the responsibility of Network Rail. The firm also blamed ""other infrastructure problems"". David Brown, managing director at Northern said the cancellations since 4 June had been an attempt to alleviate ""significant disruption"" caused by the nationwide introduction of the new timetable in May. He said: ""Whilst we are ready to reintroduce all 168 daily services, given the need to drive further improvements across Manchester, we have agreed to a more gradual reintroduction of our services."" He said it had been ""working hard"" to ensure customers ""experience stable and reliable journeys today"". ""Whilst we have experienced a few local operational issues, as we do every day, so far the vast majority of services are running to plan,"" he said. ""As at 4pm we have had to cancel 30 services - of around 1,500 we would have operated across our entire network - with nine of these relating to issues with lineside equipment.""

One frustrated commuter told us her train from Lytham never materialised adding: ""First day of the new timetable and it's out of the window."" Indeed the departure boards did show a number of cancellations and delays, though not nearly as many as in previous weeks. Another traveller told us hopefully: ""Maybe the recent trouble has just been a blip."" Mayor Andy Burnham said: ""People could have legitimately expected, when fewer trains were running, that at least the ones that were running would be on time, well they haven't been. The emergency timetable didn't solve anything. ""And then on Saturday night, nine o'clock an email lands saying Northern will cancel 47 services tomorrow so we can get trains in the right place for Monday morning. ""Even if trains do run better today it's because there were no services yesterday.

"The UK's modern slavery legislation is to be reviewed as criminal gangs find new ways to exploit victims, the Home Office has announced. Laws introduced in 2015 included tougher sentences and more help for people forced into labouring, domestic servitude, sex work and other tasks. Ministers say about 600 investigations are now taking place into offences. The government also wants businesses to do more to tackle modern slavery in their supply chains. The independent review is to be run by MPs Frank Field and Maria Miller and Baroness Butler-Sloss, the former president of the Family Division of the High Court. The Home Office says research has found modern slavery costs the UK up to Â£4.3bn a year - made up of victim support, victims' lost earnings and law enforcement. It said officials were seeing new forms of exploitation that fell under the definition of modern slavery such as children being forced to commit crimes for gangs and the recruitment of rough sleepers. A spokesperson said: ""The criminal networks that recruit and control victims are constantly adapting and finding new ways to exploit victims, and the commissioning of this independent review is an opportunity to enhance the UK's legislation to effectively tackle this issue. ""Key areas of focus for the review will be developing an understanding on the nature of modern slavery offences, the provisions around legal access and compensation to victims and improving the support given to child victims."" Victoria Atkins, Minister for Crime Safeguarding and Vulnerability, said: ""It is our responsibility as citizens, businesses and governments to do all we can to stop exploitation. ""This independent review will help us identify what more we can do to tackle this terrible, global injustice by enhancing the Modern Slavery Act where necessary."" While the majority of regulations in theModern Slavery Act 2015,externalonly cover England and Wales, certain areas - including protections for overseas domestic workers and rules relating to business transparency - do extend to Scotland and Northern Ireland. The transparency provision requires companies with an annual turnover of more than Â£36m to publish a statement on their website outlining what they are doing to prevent and tackle modern slavery. The Home Office said the review will look at what can be done to strengthen the legislation to ""minimise the risk that the goods and services available in the UK are produced through forced labour and slavery"". It also said there will be further funding of Â£2m for a scheme that works with trafficked child victims of modern slavery, in partnership with the charity Barnardo's. The scheme will begin in the West Midlands in the autumn, joining existing projects in Greater Manchester, Hampshire and Wales.

"This video can not be played Living in limbo: Assam's four million unwanted India has published a list which effectively strips about four million people in the north-eastern state of Assam of their citizenship. The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a list of people who can prove they came to the state by 24 March 1971, a day before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence. India says the process is needed to identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants. But it has sparked fears of a witch hunt against Assam's ethnic minorities. Fearing violence, officials say that no-one will face immediate deportation. They say that a lengthy appeal process will be available to all - even if it means millions of families will live in limbo until they get a final decision on their legal status. Millions of people fled to neighbouring India after Bangladesh declared itself an independent country from Pakistan on 26 March 1971, sparking a bitter war. Many of the refugees settled in Assam. Under the Assam Accord, an agreement signed by then PM Rajiv Gandhi in 1985, all those who cannot prove that they came to the north-eastern state before 24 March 1971 will be deleted from electoral rolls and expelled as they are not considered legitimate citizens. More than 32 million people submitted documents to the NRC to prove they were citizens, but four million of them have been excluded from the published list. What next for India's four million 'stateless'? What lies behind Assam violence? Many Bengalis - a linguistic minority in Assam - are worried they will be deported en masse. Hasitun Nissa, who spoke to the BBC's Joe Miller days before the list was published, said she had never known a home outside the state's floodplains. It is where the 47-year-old schoolteacher spent her childhood, where she studied, where she got married and where she had her four children. She said her family arrived in India before 1971 but she expected to be stripped of her Indian citizenship and feared her land rights, voting rights and freedom would be in peril. Four million people have been excluded from the list, which throws their citizenship into doubt Activists say the NRC is now being used as a pretext for a two-pronged attack - by Hindu nationalists and Assamese hardliners - on the state's Bengali community, a large portion of whom are Muslims. Like Hasitun, many Bengalis live in the wetlands dotted along the Bramaputra river, moving around when water levels rise. Their paperwork, if it exists, is often inaccurate. Officials claim illegal Bangladeshis are enmeshed in the Bengali population, often hiding in plain sight with forged papers - and a thorough examination of all documents is the only way to find them. Myanmar Rohingya: What you need to know about the crisis Why Narendra Modi remains star BJP vote-catcher But Bengali campaigner Nazrul Ali Ahmed is adamant that the NRC is serving another agenda entirely. ""It is nothing but a conspiracy to commit atrocities,"" he told the BBC. ""They are openly threatening to get rid of Muslims, and what happened to the Rohingya in Myanmar, could happen to us here."" Such alarming comparisons are dismissed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which emphasises that the NRC is an apolitical task, overseen by the country's secular Supreme Court. Soutik Biswas, BBC News, Delhi The latest move to make millions of people stateless overnight has sparked fears of violence in what is already a tinderbox state. Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the state, has insisted in the past that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported. But neighbouring Bangladesh will definitely not accede to such a request. Chances are India will end up creating the newest cohort of stateless people, raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo the Rohingya people who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. Read more from Soutik here After human rights organisations began to express concern, the civil servant in charge of the NRC, Prateek Hajela, released a statement stressing that the law required him to make ""no differentiation on the basis of religion or language"" in determining citizenship. But correspondents say the prime minister has never been shy of expressing his preference for Hindu Bangladeshi migrants, whom he says should be embraced by India. Other ""infiltrators"", Mr Modi told a crowd in 2014, would be deported. Activists allege that the list is a ""conspiracy"" to commit atrocities His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is considering a bill that would enshrine the rights of Hindu migrants in law. Indeed, a promotional song posted on Facebook by the NRC itself does little to calm the nerves of those worried about a Hindu nationalist witch hunt. ""A new revolution, to defeat the alien enemy, is beckoning,"" a young woman sings, ""bravely let us shield our motherland."" Siddhartha Bhattacharya, Assam's law minister and a member of the BJP, is in no doubt about the fate of those who have been rejected. ""Everyone will be given a right to prove their citizenship,"" he told the BBC. ""But if they fail to do so, well, the legal system will take its own course."" That, Mr Bhattacharya clarified, would mean expulsion from India. Questions of identity and citizenship have long vexed a vast number of people living in Assam At present, correspondents say, that seems little more than a threat aimed at whipping up Hindu support for the BJP ahead of elections. No deportation procedures have been put in place, and Bangladesh, already burdened by the Rohingya crisis, has shown no sign of being open to accepting a raft of new refugees. Nonetheless, campaigners like Samujjal Bhattacharyya say something must be done. His organisation, the All Assam Students' Union, has been agitating for the expulsion of illegal Bangladeshis - regardless of their religion - for decades. If deportations don't happen, he says, ""the illegal foreigner will intrude upon the corridor of power. We are not prepared to be second-class citizens"". Hasitun Nissa takes such rhetoric seriously. ""We have never harmed Hindus. We can live peacefully side-by-side,"" she says. ""But I fear bad news will come.""

"Dawn Sturgess' coffin was brought to the crematorium with a flower arrangement saying, ""Mum"". A ""very emotional service"" has taken place in Salisbury as family said goodbye to Dawn Sturgess, who died from exposure to the nerve agent Novichok. Over 100 people attended the ceremony, including her partner Charlie Rowley, who was also exposed to the agent. The Rev Philip Bromiley, who led the service, said Ms Sturgess ""won't be defined"" as a person by the tragic circumstances of her death. Her 11-year-old daughter told mourners how much she loved her mother. Public Health England had advised the funeral directors ahead of the ceremony, but reiterated itsadvice,externalthat risk to the public was low. Earlier reports that there would be no pallbearers were incorrect, and Ms Sturgess' coffin was carried into the crematorium. Ms Sturgess, 44, died on 8 July after she and Mr Rowley, 45, were exposed to Novichok the week before in Amesbury, Wiltshire. What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Police 'identify Novichok suspects' Mr Bromiley told the BBC that Mr Rowley was sitting on the front row throughout and Ms Sturgess' sister, Claire, delivered her eulogy. After Ms Sturgess' 11-year-old daughter read to the mourners, she received a round of applause. Speaking after the funeral, Mr Bromiley said: ""I think there was a lot of shock, but there were moments of laughter and moments of being able to remember who Dawn really was. ""Dawn won't be defined by being a story in a tragic set of circumstances. ""She was a mum and she was a person, and it was that person we commended to God today."" Dawn Sturgess died on 8 July High by James Blunt was played at the start of the service, and it ended with the title song from the musical Fame. Mr Bromiley said the theme of the funeral was peace. He added: ""Peace for her family, for her friends and the city of Salisbury and the surrounding towns and villages affected by the chaotic last few months."" Ms Sturgess' family and her partner attended the funeral The chief constable of Wiltshire Police, Kier Pritchard, also said he would be attending, along with deputy chief constable Paul Mills and the police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire, Angus Macpherson. The poisoning of Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess came four months after the case of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The Skripals were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury in March after coming into contact with Novichok. They have since been discharged from hospital. Mr Rowley left hospital on 20 July Ms Sturgess lived in Salisbury, and the couple had been in the city before going to Mr Rowley's flat in nearby Amesbury on 29 June. They collapsed after exposure to the nerve agent at his house on 30 June. A murder inquiry was launched after Ms Sturgess' death. Mr Rowleytold ITV News,externalhe had earlier found a sealed bottle of perfume and gave it to his partner, who sprayed the substance on her wrists. Police refused to confirm Mr Rowley's claim but had previously said the substance was found in a ""small bottle"". The UK government has blamed Russia for the attack on the pair in March, but the country's authorities deny any involvement.

Public Health England had advised the funeral directors ahead of the ceremony, but reiterated itsadvice,externalthat risk to the public was low. Earlier reports that there would be no pallbearers were incorrect, and Ms Sturgess' coffin was carried into the crematorium. Ms Sturgess, 44, died on 8 July after she and Mr Rowley, 45, were exposed to Novichok the week before in Amesbury, Wiltshire. What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Police 'identify Novichok suspects' Mr Bromiley told the BBC that Mr Rowley was sitting on the front row throughout and Ms Sturgess' sister, Claire, delivered her eulogy. After Ms Sturgess' 11-year-old daughter read to the mourners, she received a round of applause. Speaking after the funeral, Mr Bromiley said: ""I think there was a lot of shock, but there were moments of laughter and moments of being able to remember who Dawn really was. ""Dawn won't be defined by being a story in a tragic set of circumstances. ""She was a mum and she was a person, and it was that person we commended to God today."" Dawn Sturgess died on 8 July High by James Blunt was played at the start of the service, and it ended with the title song from the musical Fame. Mr Bromiley said the theme of the funeral was peace. He added: ""Peace for her family, for her friends and the city of Salisbury and the surrounding towns and villages affected by the chaotic last few months."" Ms Sturgess' family and her partner attended the funeral The chief constable of Wiltshire Police, Kier Pritchard, also said he would be attending, along with deputy chief constable Paul Mills and the police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire, Angus Macpherson. The poisoning of Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess came four months after the case of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The Skripals were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury in March after coming into contact with Novichok. They have since been discharged from hospital. Mr Rowley left hospital on 20 July Ms Sturgess lived in Salisbury, and the couple had been in the city before going to Mr Rowley's flat in nearby Amesbury on 29 June. They collapsed after exposure to the nerve agent at his house on 30 June. A murder inquiry was launched after Ms Sturgess' death. Mr Rowleytold ITV News,externalhe had earlier found a sealed bottle of perfume and gave it to his partner, who sprayed the substance on her wrists. Police refused to confirm Mr Rowley's claim but had previously said the substance was found in a ""small bottle"". The UK government has blamed Russia for the attack on the pair in March, but the country's authorities deny any involvement.

"Some people joined queues at 02:00 local time waiting for the polls to open at 07:00 local time Voter turnout was 75% in Zimbabwe's first general election since long-serving ruler Robert Mugabe was ousted, officials say. Polls have closed and counting is now under way. It is expected to be a tight contest between the incumbent Emmerson Mnangagwa and his main rival, Nelson Chamisa. Foreign observers have hailed the election as an opportunity for Zimbabwe to break with its repressive past. The official result is due within five days. A run-off election will be held on 8 September should none of the 23 candidates win more than 50% of the votes. Parliamentary and local elections were also taking place on Monday. Polls officially shut at 17:00 GMT but some remained open to allow people already in queues to vote. This video can not be played Why Zimbabwe's election is historic Opinion polls gave Mr Mnangagwa, who heads the ruling Zanu-PF party, a narrow lead over Mr Chamisa, the candidate of the opposition MDC Alliance. Both leaders are running for the presidency for the first time. Voting as it happened Can post-Mugabe vote heal divisions? 'Magic owls' and other things about Zimbabwe's election On Sunday, Mr Mugabe, who first came to power after independence in 1980, said he would not vote for his successor. Mr Mugabe, regarded as one of the last ""Big Men"" of African politics, was forced out of office last November by Mr Mnangagwa with the help of the military. By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News In Domboshawa village, about an hour's car drive from the capital, Harare, many had been in the queue even before sunrise. The first group of voters were mainly elderly people but there were some youngsters too. Surrounded by mountains and rolling hills, the villagers were in good spirits, chatting and laughing, as they waited to vote in a primary school that had been converted into a polling station. This video can not be played What do voters in rural Zimbabwe want? Having covered the 2008 and 2013 election, I met families who shared horrid stories of assault and intimidation for pledging allegiance to any party other than Zanu-PF. But there is an air of optimism about this election. ""This election is different, there hasn't been violence. It's a good sign,"" one voter told me. Crowds whistled and broke into chants of ""Chamisa"" when the 40-year-old MDC leader cast his ballot on the outskirts of Harare, amidst a media scrum. Nelson Chamisa hopes to become Zimbabwe's youngest president ""We will win this election to the extent it's free and fair... it's a done deal,"" he told the BBC. He later alleged on Twitter that long queues in Harare suggested a ""deliberate attempt to suppress and frustrate the urban vote"". Allow Twitter content?

In contrast, Mr Mnangagwa, thought to be 75, voted in a quiet polling station at a school in the central city of Kwekwe. At one stage, he was seen taking his head out of the voting booth to check where he should put his cross on the ballot. President Emmerson Mnangagwa is trying to rebuild Zimbabwe's credibility in the West After the polls closed, he tweeted that Zimbabweans had ""voted in the spirit of tolerance, mutual respect and peace"".

The country expected a high turnout of first-time voters. More than 5.6 million Zimbabweans were registered, almost half of those under the age of 35. People had to re-register for this year's poll as the electoral commission introduced a biometric system to eliminate any ""ghost voters"" - though the opposition still alleges there are irregularities in the voters' roll. The Zimbabwe Election Commission (Zec) says it will deliver a credible poll. Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zanu-PF Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his party faction is known as ""Lacoste"" Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after the 2008 election Thought to be 75 years old, he promises to deliver jobs, and is seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on supporters of ex-President Mugabe. The 'crocodile' who snapped back Nelson Chamisa, MDC Alliance His skull was fractured when beaten up by state security agents in 2007 Became an MP at 25, a cabinet minister at 31 and could become the youngest president at 40 A recently qualified pastor, he has been using the hashtag #GodIsInIt for his campaign Has promised to rebuild the country's devastated economy, but has been criticised for making extravagant promises - such as the introduction of a high-speed bullet train and bringing the Olympics to Zimbabwe. The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Hundreds of international observers were deployed for the first time in 16 years to ensure the vote went smoothly. European Union (EU) chief observer Elmar Brok said it was too soon to make a judgement but voting had been ""very smooth"" in some areas, and ""totally disorganised"" in other areas, Reuters news agency reports. As well as worries about the voters' roll, the opposition has expressed concern over the security of ballot papers and voter intimidation in mainly rural areas. More than 5.6 million voters have registered Liberia's former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who was monitoring the poll on behalf of the US-based National Democratic Institute, told the BBC that the long queues showed Zimbabweans were enthusiastic about voting, without any kind of repression. ""I think this is an exciting moment for Zimbabweans to change the course of their country through their votes,"" she told the BBC. Mr Mnangagwa invited the observers as part of his attempts to end Zimbabwe's isolation, and to secure investments to rebuild the shattered economy. Mr Mugabe had a poor relationship with Western powers, accusing them of undermining Zimbabwe's sovereignty and trying to topple him. Hustling for cash to survive Is it easier to poke fun after Mugabe? The story behind the scarf There is an overwhelming sense, especially among young people, that Mr Mugabe, 94, is out of touch, and a new Zimbabwe is waiting to be born, our correspondent says. He voted with his wife Grace and daughter Bona in Highfield, a high-density township in Harare - the first time he will have voted for a presidential candidate other than himself. This video can not be played Robert Mugabe refused to back Emmerson Mnangagwa On Sunday,Mr Mugabe gave a surprise news conferencewhere he refused to support his former ally Mr Mnangagwa, indicating Mr Chamisa was the only viable candidate. ""I cannot vote for those who tormented me... I hope the choice of voting tomorrow will thrust away the military government and bring us back to constitutionality,"" Mr Mugabe said.

"The owner of the Mirror and Express newspapers has slumped to a Â£113m half-year loss after slashing the value of its regional publishing operations. Reach, formerly known as Trinity Mirror, said the Â£150m charge reflected a ""more challenging outlook"" for its regional businesses. They include the Manchester Evening News, Daily Record and Liverpool Echo. The results are the first since Reach completed its takeover of the Express and Star titles from Richard Desmond. The Â£113.5m pre-tax loss for the 26 weeks to 1 July, compares with a profit of Â£38.2m for the same period last year. Adjusted pre-tax profit for the UK's biggest news publisher rose Â£3.4m to Â£64.7m. Group revenue rose by 10.6% to Â£353.8m reflecting the acquisition of the Express and Star, but fell by 7.2% on a like-for-like basis. The fall partly reflected the company handing back two regional Metro titles to Daily Mail owner DMGT in the period. Sales of Reach's national newspapers plunged in the first half, with circulation for the Daily Mirror down 13.9%, a 12.1% fall for the Daily Star and a 9.3% slide for the Daily Express. The overall UK national tabloid newspaper market declined by 9.3% in the period. Mirror buys Express titles More big losses for Johnston Press The Sunday Mirror was down 14.8%, the Sunday People fell 16.4%, with 8.3% and 9.2% declines for the Sunday Express and Star titles respectively. Simon Fox, chief executive, said Reach had delivered a positive performance in a ""difficult trading environment"". He was ""reasonably optimistic"" about the prospects of the regional titles despite the writedown and said they had a long-term future digitally. Reach had no plans to close print editions ""at the moment"" and is opening digital titles in areas such asLeeds,externaland Edinburgh where it had no print titles, Mr Fox added. The company was on track to deliver the savings of Â£20m it expected from integrating the Express and Star titles, but needed growth in digital revenues to offset the continued decline from its print products, he said. Shares in Reach fell 2.6% in afternoon trading to 70.8p, valuing the company at almost Â£215m. In April Johnston Press, publisher of newspapers including the i, the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post,posted a pre-tax loss of Â£95m for last year. That was down from a Â£301m loss in 2016 after slashing the value of its titles.

"A man acquitted of rape has lost his Supreme Court appeal to remove any reference to the case from his enhanced criminal records check. The qualified teacher, who cannot be named, was found not guilty of a rape in 2011 after a Crown Court trial. When he applied for a job following his acquittal, details of the allegation and verdict were included in his criminal records certificate. He claims the reference infringed his right to respect for private life. On Monday the Supreme Courtunanimously dismissed the appeal.,externaland ruled that disclosing the man's acquittal was proportionate in the context of his job application. The court ruled that the chief police officer who had decided to include the information about the acquittal on the criminal check form was justified in doing so. But the Supreme Court said the case raises ""more general concerns"", and ""careful thought"" needs to be given when disclosing allegations in cases where the person has later been acquitted. Tutors 'should face criminal checks' Criminal record checks ruled 'unlawful' The man, who is married with children, is a trained teacher but was working as a taxi driver at the time the allegation was made. It was alleged he had raped someone who had been a passenger in his taxi. He said there had never been any sexual contact and he was found not guilty at trial. Following the acquittal, he applied for an Enhanced Criminal Record Certificate (ECRC) - a type of criminal record check for employers, often required for jobs which involve contact with children or vulnerable people. The ECRC was issued with details of the rape charge and not guilty verdict. The man objected to the information being included, arguing he had not been convicted and that it failed to give a full account of the evidence in the trial. He said it infringed his right to respect for private and family life, as well as his right to presumption of innocence. ""When I apply for jobs, this rape allegation is disclosed on my CRB and therefore employers will not consider me,"" the man wrote in a letter in 2011 when he appealed against the criminal record check. The Court of Appeal ruled against him in 2016, saying it was reasonable and proportionate. The man appealed again against the ruling and the case went to the Supreme Court. Handing down the judgment on Monday, Lord Carnwath, sitting with four other justices, said the information about the charge and acquittal ""was in no way secret"" and a ""matter of public record"". But the court said the issues that the case raised ""further consideration outside the scope of this appeal"". Lord Carnwath said there was a lack of information and guidance about how employers should treat criminal records checks which state the person was found not guilty of a charge. ""Even if the ECRC is expressed in entirely neutral terms, there must be a danger that the employer would infer that the disclosure would not have been made unless the chief officer had formed a view of likely guilt,"" he said. Lord Carnwath added: ""We have been shown reports which emphasise the importance of not excluding the convicted from consideration for employment, but they say nothing about the acquitted, who surely deserve greater protection from unfair stigmatisation.""

"This video can not be played Living in limbo: Assam's four million unwanted India has published a list which effectively strips about four million people in the north-eastern state of Assam of their citizenship. The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a list of people who can prove they came to the state by 24 March 1971, a day before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence. India says the process is needed to identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants. But it has sparked fears of a witch hunt against Assam's ethnic minorities. Fearing violence, officials say that no-one will face immediate deportation. They say that a lengthy appeal process will be available to all - even if it means millions of families will live in limbo until they get a final decision on their legal status. Millions of people fled to neighbouring India after Bangladesh declared itself an independent country from Pakistan on 26 March 1971, sparking a bitter war. Many of the refugees settled in Assam. Under the Assam Accord, an agreement signed by then PM Rajiv Gandhi in 1985, all those who cannot prove that they came to the north-eastern state before 24 March 1971 will be deleted from electoral rolls and expelled as they are not considered legitimate citizens. More than 32 million people submitted documents to the NRC to prove they were citizens, but four million of them have been excluded from the published list. What next for India's four million 'stateless'? What lies behind Assam violence? Many Bengalis - a linguistic minority in Assam - are worried they will be deported en masse. Hasitun Nissa, who spoke to the BBC's Joe Miller days before the list was published, said she had never known a home outside the state's floodplains. It is where the 47-year-old schoolteacher spent her childhood, where she studied, where she got married and where she had her four children. She said her family arrived in India before 1971 but she expected to be stripped of her Indian citizenship and feared her land rights, voting rights and freedom would be in peril. Four million people have been excluded from the list, which throws their citizenship into doubt Activists say the NRC is now being used as a pretext for a two-pronged attack - by Hindu nationalists and Assamese hardliners - on the state's Bengali community, a large portion of whom are Muslims. Like Hasitun, many Bengalis live in the wetlands dotted along the Bramaputra river, moving around when water levels rise. Their paperwork, if it exists, is often inaccurate. Officials claim illegal Bangladeshis are enmeshed in the Bengali population, often hiding in plain sight with forged papers - and a thorough examination of all documents is the only way to find them. Myanmar Rohingya: What you need to know about the crisis Why Narendra Modi remains star BJP vote-catcher But Bengali campaigner Nazrul Ali Ahmed is adamant that the NRC is serving another agenda entirely. ""It is nothing but a conspiracy to commit atrocities,"" he told the BBC. ""They are openly threatening to get rid of Muslims, and what happened to the Rohingya in Myanmar, could happen to us here."" Such alarming comparisons are dismissed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which emphasises that the NRC is an apolitical task, overseen by the country's secular Supreme Court. Soutik Biswas, BBC News, Delhi The latest move to make millions of people stateless overnight has sparked fears of violence in what is already a tinderbox state. Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which rules the state, has insisted in the past that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported. But neighbouring Bangladesh will definitely not accede to such a request. Chances are India will end up creating the newest cohort of stateless people, raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo the Rohingya people who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. Read more from Soutik here After human rights organisations began to express concern, the civil servant in charge of the NRC, Prateek Hajela, released a statement stressing that the law required him to make ""no differentiation on the basis of religion or language"" in determining citizenship. But correspondents say the prime minister has never been shy of expressing his preference for Hindu Bangladeshi migrants, whom he says should be embraced by India. Other ""infiltrators"", Mr Modi told a crowd in 2014, would be deported. Activists allege that the list is a ""conspiracy"" to commit atrocities His Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is considering a bill that would enshrine the rights of Hindu migrants in law. Indeed, a promotional song posted on Facebook by the NRC itself does little to calm the nerves of those worried about a Hindu nationalist witch hunt. ""A new revolution, to defeat the alien enemy, is beckoning,"" a young woman sings, ""bravely let us shield our motherland."" Siddhartha Bhattacharya, Assam's law minister and a member of the BJP, is in no doubt about the fate of those who have been rejected. ""Everyone will be given a right to prove their citizenship,"" he told the BBC. ""But if they fail to do so, well, the legal system will take its own course."" That, Mr Bhattacharya clarified, would mean expulsion from India. Questions of identity and citizenship have long vexed a vast number of people living in Assam At present, correspondents say, that seems little more than a threat aimed at whipping up Hindu support for the BJP ahead of elections. No deportation procedures have been put in place, and Bangladesh, already burdened by the Rohingya crisis, has shown no sign of being open to accepting a raft of new refugees. Nonetheless, campaigners like Samujjal Bhattacharyya say something must be done. His organisation, the All Assam Students' Union, has been agitating for the expulsion of illegal Bangladeshis - regardless of their religion - for decades. If deportations don't happen, he says, ""the illegal foreigner will intrude upon the corridor of power. We are not prepared to be second-class citizens"". Hasitun Nissa takes such rhetoric seriously. ""We have never harmed Hindus. We can live peacefully side-by-side,"" she says. ""But I fear bad news will come.""

"This video can not be played Baroness Shackleton tells Today that marriage is 'not just about the heart' One of the UK's most famous divorce lawyers has backed a change in the law - but urged couples to be more practical about marriage. Baroness Fiona Shackleton called the current divorce law ""archaic"". Under the current system in England and Wales, a couple have to prove in court that their marriage has irretrievably broken down. She wants schools to help pupils view marriage as ""the most important decision they make"". ""It's not just about the heart,"" said the lawyer, who has represented Prince Charles and Sir Paul McCartney. ""It's a practical arrangement."" Baroness Shackleton, who is a solicitor to Princes William and Harry, at this year's royal wedding Baroness Shackleton,externalhas been a divorce lawyer for over 40 years and is also a solicitor to Princes William and Harry. She was made a life peer in 2010. She was speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday after a new study on divorce was published last week. The research, carried out at the University of Exeter and sponsored by Baroness Shackleton, suggested thatasking 10 questionsbefore starting a serious relationship can help couples stand the test of time. It comes in the wake of the case of Tini Owens, a woman who lost her Supreme Court appeal last week in her fight to divorce her husband. Mrs Owens, 68, wants a divorce on the ground she is unhappy but her husband Hugh has refused. Tini Owens has been refused a divorce by the family court and Court of Appeal Under the current law in England and Wales, unless people can prove their marriage has broken down due to adultery, unreasonable behaviour or desertion, the only way to obtain a divorce without a spouse's consent is to live apart for five years. Specialist lawyers have called for the introduction of a ""no-fault divorce"", which would have helped Mrs Owens. The 10 questions to ask before falling in love Should it be easier to get a divorce? The blame game: Divorcing in the UK Baroness Shackleton said that couples currently have to ""exaggerate or to agree"" to get a divorce. But she said ""it is no good just changing divorce laws to dissolve the marriage"" and that reform is also needed on laws around sorting out finances during a divorce. She issupporting a bill proposed,externalby her fellow peer Baroness Deech which could replace the current system for splitting money in divorce cases. Baroness Shackleton said she is supporting theUniversity of Exeter research,external""with a hope that education... will devote just a little time to get students to focus on what is the most important decision they make, which is basically who they breed with"". ""[Marriage] is a practical arrangement which has to survive to rear children,"" she said. ""And it's the children who are the very sad losers when parents are selfish and decide their own desires override those of their family."" She added: ""What I think should happen is that people should understand that when they are entering this commitment which is meant to be for life."" She said people should be ""aware of some of the traits that you can't change in people"". ""You can't make a mean person fundamentally generous,"" she said. ""You can't make a kind person fundamentally unkind. ""If they think about these things - not about the white dress or escape from home, or many other reasons, not the love element - [but] the practicality of marriage before entering into it, I'd probably be doing myself out of a job more often.""

"Jodie Simpson died in 2016 A family whose daughter spent nearly four years in a vegetative state have said it should be easier to withdraw nutrition from such patients. Many relatives have to go through an agonising process. In August 2012 Jodie Simpson, 38, took an overdose at home in Barrow in Furness, Cumbria. Her brother Michael Devlin found her, and called an ambulance. Although she was taken to an intensive care unit, Michael thought his older sister would recover. ""She was tough, she was strong,"" he says. "" I thought after they've done what they needed to she'll just have had the scare of her life and she'll be out."" Jodie had taken tablets belonging to her ex-partner. Her mother Jean, a recently retired nurse, knew they could cause severe, irreversible brain damage. That proved to be the case. Jodie came out of the intensive care unit, stayed in a general ward for 10 weeks, and was then moved to a nursing home. She could breathe without assistance, but was fed and given liquid through a stomach tube. Her physical condition was stable: doctors said there was no sign of consciousness. She suffered seizures though, and would grimace. ""We were tormented,"" Jean says. ""They say she wasn't. But she looked it."" This video can not be played ""I just wanted my daughter to be at peace,"" says Jodie's mother Jean Simpson Jodie couldn't eat or drink - she couldn't swallow. Staff couldn't brush her teeth, and they began to rot. For her family it was distressing to see. They agreed that Jodie would not want to live like that. But as she was relatively young, her body healthy, she could have stayed alive for years. In such cases, doctors can withhold food and liquid - if they consider there's no likelihood of improvement, and if the family agree. But to do that, they need to wait - six months in cases like Jodie's,  a year in cases of traumatic injury. Then the patient has to be assessed by a specialist unit, before being diagnosed as being in a permanent vegetative state. Then, the procedure is to seek permission from the Court of Protection to take out their feeding tube. In April 2013, Jean wrote to the doctors, asking if her daughter could be allowed to die. The applications are made by the local Clinical Commissioning Group and usually cost around Â£50,000. Only about 100 such applications have been made in more than 20 years. It's estimated between 4,000-16,000 patients in a permanent vegetative state are in NHS care in England, with thousands more who are minimally conscious.. Judy Taylor never gave up hope her husband would recover It took two years before Jodie was assessed by a specialist centre, 180 miles away in Newcastle. The delay was down to the doctors' decision, according to the local Clinical Commissioning group.   In September 2014, Jodie was diagnosed as PVS. The CCG agreed to apply to the Court of Protection - but they didn't put in an application for over a year. For the family, the delay was excruciating. Jean Simpson says she just wanted her daughter to be at peace. Cumbria CCG were asked to explain why they didn't apply sooner. ""During this period the patient became very unwell. The nurses caring for her used the time when they would have been preparing statements in this case to provide care. At that point the outcome for her was unclear."" They also said it was very challenging to co-ordinate the information from all of the organisations and clinicians concerned. Once the case got to the Court of Protection, in October 2015, one expert raised a question about the effect of Jodie's medication - could it be having a sedative effect? It was decided to withdraw the medication and assess her again. The second assessment confirmed the first. For the family, this extra delay was difficult, but they took some consolation from Mr Justice Hayden's sympathetic approach towards them, and the concluding paragraph of his judgement. As he ruled that doctors could withhold nutrition and hydration, he wrote: ""I  have found it difficult to understand entirely why this process has taken quite as long as it has. Given that, ultimately, all the parties have been able to agree on the way forward, I have not been required to investigate the reasons. It needs to be stated that the avoidance of delay in medical treatment cases is an important imperative, as I have now said in a number of judgements."" That was published in May 2016. Jodie was moved to a hospice and died - peacefully her mother says - three weeks later. Her family decided to speak out because they don't want other families to go through the same drawn out, painful process. A vegetative state is when a person is awake but is showing no signs of awareness; they may open their eyes, wake up and fall asleep at regular intervals and have basic reflexes; they're also able to regulate their heartbeat and breathing without assistance A person in a vegetative state doesn't show any meaningful responses, such as following an object with their eyes or responding to voices; they also show no signs of experiencing emotions Continuing - or persistent - vegetative state is when this happens for more than four weeks Permanent vegetative state is defined as more than six months if caused by a non-traumatic brain injury, or more than 12 months if caused by a traumatic brain injury If a person is diagnosed as being in a permanent vegetative state, recovery is extremely unlikely but not impossible Source: NHS Choices,external ""We were in limbo for nearly four years, emotional limbo, grieving, permanently grieving, but not knowing when the end was coming,"" Jean says. ""And every time my daughter had a bad patch, you were hoping that she would pass away. You were praying for it."" Not all families take the same view. Judy Taylor's husband Simon suffered severe brain damage after a head injury, and was in a vegetative state for several years. She never gave up hope that he would recover, if only partly. She thinks the current system - with withdrawal approved by court hearing - is best. ""I do think that needs to be there, that time  to protect the rights and wellbeing of the patient. I know everyone says they wouldn't want to live like that... and nobody would. But it's so important to get the decision right. Because I've seen people who have made recoveries. ""Yes they are still very very disabled, but that doesn't mean anyone has the right to take their life."" The House of Lords decision in 1993 in the case of Tony Bland, established that withholding food and water did not constitute murder - it was withdrawal of treatment. Tony Bland was a young fan who'd survived Hillsborough and been left in a vegetative state. The House of Lords said it would be good practice for similar cases to come before the court. People have assumed since that cases must be heard by the Court of Protection. But this view is wrong, argues Alex Ruck Keene, a barrister specialising in this area. The case of Tony Bland was a legal landmark ""There is some confusion over the role of the Court of Protection in these cases. While it's widely believed that it's necessary as a matter of law for doctors to obtain the court's permission to withdraw nutrition and hydration, that's not so."" Professors Celia and Jenny Kitzinger co-direct the Coma and Disorders of Consciousness Research Centre at the Universities of York and Cardiff. They have been campaigning for a change in the process  since their own sister Polly was left brain-damaged after a car accident. They have interviewed 75 relatives of PVS patients. They believe cases should only go to court where there's a dispute, and families and doctors disagree. Prof Derick Wade is one of the country's leading experts in this area, a consultant in neurological rehabilitation based in Oxford. He estimates there could be as many as 24,000 patients in the NHS in England either in a permanent vegetative state, or minimally conscious. Most will be in nursing homes, where their care's likely to cost about Â£100,000 a year. He believes we need a full public debate. He says that managing one person in a vegetative state for 10 years ""costs"" five avoidable deaths in other people. Like the family of Jodie Simpson, and the Kitzinger sisters, he believes it's time to discuss whether the Court of Protection should be involved in such cases at all.

"More than five million people across England are unable to book an appointment with a GP outside of working hours. BBC analysis of official data shows 10% of registered patients live in areas where there is no access to GPs on evenings and at weekends. Labour has accused the government of ""breaking its promises"". NHS England said it was still on target to provide access to extended care for all patients by 1 October. Our analysis shows: More than 22 million people - or 40% of patients registered with GPs - now have ""seven-day 8am to 8pm"" access to GPs - defined as full provision by NHS England Just over half the population have access to partial provision. This is when a GP practice can offer the minimum of ninety minutes of bookable appointments once a week Only two areas offer full provision to GPs for all patients Some 5.4 million people - or 10% of patients - had no access to GPs outside of normal working hours Former Prime Minister David Cameron made a promise everyone in England would have access to GP services seven-days a week by 2020,at the Conservative party conference in 2014.. The plans have since been brought forward.  From October, it will be mandatory for all Clinical Commissioning Groups to put in place arrangements for extended access to general practice. The latest data - from March and collated bi-annually from surveys filled out by GPs - shows widespread regional variation. In Sefton in Merseyside, for example, two thirds of patients had no access to GPs outside of working hours, the highest percentage in England. That compares to Herefordshire and Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, where every patient had access to full provision. A spokesman for NHS South Sefton CCG said extended access to general practice was ""not compulsory"", but it was ""undertaking a procurement exercise"" to roll services out from October. Self-employed, mother of three, Pragya Agarwal is registered at a GP practice commissioned by NHS Southport and Formby CCG. No practices provide a full 8am-8pm service, but 94% of patients have access to some form of partial provision. Pragya said it was often impossible to access a doctor's appointment. She said ""You call in the morning to make an appointment at literally one minute to 8am and it's impossible to get through, the lines are jammed straight away, everyone is trying to call at the same time and there just aren't enough appointments in the day. ""Then usually you're offered an appointment a week, eight to ten days aheadâ¦ the access to appointments is very limited. It's really difficult unless you sound really, really urgent."" Pragya said ""I hate to malign the NHS in any way, everyone works incredibly hard. Our local GP seems under a lot of pressure to meet deadlines, so when you do see someone for five to 10 minutes it's very rushed."" Olivia Djouadi, 46, from Bromley in south London, where 94% of patients have full access to extended hours appointments.  She is self-employed and cares for a disabled teenage son. ""I call for an appointment at 8 o'clock on a Monday morning and can be given an appointment for a couple of weeks time. ""At 8 o'clock, it seems they've booked all the slots for the day. If you are even slightly late, like 8.15, there is no chance of seeing someone that day. ""I've often been given an appointment for a couple of weeks time. I have diabetes and lots of medical needs so I can't really wait a couple of weeks. If I'm concerned, I will often go to the in-house GP at A&E ... and I sit and wait. ""I have a teenager in a wheelchair and work full-time, so I'd have to cancel his school day if I have to wait at A&E to see someone because I might not be back when his transport brings him home from school."" A spokesperson for NHS Rushcliffe CCG said it was proud of the extended hours service it provides, through '""vanguard funding"". In 2015, it became one of fifty 'vanguard' sites createdand funded by the NHS. The purpose was to bring together hospitals, community services, GPs and care homes to provide extended care. NHS Herefordshire CCG has been able to offer full extended access, through the GP Access Fund. Originally called the Prime Minister's Challenge Fund, it became one of twenty-one pilot areas funded in 2015 to provide extended GP hours. That has enabled Herefordshire to commission a GP Federation to provide three hub sites across the county, to provide seven-day a week service. Christine Price from Healthwatch Herefordshire, the independent champion for people who use health services in the county, said though people want convenience of care, how to get to services for those living in rural communities is an issue. Christine said ""People thought their own local GP would be open as part of extended access, but it's not realistic with twenty-four practices across the whole county. ""With limited transport between market towns and rural areas, the reality is not everyone can access services. ""If all patients wanted to use it, it wouldn't have the capacity for them to use it. ""People without money, friends and family nearby struggle to access services outside of their immediate area. It's not there for everyone in reality."" Doctors' groups have questioned the government's priority of extended access at a time when there is a critical shortage of GPs. In the recent British Medical Association's paper, Dr Richard Vautrey, its GP Committee chair, said the government should address ""increased demand and unmanageable GP workloads"". The Royal College of GPs said it wants to give patients access to services they need but states there are not enough GPs to provide this. Its chair, Helen Stokes-Lampard, has called for funding for an extra GP in every practice in England. Labour's Shadow Secretary of Health and Social Care, Jonathan Ashworth MP has been critical of the handling of the extended access scheme. He said ""This is yet more evidence that the Tories have broken their promises on access to GPs seven days a week. ""The truth is that years of austerity has taken its toll on general practice. We need a serious long term investment plan for primary care."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it had invested an extra Â£2.4bn a year into general practice by 2021. It said alternative data, recorded in May 2018, sourced monthly from Clinical Commissioning Groups, suggests 55% of the population now had access to 8am-8pm GP services.  NHS England has declined to release this data. A spokesman for NHS England said: ""The NHS is investing at least Â£258m this year to offer improved access to general practice, including evening and weekend appointments. This is ahead of schedule with appointments available to more than half the country now, and they will be available across the whole country by October this year."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it wants everyone to have access to evening and weekend GP appointments and ""already millions have benefitted"" from the plans. The BBC also analysed similar data from Wales and Scotland.  In Northern Ireland, there was no comparable data available. In Wales, five out of seven Health Boards provided no out-of-hours appointments after 18:30, in data provided by the Welsh government. GPs chose whether to provide 24-hour care for their patients or to transfer responsibility to local Health Boards. The Welsh government said its figures ""show more appointments are available for people at more convenient times"". In Scotland, 3% of patients are registered at a GP practice that has opted in to provide out-of-hours services, in data provided by the Information Services Division (ISD) on behalf of the Scottish Government. A Scottish Government spokesman said GPs were not contractually required to provide care, and it was the responsibility of local Health Boards. ""Everyone in Scotland has access to out-of-hours services - regardless of where they live,"" he added.

"This video can not be played The earthquake triggered landslides Hundreds of hikers have been making their way down after spending a night trapped on an Indonesian volcano following an earthquake. The 6.4 magnitude quake struck early on Sunday near Mount Rinjani on Lombok island, triggering landslides that cut off escape routes. At least 16 people died and more than 330 were injured. Rescue officials said many of the mostly foreign hikers were unlikely to reach the bottom before nightfall. The national park authority said on Monday that a key route to the peak had been cleared and a helicopter was dropping supplies to hikers still on the slopes. Rescue official Agus Hendra Sanjaya told AFP news agency that the hikers were believed to have enough supplies to last ""another one to two days"". Hikers have been descending the volcano after spending a night on its slopes Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, from the national disaster mitigation agency, said that when the quake struck there had been as many as 820 people on Mount Rinjani. Among the foreigners climbing the volcano were 337 Thai tourists, with French, Dutch and Spanish making up the next-largest contingents. The volcano, which rises 3,726m (12,224ft) above sea level and is the second-highest volcano in the country, is a favourite among sightseers. A Malaysian tourist on a hiking trip to Mount Rinjani was among those killed. Another young Indonesian hiker was also killed by falling rocks. Some hikers needed medical treatment US tourist John Robyn Buenavista described seeing people pinned to the ground by fallen debris. ""At one point, I saw people with half of their bodies stuck in the rocks and I just couldn't move. I felt paralysed and stopped moving. The guides were screaming, 'Don't die, don't die',"" he told Reuters. ""One of the guides had to shake me and take me by the hand. He told me that I had to go, and that they would be OK."" A group of Malaysian tourists, who have now reached safety,had earlier appealed for help on Facebook,external.

Indonesians are no strangers to earthquakes but the power of the latest one has put people on edge. After each aftershock people run out into the open. Clouds are gathering over Mount Rinjani where rescue workers are slowly bringing down the remaining hikers via alternative routes not affected by landslides. In the tents among the injured is a porter who rushed down the mountain when the earthquake struck and is being treated for dehydration. Videos filmed by guides on mobile phones captured the terrifying moment when the quake hit with people yelling for everyone to come down. Yes. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. More than half of the world's active volcanoes above sea level are part of the ring.

"The ""highly stressed"" kangaroo suffered cuts and lost blood, a rescuer said An Australian family has been startled awake after a kangaroo crashed its way through a window in their home. The residents managed to trap the marsupial in a bathroom after it ""ran amok"" in the house in Melbourne early on Sunday, a wildlife rescuer said. The family was unharmed, but the distressed kangaroo suffered blood loss and cuts to its paws and legs. Rescuer Manfred Zabinskas said the incident could partly be attributed to homes competing with kangaroo habitats. After being called to the home, Mr Zabinskas found the kangaroo ""fairly exhausted"" in the bathroom, and administered a sedative to remove it safely.

"Prolonged disorders of consciousness are usually caused by a sudden brain injury Advances in medicine have meant that many more people survive traumatic incidents than in the past. Many people will have ""prolonged disorders of consciousness"" - either in a coma or vegetative state, where they show no awareness of their environment, or a minimally conscious state,like Paul Briggs, where they show very limited awareness. However, the NHS does not publish data on these patients, so this autumn the BBC requested the information from all individual CCGs and NHS bodies across the UK. The responses showed that more than 100 people with prolonged disorders of consciousness are currently being cared for by the NHS. Many of the 105 patients declared by health authorities have been in this state for more than six months. The data comes from a BBC Freedom of Information enquiry, but gives a very incomplete picture, as only a quarter of all bodies responded. In the most extreme of these cases uncovered byBBC Radio 4's Today programme,a patient cared for by the Western Health and Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland had been in a minimally conscious state for 20 years. Q&A: What is a Minimally Conscious State? Doctors given new coma guidelines Permanent vegetative state: A family's agony Treating patients with long-term consciousness disorders takes up a considerable portion of some of the continuing care budgets ofClinical Commissioning Groups,,externalthe NHS bodies responsible for arranging their care in England. One expert in neurological rehabilitation has told the BBC he believes these figures suggest the NHS could be spending millions on such patients, often for many years. A judge ruled that doctors should stop providing life-support treatment to PC Paul Briggs Ever since the House of Lords ruled in 1993 that  doctors could end treatment for Tony Bland, the fan injured at Hillsborough, withdrawal of food and water has been approved case by case by the Court of Protection. However, lawyers say there have been relatively few cases over the past twenty years, almost always brought by the NHS Trust or Clinical Commissioning Group. The case of Paul Briggs was exceptional: the family brought the case, and the judge agreed Mr Briggs could be named. The Court of Protection deals with cases where a person, usually referred to as ""P"", lacks capacity to manage their own affairs. A disorder of consciousness can occur after a person suffers brain damage. It usually leads to a person being in one of three states - coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious state. - A coma is when a person shows no signs of being awake or aware - A vegetative state is when a person is awake but is showing no signs of awareness. - Somebody in a minimally conscious state shows clear but minimal or inconsistent awareness and may have periods where they can communicate or respond to commands, such as moving a finger when asked You can find moreinformation on the NHS Choices website.,external Freedom of information requests have shown that Lambeth CCG and Southwark CCG each spent more than Â£1m on caring for these patients in the 2015/16 financial year. These costs took up 7.5 and 9% of their continuing care budgets respectively. In Lanarkshire NHS Board, one patient suffering from a prolonged disorder of consciousness has spent the last seven years in an acute hospital bed, at an estimated cost to the NHS of Â£1.15m. However, figures on these kinds of patients are not regularly recorded by CCGs and other health bodies. Only 62 of the 238 health authorities approached by Today could provide any information on how many patients were their responsibility. Most authorities refused our requests, saying that providing a response would be too expensive, or that they simply did not hold this information. Many of those who could provide us information on the amount they spent on caring for these patients refused to state the numbers they were caring for, over fears for patient confidentiality. Treating patients with long-term consciousness disorders takes up a considerable portion of some of the continuing care budgets Prof Derick Wade, of the Oxford Centre for Enablement, said he believed the responses suggested many commissioning organisations were caring for at least five, and possibly 10, people who were in a minimally conscious or permanent vegetative state. He said ""I think that these figures provide reasonable evidence that potentially the NHS is spending very large sums of money on caring for people with a prolonged disorder of consciousness, often for very many years."" He said the CCGs and Trusts should embark on a ""much more rigorous"" collection of data.

"This video can not be played The earthquake triggered landslides Hundreds of hikers have been making their way down after spending a night trapped on an Indonesian volcano following an earthquake. The 6.4 magnitude quake struck early on Sunday near Mount Rinjani on Lombok island, triggering landslides that cut off escape routes. At least 16 people died and more than 330 were injured. Rescue officials said many of the mostly foreign hikers were unlikely to reach the bottom before nightfall. The national park authority said on Monday that a key route to the peak had been cleared and a helicopter was dropping supplies to hikers still on the slopes. Rescue official Agus Hendra Sanjaya told AFP news agency that the hikers were believed to have enough supplies to last ""another one to two days"". Hikers have been descending the volcano after spending a night on its slopes Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, from the national disaster mitigation agency, said that when the quake struck there had been as many as 820 people on Mount Rinjani. Among the foreigners climbing the volcano were 337 Thai tourists, with French, Dutch and Spanish making up the next-largest contingents. The volcano, which rises 3,726m (12,224ft) above sea level and is the second-highest volcano in the country, is a favourite among sightseers. A Malaysian tourist on a hiking trip to Mount Rinjani was among those killed. Another young Indonesian hiker was also killed by falling rocks. Some hikers needed medical treatment US tourist John Robyn Buenavista described seeing people pinned to the ground by fallen debris. ""At one point, I saw people with half of their bodies stuck in the rocks and I just couldn't move. I felt paralysed and stopped moving. The guides were screaming, 'Don't die, don't die',"" he told Reuters. ""One of the guides had to shake me and take me by the hand. He told me that I had to go, and that they would be OK.""

"Dawn Sturgess' coffin was brought to the crematorium with a flower arrangement saying, ""Mum"". A ""very emotional service"" has taken place in Salisbury as family said goodbye to Dawn Sturgess, who died from exposure to the nerve agent Novichok. Over 100 people attended the ceremony, including her partner Charlie Rowley, who was also exposed to the agent. The Rev Philip Bromiley, who led the service, said Ms Sturgess ""won't be defined"" as a person by the tragic circumstances of her death. Her 11-year-old daughter told mourners how much she loved her mother. Public Health England had advised the funeral directors ahead of the ceremony, but reiterated itsadvice,externalthat risk to the public was low. Earlier reports that there would be no pallbearers were incorrect, and Ms Sturgess' coffin was carried into the crematorium. Ms Sturgess, 44, died on 8 July after she and Mr Rowley, 45, were exposed to Novichok the week before in Amesbury, Wiltshire. What are Novichok agents? Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far What happened to the Skripals? Police 'identify Novichok suspects' Mr Bromiley told the BBC that Mr Rowley was sitting on the front row throughout and Ms Sturgess' sister, Claire, delivered her eulogy. After Ms Sturgess' 11-year-old daughter read to the mourners, she received a round of applause. Speaking after the funeral, Mr Bromiley said: ""I think there was a lot of shock, but there were moments of laughter and moments of being able to remember who Dawn really was. ""Dawn won't be defined by being a story in a tragic set of circumstances. ""She was a mum and she was a person, and it was that person we commended to God today."" Dawn Sturgess died on 8 July High by James Blunt was played at the start of the service, and it ended with the title song from the musical Fame. Mr Bromiley said the theme of the funeral was peace. He added: ""Peace for her family, for her friends and the city of Salisbury and the surrounding towns and villages affected by the chaotic last few months."" Ms Sturgess' family and her partner attended the funeral The chief constable of Wiltshire Police, Kier Pritchard, also said he would be attending, along with deputy chief constable Paul Mills and the police and crime commissioner for Wiltshire, Angus Macpherson. The poisoning of Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess came four months after the case of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The Skripals were found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury in March after coming into contact with Novichok. They have since been discharged from hospital. Mr Rowley left hospital on 20 July Ms Sturgess lived in Salisbury, and the couple had been in the city before going to Mr Rowley's flat in nearby Amesbury on 29 June. They collapsed after exposure to the nerve agent at his house on 30 June. A murder inquiry was launched after Ms Sturgess' death. Mr Rowleytold ITV News,externalhe had earlier found a sealed bottle of perfume and gave it to his partner, who sprayed the substance on her wrists. Police refused to confirm Mr Rowley's claim but had previously said the substance was found in a ""small bottle"".

"More than five million people across England are unable to book an appointment with a GP outside of working hours. BBC analysis of official data shows 10% of registered patients live in areas where there is no access to GPs on evenings and at weekends. Labour has accused the government of ""breaking its promises"". NHS England said it was still on target to provide access to extended care for all patients by 1 October. Our analysis shows: More than 22 million people - or 40% of patients registered with GPs - now have ""seven-day 8am to 8pm"" access to GPs - defined as full provision by NHS England Just over half the population have access to partial provision. This is when a GP practice can offer the minimum of ninety minutes of bookable appointments once a week Only two areas offer full provision to GPs for all patients Some 5.4 million people - or 10% of patients - had no access to GPs outside of normal working hours Former Prime Minister David Cameron made a promise everyone in England would have access to GP services seven-days a week by 2020,at the Conservative party conference in 2014.. The plans have since been brought forward.  From October, it will be mandatory for all Clinical Commissioning Groups to put in place arrangements for extended access to general practice. The latest data - from March and collated bi-annually from surveys filled out by GPs - shows widespread regional variation. In Sefton in Merseyside, for example, two thirds of patients had no access to GPs outside of working hours, the highest percentage in England. That compares to Herefordshire and Rushcliffe in Nottinghamshire, where every patient had access to full provision. A spokesman for NHS South Sefton CCG said extended access to general practice was ""not compulsory"", but it was ""undertaking a procurement exercise"" to roll services out from October. Self-employed, mother of three, Pragya Agarwal is registered at a GP practice commissioned by NHS Southport and Formby CCG. No practices provide a full 8am-8pm service, but 94% of patients have access to some form of partial provision. Pragya said it was often impossible to access a doctor's appointment. She said ""You call in the morning to make an appointment at literally one minute to 8am and it's impossible to get through, the lines are jammed straight away, everyone is trying to call at the same time and there just aren't enough appointments in the day. ""Then usually you're offered an appointment a week, eight to ten days aheadâ¦ the access to appointments is very limited. It's really difficult unless you sound really, really urgent."" Pragya said ""I hate to malign the NHS in any way, everyone works incredibly hard. Our local GP seems under a lot of pressure to meet deadlines, so when you do see someone for five to 10 minutes it's very rushed."" Olivia Djouadi, 46, from Bromley in south London, where 94% of patients have full access to extended hours appointments.  She is self-employed and cares for a disabled teenage son. ""I call for an appointment at 8 o'clock on a Monday morning and can be given an appointment for a couple of weeks time. ""At 8 o'clock, it seems they've booked all the slots for the day. If you are even slightly late, like 8.15, there is no chance of seeing someone that day. ""I've often been given an appointment for a couple of weeks time. I have diabetes and lots of medical needs so I can't really wait a couple of weeks. If I'm concerned, I will often go to the in-house GP at A&E ... and I sit and wait. ""I have a teenager in a wheelchair and work full-time, so I'd have to cancel his school day if I have to wait at A&E to see someone because I might not be back when his transport brings him home from school."" A spokesperson for NHS Rushcliffe CCG said it was proud of the extended hours service it provides, through '""vanguard funding"". In 2015, it became one of fifty 'vanguard' sites createdand funded by the NHS. The purpose was to bring together hospitals, community services, GPs and care homes to provide extended care. NHS Herefordshire CCG has been able to offer full extended access, through the GP Access Fund. Originally called the Prime Minister's Challenge Fund, it became one of twenty-one pilot areas funded in 2015 to provide extended GP hours. That has enabled Herefordshire to commission a GP Federation to provide three hub sites across the county, to provide seven-day a week service. Christine Price from Healthwatch Herefordshire, the independent champion for people who use health services in the county, said though people want convenience of care, how to get to services for those living in rural communities is an issue. Christine said ""People thought their own local GP would be open as part of extended access, but it's not realistic with twenty-four practices across the whole county. ""With limited transport between market towns and rural areas, the reality is not everyone can access services. ""If all patients wanted to use it, it wouldn't have the capacity for them to use it. ""People without money, friends and family nearby struggle to access services outside of their immediate area. It's not there for everyone in reality."" Doctors' groups have questioned the government's priority of extended access at a time when there is a critical shortage of GPs. In the recent British Medical Association's paper, Dr Richard Vautrey, its GP Committee chair, said the government should address ""increased demand and unmanageable GP workloads"". The Royal College of GPs said it wants to give patients access to services they need but states there are not enough GPs to provide this. Its chair, Helen Stokes-Lampard, has called for funding for an extra GP in every practice in England. Labour's Shadow Secretary of Health and Social Care, Jonathan Ashworth MP has been critical of the handling of the extended access scheme. He said ""This is yet more evidence that the Tories have broken their promises on access to GPs seven days a week. ""The truth is that years of austerity has taken its toll on general practice. We need a serious long term investment plan for primary care."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it had invested an extra Â£2.4bn a year into general practice by 2021. It said alternative data, recorded in May 2018, sourced monthly from Clinical Commissioning Groups, suggests 55% of the population now had access to 8am-8pm GP services.  NHS England has declined to release this data. A spokesman for NHS England said: ""The NHS is investing at least Â£258m this year to offer improved access to general practice, including evening and weekend appointments. This is ahead of schedule with appointments available to more than half the country now, and they will be available across the whole country by October this year."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said it wants everyone to have access to evening and weekend GP appointments and ""already millions have benefitted"" from the plans. The BBC also analysed similar data from Wales and Scotland.  In Northern Ireland, there was no comparable data available. In Wales, five out of seven Health Boards provided no out-of-hours appointments after 18:30, in data provided by the Welsh government. GPs chose whether to provide 24-hour care for their patients or to transfer responsibility to local Health Boards. The Welsh government said its figures ""show more appointments are available for people at more convenient times"". In Scotland, 3% of patients are registered at a GP practice that has opted in to provide out-of-hours services, in data provided by the Information Services Division (ISD) on behalf of the Scottish Government. A Scottish Government spokesman said GPs were not contractually required to provide care, and it was the responsibility of local Health Boards. ""Everyone in Scotland has access to out-of-hours services - regardless of where they live,"" he added.

"Northern services operate across the north-east and north-west of England An additional compensation scheme has been announced for season ticket holders affected by rail disruption in the north of England. Northern customers on some routes where over 5% of trains have been cancelled or seriously delayed can make a claim. It is in addition to the existing Delay Repay on offer from the Department for Transport and Transport for the North. The new scheme has two levels and covers disruption from electrification works and timetable changes. Season ticket refunds for rail delays Passenger trains return to Lakes Line Northern axe trains in timetable reshuffle The first level covers delays on specified routes caused by electrification works on the Blackpool to Preston line between 1 April 2018 and 30 June. The second level relates to disruption on certain routes caused by new timetables introduced on 20 May. Commuters have been faced with cancellations across the network David Brown, managing director at Northern, said: ""Customers have been affected by a number of issues during the past few months, most notably the knock-on effects of the delay to the electrification of the Blackpool to Preston Line, delays to the electrification of the Manchester to Preston via Bolton line and, of course, the problems on some routes following the introduction of the May timetable.

"The ID registration system for EU citizens in the UK after Brexit should extend to Britons to avoid another Windrush scandal, a think tank says. EU citizens in the UK will have to pay Â£65 and join a registration scheme to stay after the UK's transition period. In a report, Policy Exchange said the scheme should be rolled out to Britons on an initial voluntary basis. It said a ""proper national ID system"" would have ""prevented the harassment of the Windrush victims"". The Windrush scandalsaw migrants from Commonwealth countries - who had permission to settle in the UK - wrongly declared illegal immigrants. The Home Office had not issued paperwork to migrants entitled to live in the UK, and in 2010 landing cards belonging to Windrush migrants had been destroyed. As a result some were threatened with deportation, the loss of their jobs, and others were denied benefits and healthcare on the NHS. In May it was revealed that at least 63 members of the Windrush generation - named after the boat that brought the first Caribbean migrants to the UK - had been wrongfully removed since 2002. The scandal put pressure on former Home Secretary Amber Rudd to resign. She eventually left her post after it was revealed she ""inadvertently misled""MPs over targets for removing illegal immigrants. Reality Check: Could identity card plans be revived? UK's plan for EU citizens who want to stay Who are the Windrush generation? The UK is due to officially leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019. EU citizens who have arrived by the end of the transition period - December 31 2020 - but do not have five years' residence, can seek to stay until they have, at which point they can seek settled status, under plans announced by Home Secretary Sajid Javid. People will be asked to prove their identity, whether they have criminal convictions and whether they live in the UK. The Labour government introduced a Â£5bn ID card scheme but it was scrapped in 2010 In the Policy Exchange report, David Goodhart, head of demography, immigration and integration at the right-leaning think tank, said: ""We strongly recommend reopening the debate about ID management to reassure people that we know who is in the country, for how long, and what their entitlements are. ""A proper national ID system would have prevented the harassment of the Windrush victims."" There have been periodic calls for the return of identity cards ever since they were scrapped in the UK in 1952. A Â£5bn national identity card scheme was introduced by the Labour government in 2006, but Theresa May abolished it when she became home secretary in 2010. Windrush: Who exactly was on board? 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories Windrush scandal: Compensation could be capped Other suggestions form The Border Audit: A Post-Windrush Review include: A more ""decisive"" removals process, plus reforms to allow applications for asylum from outside the UK and private sponsorship of them An amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the UK for 10 years or more More cash to pay illegal immigrants to leave and a joint scheme with the Department for International Development to help them set up businesses in their countries of origin A British version of the US Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) that allows non-UK citizens to use e-gates at borders and made it quicker for ""low-risk groups"" to enter A reduction in citizenship application fees from Â£1,500 per person and almost Â£5,000 for a family with two children to a level ""more closely aligned to public policy, not just revenue needs"" Mr Goodhart said: ""Illegal immigration is not only unfair on legal immigrants who wait their turn in the queue and the employers and businesses who play (and pay) by the rules, it also fosters a twilight world of criminality, dependence and exploitation in which modern slavery flourishes. ""Combating illegal immigration should be overtly linked to minimum wage enforcement, private landlord licensing and action against modern slavery."" He said that while a general amnesty for the estimated 500,000 illegal residents in the UK would ""send the wrong signal"", he said ""some form of regularisation"" should be considered for those who have been here for more than 10 years.

"The inquiry will assess the causes, consequences and management of the disruption An inquiry into widespread rail disruption following timetable changes has been launched. It will identify what led to the failed introduction of new schedules and make recommendations ""before any future major network changes"",the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said,external. Disruption to passengers, especially on Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) lines, will be examined. ORR chair Stephen Glaister said a final report will be published by December. Transport SecretaryChris Grayling announced the plan for an inquiryinto repeatedcancellations and delaysafter the industry attempted to introduce new timetables last month. Rail users expressed their frustrations at Manchester Piccadilly GTR and Northern had to remove hundreds of trainsin a temporary timetable change to deal with the chaos on the rail network. The ORR said the inquiry will: identify factors that contributed to the failure to produce and introduce a satisfactory operational timetable reach conclusions about managing risks created by major network changes make recommendations to the industry and government before any future major network changes An interim report will be published in September. Commuters have been faced with cancellations across the network Professor Glaister said it ""is disappointing that the industry could not make the new timetable work"" and the ORR will ""look at this issue independently and dispassionately"". He said he wants the inquiry ""to proceed at pace"" but ""it is important to be thorough and impartial"" and ""collect evidence from a range of organisations, including passenger representatives such as Transport Focus"". An expert panel of external advisers will support the inquiry and ""challenge whether the ORR's own role, as regulator of Network Rail and of the train operating companies, has been properly assessed by the Inquiry.""

"Northern services operate across the North East and North West of England Rail company Northern should lose its franchise if improvements are not made, the mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool City Region have said. A phone call between Andy Burnham, Steve Rotheram and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling took place to discuss disruption and mass cancellations. The mayors said Northern needs to publish an action plan so it can be held to account by passengers. A spokesman for the government said the disruption has been ""unacceptable"". Northern has been approached for comment. The mayors said the chaos on the network has been ""so extreme"" that Northern has ""lost the benefit of the doubt"". ""They simply cannot be permitted to keep inflicting a miserable sub-standard service on the hundreds of thousands of passengers across our region who have had to endure dire train travel for far too long,"" they said. An investigation into Northern's ""unacceptably poor"" service wascalled for by Greater Manchester mayor Mr Burnham. Mr Rotheram, Liverpool City Region mayor,wrote to Northern,externalabout ""serious shortcomings"" in its operations. During the conversation, the two mayors are understood to have made a number of calls for action. They asked for: A shared analysis of the causes of the problem, developed by Northern, Transport for the North and the Department for Transport The publication of an action plan by Northern with ""clear dates and milestones"" for improvements so the company can be held to account A deadline for settling the backlog of compensation claims for delayed trains, and broader compensation for regular users paid for by fines They said that if an agreed action plan is not followed by Northern then ""a process be initiated to remove Arriva Rail North's franchise to operate"". The mayors said there is ""considerable distance"" between the government's view of the situation and their own. Government ministers' talk of teething problems suggests these are only recent problems linked to the new timetable, the mayors said. They said the ""endemic"" staffing shortage needs to be addressed. However, they added that all parties agree the priority is getting services back on track. Mr Grayling told the House of Commons that the issues with Northern were a ""Network Rail failure."" ""This problem has arisen for two prime reasons: the problems with electrification Network Rail is carrying out on the line through Bolton and the failure of Network Rail to deliver a finalised timetable in time,"" he said.

"Northern services operate across the North East and North West of England New train timetables have damaged the punctuality of trains across the country, new figures show. Almost a quarter of trains operated by Northern were at least five minutes late between 27 May and 23 June, compared with 9% during the same period last year, Network Rail data shows. This rises to 34% when only the company's Lancashire and Cumbria routes are taken into account. New timetables were introduced on 20 May, leading towidespread disruption. In the South East, 36% of Thameslink services failed to hit the punctuality target, compared with 18% in the same period last year. Great Northern's figure rose from 16% last year to 30% in 2018. Rail bosses 'were aware' of likely chaos More trains hit by timetable 'shambles' Trains chaos: What's really going on? There were major delays on ""Meltdown Monday"" on 21 May at Manchester Piccadilly Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was accused of ""personally propping up"" failing rail franchises by the Rail, Maritime and Transport union amid reports that Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) - which includes Thameslink and Great Northern - could be about to lose its contract. GTR was said to be ""drinking in the last chance saloon"",a government source told the BBC. A series of failures have been blamedfor causing the chaos, including Network Rail's late approval of the new timetables and delayed electrification projects. Poor planning by train operatorshas also been blamed, and the decision by transport ministers to phase in the introduction of new GTR services. A GTR spokesman said services on Southern ""have been performing much better since the introduction of the new timetable"". He added: ""Meanwhile, on Thameslink and Great Northern we are working hard with the Department for Transport and Network Rail to bring in a new, interim timetable that will give certainty and improved services.""

"Henri Le Masne went missing after skiing in a storm near the Matterhorn in March 1954 A French skier who disappeared in Italy more than 60 years ago has been identified after his story was shared on social media, Italian police say. Human remains, ski equipment and glasses had been found in 2005, high in a valley in Italy's Aosta region. But investigators were unable to identify the victim, and, last month, shared their findings on Facebook. A French family then matched the glasses to a relative, Henri Le Masne, which sparked a forensic investigation. The belongings were discovered 3,000 metres (10,000 ft) high in the Alps, near the Swiss border. There were some clues about the man's identity - such as clothing embroidered with initials and wooden skis, which at the time of use would have been expensive - but the investigators remained puzzled. They established that the remains belonged to a man who would have been about 1.75 metres tall and aged about 30, with his death likely to have occurred in the spring, said Marinella Laporta, an investigator with the forensic police unit in Turin. Forensic investigators analyse a tooth found in July 2005 In June, the Aosta valley prosecutor's findings were shared on social media with an appeal for readers to spread the information, especially in France and Switzerland.

Lucky escape for Alps snowboarder Four die in avalanche in southern Alps The technology creating controlled avalanches Mr Le Masne's younger brother, Roger, now 94, also came forward with an email describing his sibling. ""I am the brother of Henri Le Masne ... who is likely the skier who disappeared 64 years ago. He was a bachelor and quite independent. He worked in the finance ministry in Paris,"" he wrote in an email, which was shared with the police. The police said a photograph provided by the family showed glasses matching those found by the investigators. A subsequent DNA test confirmed the identification, they said.

"Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has called for an investigation into Northern Greater Manchester's mayor has called on the government to investigate claims that train operator Northern knew about ""likely"" cancellations in advance. Andy Burnham said a whistleblower has also alleged the firm is choosing to pay fines for cancelled services rather than employ staff on rest days. It comes after a series of public exchanges in whichthe mayor has criticised Northern's ""unacceptably poor"" service. Northern has denied the allegations. An internal email, provided by an anonymous Northern employee and published by Mr Burnham, allegedly identified a number of services which ""are likely to be cancelled"". The mayor said the allegations ""appear to contradict"" Northern's public claims that it did not plan cancellations in advance. ""If true, these revelations are very worrying. It now looks like Northern have simply not been straight with the Greater Manchester public,"" Mr Burnham said. The whistleblower also alleged that Northern pulled out of an agreement with drivers around payment for working on rest days, leading to a shortage of staff. Despite being fined for the number of cancelled services, the company had still benefited as a result, it was claimed. ""A situation where imposed fines are more lenient than the cost of the company doing actually their job would be a farce,"" said Mr Burnham. In a letter to the transport secretary Chris Grayling, the mayor said these ""serious allegations ... warrant further investigation"". On Wednesday, he also wrote to Transport for the North criticising Northern for delays, overcrowding and cancellations on its services. A spokesman for Northern said the company ""did not cancel any agreement"" on driver's rest days and denied that any services had been cancelled to save money. ""Northern put forward a formal proposal to [train driver's union] Aslef to continue with rest-day working, but the two parties were not able to reach agreement,"" he said. ""There is no list of pre-planned train cancellations, we cancel trains with great reluctance, and never for financial reasons,"" the spokesman said.

"The Carr fire has burned through an area larger than the city of San Francisco Firefighters have made some progress against California's deadliest current wildfire, which had been getting larger, officials say. The Carr fire is now 20% contained, up from 5% on Sunday when wind and dry conditions were causing it to grow. It is one of eight major wildfires currently burning in the state. The fire, in the Shasta County in northern California, has killed six people so far, including two children and their great-grandmother. Melody Bledsoe, 70, Emily Roberts, five, and James Roberts, four, died when they were caught in its pathas they were about to evacuate their home in the town of Redding, about 150 miles (240km) north of Sacramento, on Thursday.

The Carr fire has already burned nearly 100,000 acres and destroyed more than 720 homes and 240 other buildings. Nearly 200 more buildings have been damaged and 5,000 more are under threat. The blaze is being fought by nearly 3,400 firefighters with equipment including 330 fire appliances and 17 helicopters. It began on Monday. On Thursday it became a firestorm, jumping across the Sacramento River. This video can not be played Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years California department of forestry and fire protection (CalFire) chief Ken Pimlott told reporters they were ""seeing fire whirls - literally what can be described as a tornado"". ""This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity"" by gale-force winds, he said, ""uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways"". A total of 38,000 people have been evacuated from Shasta County. California's Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in the area, as well as three others. US President Donald Trump has approved federal aid for the counties. The Carr is the largest ofeight big fires burning in California,,externaland 90 across the country, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. There are currently 12,000 firefighters battling the flames across the state. Wildfires are a common occurrence in California during the state's long, hot, dry summers. However,experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years,external- partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. UCLA climate scientist Daniel Swain told the Los Angeles Times much of the state's vegetation had reached ""explosively dry"" levels. In December,Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"", and that large fires ""could happen every year or every few years"".

Its first edition on 30 July 1938 broke with the tradition of text-dense publications for children, in favour of pictures to tell the story. Along with the print edition there is a CBBC series, an interactive website and a new live-action series. David Walliams has guest-edited the 80th birthday commemorative issue.

David Walliams guest-edited the 80th birthday commemorative issue Head of Beano Studios, Mike Stirling, said the comic revolutionised the industry in 1938. He said: ""It was a really rebellious approach to the medium. ""The original team turned everything on its head and made the focus upon picture stories and humour. ""The key point was that the heroes were all kids.""

"This video can not be played 'It's just insane really' - Thomas reacts to Tour de France win Geraint Thomas became the third Briton to win the Tour de France when he crossed the finish line in Paris. The Team Sky rider, 32, follows Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2012 and four-time Tour champion Chris Froome as Britain celebrates a sixth win in seven years. Alexander Kristoff won the final sprint finish on the Champs-Elysees as Thomas crossed the line arm-in-arm with Froome after three weeks of racing. He beat Dutchman Tom Dumoulin by one minute 51 seconds, with Froome third. The Welshman, who rode in support of Froome in each of his four wins, had built up that lead over the previous 20 stages and Tour convention dictates that the yellow jersey is not challenged on the final stage. ""When I rode on the Champs-Elysees for the first time in 2007, that was insane - just to finish the race and just to be a part of it,"" Thomas told ITV. ""To now be riding round winning it is just incredible. It's just a whirlwind. I seem to be floating around on cloud nine. ""Maybe when I'm 70, sat in a corner of a pub telling some 18-year-old what I used to be, it will sink in. It's incredible, the stuff of dreams."" 'So tired he rang the doorbell with his head' - Thomas' journey to Tour champion Thomas became 'clear' team leader after winning stage 11 - Froome BeSpoke at the Tour podcast: A special day on the Champs-Elysees Stage by stage - how Thomas won the Tour Froome was heavy favourite to become the fifth rider to win a record-equalling fifth Tour de France title. He came into the race as defending champion and holder of all three Grand Tour titles, having won the Vuelta a Espana last September and the Giro d'Italia in May. However, he was only cleared to race the week before the Tour started, after his anti-doping case was dropped by cycling's world governing body, the UCI. The 33-year-old was under investigation after more than the permitted level of legal asthma drug salbutamol was found in his urine during his Vuelta victory. But his hopes of matching Eddy Merckx's record of four consecutive Grand Tour victories were ended in the Pyrenees mountains in the final week as Thomas proved the strongest rider. The moment Thomas crossed the finish line in Paris - with four-time champion Froome The final 116km stage began in Houilles, to the north-west of Paris, and the riders took a leisurely pace into the capital before embarking on eight laps of the city centre. Team Sky led the peloton into Paris, having allowed France's Sylvain Chavanel to ride clear for one lap in his final Tour in recognition of his achievement of completing a record 18th race. Six riders attacked off the front of the peloton and built an advantage of about 45 seconds, but they were eventually reeled in on the final lap, with 6km remaining. World champion Peter Sagan's Bora-Hansgrohe team-mates did the bulk of the chasing, hoping to help the winner of the green points classification jersey to a first win in Paris, but Norwegian Kristoff outsprinted Frenchman Arnaud Demare and Germany's John Degenkolb after Yves Lampaert's late attack failed. Thomas rode over the line a few seconds later, alongside Froome, the man he dethrones as champion. Geraint Thomas was keen to show off the Welsh flag on the run-in to Paris Thomas' victory comes in his ninth Tour, one fewer than the record for most appearances before winning, held by 1980 winner Joop Zoetemelk of the Netherlands. Thomas first rode in the Tour in 2007, when he finished 140th of the 141 finishers. Like many British riders, he raced on both the track and the road in the early part of his career, winning two Olympic and three world team pursuit titles on the track between 2007 and 2012. His sacrifice in helping Froome win four Tours has meant Thomas' best finish before this year was 15th. He has also been dogged by bad luck. He fractured his pelvis on stage one in 2013 but rode the remaining 20 stages to help Froome win; in 2015 he crashed head first into a telegraph pole; and in 2017 broke a collarbone on stage nine. This year, he has ridden a near faultless race to cement his place among Britain's greatest cyclists. Mark Cavendish,a former Team Sky and Great Britain team-mate of Thomas, said he was ""so, so proud"" of his achievement. Asked if he ever thought Thomas could win a Grand Tour, Cavendish, who has won 30 Tour de France stages, told BBC Sport: ""Recently, yes. But there is a definite hierarchy in Team Sky so I didn't know if he'd get the opportunity. ""If they (Team Sky) had said to Geraint 'right, now you've got to work for Froome' he'd have done it. That's the kind of guy he is. That's what is special about him and why he deserves the win. ""He's the most loyal guy you'll ever meet. He's incredible. I love him. I'm so, so proud of him."" Peter Kennaugh,another former Team Sky and GB team-mate, added: ""It's incomprehensible. It's 'G' and he's won the Tour de France. I can't imagine how he feels. I'm just so proud of him."" Ex-Team Sky team-mate Ben Swift,who shared a house with Thomas in Manchester, said: ""It's amazing to see. We've grown up together, been at the British Academy together, lived together, so to see him do this is incredible."" Three-time world team pursuit world championDani Rowesaid: ""I did see him as a Tour winner. He's one of the most hard-working riders I've ever come across, so I think he deserves this more than anyone."" Former British cyclistChris Boardman,who won three Tour stages and wore the yellow jersey, said: ""He's the most popular winner for years. No disrespect to those who have gone before him but he's always laid it down for someone else and sacrificed himself for someone else."" Thomas went in to this year's race saying he was hoping to challenge team leader Froome. He told BBC Sport: ""The team have said with the way I've been riding they're confident to give me that role of a back-up guy and to race at least until the first rest day (after stage nine)."" He was second after stage nine and took hold of the race leader's yellow jersey on stage 11. Stage 3:Team Sky finish second in the team trial to propel Thomas up the standings to third, three seconds adrift of race leader Greg van Avermaet. Stage 6:A tactically aware Thomas picks up two bonus seconds near the finish to move himself up to second overall. Stage 11:Thomas attacks with 6km remaining on the final ascent to the summit finish at La Rosiere in the Alps to finish 20 seconds ahead of Dumoulin and Froome and take the race leader's yellow jersey. Stage 12:Another late surge sees Thomas become the first British rider to win on the fabled Alpe d'Huez as he again leaves Dumoulin and Froome in his wake to cement his position as a real threat in the race. ""There wasn't a chance in hell I was going to win,"" Thomas said. ""I just kept following Dumoulin and Froome. Can we just go to Paris now?"" Stage 17:Into the Pyrenees and an attack in the closing few hundred metres helps Thomas finish third to put another nine seconds into Dumoulin as Froome falters on the final climb, finishing 48 seconds behind his team-mate. Stage 19:The final stage in the mountains and Thomas follows the attacks of all his rivals before sprinting to second on the stage to pick up more bonus seconds and move two minutes five seconds clear. He has accrued 33 bonus seconds, 21 more than Dumoulin. Stage 20:Dumoulin wins the time trial, beating Froome by one second, but Thomas finishes third on the stage to maintain a lead of one minute 51 seconds. Mark Cavendishset out looking to make further inroads in Eddy Merckx's record of 34 Tour stage wins, but the Dimension Data rider was unable to add to his tally of 30. He missed out on the early sprint stages and was eliminated when he missed the time cut on the mountainous 11th stage. Mitchelton-Scott riderAdam Yateswon the young rider classification in 2016 and was tipped to go well this year, but dehydration in the Alps - he was dropped on the way to La Rosiere on stage 11 and again on the next stage to Alpe d'Huez - cost him dearly. To end a miserable Tour, he crashed while leading on stage 16 and finished third. The third British rider in Team Sky's squad,Luke Rowe,finished 130th - almost four hours behind the winner - but his sacrifices to help compatriot Thomas win will live long in both their memories. Three-time world champion Sagan romped away with the green points jersey, which rewards consistently high finishes on each stage. It is a joint record sixth victory in the classification for the Slovak, matching Germany's Erik Zabel. Sagan won three stages and finished in the top 10 on nine others to amass 477 points, more than double Kristoff in second. The polka dot 'king of the mountains' jersey was claimed by Julian Alaphilippe, who comfortably beat fellow Frenchman Warren Barguil. Another home rider, Pierre Latour, won the white jersey awarded to the best young rider (under the age of 26). Final standings: 1. Geraint Thomas (GB/Team Sky) 83hrs 17mins 13secs 2.

"Some people joined queues at 02:00 local time waiting for the polls to open at 07:00 local time Voter turnout was 75% in Zimbabwe's first general election since long-serving ruler Robert Mugabe was ousted, officials say. Polls have closed and counting is now under way. It is expected to be a tight contest between the incumbent Emmerson Mnangagwa and his main rival, Nelson Chamisa. Foreign observers have hailed the election as an opportunity for Zimbabwe to break with its repressive past. The official result is due within five days. A run-off election will be held on 8 September should none of the 23 candidates win more than 50% of the votes. Parliamentary and local elections were also taking place on Monday. Polls officially shut at 17:00 GMT but some remained open to allow people already in queues to vote. This video can not be played Why Zimbabwe's election is historic Opinion polls gave Mr Mnangagwa, who heads the ruling Zanu-PF party, a narrow lead over Mr Chamisa, the candidate of the opposition MDC Alliance. Both leaders are running for the presidency for the first time. Voting as it happened Can post-Mugabe vote heal divisions? 'Magic owls' and other things about Zimbabwe's election On Sunday, Mr Mugabe, who first came to power after independence in 1980, said he would not vote for his successor. Mr Mugabe, regarded as one of the last ""Big Men"" of African politics, was forced out of office last November by Mr Mnangagwa with the help of the military. By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News In Domboshawa village, about an hour's car drive from the capital, Harare, many had been in the queue even before sunrise. The first group of voters were mainly elderly people but there were some youngsters too. Surrounded by mountains and rolling hills, the villagers were in good spirits, chatting and laughing, as they waited to vote in a primary school that had been converted into a polling station. This video can not be played What do voters in rural Zimbabwe want? Having covered the 2008 and 2013 election, I met families who shared horrid stories of assault and intimidation for pledging allegiance to any party other than Zanu-PF. But there is an air of optimism about this election. ""This election is different, there hasn't been violence. It's a good sign,"" one voter told me. Crowds whistled and broke into chants of ""Chamisa"" when the 40-year-old MDC leader cast his ballot on the outskirts of Harare, amidst a media scrum. Nelson Chamisa hopes to become Zimbabwe's youngest president ""We will win this election to the extent it's free and fair... it's a done deal,"" he told the BBC. He later alleged on Twitter that long queues in Harare suggested a ""deliberate attempt to suppress and frustrate the urban vote"". Allow Twitter content?

The country expected a high turnout of first-time voters. More than 5.6 million Zimbabweans were registered, almost half of those under the age of 35. People had to re-register for this year's poll as the electoral commission introduced a biometric system to eliminate any ""ghost voters"" - though the opposition still alleges there are irregularities in the voters' roll. The Zimbabwe Election Commission (Zec) says it will deliver a credible poll. Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zanu-PF Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his party faction is known as ""Lacoste"" Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after the 2008 election Thought to be 75 years old, he promises to deliver jobs, and is seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on supporters of ex-President Mugabe. The 'crocodile' who snapped back Nelson Chamisa, MDC Alliance His skull was fractured when beaten up by state security agents in 2007 Became an MP at 25, a cabinet minister at 31 and could become the youngest president at 40 A recently qualified pastor, he has been using the hashtag #GodIsInIt for his campaign Has promised to rebuild the country's devastated economy, but has been criticised for making extravagant promises - such as the introduction of a high-speed bullet train and bringing the Olympics to Zimbabwe. The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Hundreds of international observers were deployed for the first time in 16 years to ensure the vote went smoothly. European Union (EU) chief observer Elmar Brok said it was too soon to make a judgement but voting had been ""very smooth"" in some areas, and ""totally disorganised"" in other areas, Reuters news agency reports. As well as worries about the voters' roll, the opposition has expressed concern over the security of ballot papers and voter intimidation in mainly rural areas. More than 5.6 million voters have registered Liberia's former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who was monitoring the poll on behalf of the US-based National Democratic Institute, told the BBC that the long queues showed Zimbabweans were enthusiastic about voting, without any kind of repression. ""I think this is an exciting moment for Zimbabweans to change the course of their country through their votes,"" she told the BBC. Mr Mnangagwa invited the observers as part of his attempts to end Zimbabwe's isolation, and to secure investments to rebuild the shattered economy. Mr Mugabe had a poor relationship with Western powers, accusing them of undermining Zimbabwe's sovereignty and trying to topple him.

"This video can not be played Robert Mugabe refused to back Emmerson Mnangagwa Zimbabwe's ex-president Robert Mugabe says he will not vote for his successor and former ally in Monday's elections. In a surprise speech, Mr Mugabe said he could not support Zanu-PF's Emmerson Mnangagwa after being forced from office by the ""party I founded"". ""I cannot vote for those who tormented me,"" he said. He added that he had not chosen among the other candidates but wished the main opposition leader well. Mr Mugabe was ousted last year after almost four decades as leader. Mr Mnangagwa's main challenger is the candidate from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Nelson Chamisa. Can post-Mugabe vote heal divisions? Video: What do young voters want? Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats?

In response to the comments, Mr Mnangagwa accused his former boss of making a deal with the opposition. ""It is clear to all that Chamisa has forged a deal with Mugabe, we can no longer believe that his intentions are to transform Zimbabwe and rebuild our nation,"" he said. Speaking from his home in the capital, Harare, on Sunday, the former president again said he had been ""sacked"" as part of a military coup and that he left office in order to ""avoid conflict"". ""I hope the choice of voting tomorrow will throw, thrust away the military government and bring us back to constitutionality,"" he said. Grace Mugabe accompanied her husband for his address in Harare on Sunday Mr Mugabe said that MDC leader Nelson Chamisa was the only viable candidate Mr Mugabe also denied that, as president, he had planned to hand the leadership to his wife, Grace, saying it was ""utter nonsense"". He suggested that ex-defence minister Sydney Sekeramayi should have taken over. By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Harare Robert Mugabe has hardly been seen or heard from since his unceremonious removal from the presidency last November. If Sunday's surprise news conference is anything to go by, the former statesman has not forgiven those who took his Zimbabwe away from him. At times he appeared frail, but his words were cutting. He spent much of his address criticising the current government led by Mr Mnangagwa, once a close ally. He believes President Mnangagwa's rise to the top job was unconstitutional. Perhaps the strongest sign of their fractured relationship was the revelation that he would not be voting for Zanu-PF, the party he helped found. But does Mr Mugabe still matter here in Zimbabwe? Not in any way he would appreciate; there is an overwhelming sense especially from young people that he is out of touch with the challenges facing Zimbabweans today. And while Zimbabwe might owe its independence to Mr Mugabe, there's a new Zimbabwe waiting to be born. More than five million Zimbabweans are preparing to go to the polls to vote in presidential, parliamentary and local elections. There are 23 candidates on the presidential ballot. The country is expecting a high turnout of first-time voters, where the youth vote is expected to be key, with almost half of those registered being under the age of 35. Video: Comedians poke fun after Mugabe The 'crocodile' who snapped back The crusader taking on the 'crocodile' The impoverished country, which has known decades of repressive rule, faces severe economic challenges. These include issues of investment, education, healthcare and jobs - some estimates suggest that the unemployment rate in Zimbabwe is as high as 90%. This video can not be played Why Zimbabwe's election is historic The frontrunners in addressing these challenges are Zanu-PF's President Mnangagwa, 75, and the MDC's Mr Chamisa, 40. An opinion poll last week saw the MDC close the gap with Zanu-PF from 11 percentage points to three, with 20% of voters undecided.

"Pro-choice activists in Buenos Aires dressed as handmaids on Wednesday Dozens of women march in silence through a rainy cityscape. Heads bowed, dressed in red cloaks and white bonnets, it looks like a scene from Gilead, the theocratic patriarchy Margaret Atwood created in dystopian 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale. But this is Buenos Aires. It is Wednesday, and the women involved are calling for abortion to be decriminalised in a country where complications arising from illegal abortion are a leading cause of maternal death. When they reach the Congress building in Argentina's capital, an activist reads a letter from Atwood herself,according to the Associated Press,external. ""Nobody likes abortion, even when safe and legal,"" the Canadian author had written. ""But nobody likes women bleeding to death on the bathroom floor from illegal abortions, either. What to do?"" Why The Handmaid's Tale is so relevant today Dystopian fantasy? The Handmaid's Tale is based entirely on real history 'Handmaid's tale' protest at US Ohio abortion bill In many parts of the world, women's-rights campaigners - particularly those concerned with reproductive rights and abortion - have embraced the symbolism of The Handmaid's Tale. Language and iconography from the book and TV series are increasingly prevalent on marches, protests and social media. Pro-choice advocates protested in Toronto in May According to Amazon,external, Atwood's 1985 novel was the most read in the US in 2017. Kindle and Audible sales data indicates it topped the charts in 48 of 50 states. That resurgent popularity is no doubt driven in no small part by thesuccess of the Hulu television adaptation starring Elisabeth Moss, but activists also point to concerns about women's rights following the inauguration of Donald Trump as president in January 2017. In the election campaign, footage emerged ofthe Republican making obscene remarks about women. Trump also alarmed many pro-choice advocates when hesuggested there should be ""some form of punishment"" for women who have abortions, later clarifying he meant the doctor or practitioner should be punished, not the woman. Emboldened,anti-abortion activistshope Trump's nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court - which would ensure a conservative majority - could see a reversal of the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision which legalises abortion nationally. Pro-choice campaigners worry that bitterly fought victories on reproductive rights are at risk. Atwood's dystopia provides a stark, recognisable illustration of their fears; a visual shorthand for the oppression of women.The author highlights many of these protests on her own Twitter account.,external ""Donald Trump's Supreme Court pick, Brett Kavanaugh, is an immediate threat to our hard-won fundamental rights and freedoms,"" say the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League (Naral) Pro-Choice America group, which campaigns for women's reproductive rights and pro-choice legislation.

""Back in 2015, we had folks in hospital gowns to protest [against] another abortion restriction. We had an inkling that this kind of thing is effective, and the timing of the show coming out, and with the book experiencing a resurgence in popularity, it seemed like the perfect convergence of all those things.""

Parliament voted to ratify the convention in April. In May, demonstrators dressed as handmaids were among theactivists protesting against Northern Ireland's anti-abortion laws in Belfast,external. In Dublin, among those who successfully campaigned forthe Republic of Ireland to overturn its abortion ban in a historic referendum votewere many women in red and white. Chiara Capraro was among those to dress as handmaids during anti-Trump protests in London In London, Chiara Capraro, a women's human-rights programme manager at Amnesty International, was among the crowds marching to voice their opposition to President Trump, who visited the UK earlier in July. She attended the protest with a friend, also dressed as a handmaid. Once there, they met other protesters in similar dress. Speaking in a personal capacity, she told the BBC: ""I read the book a long time ago."" ""I think that it feels less and less dystopian. Immediately when I heard there was going to be a protest I knew I would go as a handmaid. ""The symbolism is so powerful, reducing women to their reproductive functions. Women become just vehicles to produce children. It's a symbol to say we need to be vigilant, to be careful."" Ms Capraro was born in Italy, though she lives in London. Abortion in the first 90 days of pregnancy has been legal in her home country since a 1978 referendum. But medical professionals in the predominantly Catholic country can refuse to carry out the procedures on the basis of their religious convictions.Some 70% of gynaecologists in Italy refuse to perform abortions,external- a figure that has grown significantly over the past two decades. ""It's not just a thing that's happening in the US. It's happening all over the world,"" Ms Capraro said. ""It's disheartening to have to take the same battles and fight attempts to oppress women. It's a reminder that rights are not won for ever. ""People who are attacked under these agendas tend to be the most marginalised. ""But the feminist movement is finding strength again, if you look at what is happening inPolandand Argentina."" And so to Buenos Aires. In June, Argentina's lower house narrowly backed a bill which would legalise elective abortion in the Catholic nation during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. The bill still needs to pass through Argentina's senate, where it is expected to face an uphill battle. Several senators have expressed opposition. If successful, Argentina will become just the third Latin American nation - after Uruguay and Cuba - to legalise elective abortion. It is unlikely that activists will be putting away their cloaks and bonnets in the foreseeable future.

"This video can not be played Is this skeleton of Jamestown hero George Yeardley? Established in 1607, Jamestown was the first permanent British colony in America. But it nearly didn't survive. The fact it did, is due in large part to Sir George Yeardley, a military man, social reformer - and one of the first English slaveholders in the colonies. Archaeologists now think they've discovered his remains. Barely 60 people survived the winter of 1609 at Jamestown. Hundreds had died of starvation or were picked off by Powhatan Indians if they ventured beyond the walls of the settlement. By the time relief arrived in 1610, conditions were so dire that some of the settlers had resorted to cannibalism. Sir Thomas Gates, who headed the first rescue mission, was so appalled by the suffering he decided to evacuate the colony and head for Newfoundland where he hoped to find passage back to England. But as they waited for the tide to turn, a longboat was spotted coming towards them. It was an advance party of another expedition headed by Lord De La Warr consisting of three ships, 150 colonists and enough food to last a year. It also carried Captain George Yeardley, who was to have such an impact on the future of America. Supplies arrived at the stricken colony just in time Much to their distress, the Jamestown survivors were ordered back to the fort and Yeardley was one of the commanders in charge of imposing martial law to keep order. ""Things couldn't have been worse. But Yeardley and Gates turned it around,"" says historian and author Jim Horn, President of Jamestown Rediscovery, which manages the historic site. Yeardley returned to England in 1616 and two years later was appointed Captain General and Lord Governor of Virginia. He arrived back at Jamestown in April 1619 with instructions to transform the colony from a military regime to a civil society in an effort to attract more settlers. ""The Virginia Company (which controlled the colony) wanted a society that was an improvement on England,"" says Dr Horn author of an upcoming book, 1619: Jamestown and the Forging of American Democracy. ""There would be work for all and everyone would have a role and a place in society - even Indian people, which was quite progressive for the time. It was a Christian commonwealth that included the Powhatan Indians and it was Sir George Yeardley's task to implement those Great Reforms."" America's first General Assembly, with Yeardley presiding, seated in red Private property was extended to white males, the rule of law based on the English judicial system was introduced and representative government established the principle of consent by the governed. Support for the Church of England was another key component. ""I think he was a very intelligent man, but he was also clearly someone on the make,"" says Dr Horn. ""In Virginia at this time you could make a fortune from tobacco if you had the resources to acquire land and labour. In 1619, around the time of the General Assembly (which introduced the Great Reforms) the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colony and Sir George became one of the largest English slave owners. They remained in his family for half a century."" The story of America's earliest democratic experiment and the beginnings of slavery is often eclipsed by the arrival of the Plymouth Rock pilgrims in 1620 and the Massachusetts pilgrims a decade later. Historic Jamestown ""But American society begins here at Jamestown. This is the place where private property was established and the rule of law and representative government. All those things were critical to the future of early America, and tragically, the development of slavery in this country. ""Racism did not develop out of the Civil War; it did not develop out of the great migrations of the 19th and early 20th Centuries. It was already well established in this country and reaches back over 400 years. We had this canker at the heart of the democratic experiment and that is something important for people to know."" That's why the discovery of the remains of Sir George Yeardley - if indeed they are his - is so significant. American settlers 'turned cannibal' First English US founders identified The grave is located in what was the middle aisle of one of the first churches at Jamestown. Another church was built on top but the position indicates a high status burial. It is one of hundreds of graves of early colonists but a monumental tombstone, discovered in the early 1900s, and other records directed archaeologists from Jamestown Rediscovery to this particular site. Ground-penetrating radar confirmed the presence of a skeleton of the right age and build for Yeardley who died in 1627 aged about 40. DNA taken from teeth and bones and matched against his known living descendants will help confirm - or disprove his identity. Tests are being carried out by the FBI and Professor Turi King, a geneticist at the University of Leicester who helped identify the remains of King Richard III found under a city car park in 2012. Only fragments of the skull were found in the grave but DNA can also be extracted from teeth and Professor King believes she has enough material to work with. The results could take several months but should be available in time for next year's 400th Anniversary of Sir George Yeardley's Great Reforms and the first General Assembly which introduced them.

Northern said some of those cancellations have been because of signalling problems which is the responsibility of Network Rail. The firm also blamed ""other infrastructure problems"". David Brown, managing director at Northern said the cancellations since 4 June had been an attempt to alleviate ""significant disruption"" caused by the nationwide introduction of the new timetable in May. He said: ""Whilst we are ready to reintroduce all 168 daily services, given the need to drive further improvements across Manchester, we have agreed to a more gradual reintroduction of our services."" He said it had been ""working hard"" to ensure customers ""experience stable and reliable journeys today"". ""Whilst we have experienced a few local operational issues, as we do every day, so far the vast majority of services are running to plan,"" he said. ""As at 4pm we have had to cancel 30 services - of around 1,500 we would have operated across our entire network - with nine of these relating to issues with lineside equipment."" Lakes Line: All services Blackpool: All services from Blackpool to Manchester Airport and Manchester Piccadilly Blackpool: Seventeen services a day, out of 30, between Blackpool South and Colne, via Preston Lancashire: Ten daily services, out of 16, between Ormskirk and Preston Lancashire:  All 24 services on the Lancaster to Morecambe line Lancashire:  All four services between Preston and Blackburn Manchester: Four services a day, of 10 removed, from Kirkby to Manchester Victoria via Wigan Dave Guest, BBC News at Preston Railway Station On Preston station this morning there was some scepticism among delay-weary travellers as to whether Northern has finally sorted things out. One frustrated commuter told us her train from Lytham never materialised adding: ""First day of the new timetable and it's out of the window."" Indeed the departure boards did show a number of cancellations and delays, though not nearly as many as in previous weeks. Another traveller told us hopefully: ""Maybe the recent trouble has just been a blip."" Mayor Andy Burnham said: ""People could have legitimately expected, when fewer trains were running, that at least the ones that were running would be on time, well they haven't been. The emergency timetable didn't solve anything. ""And then on Saturday night, nine o'clock an email lands saying Northern will cancel 47 services tomorrow so we can get trains in the right place for Monday morning. ""Even if trains do run better today it's because there were no services yesterday. ""Speak to any commuter in the north west of England and they will tell you that Northern services were poor for a long time before the new timetable came in and they haven't got much better in the two months since."" Rail industry 'has failed passengers' Two-year-old emails 'predicted rail chaos' Asked if Transport Secretary Chris Grayling should lose his job, Mr Burnham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Yes, ultimately, because he's just not doing enough."" Last month, Mr Graylingdefended his handling of the sagaand announced an inquiry into what went wrong. 20 May:A rail timetable overhaul - billed as the biggest in the UK - begins 4 June:Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway remove hundreds of trains in an ""interim timetable"" to deal with the chaos on the rail network 4 June:Transport Secretary Chris Grayling announces compensation for commuters and an inquiry into what went wrong 15 June:Govia Thameslink chief executive Charles Horton resigns 18 July:It is announced a new rail ombudsman is to be set up to handle complaints from passengers about train travel 30 July:75% of Northern services cancelled following the timetable shake-up begin running again A government spokesman said: ""The Rail North Partnership has accepted the rail industry's recommendation to phase in services from Monday when 75% of the Northern train services removed during the interim timetable will be reintroduced. ""This is in addition to further adjustments to timetables to improve reliability, so that passengers can better plan ahead."" He added that Mr Burnham sits on the board ofTransport for the North,external""which jointly manages the Northern franchise through the Rail North Partnership"".

"The inquiry will assess the causes, consequences and management of the disruption An inquiry into widespread rail disruption following timetable changes has been launched. It will identify what led to the failed introduction of new schedules and make recommendations ""before any future major network changes"",the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) said,external. Disruption to passengers, especially on Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) lines, will be examined. ORR chair Stephen Glaister said a final report will be published by December. Transport SecretaryChris Grayling announced the plan for an inquiryinto repeatedcancellations and delaysafter the industry attempted to introduce new timetables last month. Rail users expressed their frustrations at Manchester Piccadilly GTR and Northern had to remove hundreds of trainsin a temporary timetable change to deal with the chaos on the rail network. The ORR said the inquiry will: identify factors that contributed to the failure to produce and introduce a satisfactory operational timetable reach conclusions about managing risks created by major network changes make recommendations to the industry and government before any future major network changes An interim report will be published in September. Commuters have been faced with cancellations across the network Professor Glaister said it ""is disappointing that the industry could not make the new timetable work"" and the ORR will ""look at this issue independently and dispassionately"". He said he wants the inquiry ""to proceed at pace"" but ""it is important to be thorough and impartial"" and ""collect evidence from a range of organisations, including passenger representatives such as Transport Focus"". An expert panel of external advisers will support the inquiry and ""challenge whether the ORR's own role, as regulator of Network Rail and of the train operating companies, has been properly assessed by the Inquiry.""

"Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has called for an investigation into Northern Greater Manchester's mayor has called on the government to investigate claims that train operator Northern knew about ""likely"" cancellations in advance. Andy Burnham said a whistleblower has also alleged the firm is choosing to pay fines for cancelled services rather than employ staff on rest days. It comes after a series of public exchanges in whichthe mayor has criticised Northern's ""unacceptably poor"" service. Northern has denied the allegations. An internal email, provided by an anonymous Northern employee and published by Mr Burnham, allegedly identified a number of services which ""are likely to be cancelled"". The mayor said the allegations ""appear to contradict"" Northern's public claims that it did not plan cancellations in advance. ""If true, these revelations are very worrying. It now looks like Northern have simply not been straight with the Greater Manchester public,"" Mr Burnham said. The whistleblower also alleged that Northern pulled out of an agreement with drivers around payment for working on rest days, leading to a shortage of staff. Despite being fined for the number of cancelled services, the company had still benefited as a result, it was claimed. ""A situation where imposed fines are more lenient than the cost of the company doing actually their job would be a farce,"" said Mr Burnham. In a letter to the transport secretary Chris Grayling, the mayor said these ""serious allegations ... warrant further investigation"". On Wednesday, he also wrote to Transport for the North criticising Northern for delays, overcrowding and cancellations on its services. A spokesman for Northern said the company ""did not cancel any agreement"" on driver's rest days and denied that any services had been cancelled to save money. ""Northern put forward a formal proposal to [train driver's union] Aslef to continue with rest-day working, but the two parties were not able to reach agreement,"" he said. ""There is no list of pre-planned train cancellations, we cancel trains with great reluctance, and never for financial reasons,"" the spokesman said.

"Zara Tindall and her husband Mike with her oldest daughter, Mia Zara Tindall has spoken about suffering two miscarriages before having her second child. The Queen's granddaughter had announced in 2016 that a pregnancy announced the previous month had ended in a miscarriage. Now she has toldthe Sunday Times she,externallater suffered another miscarriage before becoming pregnant with her daughter Lena, who was born in June. She said for a time ""you don't talk about it because it's too raw"". ""But as with everything, time's a great healer,"" she said. Royal Family tree and succession line Who are the youngest royals? The Olympic medal-winning equestrian is married to ex-England rugby captain Mike Tindall. The pair have a four-year-old daughter Mia as well as Lena. Mrs Tindall does not hold a royal title and is not an HRH but, as a descendant of the Queen, her pregnancies were announced publicly. After announcing that she hadlost her baby in 2016she said she and her husband had been inundated with letters from people saying they had been through the same thing. In a joint interview with her brother Peter Phillips, Mrs Tindall said: ""For me, the worst bit was that we had to tell everyone, everyone knew."" The 37-year-old went on: ""I had to go through having the baby because it was so far along. ""I then had another miscarriage really early on."" Mrs Tindall praised her ""concerned"" husband and ""protective"" brother, saying: ""It was a time when my family came to the fore and I needed them."" Mrs Tindall said: ""In our case, it was something that was really rare; it was nature saying, 'This one's not right.'."" The couple were at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in May Mr Phillips explained how he and his wife Autumn and their two daughters live 200 yards from Mrs Tindall and her family. He said: ""When Mia arrived it was quite difficult to compute. Zara has always been the little sister and suddenly I thought: 'Christ, you've properly grown up now'. ""That rather annoying little sister is now a well-respected equestrian and an exceptional mother. If my daughters come close to achieving what Zara's achieved, I'd be happy."" Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy up to but not including 24 weeks of pregnancy. If the baby is lost after this point it is classed as a stillbirth Unlike stillbirths, miscarriages do not have to be registered or recorded anywhere so there are no official statistics, but it is estimated that about one in four pregnancies ends in miscarriage The majority of miscarriages happen within the first 12 weeks and by far the majority of those happen within the first eight weeks. When a woman gets to the second trimester - the middle three months of pregnancy - there is a much smaller likelihood of miscarriage About half of miscarriages are thought to happen because something has gone wrong with the early development of the egg cell or sperm cell Miscarriages can also happen because of a blood clotting problem which can starve the baby of oxygen, hormonal problems, a problem with the shape or strength of the uterus or cervix, large fibroids (non-cancerous growths) in the uterus, or infection The main two risk factors for miscarriage are a woman's age and the number of miscarriages she has had before. As women age, their eggs too get older and there are more likely to be abnormalities Source: Miscarriage Association,external Zara Tindall gives birth to baby girl Zara and Mike Tindall lose their baby Full Sunday Times interview with Zara Tindall and Peter Phillips The Miscarriage Association LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Thousands of people came together in the capital, Addis Ababa Ethiopian police have fired tear gas to keep back thousands of people who gathered to pay their final respects to the chief engineer of a controversial dam project. Simegnew Bekele was found shot dead in the capital Addis Ababa on Thursday. It is not clear if his death was connected to the $4bn (Â£3bn) Grand Renaissance Dam project. Mr Simegnew's death prompted an outpouring of grief. Hundreds packed a cathedral, with thousands more outside. The police say they are still investigating the shooting. Why Ethiopia is grieving 'hero' dam engineer Simegnew Bekele The 'water war' brewing over the new River Nile dam Egyptian authorities have opposed the project over fears the supply of water from the River Nile will be affected. Simegnew Bekele's coffin was draped in the Ethiopian flag For many the engineer had come to represent the country's ambitions As news of Mr Simegnew's death spread on Thursday, there was a spontaneous demonstration outside the state broadcaster's offices in Addis Ababa, with people calling for ""justice for the engineer"". Thousands then gathered on Sunday for his burial. Videos shared on social media showed the crowd being dispersed with tear gas. Other pictures show injured mourners being carried by Ethiopian security forces. According to pro-opposition Ethiopia Live Updates, the crowd had been calling for the arrest of those who killed Mr Simegnew.
