"The Nord Stream 1 pipeline in Lubmin, Germany Russia's main gas pipeline to Europe will not reopen as planned on Saturday, adding to concerns about energy supplies this winter. State energy firm Gazprom said it found a leak on Nord Stream 1, meaning it could be closed indefinitely. The pipeline, which runs to Germany, has been shut for three days for what Gazprom described as maintenance work. Europe accused Russia of using its gas supplies to blackmail Europe amid the Ukraine conflict, which Moscow denies. Energy prices have soared since Russia invaded Ukraine and scarce supplies could push up costs even further. There are growing fears families in the EU will be unable to afford the cost of heating this winter. The UK could also be affected. Although not reliant on Nord Stream 1 for its gas, the pipeline suspension could drive the cost of wholesale gas up further, which has been behind the spiralling rise in the energy price cap. EU told to prepare for Russian gas shut-off Cold showers as German city turns off the gas Faisal Islam, the BBC's economics editor, described the indefinite closure of Nord Stream 1 as a very serious development, noting that Russia had kept supplies into Europe flowing even at the height of the Cold War. The stand-off with Russia has forced countries to fill their own gas supplies, with Germany's stores increasing from less than half in June to 84% full today. As a result, internationalgas priceshave fallen in the past week, but remain high by normal standards. Europe is attempting to wean itself off Russian energy in an effort to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the war, but the transition may not come quickly enough. Gazprom released a photo of the oil leak EU Council President Charles Michel said Russia's move was ""sadly no surprise"". ""Use of gas as a weapon will not change the resolve of the EU. We will accelerate our path towards energy independence. Our duty is to protect our citizens and support the freedom of Ukraine,"" he tweeted. Moscow denies using energy supplies as an economic weapon against Western countries supporting Ukraine. It has blamed the sanctions for holding up routine maintenance of Nord Stream 1, but the EU says this is a pretext. Germany's network regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur, said the country was now better prepared for Russian gas supplies to cease, but it urged citizens and companies to cut consumption. Gazprom's announcement came shortly afterthe G7 nations agreed to cap the price of Russian oil in support of Ukraine. The G7 (Group of Seven) consists of the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. Their introduction of a price cap means countries that sign up to the policy will be permitted to purchase only Russian oil and petroleum products transported via sea that are sold at or below the price cap. However, Russia says it will not export to countries that participate in the cap. The gas pipeline stretches from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany and can carry up to 170 million cubic metres of gas a day. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins Onâ¦ How this yearâs biggest stories connect It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is Gazprom. Germany had also previously supported the construction of a parallel pipeline - Nord Stream 2 - but the project was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine. Gazprom said the fault had been detected at the Portovaya compressor station, with the inspection carried out alongside workers from Siemens, the German firm that maintains the turbine. It said that fixing of oil leaks in key engines was only possible in specialised workshops, which had been hindered by Western sanctions. However, Siemens itself said: ""Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure within the scope of maintenance work."" This is not the first time since the invasion that the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has been closed. In July, Gazprom cut off supplies completely for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again 10 days later, but at a much reduced level. Speaking to the BBC from the Swiss capital Bern, an economist and energy analyst, Cornelia Meyer, said the gas shutdown would have a major impact on employment and prices. ""That really has huge ramifications for gas in Europe which is about four times more expensive than it was a year ago and this cost of living crisis will really soar because it's not just gas,"" she said. ""Gas becomes fertiliser and it's used in many industrial processes, so that will affect jobs, and it will affect costs."" This is no coincidence. Russia's state-controlled gas giant announced an indefinite extension to a three-day maintenance halt to flows of gas through the continent's key energy artery, hours after leading western finance ministers vowed to escalate sanctions on Russian oil. Gazprom's official reason is that an oil leak has been found and the pipeline cannot work without German imports of technology, which are now subject to sanctions. Few observers believe, however, that this is anything other than an attempt essentially to blackmail Europe over supplies. This is a very serious development. Even during the height of the Cold War, Russia kept supplies of its gas flowing into Europe. This cut-off though - and the pointed attempt by Gazprom to blame the German energy giant Siemens for the malfunction - is the culmination of decades of dysfunction in the energy relationship between Russia and Germany.

"Passengers were unable to move their cars as the queues built up Travellers heading to the UK have suffered delays of up to six hours as they queued at the Port of Calais. Ferry operators DFDS and P&O Ferries apologised for the long wait times at UK border controls on Saturday. Passengers shared their ""misery"" at being stuck in cars for hours heading back from mainland Europe, especially as some had children with them. DFDS said queues could reach two and a half hours at border controls on Sunday. A spokesperson earlier told BBC News: ""Calais was affected by 'the perfect storm' of summer volumes in combination with post-Brexit border checks, causing six hours of queuing. ""We worked together with partners to reduce the queues as quickly as we could."" Jo Van Herwegen, from Surrey, said she ""felt lucky"" to have water with her while she waited for five hours in the French heat with her two children. Speaking to BBC News, she said: ""It was little to do with the amount of people but with the poor layout and no traffic control. ""We were travelling back from Belgium and expected to be delayed, so arrived early. ""There weren't many cars but an hour later we had moved just two cars. The way this terminal is designed is the problem."" Passenger Josh Williams added he was also stuck waiting in Calais for five hours on Saturday to get a ferry back to the UK. He shared pictures of long lines of cars filled with families trying to get back to Dover ahead of the new school year starting for many in England next week. People at the port reported delays lasting nearly six hours Leanne Wood, from near York, and her two children arrived home in the early hours of Sunday morning because of the queues at Calais. She said: ""We arrived early and the queues started forming but it was taking too long because there was no space for the cars. ""The reason for the delay seemed to be British passport control - they seemed to be on a 'go slow'. ""They knew there would be British families coming back but it was as though they wanted to create misery - to make a point."" Earlier on Saturday afternoon, DFDS warned on social media the queues could potentially last for six hours for people travelling from Calais. P&O added extra vessels were used for passengers who had missed their booked sailings, to ""help with the passengers that have been stuck at border control"", as queues continued into the evening. The issue appeared to be improved on Sunday, when DFDS said at 12:00 BST there were 45 minute queues at border control, and no waits at check-in. It earlier said traffic at the ports in Dunkirk, in France, and Dover, in the UK, was ""free-flowing through check-in and border controls"" throughout the day. P&O Ferries tweeted that queues were at about an hour. But DFDS went on to post just before 18:00 BST that although there were ""no queues at check-in"", there were currently ""queues of up to 150 minutes at border controls"" in Calais. It added the Dunkirk port was now seeing waiting times of about 45 minutes too. At the start of the school holidays in July there were long queues of traffic in Dover as people tried to get through French border control to head to mainland Europe Passenger Craig Price, from Essex, told the BBC he spent five hours at Calais Saturday afternoon after driving through Italy and France. ""We arrived at 3pm and got through at 8pm,"" he said. ""The design of the port does not seem able to cope with the need for French and UK border control,"" he said, adding that two-thirds of UK border control booths were manned. The BBC has approached the Home Office and Border Force for comment. There were similar wait times in Calais just days earlier on 24 August due to extra traffic arriving from the Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel Le Shuttle passengers had to leave their vehicles and walk through an emergency service tunnelwhen the train's alarms went off. Have you been affected by delays at Calais?

"A CCTV image of the victim was released with permission from his family The family of a Sikh priest ""left for dead"" in an attack more than two months ago have appealed for help to catch his attacker. The unnamed 62-year-old man was left with life-changing injuries and has been in hospital since the attack in the centre of Manchester on 23 June.

"The managing director of Avanti West Coast is stepping down, the company has announced, amid a backlash over timetable cuts. The rail firm said Phil Whittingham would leave on 15 September - the same daynew train strikes will take place. Services between London and Manchester have been cut to a third, with the company blaming ""staffing issues"". Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the firm should be in the ""last chance saloon"". Mr Burnham has previously called for the company's licence to be revoked if services aren't restored - a decision only the government can take. ""This is England's most important railway line, linking its biggest cities, and every day that this chaos continues is a day when our economy in Greater Manchester is damaged and another day of misery for passengers,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Last month, Avanti West Coast cut its timetable from three services an hour to one - blaming staffing issues. Explaining the timetable change at the time, Mr Whittingham said the ""current industrial relations climate"" had resulted in ""severe staff shortages in some grades through increased sickness levels, as well as unofficial strike action by Aslef members"". The company said it currently had more drivers than before the pandemic but relied on staff working overtime in order to run a full timetable and keep up with training. The union said the company needed to employ more drivers - and denied any accusation of unofficial strike action. In a statement, Avanti apologised to customers for the ""enormous frustration and inconvenience"" caused by the reduced timetable. When are the next rail strikes? More train drivers set to strike on 15 September Train operator suspends sales and cuts timetables The cuts to the timetable have prompted widespread criticism and frustration. Mr Burnham said Mr Whittingham's departure revealed a serious management failure, and urged the government to ""stop playing politics"" regarding the country's widespread strike action. He called on the UK's new prime minister, who will be announced on Monday, to ""reset"" the debate. ""We need to start fixing problems and working together, rather than this playing the politics and trying to demonise the trade unions."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""People deserve certainty and confidence that their train will run on time, and while the change of schedule was unavoidable, it should minimise the fallout for passengers. ""This is a prime example of why we need to modernise our railways, so passengers benefit from reliable timetables that don't rely on the goodwill of drivers volunteering to work overtime in the first place."" First Rail boss Steve Montgomery said: ""Having led the team through the challenges presented by the pandemic over the last two years and into the recovery period, Phil leaves with the team ready for the challenges in delivering the future service requirements. ""I would like to thank Phil and wish him well in the future."" On Wednesday, Aslef said its members at 12 operators - including Avanti West Coast - would take industrial action on 15 September. Separately, the RMT union has announced two more national rail strikes later this month. Workers will walk out on 15 and 17 September in a long-running dispute about pay, jobs and conditions.

"Moscow is redeploying troops to the south, where it is under heavy pressure from Ukrainian forces Neither Russia nor Ukraine is likely to achieve any decisive military action in Ukraine this year, the UK's head of military intelligence has told the BBC. Speaking in a rare public interview, Gen Sir Jim Hockenhull also said he had been keeping a very close eye on Russia's potential use of nuclear weapons. On 23 February this year, Gen Hockenhull had been working late into the night. He cycled home at midnight, and went to bed at about 01:00. He got a phone call an hour later saying there had been some odd indicators of activity on the Ukrainian border, so he got back on his bicycle and returned to work. The confirmation came that Russia had indeed invaded its neighbour. Minutes later, and still in the early hours of the morning, he was briefing Britain's prime minister and defence secretary on the beginning of Europe's biggest armed conflict since World War Two. Gen Hockenhull began thinking a Russian invasion was likely last November As the chief of Defence Intelligence for the past four years, Gen Hockenhull works in the shadows, running an organisation that deals with highly classified and secret information. The war in Ukraine has made its work and his job more important. He says he became increasingly convinced that Russia was about to launch its invasion in November last year. That was when he thought ""this is going to happen"", he recalls. The week before the invasion, he took the highly unusual decision of publishing a map predicting Russia's likely invasion plans on Twitter. It was a decision he says wasn't easy, but he was convinced there was a need to get information out into the public domain. ""It's important to get the truth out before the lies come,"" he says. In maps: Ukraine launches counterattack in south What weapons are being given to Ukraine by the UK? He also defends the West's decision to highlight Russia's potential to use chemical and biological weapons. He believes it helped stop them from conducting so-called false flag operations to try and portray the Ukrainians or the West as being the instigators of the conflict. Rarely has so much classified intelligence been shared with the public. Defence Intelligence has since been publishing daily updates throughout the war. Intelligence is not a science - predictions are made on a scale of probabilities, and there are a number of things that have surprised UK defence intelligence. Gen Hockenhull says the strength of Western unity and Ukrainian resistance have surpassed expectations. So have the failures of Russia's military, whose command, control and logistics have been ""poor"", he suggests. It has also suffered from political interference, from the strategic to the tactical level, he adds. There has been a lack of trust between Russia's political and military class - and Gen Hockenhull says he is surprised Moscow has suffered all of these problems at the same time. We should be wary of thinking in binary terms - that people are winning or losing - or thinking it is a stalemate, says Gen Hockenhull. Russia, he says, is clearly trying to generate more forces after suffering significant losses. It is also having to redeploy some of its troops from the Donbas to the south, where he says it is under significant pressure from Ukrainian forces in and around Kherson. But Gen Hockenhull still says it is unrealistic to expect a decisive shift in the south in the coming months. He says he understands Ukraine's desire to retake territory, but adds that while there will be counter-attacks and counter-offensives, he does not believe there will be decisive action taken this year by either side. His expectation is for a long conflict. This raises another question - what will President Vladimir Putin do if he continues to struggle to meet his military objectives? Could he resort to the use of nuclear weapons? Gen Hockenhull says this is watched ""very, very closely"". Moscow is unlikely to use nuclear weapons imminently, Gen Hockenhull says Russian military doctrine, unlike that of the West, includes the use of tactical, or battlefield, nuclear weapons for military operations. Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons? World one misstep from nuclear annihilation - UN While he believes it is unlikely tactical nuclear weapons will be used imminently, he says it is something he will continue to watch. The likelihood of their being used may change if the battlefield dynamic shifts, he explains. After four years as chief of Defence Intelligence, Gen Hockenhull is now moving on to head up UK defence's Strategic Command - which includes overseeing the UK's activities in space, in cyber and the use of special forces. He still sees Russia as the greatest threat, but he's also increasingly concerned about China. Beijing has been flexing its military muscle over Taiwanin recent weeks. Gen Hockenhull says it would be inappropriate of him to not consider an ""incredible military modernisation with a country determined to resolve a political issue"" a problem. The work of British military intelligence is not going to get any easier.

"This video can not be played Olena Zelenska tells Laura Kuenssberg about the human cost of the war The economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, the country's first lady has told the BBC, but as Britons ""count pennies"", Ukrainians ""count casualties"". Olena Zelenska told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that if support for Ukraine was strong the crisis would be shorter. In an interview recorded in Kyiv, she also said it was important to keep highlighting the human toll of the war. And Mrs Zelenska said while she rarely saw her husband, they talk every day. The first lady, who has been married to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky since 2003, spoke to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg in Kyiv. In a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on Sunday 4 September, Mrs Zelenska was asked what message she had for British people who are facing soaring energy bills in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the impact that has had on global gas and oil prices. ""I understand the situation is very tough. But let me recall that at the time of the Covid-19 epidemic, and it's still with us, when there were price hikes, Ukraine was affected as well. ""The prices are going up in Ukraine as well. But in addition our people get killed. ""So when you start counting pennies on your bank account or in your pocket, we do the same and count our casualties,"" she said. Johnson: Endure energy crisis to counter Russia Ukraine's president: Johnson's support was special Russia shuts major gas pipeline to Europe - again Mrs Zelenska's comments follow Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suggestion while visiting Kyiv last month that households across Europe would have to endure the cost of living crisis and ""stay the course"" with Ukraine to counter Russia's aggression. In the UK, the inflation rate is forecast to hit a 42-year high of 13.3% this year, while the economy is expected to shrink for more than a year. President Zelensky has been praised for staying with his people following the Russian invasion The Bank of England said the main reason for high inflation and low growth was rising energy bills, fuelled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. European countries have accused Russia - a major global supplier of energy - of using gas as a weapon by limiting supplies in response to sanctions. Born 16 February 1978 in Kryvyi Rih, a Russian-speaking area of central Ukraine Studied architecture at university Married Volodymyr Zelensky in September 2003 Has two children - daughter Oleksandra and son Kyrylo Became Ukraine's first lady when her husband was elected president in 2019 Mrs Zelenska told the BBC that it was hard for people outside Ukraine to understand the impact of the war on its people but it was important to share human stories about the toll the conflict was taking. She said that many parents would have been moved by the story of a Ukrainian boy who was filmed crossing the Polish border in floods of tears last March. ""I think that fathers and mothers watching this video could not but break into tears. I always place myself in their situation and I think that everyone - every human in the world should feel the same,"" Mrs Zelenska said. ""That's why we have to tell these stories, to show these stories, because these are the faces of a war. Not the number of bombs dropped, not the amount of money spent, human stories - and there are a thousand stories like that around."" Ms Zelenska and her husband attended a public event together in May The first lady, who comes from the same town as her husband and has known him since university, said she was ""insulted"" by people who said they were surprised at his transition from TV actor to wartime leader. ""He's the man I've always known.  He wouldn't do anything else,"" she said. Asked whether she hoped to come to the UK after it was chosen to host the Eurovision Song Contest because Ukraine - which won the event this year - was deemed to be too unsafe, Ms Zelenska said she would ""love to go"" . But she added it was a ""bitter feeling"" to accept the winners would not be next year's host.

"The Nord Stream 1 pipeline in Lubmin, Germany Russia's main gas pipeline to Europe will not reopen as planned on Saturday, adding to concerns about energy supplies this winter. State energy firm Gazprom said it found a leak on Nord Stream 1, meaning it could be closed indefinitely. The pipeline, which runs to Germany, has been shut for three days for what Gazprom described as maintenance work. Europe accused Russia of using its gas supplies to blackmail Europe amid the Ukraine conflict, which Moscow denies. Energy prices have soared since Russia invaded Ukraine and scarce supplies could push up costs even further. There are growing fears families in the EU will be unable to afford the cost of heating this winter. The UK could also be affected. Although not reliant on Nord Stream 1 for its gas, the pipeline suspension could drive the cost of wholesale gas up further, which has been behind the spiralling rise in the energy price cap. EU told to prepare for Russian gas shut-off Cold showers as German city turns off the gas Faisal Islam, the BBC's economics editor, described the indefinite closure of Nord Stream 1 as a very serious development, noting that Russia had kept supplies into Europe flowing even at the height of the Cold War. The stand-off with Russia has forced countries to fill their own gas supplies, with Germany's stores increasing from less than half in June to 84% full today. As a result, internationalgas priceshave fallen in the past week, but remain high by normal standards. Europe is attempting to wean itself off Russian energy in an effort to reduce Moscow's ability to finance the war, but the transition may not come quickly enough. Gazprom released a photo of the oil leak EU Council President Charles Michel said Russia's move was ""sadly no surprise"". ""Use of gas as a weapon will not change the resolve of the EU. We will accelerate our path towards energy independence. Our duty is to protect our citizens and support the freedom of Ukraine,"" he tweeted. Moscow denies using energy supplies as an economic weapon against Western countries supporting Ukraine. It has blamed the sanctions for holding up routine maintenance of Nord Stream 1, but the EU says this is a pretext. Germany's network regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur, said the country was now better prepared for Russian gas supplies to cease, but it urged citizens and companies to cut consumption. Gazprom's announcement came shortly afterthe G7 nations agreed to cap the price of Russian oil in support of Ukraine. The G7 (Group of Seven) consists of the UK, US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. Their introduction of a price cap means countries that sign up to the policy will be permitted to purchase only Russian oil and petroleum products transported via sea that are sold at or below the price cap. However, Russia says it will not export to countries that participate in the cap. The gas pipeline stretches from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany and can carry up to 170 million cubic metres of gas a day. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins Onâ¦ How this yearâs biggest stories connect It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is Gazprom. Germany had also previously supported the construction of a parallel pipeline - Nord Stream 2 - but the project was halted after Russia invaded Ukraine. Gazprom said the fault had been detected at the Portovaya compressor station, with the inspection carried out alongside workers from Siemens, the German firm that maintains the turbine. It said that fixing of oil leaks in key engines was only possible in specialised workshops, which had been hindered by Western sanctions. However, Siemens itself said: ""Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure within the scope of maintenance work."" This is not the first time since the invasion that the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has been closed. In July, Gazprom cut off supplies completely for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again 10 days later, but at a much reduced level. Speaking to the BBC from the Swiss capital Bern, an economist and energy analyst, Cornelia Meyer, said the gas shutdown would have a major impact on employment and prices. ""That really has huge ramifications for gas in Europe which is about four times more expensive than it was a year ago and this cost of living crisis will really soar because it's not just gas,"" she said. ""Gas becomes fertiliser and it's used in many industrial processes, so that will affect jobs, and it will affect costs."" This is no coincidence. Russia's state-controlled gas giant announced an indefinite extension to a three-day maintenance halt to flows of gas through the continent's key energy artery, hours after leading western finance ministers vowed to escalate sanctions on Russian oil. Gazprom's official reason is that an oil leak has been found and the pipeline cannot work without German imports of technology, which are now subject to sanctions. Few observers believe, however, that this is anything other than an attempt essentially to blackmail Europe over supplies. This is a very serious development. Even during the height of the Cold War, Russia kept supplies of its gas flowing into Europe. This cut-off though - and the pointed attempt by Gazprom to blame the German energy giant Siemens for the malfunction - is the culmination of decades of dysfunction in the energy relationship between Russia and Germany.

"This video can not be played Olena Zelenska tells Laura Kuenssberg about the human cost of the war The economic impact of the war in Ukraine is tough on its allies, the country's first lady has told the BBC, but as Britons ""count pennies"", Ukrainians ""count casualties"". Olena Zelenska told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that if support for Ukraine was strong the crisis would be shorter. In an interview recorded in Kyiv, she also said it was important to keep highlighting the human toll of the war. And Mrs Zelenska said while she rarely saw her husband, they talk every day. The first lady, who has been married to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky since 2003, spoke to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg in Kyiv. In a wide-ranging interview to be broadcast on Sunday 4 September, Mrs Zelenska was asked what message she had for British people who are facing soaring energy bills in part due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the impact that has had on global gas and oil prices. ""I understand the situation is very tough. But let me recall that at the time of the Covid-19 epidemic, and it's still with us, when there were price hikes, Ukraine was affected as well. ""The prices are going up in Ukraine as well. But in addition our people get killed. ""So when you start counting pennies on your bank account or in your pocket, we do the same and count our casualties,"" she said. Johnson: Endure energy crisis to counter Russia Ukraine's president: Johnson's support was special Russia shuts major gas pipeline to Europe - again Mrs Zelenska's comments follow Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suggestion while visiting Kyiv last month that households across Europe would have to endure the cost of living crisis and ""stay the course"" with Ukraine to counter Russia's aggression. In the UK, the inflation rate is forecast to hit a 42-year high of 13.3% this year, while the economy is expected to shrink for more than a year.

"The managing director of Avanti West Coast is stepping down, the company has announced, amid a backlash over timetable cuts. The rail firm said Phil Whittingham would leave on 15 September - the same daynew train strikes will take place. Services between London and Manchester have been cut to a third, with the company blaming ""staffing issues"". Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the firm should be in the ""last chance saloon"". Mr Burnham has previously called for the company's licence to be revoked if services aren't restored - a decision only the government can take. ""This is England's most important railway line, linking its biggest cities, and every day that this chaos continues is a day when our economy in Greater Manchester is damaged and another day of misery for passengers,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Last month, Avanti West Coast cut its timetable from three services an hour to one - blaming staffing issues. Explaining the timetable change at the time, Mr Whittingham said the ""current industrial relations climate"" had resulted in ""severe staff shortages in some grades through increased sickness levels, as well as unofficial strike action by Aslef members"". The company said it currently had more drivers than before the pandemic but relied on staff working overtime in order to run a full timetable and keep up with training. The union said the company needed to employ more drivers - and denied any accusation of unofficial strike action. In a statement, Avanti apologised to customers for the ""enormous frustration and inconvenience"" caused by the reduced timetable. When are the next rail strikes? More train drivers set to strike on 15 September Train operator suspends sales and cuts timetables The cuts to the timetable have prompted widespread criticism and frustration. Mr Burnham said Mr Whittingham's departure revealed a serious management failure, and urged the government to ""stop playing politics"" regarding the country's widespread strike action. He called on the UK's new prime minister, who will be announced on Monday, to ""reset"" the debate. ""We need to start fixing problems and working together, rather than this playing the politics and trying to demonise the trade unions."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""People deserve certainty and confidence that their train will run on time, and while the change of schedule was unavoidable, it should minimise the fallout for passengers. ""This is a prime example of why we need to modernise our railways, so passengers benefit from reliable timetables that don't rely on the goodwill of drivers volunteering to work overtime in the first place."" First Rail boss Steve Montgomery said: ""Having led the team through the challenges presented by the pandemic over the last two years and into the recovery period, Phil leaves with the team ready for the challenges in delivering the future service requirements. ""I would like to thank Phil and wish him well in the future."" On Wednesday, Aslef said its members at 12 operators - including Avanti West Coast - would take industrial action on 15 September. Separately, the RMT union has announced two more national rail strikes later this month. Workers will walk out on 15 and 17 September in a long-running dispute about pay, jobs and conditions.

"Jamie Corstorphine showing the evidence of where a large gate was hung on the wall The entrance to a forgotten square which was once home to upper-class society has been found inside a pub during renovation work following a huge fire. Using old maps and directories, experts have discovered the goods entrance led through slum dwellings into an area where physicians, advocates and writers lived. Brown Square, which no longer exists, represented the most ambitious new development ever attempted when it was built in the early 1760s in Edinburgh. It was the first development outside the old city walls and offered an exclusive setting for Edinburgh's professional classes. The entrance passed through an old slum tenement and shop store in Candlemakers Row - where candles were stored outside of the city in case of fire. Brown Square no longer exists An extension was later built onto the corner of the building when George IV Bridge was built on top of Brown Square between 1827 and 1836. It has now been discovered that this contained an ironmongers, which sold the working classes everything from spades and shovels to turnip cutters and candles. Just a few doors up the street at number 59 was a coaching courier. Experts believe it would have used the ironmongers for tacks for the horses shoes and parts for bridles. Jamie Corstorphine, a  local historian who is manager of the City of the Dead Tours, said: ""It would have been like a 24-hour taxi rank but with horses and coaches."" Archways were uncovered after layers of plaster, wood and corrugated iron were peeled off following the fire Mr Corstorphine carried out weeks of research for BBC Scotland following the discovery of the old entrance inside The Oz Bar. He said: ""We can see here that the lower classes lived right next to the upper classes, something that still happens today in Edinburgh. ""At the bottom of the street is the Cowgate which was full of street hawkers and was a low class of living. ""It's where the Irish immigrants set up a life as best they could in the 1820s - it was called Little Ireland."" He said the gentry would cross George IV Bridge and look down at the poor people in the Cowgate and Merchant Street. The fire is understood to have started inside the basement of Patisserie Valerie cafe Mr Corstorphine said: ""These men in their top hats, canes, pocket watches and breeches would enjoy looking down at this living zoo, it was entertainment for them. ""It was a self pick-up to remind them there was always someone worse off than you."" Robert Louis Stevenson said in 1878 of nearby South Bridge: ""To look over the South Bridge and see the Cowgate below full of crying hawkers is to view one rank of society from another in the twinkling of an eye."" George IV Bridge was built as a route to connect the centre of Edinburgh - the Royal Mile - over the Cowgate and Merchant Street to the south side. In August 2021 a huge blaze destroyed many businesses at one end of the 300 metre long bridge, which stretches up through two streets. Harry Potter cafe left in limbo after fire damage JK Rowling table saved from cafe gutted by fire Disruption after Edinburgh Old Town fire The blaze is thought to have started at Patisserie Valerie, which has a basement running under the Elephant House cafe on George IV Bridge - the name for the street at the top of the bridge. The alarm was raised by a cleaner at the Elephant House cafe. The Oz Bar and Merchants restaurant are at the bottom of the bridge in the street below. They were flooded with thousands of gallons of water used by firefighters to put out the blaze. The water damage meant workers were forced to remove several layers from the pub's walls in Candlemaker Row - revealing stonework which was different to the rest of the building. This photograph from 1900 shows 33 Candlemaker Row in the far right of the picture After visiting the site Mr Corstorphine said he could see that the inside wall had at one time been outside. He said: ""This inside wall dates around 1776 and is the original frontage of the tenement. ""You can see where a big gate has been hanging in the arch, which would have been a goods entrance from Candlemaker Row leading into Brown Square. ""It is rough cast the same as the course rubble frontages in the area at the time, so it is clear the iron merchant and now Oz Bar was an extension. These were slum dwellings."" He was also able to discover that iron merchant Redpath, Brown and Co traded from there from 1838. Brown Square was built by architect James Brown, who also designed George Square, which still exists today in Edinburgh. Archives show that those who lived in Brown Square included physician Joseph McKenzie; advocate John McLaurin; lord justice clerk Thomas Miller; Lady Agnew; and a writer to the signet, Isaac Grant. Firefighters checking the building outside the Oz Bar during the fire last year Mr Corstorphine said it was a very interesting and exciting discovery. He said: ""The fire was a travesty and all the businesses are still closed more than a year on. ""The only good to come from it is that we would never have found all this historical evidence if it had not been for the fire."" Fraser Scott, 23, was one of the workmen who discovered the wall. He told BBC Scotland: ""There was a big thick layer of plaster and I had to carefully chisel it away without damaging the stone. ""It was detached from the wall because of the water damage. Fraser Scott was one of the workmen who uncovered the old stonework ""It took two days just to get that final layer off before we wire brushed it and cleaned it. ""I was over the moon when I saw there was such an old wall behind the plaster and I wondered what stories were behind it. It was very exciting."" The workers called Iain Ponton, the owner of the Oz Bar, when they made the discovery. The 46-year-old said: ""When I got a photograph from the contractors saying 'look what we've found' I immediately drove down to the pub. ""They had to remove layers and layers of wood and corrugated iron on top of plaster. When it all came off it exposed this arch. ""I got up on the ladder to see as I was very curious, and then over a week they revealed more and more."" The Oz Bar is on the corner of Candlemaker Row and Merchant Street - on the other side of the building and up a level is the top of George IV Bridge which has the Elephant House and Patisserie Valerie - where the fire is understood to have started His father, Tom Ponton, opened the pub in 1989 on the site of a derelict Harvey's furniture store. ""I thought maybe the wall was something to do with the furniture store,"" said Mr Ponton. ""I had no idea it would actually be evidence of all this history, it's incredible."" He has now vowed not to cover the stonework and archway, but will instead highlight them with lights within the pub.

"Serena Williams has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the second most in tennis history US Open 2022 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:29 August-11 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app Serena Williams waved farewell to the US Open - and her illustrious career - amid emotional scenes after she lost to Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic on a thrilling night in New York. Williams, who turns 41 this month, expects it to be her final match. It will end a 27-year professional career that brought 23 major singles wins and sees the American widely labelled as the greatest of all time. Williams lost 7-5 6-7 (4-7) 6-1 and had tears running down her face afterwards. The former long-time world number one saved five match points in what proved to be the final game but was powerless to stop a sixth. Almost everyone who could rose to their feet when she departed the court on Arthur Ashe Stadium - the scene of her first major triumph in 1999 and five more of the finest wins in her storied career - for what she intends to be the last time. As she waved goodbye and gave a signature twirl, Tina Turner's pop classic 'Simply The Best' boomed out over the sound system. Asked if she would reconsider retiring after her performances this week, Williams said: ""I'm literally playing my way into this and getting better. I should have started sooner this year. I don't think so, but you never know."" Williams was overcome with emotion when she was interviewed in the middle of the court, thanking her family, team, the crowd and her fans across the world for their support over the years. ""I thank everyone that's here, that's been on my side so many years, decades. Oh my gosh, literally decades,"" said Williams, who played her first professional tournament as a 14-year-old in 1995. ""But it all started with my parents. And they deserve everything. So I'm really grateful for them. ""And I wouldn't be Serena if there wasn't [sister] Venus, so thank you, Venus. She's the only reason that Serena Williams ever existed."" Tomljanovic, who moves into the fourth round and plays Russia's Liudmila Samsonova, stepped to the side and applauded her opponent as she took the microphone. The world number 46 produced a phenomenal performance to block out the noise and sense of occasion, illustrated by her clinical hitting in the final stages of a brutal contest which lasted three hours and five minutes. Relive final match of Williams' career The ultimate Serena Williams quiz 'Greatest the world has ever seen' - Williams tributes Serena Williams - the ultimate game-changer? Williams has long been more than a tennis player and it was a sign of her status - as an American icon and one of the world's most recognisable sport stars - that she announced her retirement in an essay for glossy fashion magazine Vogue. Although she did not use the word retirement itself, preferring to say she was ""evolving away"" from the sport, her plan is to end her glittering career this fortnight at her home major. Like every night she has appeared this week, Williams emerged on to court after being introduced as the 'Queen of Queen's' - the borough of New York where the tournament is held - in a specially-commissioned video montage narrated by American rap star Queen Latifah. The A-Listers have been out in force on Ashe this week, with Vogue editor Anna Wintour and golf superstar Tiger Woods previously sitting in Williams' box. On Friday night it was R&B singer Ciara and her husband Russell Wilson, who is one of the country's biggest NFL stars, alongside members of Williams' family. Elsewhere, tennis great Billie Jean King, film director Spike Lee and actress Rebel Wilson were also watching. Williams wore the glittery, figure skating-inspired dress she had specially created for the tournament, along with diamond-encrusted trainers, to add further pomp to the occasion. Right to the end, Williams put on a show for the almost capacity 24,000 crowd. The 40-year-old played some of her best tennis in a long while as she fought to prolong her career, putting on one final memorable show for those lucky enough to witness it. Allow Twitter content?

Waiting for one of the greatest icons in the sport, as a partisan home crowd was being whipped up, would test the mettle of even the most nerveless players. Williams breezed in with Tomljanovic already long out on the court, having arrived first after touching a bronze plaque at the players' entrance inscribed with Billie Jean King's famous 'Pressure is a privilege' quote. The American looked the more tense and showed it in the first game, with Tomljanovic not looking fazed when she broke her opponent's serve. But Williams settled quickly in the next game as Tomljanovic could not consolidate, going a break ahead for 5-3 and serving for the opening set. Then a poor game appeared at the worst possible time for Williams. Unforced errors from her racquet contributed to Tomljanovic breaking back for 5-4 as did, almost as crucially, a net cord trickling back to Williams' side of the court at 30-30. Growing in confidence as a result of the break, Tomljanovic hit clean winners off both wings - either side of a double fault from Williams - to break again for 6-5 and leave her serving for the opener. She raced into a 40-0 lead and sealed the set at the third opportunity with an inch-perfect forehand winner. Seeing Williams trailing left the crowd inside the world's biggest tennis stadium somewhat subdued. Not for long, however. The world number 605 broke for a 2-0 lead in the second set and moved 4-0 ahead, thanks to some ferocious winners and helped by two double faults from her opponent, to send Ashe back into raptures. Williams was turning back the clock again at this point and was described by British former player Laura Robson, working for BBC Radio 5 Live as an analyst, as playing the best tennis she had seen her play ""in years"". A slip in concentration allowed Tomljanovic to claw back one of the breaks, but Williams locked in again and held from deuce for 5-2. That sparked an impassioned celebration from Williams - a trademark roar complemented with a fist clench and foot stamp as she bent towards the court - as everyone in the place erupted once again. Anticipation hung in the air as Williams tried to level the match at the first attempt, but she missed four set points and that triggered a fightback from Tomljanovic. Sensing Williams needed their help, the crowd chanted her name around the cavernous arena going into the tie-break and she responded with a composed passage of play to finally level the match after an 84-minute set. Now it was a straight one-set shootout. Williams looked to be suffering a dip in energy - understandably after her physical efforts this week in only her fourth tournament in more than a year - as she fell 5-1 behind in the decider. The end looked inevitable but not before she mustered one last act of resistance. In a final game lasting 15 minutes and 22 points, she eventually succumbed by planting a forehand into the net, which led to the final - potentially loudest - ovation of her career.

"Serena Williams has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the second most in tennis history US Open 2022 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:29 August-11 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app Serena Williams waved farewell to the US Open - and her illustrious career - amid emotional scenes after she lost to Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic on a thrilling night in New York. Williams, who turns 41 this month, expects it to be her final match. It will end a 27-year professional career that brought 23 major singles wins and sees the American widely labelled as the greatest of all time. Williams lost 7-5 6-7 (4-7) 6-1 and had tears running down her face afterwards. The former long-time world number one saved five match points in what proved to be the final game but was powerless to stop a sixth. Almost everyone who could rose to their feet when she departed the court on Arthur Ashe Stadium - the scene of her first major triumph in 1999 and five more of the finest wins in her storied career - for what she intends to be the last time. As she waved goodbye and gave a signature twirl, Tina Turner's pop classic 'Simply The Best' boomed out over the sound system. Asked if she would reconsider retiring after her performances this week, Williams said: ""I'm literally playing my way into this and getting better. I should have started sooner this year. I don't think so, but you never know."" Williams was overcome with emotion when she was interviewed in the middle of the court, thanking her family, team, the crowd and her fans across the world for their support over the years. ""I thank everyone that's here, that's been on my side so many years, decades. Oh my gosh, literally decades,"" said Williams, who played her first professional tournament as a 14-year-old in 1995. ""But it all started with my parents. And they deserve everything. So I'm really grateful for them. ""And I wouldn't be Serena if there wasn't [sister] Venus, so thank you, Venus. She's the only reason that Serena Williams ever existed."" Tomljanovic, who moves into the fourth round and plays Russia's Liudmila Samsonova, stepped to the side and applauded her opponent as she took the microphone. The world number 46 produced a phenomenal performance to block out the noise and sense of occasion, illustrated by her clinical hitting in the final stages of a brutal contest which lasted three hours and five minutes. Relive final match of Williams' career The ultimate Serena Williams quiz 'Greatest the world has ever seen' - Williams tributes Serena Williams - the ultimate game-changer? Williams has long been more than a tennis player and it was a sign of her status - as an American icon and one of the world's most recognisable sport stars - that she announced her retirement in an essay for glossy fashion magazine Vogue. Although she did not use the word retirement itself, preferring to say she was ""evolving away"" from the sport, her plan is to end her glittering career this fortnight at her home major. Like every night she has appeared this week, Williams emerged on to court after being introduced as the 'Queen of Queen's' - the borough of New York where the tournament is held - in a specially-commissioned video montage narrated by American rap star Queen Latifah. The A-Listers have been out in force on Ashe this week, with Vogue editor Anna Wintour and golf superstar Tiger Woods previously sitting in Williams' box. On Friday night it was R&B singer Ciara and her husband Russell Wilson, who is one of the country's biggest NFL stars, alongside members of Williams' family. Elsewhere, tennis great Billie Jean King, film director Spike Lee and actress Rebel Wilson were also watching. Williams wore the glittery, figure skating-inspired dress she had specially created for the tournament, along with diamond-encrusted trainers, to add further pomp to the occasion. Right to the end, Williams put on a show for the almost capacity 24,000 crowd. The 40-year-old played some of her best tennis in a long while as she fought to prolong her career, putting on one final memorable show for those lucky enough to witness it. Allow Twitter content?

Waiting for one of the greatest icons in the sport, as a partisan home crowd was being whipped up, would test the mettle of even the most nerveless players. Williams breezed in with Tomljanovic already long out on the court, having arrived first after touching a bronze plaque at the players' entrance inscribed with Billie Jean King's famous 'Pressure is a privilege' quote. The American looked the more tense and showed it in the first game, with Tomljanovic not looking fazed when she broke her opponent's serve. But Williams settled quickly in the next game as Tomljanovic could not consolidate, going a break ahead for 5-3 and serving for the opening set. Then a poor game appeared at the worst possible time for Williams. Unforced errors from her racquet contributed to Tomljanovic breaking back for 5-4 as did, almost as crucially, a net cord trickling back to Williams' side of the court at 30-30. Growing in confidence as a result of the break, Tomljanovic hit clean winners off both wings - either side of a double fault from Williams - to break again for 6-5 and leave her serving for the opener. She raced into a 40-0 lead and sealed the set at the third opportunity with an inch-perfect forehand winner.
