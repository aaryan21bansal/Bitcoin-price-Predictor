"Ivan Skyba Taxi driver and father of four, Ivan Skyba, found himself defending a suburban street at the start of the war. He narrowly avoided death at the hands of the Russians. All the other Ukrainian men with him were not so lucky. Prosecutors are treating what happened in the small city of Bucha as a war crime. Fergal Keane has been to meet Ivan, the sole survivor. There is the urge to breathe out. Just one big exhalation to relieve the pressure. But Ivan knows it will be the death of him if he does. The temperature is just above freezing. Warm breath rising into cold air will create a small fog and alert the killers. They are already checking the bodies of the men they have just shot, making sure, firing a final bullet where they see any sign of life. He hears one of the Russians say: ""That one is still alive!"" Ivan wonders if they are talking about him? Maybe it is one of the others. Still, he prepares himself for the bullet. He is already bleeding from a wound in his side. The other Russian says: ""He will die by himself!"" But then there is a shot. It strikes somebody else. A man fights different urges in such moments. The bullet wound in his side is agonisingly painful. But crying out would be fatal. All of this will come back later in dreams. But for now, he will lie among the dead. He will be as still as his murdered comrades. I meet Ivan Skyba in a small village in rural Poland where he has found shelter for his family. He has a job. The kids are living in a place without fear. The warm weather has arrived and in the evenings the family walk to a local park where Ivan fishes in the lake. The bruises on his face and body have healed. But at night, after everybody else is asleep, the wounds of memory are open. Ivan Skyba is the man who came back from the dead. When it all started in the early hours of 24 February, Ivan was driving his taxi in Kyiv. He heard explosions. Ivan struggled to believe it was actually happening. ""I didn't imagine it coming,"" he says. The dispatcher called and said all taxis were to return to base. Forty-three year old Ivan had been doing whatever work he could find to support his wife and four children. He drove the cab and sometimes worked as a building renovator. His first thought that morning was to get the family's identification documents. If they were going to have to flee, they needed passports. He quickly drove the 40km towards Brovary where they lived - and from there to Bucha where his wife and children were visiting her mother. That was where the family would stay until they could make a plan. ""Different rumours were circulating that [the Russians] were approaching Bucha. We started arranging shelters in the cellars, bringing things there."" Ivan (l) with his friend Svyatoslav Turovsky and Ivan's daughter Zlata Three days later, on 27 February, the Russians arrived nearby. Almost immediately they suffered a devastating ambush by Ukrainian artillery. A column of Russian airborne troops had taken up position on Vokzalna Street when the shells came screaming in. They retreated temporarily. But they were angry, convinced some locals had told the Ukrainian military of their location. By now, across Ukraine, people were mobilising to defend their communities. Bucha was no exception. Ivan Skyba and his friend, Svyatoslav Turovsky, the godfather to his two-year-old daughter Zlata, heard that some men who had fought in the eastern Donbas region against the Russian-backed separatists were forming in Bucha a unit of Ukraine's Territorial Defence Force, a militia to protect local communities in time of war. The two men joined up. ""We were doing duty at checkpoints, checking documents and making sure people didn't carry arms,"" says Ivan. ""We were helping to organise people's safe passage out because we knew the area."" Ivan's unit was poorly armed. They had one rifle, a grenade and a pair of binoculars to share among nine men. He and his comrades worked shifts on a checkpoint on Yablunska Street. In Ukrainian it means ""the street of the apples"", because of the trees that line much of its nearly 6km length. In peacetime, it is a pleasant place with a lake for fishing. Some of the houses back on to fields and orchards. It is also the site of an old office complex, built in the Soviet era, part of which has been transformed into workspaces for local businesses. These quarters at 144 Yablunska Street would become a Russian base notorious in the story of the war's brutality. By early March, Ukrainians were fleeing the country in their hundreds of thousands. Ivan and his wife decided the family should try to shelter in Bucha for the time being. He describes the atmosphere among the men as one of defiance. ""There was no fear. No fear. There was a desire to unite, to get together. We were on our feet all the time. When we were off duty, we would distribute food around cellars to those who were taking shelter there, the women and children. There was no time to be afraid."" That changed dramatically on 3 March. The Russians returned in force ""in the second half of the day, around lunchtime"". Immediately, Ivan and the others began directing cars away from the direction of the Russian advance. There was indiscriminate firing. Rockets were landing. He saw a white Renault being struck and a woman and her children trapped inside the burning car. There were eight men at Ivan's checkpoint and with the Russians rapidly approaching they decided to try to hide. Directly opposite the checkpoint, at number 31 Yablunska Street, was Valera Kotenko's house. The 53-year-old had given them hot drinks and food. He offered shelter now. Soon the Russians were outside. Ivan at the checkpoint outside 31 Yablunska Street ""We could hear them and the movement of their equipment. We were surrounded,"" says Ivan. The men whispered to each other. They could not run. The Russians had thermal imaging detectors that would surely pick up any attempt to escape at night. The men had already ditched their few weapons and now decided on a cover story - if the Russians found them they would say they were builders working in the district and had been sheltering from the fighting. They texted wives and girlfriends. One of the men, Anatoliy Prykhidko, aged 39, called his wife Olha that evening - 3 March - and whispered ""that he couldn't speak because he could be heard. It was so quiet. He said they were in hiding."" The following morning, Yulia, the wife of Andriy Dvornikov, a delivery driver, received a message saying: ""We have been encircled, we are sitting here, but I will be getting away from here as soon as there is an opportunity."" He told her to delete all messages and photographs from her phone. And he told her that he loved her. ""At 10am, [Anatoliy] sent me a message saying 'we are still sitting tight.' That was his last message,"" says Olha Prykhidko With tears streaming down her face, Olha Prykhidko, tells me of her last communication from Anatoliy on the morning of 4 March: ""At 10:00, he sent me a message saying 'we are still sitting tight.' That was his last message."" Less than an hour later the Russians broke in. Ivan Skyba remembers beatings and shouted questions. Mobile phones and shoes were confiscated. By 11:00 two different sets of CCTV images captured the men being led across and then down Yablunska Street towards number 144. Each had one hand on the belt of the man in front and the other on their own head. They were lined up against a wall next to the Russian base and made to kneel. The Russians forced their shirts and sweaters over their heads so that they could not see . They were beaten with rifle butts and verbally abused. According to Ivan they shouted: ""You are the Bandera fighters (an anti-Soviet nationalist group in World War Two). You wanted to burn us with Molotov cocktails! We'll burn you alive now!"" This video can not be played CCTV shows the men being marched at gunpoint to the location where they were killed Ivan says the Russians decided to intimidate the others by shooting 28-year-old Vitaliy Karpenko, a worker at a co-operative store. After this, a younger man in the group panicked and told the Russians that all of them belonged to the Territorial Defence Unit. The beatings intensified. Ivan Skyba and another man, Andriy Verbovyi, a father of one and a woodworker, were brought into the building. In the interrogation that followed, Ivan had a bucket placed over his head and was made to bend and lean against the wall. Bricks were piled, one after the other on his back, until he collapsed. He was beaten again and a brick was repeatedly smashed against the bucket. At some point he heard the police tell Andriy Verbovyi that they would shoot him in the foot. There was a shot. After that he didn't hear Andriy any more. Ivan was then led back out of the building to join the other men. Some of what took place was witnessed by local residents who were ordered to gather by the Russians in front of number 144, but kept separate from the arrested men. Lucy Moskalenko remembers a Russian officer telling her to cover her daughters' eyes because they would see things they would never forget. ""He told us, 'Don't look at those people lying on the ground. They are not humans. They are absolute dirt. Dirt. They are not human. They are beasts.'"" Her sister, Irina Volynets, had accompanied Lucy. Both recall the noise of the Russian armoured vehicles, the sound of shelling, and how the dogs of the neighbourhood were fighting with each other. It was as if a madness had descended on the place. Then Irina had a shock. She saw that her old classmate, Andriy Verbovyi, the boy who had sat beside her from kindergarten, and all the way up through school, was lying bleeding on the ground. Only a few weeks before, they had walked home from the shopping centre together. There was a sheet thrown on the ground near him. ""He was lying there, all twisted from cold. He was looking straight at me. We looked into each other's eyes,"" she says. Irina wanted to go and cover her old friend with the sheet, anything that might make him warmer. But she did not. ""Was she too afraid?"" I ask. ""It was not so much fear as despair,"" she replies, ""and I was really confused at the time, and couldn't seem to grasp how it happened, and why my classmate was lying there on the ground."" Everything was happening so fast. Besides, she had just seen that her son Slavyk was among the line of men. He had been captured separately and beaten, before being brought to join the others. Waiting in the line Slavyk saw blood on the ground nearby, and heard the Russians talking about a wounded man. This was almost certainly Andriy Verbovyi. ""I heard them talk among themselves to finish him off because he wouldn't make it,"" recalls Slavyk. He began to fear for his own life. Irina found an officer and pleaded for Slavyk's life. The soldier listened. Then he called over a Ukrainian informer - possibly the arrested man who had cracked after the shooting of Vitaliy Karpenko - and asked him: ""Is he one of them?"" ""No,"" came the reply. Slavyk was released to his mother. The residents were told to go home, but Irina remembers an ominous feeling as she left. ""I was afraid horrible things would happen."" On the following day, 5 March, Andriy Verbovyi's wife, Natalya, sent him a message. ""Where are you? Your [good luck] chain is with me, the amulet as well. I am protecting you from all bad things. We are praying for you. We are waiting for your call. Write us at least two words."" By then, Andriy was dead. Ivan Skyba sensed time was running out. By late afternoon on 4 March, two of the eight men captured with him had been shot dead. ""The Russians started talking between themselves as to what they would do with us. The conversation was as follows: 'What shall we do with them?' The second man says, 'Finish them off, but just take them out, so that they wouldn't be lying here.'"" The remaining men were led around the corner into a small courtyard. From under the edge of his clothing Ivan saw the body of a man lying on a small concrete platform. He had clearly been shot earlier. The Russians began taunting their victims. ""They were enjoying the execution, using swear words, saying, ""That's it. It's kapooey (death) for you!"" Ivan recalls a final exchange of words with his comrades. ""We said goodbye to each other. That was it."" Among those to whom he bade farewell was Svyatoslav Turovsky, the godfather of his daughter. According to Ivan, Anatoliy Prykhidko suddenly decided to make a run for it but was shot straight away. Then the Russians opened fire on the others. ""I felt a bullet go into my side,"" Ivan remembers. ""It wounded me and I fell."" Ivan Skyba's bruised face and bullet wounds on his torso Ivan cannot remember exactly how long the Russians stayed, but it was more like minutes than hours. When he sensed they were gone he risked a glance from under his jacket. The courtyard was empty of life. Now was his chance. He reached out towards a pair of feet near him - those of the dead man he had noticed when they first entered the courtyard. He pulled off the man's shoes to put on his own exposed feet. He then crawled to a fence and dragged himself across into nearby gardens. There was another fence to cross before he made it into a house abandoned by its owners during the shelling. What followed was another terrifying ordeal. Inside the house, Ivan treated his wound with some antiseptic liquid he found in the bathroom and changed into clothes left behind by the householder. He wrapped himself in a blanket and tried to sleep. But he was disturbed by voices. Russian voices. It turned out that several Russian soldiers were also resting in the house. ""They saw me and started asking me who I was and what I was doing there."" He persuaded them that he was the owner of the house and that his family had been evacuated. His wounds, he explained, were the result of shelling. The soldiers believed his story but they told him he couldn't stay where he was. Instead, they said they would take him to their base for medical treatment. Back at 144 Yablunska Street. ""I was terrified what would happen next - from one captivity into another."" But Ivan's luck held. At the base, combat medics treated his wounds. If the troops who shot him were still around, they either did not see him return, or did not recognise him. He was placed with civilians sheltering in the bunker of the building. After several days, they were allowed to leave. The bodies of the murdered men who had been defending Bucha with Ivan were left lying in the courtyard, where the Russians dumped rubbish, for the remaining month of the occupation. Ivan found his family, still sheltering from the war, at home. They were able to flee Bucha, and eventually Ukraine into Poland, but not the legacy of the terrible hours at 144 Yablunska. The office building at 144 Yablunska Street where the killings happened Military defeat forced the retreat. Harried by Ukrainian forces the Russians pulled out of Bucha on 31 March and headed north to the border with Belarus. The invaders left behind numerous traces of their presence. From the banal - obscene graffiti scrawled on the walls - to the potentially significant. We found a soldier's military-issued debit card on the floor of 144 Yablunska, and traced him to Pskov in north-western Russia, a major base for airborne forces. Other journalists found evidence leading to the same units - the 104th and 234th Airborne Assault regiments. A Bucha resident found Ivan Skyba's mobile phone, left behind by the Russians as they retreated. It contained records of calls made to several numbers in Russia. The records don't link any of the callers directly to the massacre. The phone might easily have been passed around among a large group of soldiers. But the call records could help narrow down the search for perpetrators to smaller units within the regiments present when Ivan and the others were shot. Bucha satellite image contradicts Russian claims Collecting the dead in Bucha The killings at 144 Yablunska Street and elsewhere in Bucha are the focus of a huge war crimes investigation by the International Criminal Court and Ukraine. The Ukrainian investigation is led by a police lawyer who, until recently, was best known for investigating cases of brutality within the country's police force. Walking me around the crime scene, Yuriy Belousov is hopeful the perpetrators will ultimately face justice. ""These Russian soldiers who have committed this crime, they could be captured somewhere,"" he says, pointing to the recent trial of a Russian prisoner of war accused of murdering a civilian near Kyiv. But the big targets of the investigation are President Putin and the Russian military and political elite. ""It was planned in advance,"" Mr Belousov says. ""It was instructed from the top how to behave. So the suspects would be top of the top, the guys who actually launch the war, let's say. It's like a chain of people whose decisions led to the invasion of Ukraine."" Barring a change of regime in Moscow, any imminent prosecution seems highly unlikely. Ivan Skyba with Fergal Keane in Poland If there are prosecutions, Ivan Skyba will be a vital witness. For now, he works with the Polish man who has given the family shelter. The Russians seem physically far away. But there is the terror that comes at night. ""You wake up because you are anticipating that shot in your head. I have this feeling. It comes like a wave."" When we walk to a nearby lake in the evening, I notice that a teenaged boy has joined the family group. He plays with Ivan's son who is just a few years younger. Ivan tells me that the teenager is the child of his murdered friend and godfather to his daughter, Svyatoslav Turovsky. The boy and his mother moved to Poland with the Skyba family. It is a perfect early summer's evening - the boys fishing, Ivan leaning against a tree and looking on, his wife shepherding their young daughter away from the water's edge. But for Ivan and his family, for their friends the Turovskyis, for all the families of the men of 144 Yablunska, Russia's invasion and the massacre it unleashed has changed everything. I remember the words of Olha Prykhidko, whose husband Anatoliy tried to run for his life, and whose grave she visits every day with two cups of coffee, one for him and one for her.  ""When no-one can hear me,"" she says, ""I call him by his name."" Day after day she calls to him, from silence to silence, into the emptiness made by war.

"British Airways has cancelled a further 1,500 flights, mostly for July. The wave of cancellations made over the past weeks will affect tens of thousands hoping to jet off this summer from Heathrow and Gatwick. The industry has been struggling with staff shortages as demand for air travel rebounds. British Airways had already removed 10% of scheduled flights between April and October, but said that ""regrettably"" more reductions were needed. A spokesperson from the airline, which is the UK's largest, said: ""We took pre-emptive action earlier this year to reduce our summer schedule to provide customers with as much notice as possible about any changes to their travel plans. ""As the entire aviation industry continues to face into the most challenging period in its history, regrettably it has become necessary to make some further reductions."" Flight cancellation plan aims to ease summer chaos What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? The carrier said it was in touch with customers to ""apologise and offer to rebook them or issue a full refund"". The wave of cancellations comesahead of Friday's deadline, announced last month by the Department for Transport (DfT), for an amnesty to give airlines a short window to hand back airport slots in the summer season they are not confident they will be able to operate. BA is expected to announce further cancellations over the summer ahead of the deadline. Airport slots provide airlines with the authorisation to take off or land at a specified time on a specified day. In usual circumstances, the carriers risk losing the slots - and taking a hit to their business - if they cancel flights. On Wednesday, British Airways was also affected by a rare ""schedule intervention"" by Heathrow Airport. Heathrow asked airlines to cut 30 flights from their Thursday morning schedules, as more passengers were expected than it could deal with. It made the move to ensure the airport had enough security staff on duty for the number of passengers. The cancellations come ashundreds of British Airways check-in staff at Heathroware deciding on strike dates which could further affect the peak summer school holiday travel period. Many jobs in the aviation industry were lost during the course of the Covid pandemic and recruiting enough staff in time to deal with the surge in demand for travel has proven difficult for airlines and airports. Gatwick has already said it would be reducing the number of flights during summer because of staff shortages before the airport slots amnesty was announced. And Manchester Airporthas warned it will not be able to return to its pre-pandemic standardsuntil the autumn. Thousands of passengers were affected by last-minute flight cancellations over the Easter and half-term holidays. That earlier disruption prompted the government and the aviation regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, to write to airlines telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable... based on the resources you and your contractors expect to have available"".

"The strikes threaten to stop deliveries to the Easington gas receiving terminal in Yorkshire Strikes which threatened to cut off most of the UK's gas imports from Norway have been called off. The Norwegian labour ministry confirmed it had stepped in to end industrial action set for later this week. ""Workers are going back to work as soon as possible. We are cancelling the planned escalation,"" Lederne union leader Audun Ingvartsen told Reuters. The Department for Business had insisted: ""The UK has no issues with gas supply."" The UK imports about 50% of its gas and Norway is its biggest supplier making up 77% of imports, ONS data shows. Oil and gas from Norway, Europe's second-largest energy supplier after Russia, is in high demand as many countries reduce their dependence on Russian supplies in response to the war in Ukraine. Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? The industrial action started on Monday following a pay dispute between the employer's organisation, the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, and the union Lederne, which represents oil and gas workers. The first phase forced the Norwegian energy company Equinor to shut down three of its oil and gas fields. More strikes were expected on Tuesday evening, impacting three more Equinor facilities. The union had threatened to take further strike action from Saturday if the dispute was not resolved. But labour minister, Marte Mjoes Persen, told Reuters the government had exercised its right to intervene. ""Norway plays a vital role in supplying gas to Europe, and the planned escalation [of the strike] would have had serious consequences, for Britain, Germany and other nations,"" he said. ""The volume impact would have been dramatic in light of the current European situation."" Reacting to the strike being called off, NOG, the oil lobby, said in a statement: ""We are glad to see that the government understood the seriousness of the situation and acted to uphold Norway's reputation as a reliable and stable supplier of natural gas to Europe."" Norwegian gas arrives in the UK at two terminals - Easington in Yorkshire and St Fergus in Scotland. It was Saturday's planned strike that would have affected UK supplies as it would have temporarily closed the Sleipner field - a key distribution point for gas exports to the UK. Norwegian-state owned Gassco had told the BBC ""in a worst case scenario, from this Saturday there will be zero deliveries to Easington"", a gas terminal on the East Yorkshire coast,something reported by the Financial Times.,external But while the potential strike action would only have impacted the operations at Easington, Gassco said that was by far the most significant of the two, receiving 80% to 90% of the gas from Norway. The Department for Business said: ""We have one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world, with access to our own North Sea gas reserves, and the second largest LNG port infrastructure in Europe."" Gassco transports gas to other European countries including Germany and Belgium.

"Butter brand Lurpak has said the price of its products has gone up so that dairy farmers get a fair deal. Lurpak was trending on Twitter as shoppers expressed shock at the price of the spread in supermarkets. A 750g tub is Â£7.25 in Sainsbury's. Asda said photos of the butter covered in security tags did not indicate that they were being stolen more often, but an issue in an individual store. Lurpak said: ""Prices on the shelves have had to rise in recent months."" A statement from Lurpak's owner Arla Foods said: ""We understand that recent inflation in food price is hitting many households really hard right now. ""Unfortunately, our farmers are facing a similar situation with prices for the feed, fertiliser and fuel they need to produce milk, all rising significantly in recent months. ""While we don't set the prices on the shelves, we do work closely with the retailers to ensure our farmers receive a fair price for the milk they produce."" Allow Twitter content?

Asda said its largest pack of Lurpak had been at about the Â£6 mark since last year, its price had not changed and it was not considered high value. ""We've no data to suggest it's being stolen more than anything else or more than it has been in the past,"" a spokesperson said. ""Asda hasn't started tagging this product as a rule, individual stores may add tags to products they may have noticed have been going missing."" Sainsbury's said: ""The price of products will be influenced by a range of factors, including manufacturer's costs, and we are doing all we can to mitigate rising costs where we can."" A spokesperson for the supermarket pointed out it had own brand options and butter was also part of its Sainsbury's Quality, Aldi Price Match campaign. Retail analyst Steve Dresser, chief executive of Grocery Insight, said high costs for production, energy, fuel and other raw materials at the start of the supply chain were now making their way to the shelf edge. He said: ""Paying farmers a fair price is important for our wider food security and as their costs rise, the price paid for their produce has to rise too. It all leads to a higher cost price and thus, a higher shelf price. ""Of course, Lurpak is a brand with a distinctive taste and lots of loyal fans, but it's a reminder that other (cheaper) brands are also available. ""A non-promotional price for Lurpak at Â£5/Â£7/Â£9 is a reminder of the significant inflationary pressure we're all feeling at the minute.

"Holidaymakers are advised against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka The UK government has reinstated advice against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka as a severe economic crisis has sparked civil unrest. A shortage of basic necessities including medicines, cooking gas, fuel and food has sparked protests and violence in the Asian country. Sri Lanka's government said it only had enough petrol to last one day as it faces its worst crisis in 70 years. The travel warning was previously in place from 13 May to 10 June. The popular tourist destination ended a state of emergency prompted by angry demonstrations over the economic crisis on 21 May. But on Sunday, the nation said its petrol stocks had almost run dry once again and its next shipment was not due for two weeks. What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? Sri Lanka warns petrol stocks about to run dry Sri Lanka: 'I canât afford milk for my babies' The Foreign Office warned holidaymakers could encounter ""demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest at short notice"". Visiting countries against Foreign Office advice would be likely to invalidate your travel insurance, the Association of British Insurers said. It said anyone who changed their plans as a result of a travel warning should also check their insurance could be transferred to cover their new destination. The Sri Lankan government has blamed the Covid pandemic for the crisis, which affected the country's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. Nearly 200,000 Britons travelled to Sri Lanka in 2019, but this figure dipped to 55,455 in 2020. But Sri Lanka's government exacerbated its foreign currency shortage in 2021, when it banned imports of chemical fertiliser. Widespread crop failure forced the country to import food from abroad, compounding its foreign currency crisis.

"The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, and the Secretary of State for Health, Sajid Javid, have resigned from Boris Johnson's government. Here are their letters of resignation. Prime Minister, It was a privilege to have been asked to come back into Government to serve as Secretary of State for Health and Social Care at such a critical time for our country. I have given every ounce of energy to this task, and am incredibly proud of what we have achieved. The UK has led the world in learning to live with Covid. Thanks to the amazing rollout of our booster programme, investment in treatments, and innovations in the way we deliver healthcare, the British people have enjoyed months more freedom than other comparable countries. We have also made important strides in the recovery and reform of the NHS and adult social care. The longest waiters are down by 70% and, as you know, I have been working hard on wider modernisation of the NHS. I have also developed radical new approaches to dementia, cancer and mental health, and prepared the Health Disparities White Paper which will set out plans to level up health outcomes for communities that have been left behind for too long. Given the unprecedented scale of the challenges in health and social care, it has been my instinct to continue focusing on this important work. So it is with enormous regret that I must tell you that I can no longer, in good conscience, continue serving in this Government, I am instinctively a team player but the British people also rightly expect integrity from their Government. The tone you set as leader, and the values you represent, reflect on your colleagues, your party, and ultimately the country. Conservatives at their best are seen as hard-headed decision-makers, guided by strong values. We may not always have been popular, but we have been competent in acting in the national interest. Sadly, in the current circumstances, the public are concluding that we are neither. The vote of confidence last month showed that a large number of our colleagues agree. It was a moment for humility, grip and new direction. I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership - and you have therefore lost my confidence too. It is three years since you entered Downing Street. You will forever be credited with seeing off the threat of Corbynism, and breaking the deadlock on Brexit. You have shone a very welcome light on the regional disparities on our country, an agenda that will continue to define our politics. These are commendable legacies in unprecedented times. But the country needs a strong and principled Conservative Party, and the Party is bigger than any one individual. I served you loyally and as a friend, but we all serve the country first. When made to choose between those loyalties there can only be one answer. Finally, I would like to put on record my thanks to ministerial and departmental colleagues, my admiration for NHS and social care staff, and my love for my family who have been immensely patient in these challenging times. Yours ever, S Javid Dear Prime Minister, It is with deep sadness that I am writing to you to resign from the Government. It has been an enormous privilege to serve our country as Chancellor of the Exchequer and I will always be proud of how during the pandemic we protected people's jobs and businesses through actions such as furlough. To leave ministerial office is a serious matter at any time. For me to step down as Chancellor while the world is suffering the economic consequences of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other serious challenges is a decision that I have not taken lightly. However, the public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously. I recognise this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning. I have been loyal to you. I backed you to become Leader of our Party and encouraged others to do so. I have served as your Chancellor with gratitude that you entrusted me with stewardship of the nation's economy and finances. Above all, I have respected the powerful mandate given to you by the British people in 2019 and how under your leadership we broke the Brexit deadlock. That is why I have always tried to compromise in order to deliver the things you want to achieve. On those occasions where I disagreed with you privately, I have supported you publicly. That is the nature of the collective government upon which our system relies and it is particularly important that the Prime Minister and Chancellor remain united in hard times such as those we are experiencing today. Our country is facing immense challenges. We both want a low-tax, high-growth economy, and world class public services, but this can only be responsibly delivered if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices and take difficult decisions. I firmly believe the public are ready to hear that truth. Our people know that if something is too good to be true then it's not true. They need to know that whilst there is a path to a better future, it is not an easy one. In preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it has become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different. I am sad to be leaving Government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this. Kind regards, Rishi Sunak Dear Saj, Thank you for your letter this evening tendering your resignation. I was very sorry to receive it. You have served this Government, and the people of the United Kingdom, with distinction. Most recently, you have led the Department of Health and Social Care as we learn to live with Covid, forging ahead with plans to beat the Covid backlogs, recruit 50,000 nurses, build 40 new hospitals, and reform social care. These are the issues that matter to the people of this country, and the Government will continue to deliver on them. You have held significant positions in Government for the past decade, and have served myself and former Prime Ministers admirably. You have used your personal experience to bring about change in government, from fixing the injustices of Windrush to setting out recently a plan to address suicide. You will be greatly missed, and I look forward to your contributions from the backbenches. Yours ever, Boris Dear Rishi, I was sorry to receive your letter resigning from the Government. You have provided outstanding service to the country through the most challenging period for our economy in peacetime history. In March 2020, weeks after your appointment as Chancellor, we introduced a national lockdown to protect people from the pandemic. You acted to safeguard the economy with the pace, creativity and commitment which has been the hallmark of your tenure. The furlough scheme - conceived and implemented in a matter of weeks - supported 11.7 million jobs from 1.3 million employers. Through business loans and grants, you helped thousands of businesses to avoid insolvency. Emergency funding worth more than Â£140 billion, enabled the NHS and other critical public services to meet the enormous challenges we faced. These efforts primed the economy for a rapid recovery once the immediate dangers of the pandemic receded. At the Spending Review last year, you put us on track to deliver our promises to the British people, including 20,000 police officers and 40 new hospitals. We also set a clear plan to rebuild our economy and public services, including an historic funding settlement for the NHS and delivering six million tutoring courses to help pupils catch up lost learning. Through all of this, you have not shied from the tough decisions needed to repair our public finances whilst protecting public services and boosting economic growth. This has enabled us to provide support to households worth Â£37 billion, as we have faced global inflation pressures arising from Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine. And we have begun to deliver tax cuts to families - including this week, a cut to National Insurance saving the average worker Â£330 a year. I have enormously valued your advice and deep commitment to public service and will miss working with you in government.

"The key line in all the resignation letters released tonight is that the chancellor felt his approach to the economy was ""fundamentally too different"" to that of Boris Johnson. The context here was the PM's plan for a joint speech with the chancellor as the anchor of a plan to show the government taking control of the cost of living crisis. That speech was due next week. They could not agree its contents. In particular, the chancellor said the public is ""ready to hear the truth"" about the tough times ahead of us. This echoes some comments made by the former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King that the government needed to level with the public about the fact that the inflation energy crisis has made the nation poorer. The cost-of-living crisis means a series of incredibly difficult trade-offs for government to make in the coming months. Public sector pay review bodies have begun to report back. The Treasury believes it is irresponsible even to be talking about pay claims matching the 9% inflation rate. And yet, a 10% rise in pensions is pencilled in for next year. Government departments are facing rising costs to provide public services, but cash budgets are yet to be increased. Tax cuts are being promised, but only in two years' time, if borrowing is under control. Fuel prices reach new records, but where did the 5p Budget reduction go? Domestic energy prices are heading even higher than predicted at the time of the chancellor's last cost of living package. Rishi Sunak was a crisis chancellor. He spent his time expanding the state, spending and levels of taxation, against his instincts, to deal with the pandemic and Ukraine crisis. His signature policy - the furlough scheme - squarely succeeded in its primary aim, of preventing long-term unemployment from the pandemic lockdown. When announced, there was no guarantee it would even function technically. It has helped keep unemployment levels very low, the shining light in a now shaky set of British economic figures. Rishi Sunak, however, was keen to draw a line under that support, even as it had made him popular. He rolled back the pandemic increase in universal credit. The energy crisis was not a ""whatever it takes"" moment. At Number 10, their instincts were to borrow more, tax less and support households more. Sunak wished to increase productivity, empower tech businesses and raise living standards. Clearly, personal tensions also emerged. Some in Number 10 felt that Sunak backers had pushed too hard to oust the PM in January. Sunak's team felt the run of negative stories leaked about the chancellor's finances in the spring were an operation to kill his leadership chances. Without Mr Sunak, and with a new chancellor, the PM will find it easier to tax less, perhaps spend more and so borrow more. There is talk of cuts to VAT. Some backers of the PM think that all the cost-of-living support has gone largely unnoticed and the government somehow needs to find a way to physically stop the energy price cap from going up a further Â£1,000. But that comes against increasing market concern about the UK's growing trading deficit, a slump in sterling, and fears of recession. It is exactly the sort of time a government might rely on having an Iron Chancellor, who can rein in his, or her, crisis-afflicted neighbour. But this may not be the likely direction of travel in Downing Street. Javid's and Sunak's resignation letters in full Government resignations: Who resigned, who stayed?

"Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid - who quit the cabinet within minutes of each other in protest at Boris Johnson's leadership - look like political allies right now, but they are also friends. They both rose from relatively modest beginnings to make a fortune in investment banking, before entering politics. There is also a shared love of Star Wars - and they haven't been afraid to hide it. When Mr Javid resigned as chancellor in February 2020, after losing a power struggle with Mr Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings, he tweeted about his successor: ""The Force is strong in young Sunak."" Just over a year earlier, when he was still number two to Mr Javid at the Treasury, Mr Sunak tweeted a picture of the pair of them at the cinema, where they had just been to see The Rise of Skywalker. ""Great night out with the boss - Jedi Master,"" wrote Mr Sunak. LIVE: Latest developments as Sunak and Javid quit cabinet Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid resign from government Javid's and Sunak's resignation letters in full The pair are also ideological soulmates, seeing themselves as being part of the low tax and spending Thatcherite wing of the Conservative Party. Despite the tax burden rising to record peacetime levels on his watch, Mr Sunak took the unusual step ofpromising to cut income tax before the next general election. In his resignation letter, the 42-year-old former chancellor says Boris Johnson's approach is ""fundamentally too different"" to his, suggesting the PM is unwilling to take the ""difficult decisions"" needed to fix the economy. Mr Javid, 52, also sees himself as a fiscal conservative, who repeatedly warned about the dangers of rising inflation and the size of the national debt before becoming health secretary last year. Like Mr Sunak, he was tipped for the top almost from the moment he entered Parliament, in 2009 - and the two men were once talked about as the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown of the Conservative Party. Born in Rochdale, to a first generation immigrant family, Mr Javid's bus conductor father is said to have arrived in Britain from a Pakistani village in 1961, with Â£5 to his name. Mr Sunak's background was more comfortable. His father was a GP and his mother ran a pharmacy, and he attended fee-paying Winchester School, before a highly lucrative career in banking and hedge funds. Elected to Parliament in 2015, he was briefly seen as the frontrunner to succeed Boris Johnson as Conservative leader. But his fine for attending Mr Johnson's birthday party during lockdown - andrevelations about his wife's tax affairs- have put paid to that ambition for now. In his resignation letter, he says: ""I recognise this may be my last ministerial job."" The coming days will reveal whether this is false modesty on the part of the now ex-chancellor, or whether he and his fellow Star Wars fan are a spent Force.

"Russian shelling set a central market ablaze in Ukraine's eastern city of Slovyansk, killing two people and injuring seven, an official said. ""This is pure terrorism!"" Donetsk regional head Pavlo Kyrylenko said. Mayor Vadym Lyakh said Slovyansk was being hit by Russian artillery salvoes from closer positions, as it became a frontline city. He posted photos of Tuesday's blaze on Facebook, describing massive shelling, and urging people to stay in shelters. Russia is seeking to capture all of the eastern industrial Donbas area. The area is made up of two regions, Luhansk and Donetsk. After recognising two rebel self-proclaimed statelets there, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Last week, Ukraine's military said it had to pull out of Lysychansk, its last remaining stronghold in Luhansk, under intense Russian fire. It said its troops were now strengthening fortifications to defend areas it holds in Donetsk, including Slovyansk. Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai on Tuesday said that ""heavy fighting is going at the edge of the Luhansk region near Lysychansk"". ""The enemy has deployed significant forces,"" he said, adding that Russia was trying to send more of its forces across a river by building pontoon bridges. Mr Haidai said the Russians were ""sustaining heavy losses"". The BBC has not been able to verify details of the latest attacks.

"The chancellor and health secretary have resigned from government, saying they no longer have confidence in Boris Johnson to lead the country. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the public expected government to be conducted ""properly, competently and seriously"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid echoed this, saying the government was not ""acting in the national interest"". The resignations came minutes after the PM apologised for appointing MP Chris Pincher to a government role. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi has been named as the new chancellor, and Downing Street chief of staff, Steve Barclay, will replace Mr Javid as health secretary. Higher education minister Michelle Donelan has been promoted to education secretary. Mr Johnson admitted he had made a ""bad mistake"" in appointing Mr Pincher to the role of deputy chief whip earlier this year, despite being made aware of earlier allegations about the MP's conduct. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson said: ""In hindsight it was the wrong thing to do. I apologise to everybody who has been badly affected by it."" His handling of the row has faced fierce criticism from the opposition and some of his own MPs. Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid resignation letters in full PM regrets appointing Chris Pincher after complaint Pincher suspended as Tory MP after groping claim PM under renewed pressure over Pincher appointment Alongside Mr Sunak and Mr Javid, Bim Afolami quit as Tory vice-chair live on TV, Andrew Murrison resigned as a trade envoy, and ministerial aides Jonathan Gullis and Saqib Bhatti left their roles. But the BBC understands Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove and other cabinet ministers are backing the prime minister as he assesses the scale of the rebellion against his leadership. Mr Johnson has been publicly backed by loyal allies Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and minister for Brexit Opportunities Jacob Rees-Mogg, who insisted the prime minister was the ""right man for the job"". The resignation of two senior cabinet ministers has plunged Mr Johnson into a fresh leadership crisis weeks afterhe survived a no-confidence vote. The PM is immune from a Conservative leadership challenge until June next year under party rules, after he won 59% of the vote. This video can not be played Watch: Johnson on appointing Pincher: I apologise for it In response to the resignations, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would welcome a snap election and the country needed a change of government. He said: ""After all the sleaze, all the failure, it's clear that this Tory government is now collapsing."" The next general election is expected to be held in 2024 but could be earlier if Mr Johnson used his powers to call one. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, said the prime minister's ""government of chaos has failed our country"", and called for him to go. Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said ""the whole rotten lot"" in Mr Johnson's government should go, accusing ministers of ""lying to public"". Is this the beginning of the end for Boris Johnson? During the course of the day, some of the PM's prominent critics called on government ministers to put pressure on the prime minister to resign. A chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and an ex-chancellor, Sajid Javid, have done just that. Both men see their resignations as necessary if the PM is to be pushed out. Both may be positioning for a future leadership contest. But even now, Downing Street will hope to avoid this. Boris Johnson still has his foreign secretary, home secretary, defence secretary and business secretary. And, remember, a beleaguered Gordon Brown survived a ministerial resignation because the rest of his cabinet stayed loyal, when he was in Number 10. But it now seems more likely that other ministers, in more junior roles, who have been privately critical of Boris Johnson could follow Mr Sunak and Mr Javid's lead. The last Conservative prime minister to face a party vote on their leadership was Theresa May, who won the vote but resigned six months later over her approach to Brexit. Mr Johnson's government has been dogged by a series of controversies in recent months, prompting some Tory MPs to call for the prime minister's resignation. Discontent among Tory MPs has grown sincea highly critical report into lockdown partiesin and near Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic was published earlier this year. The report laid bare the extent of Covid rule-breaking in Number 10, including at a birthday party for whichthe PM was fined by the police. The fine meant Mr Johnson became the UK's first serving prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law. Some Tory MPs have also expressed dissent over tax rises, the government's response to rising living costs and its policy direction. The loss of by-elections inTiverton and HonitonandWakefieldin June put more pressure on the prime minister and triggered the resignation of Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. This video can not be played Watch: Sajid Javid seen after shock resignation In a dramatic sequence of events on Tuesday evening, Mr Javid shared his resignation letter on Twitter shortly after 18:00 BST - minutes after the prime minister spoke to reporters in Downing Street. Mr Javid - who has been health secretary since June 2021 - said he could ""no longer in good conscience continue serving in this government"". ""I am instinctively a team player but the British people also rightly expect integrity from their government,"" he wrote. ""The tone you set as a leader and the values you represent, reflect on your colleagues, your party and ultimately the country."" A few minutes later at about 18:10, Mr Sunak tweeted out his resignation letter, leaving two top roles empty in Mr Johnson's cabinet. In his letter, Mr Sunak, who has been tipped as potential future leader of the Conservative Party, told the prime minister that standards in government were ""worth fighting for"". Since becoming chancellor in February 2020, Mr Sunak has not always been in sync with the prime minister on economic policy and public spending. ""I have been loyal to you,"" Mr Sunak wrote in his letter. ""I backed you to become leader of our party and encouraged others to do so. ""I have served as your chancellor with gratitude that you entrusted me with stewardship of the nation's economy and finances."" But Mr Sunak said that he could no longer back Mr Johnson, suggesting their differences could not be reconciled. He said: ""In preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it has become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different. ""I am sad to be leaving government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this.""

"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Cameron Norrie's comeback as he beats David Goffin to progress Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Britain's Cameron Norrie reached the Wimbledon semi-finals by fighting back to beat David Goffin in a memorable five-set thriller which left the home fans celebrating jubilantly. Ninth seed Norrie, 26, battled hard to secure a 3-6 7-5 2-6 6-3 7-5 win against unseeded Belgian Goffin. As his name was chanted around Court One, he was overcome with emotion. Norrie will now contest his first Grand Slam semi-final, meeting defending champion Novak Djokovic on Friday. Asked for his reaction to beating Goffin, Norrie said: ""Honestly? Speechless. I can't even talk."" 'Crazy match, crazy day' as Norrie thrills Wimbledon Norrie unrecognised by a barman but now watched by royalty Djokovic fights back to beat Sinner after pep talk 'Extraordinary' Maria reaches Wimbledon semi-finals The British men's number one, known for his laid-back demeanour, showed a unusual flicker of emotion during his on-court interview. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were among the 11,000 or so fans who watched as the world number 12 absorbed the finest moment of his career. Norrie added: ""I think just winning a match like this, I'm in shock. I don't know what to say now. ""I have flashbacks of all the hard work and all the sacrifices I have had to make and it's definitely paid off - and it feels pretty good."" Norrie is the first British man to reach the Wimbledon singles semi-finals since Andy Murray in 2016 and the first British player since Johanna Konta in 2017. Next he faces top seed Djokovic, who is chasing a fourth successive title and a seventh in total at the All England Club. The 35-year-old Serb was given a huge scare by Italy's Jannik Sinner before fighting back to win in five sets earlier on Tuesday. ""It great to get this now but it's only going to get tougher,"" Norrie told the Wimbledon crowd. ""I'm going to take it to Novak and hopefully you guys can get behind me and I'm sure you will."" As the highest seeded Briton in the singles draws, Norrie may have been predicted to be the last home player left but was breaking new ground by reaching the quarter-finals. Now he has moved one step further. The left-hander had never previously been past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, despite a fine couple of years which have seen him reach the world's top 10. Reserved and understated, Norrie does not receive - or seek - the same level of attention as what Murray has received throughout his career. But he has found himself thrust into the spotlight, saying he has been ""enjoying and embracing"" being the leading home hope at Wimbledon. That was evident in a confident performance in the fourth round against Tommy Paul, but was missing in the opening stages against an inspired Goffin. Still, he refused to become overly despondent and fought back to take a momentum-swinging match into a decider. In front of an enthusiastic crowd now including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who were earlier on Centre Court and headed over after Djokovic's win, Norrie kept his cool in an increasingly tense situation. Former world number seven Goffin had served well in the decider until being broken to love for 6-5 and, remarkably, that was the first time in the match where Norrie had led. He saw a first match point disappear when Goffin pummelled past a winner, but took his second opportunity to become only the fourth British man - following Murray, Tim Henman and Roger Taylor - to reach the Wimbledon singles semi-finals in the Open era.

Norrie's journey began in Johannesburg and, after moving to Auckland as a child and then studying in Texas, has since made a home in London. With a Welsh mother and a Scottish father, he was always destined to represent the nation despite retaining a hint of a New Zealand accent. His parents, microbiologists David and Helen, have been a driving force in his life and watched on proudly as they shared the finest moment of his career at the All England Club. The couple still live in New Zealand and missed much of his recent rise in the flesh because of the coronavirus pandemic. But they have been following their son around the European clay and grass tournaments since flying over to Rome in May. His sister Bronwyn, who lives in London, was also among his loved ones watching on court, along with his old landlady, Linda, and friends from his university days in the United States. After sealing victory over Goffin, Norrie walked over to his box where mum Helen and girlfriend Louise were both overcome by the moment.

"This video can not be played Watch: Johnson on appointing Pincher: I apologise for it There was the whiff of panic hanging over it all. The prime minister's team had invited me in for a last-minute interview with Boris Johnson. Five o'clock Tuesday evening, in his Commons office. The mementoes of a political career are scattered around: an Olympic flag, a mocked-up plastic bus stop - with his name written on it as the destination. A framed newspaper front page marking a moment of victory. But was this the moment that marked his defeat? Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid resignation letters in full Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak resign from government PM apologises for giving Pincher government job The prime minister had decided he had to confront the awkward truth that the people who speak on his behalf hadn't been telling the truth, for days on end. As I left, one of his most loyal ministers was heading the other way up the stairwell. Others from ""team Boris"" - those who originally championed him as a prospective Conservative leader - were summoned too. Already it was obvious he was in peril. And then, for him, it got a whole lot worse. His health secretary, Sajid Javid walked. Walking matters, but words matter too. ""The British people rightly expect integrity from their government,"" he said. Yes, you heard that right. A man who sat around the cabinet table this morning, serving at the highest level in government, had concluded what the government's critics have been saying for months: it, and its leader, don't have integrity. The now former chancellor, Rishi Sunak, went further: the public expects the government to conduct itself ""properly, competently and seriously"". The man who sat alongside the prime minister this morning saying the government is none of those things. He also, incidentally, said he had concluded he couldn't share a platform with Mr Johnson this time next week to set out a joint economic strategy to address the cost of living crunch. There was a huge policy disagreement there too, on the most important issue for millions and millions of people right now. Suddenly, what we were witnessing was the potential collapse of the government. But hold on. As I type these words at just after half-past seven, we haven't had a cabinet resignation for about an hour-and-a-half. Plenty of cabinet ministers have made it known they are staying. And Boris Johnson is not - until we hear otherwise - someone expected to go easily. Things remain, to put it gently, fluid. The only question that matters tonight is, will Boris Johnson survive? The simple truth is we don't know. And here's another thing. Neither does he. He's no longer in control of events, or in control of his government. He has never faced a more perilous day in office.

"The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, and the Secretary of State for Health, Sajid Javid, have resigned from Boris Johnson's government. Here are their letters of resignation. Prime Minister, It was a privilege to have been asked to come back into Government to serve as Secretary of State for Health and Social Care at such a critical time for our country. I have given every ounce of energy to this task, and am incredibly proud of what we have achieved. The UK has led the world in learning to live with Covid. Thanks to the amazing rollout of our booster programme, investment in treatments, and innovations in the way we deliver healthcare, the British people have enjoyed months more freedom than other comparable countries. We have also made important strides in the recovery and reform of the NHS and adult social care. The longest waiters are down by 70% and, as you know, I have been working hard on wider modernisation of the NHS. I have also developed radical new approaches to dementia, cancer and mental health, and prepared the Health Disparities White Paper which will set out plans to level up health outcomes for communities that have been left behind for too long. Given the unprecedented scale of the challenges in health and social care, it has been my instinct to continue focusing on this important work. So it is with enormous regret that I must tell you that I can no longer, in good conscience, continue serving in this Government, I am instinctively a team player but the British people also rightly expect integrity from their Government. The tone you set as leader, and the values you represent, reflect on your colleagues, your party, and ultimately the country. Conservatives at their best are seen as hard-headed decision-makers, guided by strong values. We may not always have been popular, but we have been competent in acting in the national interest. Sadly, in the current circumstances, the public are concluding that we are neither. The vote of confidence last month showed that a large number of our colleagues agree. It was a moment for humility, grip and new direction. I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership - and you have therefore lost my confidence too. It is three years since you entered Downing Street. You will forever be credited with seeing off the threat of Corbynism, and breaking the deadlock on Brexit. You have shone a very welcome light on the regional disparities on our country, an agenda that will continue to define our politics. These are commendable legacies in unprecedented times. But the country needs a strong and principled Conservative Party, and the Party is bigger than any one individual. I served you loyally and as a friend, but we all serve the country first. When made to choose between those loyalties there can only be one answer. Finally, I would like to put on record my thanks to ministerial and departmental colleagues, my admiration for NHS and social care staff, and my love for my family who have been immensely patient in these challenging times. Yours ever, S Javid Dear Prime Minister, It is with deep sadness that I am writing to you to resign from the Government. It has been an enormous privilege to serve our country as Chancellor of the Exchequer and I will always be proud of how during the pandemic we protected people's jobs and businesses through actions such as furlough. To leave ministerial office is a serious matter at any time. For me to step down as Chancellor while the world is suffering the economic consequences of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other serious challenges is a decision that I have not taken lightly. However, the public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously. I recognise this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning. I have been loyal to you. I backed you to become Leader of our Party and encouraged others to do so. I have served as your Chancellor with gratitude that you entrusted me with stewardship of the nation's economy and finances. Above all, I have respected the powerful mandate given to you by the British people in 2019 and how under your leadership we broke the Brexit deadlock. That is why I have always tried to compromise in order to deliver the things you want to achieve. On those occasions where I disagreed with you privately, I have supported you publicly. That is the nature of the collective government upon which our system relies and it is particularly important that the Prime Minister and Chancellor remain united in hard times such as those we are experiencing today. Our country is facing immense challenges. We both want a low-tax, high-growth economy, and world class public services, but this can only be responsibly delivered if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices and take difficult decisions. I firmly believe the public are ready to hear that truth. Our people know that if something is too good to be true then it's not true. They need to know that whilst there is a path to a better future, it is not an easy one. In preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it has become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different. I am sad to be leaving Government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this. Kind regards, Rishi Sunak Dear Saj, Thank you for your letter this evening tendering your resignation. I was very sorry to receive it. You have served this Government, and the people of the United Kingdom, with distinction. Most recently, you have led the Department of Health and Social Care as we learn to live with Covid, forging ahead with plans to beat the Covid backlogs, recruit 50,000 nurses, build 40 new hospitals, and reform social care. These are the issues that matter to the people of this country, and the Government will continue to deliver on them. You have held significant positions in Government for the past decade, and have served myself and former Prime Ministers admirably. You have used your personal experience to bring about change in government, from fixing the injustices of Windrush to setting out recently a plan to address suicide. You will be greatly missed, and I look forward to your contributions from the backbenches. Yours ever, Boris Dear Rishi, I was sorry to receive your letter resigning from the Government. You have provided outstanding service to the country through the most challenging period for our economy in peacetime history. In March 2020, weeks after your appointment as Chancellor, we introduced a national lockdown to protect people from the pandemic. You acted to safeguard the economy with the pace, creativity and commitment which has been the hallmark of your tenure. The furlough scheme - conceived and implemented in a matter of weeks - supported 11.7 million jobs from 1.3 million employers. Through business loans and grants, you helped thousands of businesses to avoid insolvency. Emergency funding worth more than Â£140 billion, enabled the NHS and other critical public services to meet the enormous challenges we faced. These efforts primed the economy for a rapid recovery once the immediate dangers of the pandemic receded. At the Spending Review last year, you put us on track to deliver our promises to the British people, including 20,000 police officers and 40 new hospitals. We also set a clear plan to rebuild our economy and public services, including an historic funding settlement for the NHS and delivering six million tutoring courses to help pupils catch up lost learning. Through all of this, you have not shied from the tough decisions needed to repair our public finances whilst protecting public services and boosting economic growth. This has enabled us to provide support to households worth Â£37 billion, as we have faced global inflation pressures arising from Putin's brutal invasion of Ukraine. And we have begun to deliver tax cuts to families - including this week, a cut to National Insurance saving the average worker Â£330 a year. I have enormously valued your advice and deep commitment to public service and will miss working with you in government.

"Dr Garcia said Hope ""moves even quicker than his three neighbours"" A three-legged specimen of the world's rarest type of tortoise has been fitted with rollers to get it moving again after it was rescued from smugglers. Hope, a ploughshare tortoise, has been given a new home at Chester Zoo after being found in a suitcase by Hong Kong customs officers in 2019. The male, which is missing a front leg, was fitted with under-shell support rollers before arriving in Cheshire. The zoo's Dr Gerardo Garcia said Hope was ""an incredibly special tortoise"". Ploughshare tortoises, which are native to Madagascar, are one of the world's rarest animals, with fewer than 300 remaining in the wild. A spokesman for the zoo said only 63 specimens ""exist legally outside of Madagascar as part of vital conservation breeding programmes battling to save the species"". ""Chester Zoo is now home to four of these,"" he said. He added that the species was ""highly prized for their distinctive gold and black shells"" and fetched ""exceptionally high prices"" on the black market. Hope was found, along with 56 other endangered tortoises, three years ago The zoo said Hope's supports underwent further modifications after arriving in the UK Hope was found, along with 56 other endangered tortoises, three years ago by Hong Kong border officials. The owner of the suitcase, a man from the Comoro Islands in East Africa, was later jailed for two years for smuggling. The reptile was initially taken to an animal rescue centre in Hong Kong where support rollers were fitted under its lower shell to help it balance. Further modifications were made to the rollers at Chester Zoo after Hope arrived in the UK. Dr Garcia, the zoo's curator of lower vertebrates and invertebrates said Hope had had ""a remarkable life story"". He said the ""prosthetic mobility support"" worked ""wonderfully well"". ""He moves even quicker than his three neighbours,"" he added. Hope will join a breeding programme at the zoo Director of animals and plants Mike Jordan said Hope was ""such an important addition to the zoo"". He said the species was ""sadly under huge pressure for its survival"" and there was a ""very real possibility [it] could be lost forever"". He added that Hope would help ""maintain an ark population"" and join a breeding programme to create ""a genetically viable safety net population and prevent its extinction"". ""We refuse to sit back and see this incredible species disappear,"" he said. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"Police have been giving updates on a man held after a mass shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois They say Robert E Crimo III, 21, who is in custody, planned the shooting for several weeks and wore women's clothing to blend into the crowd He purchased his two rifles legally and fired more than 70 rounds, Chris Covelli, crime task force spokesman says The shooting appears to be completely random with no religion or race motives, he adds Two victims have been identified; The family of Nicolas Toledo, from Mexico, paid tribute to a ""loving, adventurous"" man Jacki Sundheim was described as a ""beloved"" staff member by her local synagogue They were among six people killed and more than three dozen injured It was devastating that a celebration of the US was ripped apart by a ""uniquely American plague"", Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker said US President Biden expressed shock and said he would not give up fighting the gun violence âepidemicâ Highland Park sits north of Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan Edited by Claire Heald We're closing our live coverage of the shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park near Chicago. Here are the latest developments:  For the latest updates, read our story here. Our live coverage was provided by Holly Honderich, Max Matza in the US and Alexandra Fouche and Malu Cursino in London. The debate over gun laws arises frequently in the wake of high-profile mass shootings in the US. Tuesday is the 186th day of the year, and the US has already seen 317 mass shootings in 2022. On average, they occur more than 11 times per week, according to the Gun Violence Archive organisation. A mass shooting is defined by the research group as an event in which four or more people are shot or killed, excluding the attacker. The killings in Highland Park have been the most widely-covered attack over the Independence Day weekend, but it is far from the only instance of recent fatal gun crime, which tends to rise in frequency during summer's hotter months. Also on Monday, two police officers were shot at a concert in Philadelphia, triggering panic among people who were there to watch fireworks. In Minneapolis, eight people were shot during an unofficial fireworks celebration. And in Gary, Indiana, three people were killed and seven wounded at a shooting at a holiday party in a residential neighbourhood. Less than 30 miles from Highland Park, 10 people were killed and 62 injured in shootings in Chicago - a drop over last year's total. Semi-automatic rifles, seen here, have been used in several of the country's worst recent shooting sprees This attack comes just weeks after the US Congress passed its first gun control law since 1994. The bipartisan bill came after mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde in Texas triggered lawmakers to finally act. The new law contains several provisions, including allowing the FBI to access juvenile and health records from younger gun buyers aged 18 to 20. The law does not include a provision that gun control campaigners hoped for - raising the age to buy a semi-automatic rifle to 21. Many of the most deadly mass shootings in recent history have occurred using semi-automatic rifles. But the new law comes as the Supreme Court tears down a New York state law that required people to prove a special need in order to carry a gun in public. Their ruling said that all Americans have the right under the Constitution to carry a gun outside their home. State bans on assault rifles are also expected to fall in light of the latest Supreme Court ruling. Here's a quick recap of the developments in the investigation into the Highland Park mass shooting: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot tells reporters she has been in
""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. The two mayors have known each other for three decades,
Lightfoot said, after meeting in law school. ""The minute I understood what had happened I reached out to
her [Rotering] and offered anything that I could do,"" Lightfoot says.
""Unfortunately I have a lot of experience here."" Lightfoot says she offered the support of the Chicago Police
Department, who ""sprang into action"". ""Whatever you need, we will be here for you,"" she
says.  President Joe Biden has ordered the American flag be lowered to half mast at the White House and other government buildings after Monday's shooting. ""As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of gun violence perpetrated on our Independence Day, July 4, 2022, in Highland Park, Illinois, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff,"" the president proclamation says. The flags will fly like that until 9 July. Biden made a similar proclamation just weeks ago, after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. What else did we learn during the Chicago police press conference about Monday's Highland Park attack? Officials said Robert E Crimo was dressed as a woman during the attack to hide his facial tattoos and help him escape in the crowd. The authorities also said they aimed to reveal charges against the suspect on Tuesday afternoon US time. Crime task force spokesman Chris Covelli says at this point authorities have not been able to identify any clear motive for the attack. Asked by reporters about the gunman's weapons, Covelli says Crimo used at least two rifles and pistols. All weapons examined were purchased lawfully by Crimo. Covelli adds that shooting appears to be completely random and there are no reasons to believe the attack was motivated by religion or race. We've been hearing more from the spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, Christopher Covelli. He says Crimo used his mother's car to escape the scene and blended in with the community because he concealed his identity by wearing women's clothing. Covelli adds that a second rifle was located inside Crimo's mother's car. He adds that Crimo remains in custody, and there are no indications he was acting with anyone else. Highland Park's authorities are delivering a news conference about the Fourth of July parade shooting, where six people were killed. Police say Robert E Crimo, 21, planned this attack for several weeks. Christopher Covelli, spokesman for Lake County Major Crime Task Force, says significant amount of information have been obtained from cell phone recordings and other footage. Crimo was dressed in women's clothing to conceal his identity, Covelli says. More than 70 rounds were fired from a legally purchased rifle, Covelli adds. We've heard from US President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the shootings and from the state's governor. Now its the turn of Illinois' lieutenant governor Juliana Stratton who says in atweet,external: ""Enough is enough."" Stratton echoed the governor's statement when he said gun violence was ""our uniquely American plague"". She added: ""I'm angry too. We all should be."" Highland Park's Independence Day shooting killed six people, and left at least three dozen others injured. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is speaking out about the ""horrible tragedy"" in Highland Park. Lightfoot appears with other Illinois lawmakers to discuss a bipartisan bill meant to address gun violence. ""The gun violence epidemic is deep and pervasive,"" she says. ""We saw that play out again in Highland Park yesterday."" Lightfoot says she has been in ""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. Gun violence is not just a Chicago problem, Lightfoot says. ""Gun violence knows no
borders or boundaries."" The bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, is meant to reduce gun violence nationwide. It includes enhanced background checks, a $250m (Â£205m) investment in community violence intervention and $100m for the national background check system. This video can not be played People, who had set up deck chairs in the street to watch the annual Independence Day parade, ran for safety as multiple shots rang out shortly after 1000 local time in Highland Park on 4 July. Toddlers in pushchairs, babes in arms, teenagers and the elderly fled the scene - and the gunfire - in fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones. ""He started shooting again, and we ran behind the building and I put my son in a dumpster,"" recalled one bystander. ""It was just horrible."" Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Illinois Senator Dick Durbin is here to view the remnants of the
Fourth of July parade. The Democrat looks shaken and tells me he is heart-broken
at what's happened. ""Are mass shootings now a tradition in America?"" I ask
him. ""I donât want
it to be but itâs becoming one,"" he sighs He backed recent major gun legislation aimed at addressing US gun
violence. He tells me it was an ""improvement"" but didnât go as far as
it should have. Senator Durbin says we have yet to see whether those new laws
would have stopped the gunman here. Illinois has tough gun laws but overall gun crime is high here. Republicans often point to Chicago as an example of a place
where gun control doesn't work. But some context - a report
in recent years from the city's police department has found a lot of guns come
from outside of Chicago and from neighbouring states like Kentucky and
Tennessee where the gun laws are more lax. The state of Illinois has the sixth strictest gun laws in the US,according to gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety,external. It also has the ninth lowest rate of gun ownership, according to the group. The state has universal background checks and requires firearms to be safely stored - but it does not ban assault weapons. Nancy Rotering, Highland Park's mayor, has told CNN the alleged shooter obtained his weapon legally. She criticised current gun laws, which enable individuals to lawfully purchase weapons. Rotering said: ""That being said, again, if you can have a weekly mass shooting with a legally purchased gun, then I think we need to talk about why those laws aren't protecting the very people that they're supposed to be protecting."" US President Joe Biden signed into law a landmark gun control bill in June, which aims to impose tougher checks on young buyers and encourage states to remove guns from people considered a threat. Robert Crimo, the alleged Independence Day shooter, has not yet been charged. But Rotering said she expects him to be charged today. So far, police have identified him as a ""person of interest"". Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Ken Pell is picking up his granddaughters' scooters. His wife
and family were at the parade and dumped everything for safety. ""I wasn't here, I was at a nearby golf club and got
notification of a shooting. We were then put into a basement for safety. I
couldnât get a signal and I was so panicked as I couldnât get hold of my family
for ages."" His daughter told him to leave the scooters because taking them
back ""would be bad karma"". ""I couldn't do that I wanted to collect them. My grandkids
donât seem too affected at the moment but you know my daughter is not doing
well. She is questioning raising her kids in a place like this."" The motivations of the gunman are unknown. Ken is Jewish and
says this is a predominantly Jewish area so he is worried that's why it may
have been targeted. ""We just never thought we would be hit like this but I
guess neither did Uvalde [the site of a mass school shooting]."" What does the data tell us about gun culture in the US and its impact? Here are some key charts. How many guns are there in the US? While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based leading research project - estimate that there were 390 million guns in circulation in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. How do US gun killings compare with other countries?  Nearly 53 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US, according to the official data from 2020. The data also shows that the vast majority of murders, 79%, were carried out with guns. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries Who supports gun control?  Despite widespread and vocal public outrage - often in the wake of gun violence - American support for stricter gun laws in 2020 fell to the lowest level since 2014,according to polling by Gallup,external. Only 52% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun laws, while 35% said they should remain the same. The issue is also one that is hyper-partisan - the Gallup study noted that Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans agreed with the same statement. See more key data and charts here The Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, was scheduled to include floats, marching bands, and community entertainment as part of the city's Fourth of July celebrations. But around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT) - just a few minutes after the parade had begun - a gunman who had climbed on to a roof near the parade route began shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. What should have been one of the happiest days of the year quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs left discarded on the street as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks. Police later recovered ""evidence of a firearm"" from the rooftop of a shop near to the parade route Five adults were killed at the scene, as well as a further victim who the local coroner said died in a nearby hospital. At least three dozen others were injured. At least eight victims remain in hospitals across Chicagoland (the Chicago metropolitan area) following yesterday's shooting, Jim
Anthony, spokesman for the North Shore University hospital group says. He did not provide updates on the patients' conditions. Thirty-eight patients were initially admitted for treatment after the parade, Anthony said, at three of the group's hospitals: Evanston Hospital, Glenbrook Hospital and Highland Park Hospital. ""We were able to mobilise quickly,"" Anthony said. ""Our physicians and nurses and medical support
staff train for situations like this, not that we ever want to see them in real
life."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,3.074657e-12
"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch Cameron Norrie's comeback as he beats David Goffin to progress Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Britain's Cameron Norrie reached the Wimbledon semi-finals by fighting back to beat David Goffin in a memorable five-set thriller which left the home fans celebrating jubilantly. Ninth seed Norrie, 26, battled hard to secure a 3-6 7-5 2-6 6-3 7-5 win against unseeded Belgian Goffin. As his name was chanted around Court One, he was overcome with emotion. Norrie will now contest his first Grand Slam semi-final, meeting defending champion Novak Djokovic on Friday. Asked for his reaction to beating Goffin, Norrie said: ""Honestly? Speechless. I can't even talk."" 'Crazy match, crazy day' as Norrie thrills Wimbledon Norrie unrecognised by a barman but now watched by royalty Djokovic fights back to beat Sinner after pep talk 'Extraordinary' Maria reaches Wimbledon semi-finals The British men's number one, known for his laid-back demeanour, showed a unusual flicker of emotion during his on-court interview. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were among the 11,000 or so fans who watched as the world number 12 absorbed the finest moment of his career. Norrie added: ""I think just winning a match like this, I'm in shock. I don't know what to say now. ""I have flashbacks of all the hard work and all the sacrifices I have had to make and it's definitely paid off - and it feels pretty good."" Norrie is the first British man to reach the Wimbledon singles semi-finals since Andy Murray in 2016 and the first British player since Johanna Konta in 2017. Next he faces top seed Djokovic, who is chasing a fourth successive title and a seventh in total at the All England Club. The 35-year-old Serb was given a huge scare by Italy's Jannik Sinner before fighting back to win in five sets earlier on Tuesday. ""It great to get this now but it's only going to get tougher,"" Norrie told the Wimbledon crowd. ""I'm going to take it to Novak and hopefully you guys can get behind me and I'm sure you will."" As the highest seeded Briton in the singles draws, Norrie may have been predicted to be the last home player left but was breaking new ground by reaching the quarter-finals. Now he has moved one step further. The left-hander had never previously been past the third round of a Grand Slam tournament, despite a fine couple of years which have seen him reach the world's top 10. Reserved and understated, Norrie does not receive - or seek - the same level of attention as what Murray has received throughout his career. But he has found himself thrust into the spotlight, saying he has been ""enjoying and embracing"" being the leading home hope at Wimbledon. That was evident in a confident performance in the fourth round against Tommy Paul, but was missing in the opening stages against an inspired Goffin. Still, he refused to become overly despondent and fought back to take a momentum-swinging match into a decider. In front of an enthusiastic crowd now including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who were earlier on Centre Court and headed over after Djokovic's win, Norrie kept his cool in an increasingly tense situation. Former world number seven Goffin had served well in the decider until being broken to love for 6-5 and, remarkably, that was the first time in the match where Norrie had led. He saw a first match point disappear when Goffin pummelled past a winner, but took his second opportunity to become only the fourth British man - following Murray, Tim Henman and Roger Taylor - to reach the Wimbledon singles semi-finals in the Open era.

Norrie's journey began in Johannesburg and, after moving to Auckland as a child and then studying in Texas, has since made a home in London. With a Welsh mother and a Scottish father, he was always destined to represent the nation despite retaining a hint of a New Zealand accent. His parents, microbiologists David and Helen, have been a driving force in his life and watched on proudly as they shared the finest moment of his career at the All England Club. The couple still live in New Zealand and missed much of his recent rise in the flesh because of the coronavirus pandemic. But they have been following their son around the European clay and grass tournaments since flying over to Rome in May. His sister Bronwyn, who lives in London, was also among his loved ones watching on court, along with his old landlady, Linda, and friends from his university days in the United States. After sealing victory over Goffin, Norrie walked over to his box where mum Helen and girlfriend Louise were both overcome by the moment.

"The chancellor and health secretary have resigned from government, saying they no longer have confidence in Boris Johnson to lead the country. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the public expected government to be conducted ""properly, competently and seriously"". Health Secretary Sajid Javid echoed this, saying the government was not ""acting in the national interest"". The resignations came minutes after the PM apologised for appointing MP Chris Pincher to a government role. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi has been named as the new chancellor, and Downing Street chief of staff, Steve Barclay, will replace Mr Javid as health secretary. Higher education minister Michelle Donelan has been promoted to education secretary. Mr Johnson admitted he had made a ""bad mistake"" in appointing Mr Pincher to the role of deputy chief whip earlier this year, despite being made aware of earlier allegations about the MP's conduct. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson said: ""In hindsight it was the wrong thing to do. I apologise to everybody who has been badly affected by it."" His handling of the row has faced fierce criticism from the opposition and some of his own MPs. Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid resignation letters in full PM regrets appointing Chris Pincher after complaint Pincher suspended as Tory MP after groping claim PM under renewed pressure over Pincher appointment Alongside Mr Sunak and Mr Javid, Bim Afolami quit as Tory vice-chair live on TV, Andrew Murrison resigned as a trade envoy, and ministerial aides Jonathan Gullis and Saqib Bhatti left their roles. But the BBC understands Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove and other cabinet ministers are backing the prime minister as he assesses the scale of the rebellion against his leadership. Mr Johnson has been publicly backed by loyal allies Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and minister for Brexit Opportunities Jacob Rees-Mogg, who insisted the prime minister was the ""right man for the job"". The resignation of two senior cabinet ministers has plunged Mr Johnson into a fresh leadership crisis weeks afterhe survived a no-confidence vote. The PM is immune from a Conservative leadership challenge until June next year under party rules, after he won 59% of the vote. This video can not be played Watch: Johnson on appointing Pincher: I apologise for it In response to the resignations, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he would welcome a snap election and the country needed a change of government. He said: ""After all the sleaze, all the failure, it's clear that this Tory government is now collapsing."" The next general election is expected to be held in 2024 but could be earlier if Mr Johnson used his powers to call one. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, said the prime minister's ""government of chaos has failed our country"", and called for him to go. Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said ""the whole rotten lot"" in Mr Johnson's government should go, accusing ministers of ""lying to public"". Is this the beginning of the end for Boris Johnson? During the course of the day, some of the PM's prominent critics called on government ministers to put pressure on the prime minister to resign. A chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and an ex-chancellor, Sajid Javid, have done just that. Both men see their resignations as necessary if the PM is to be pushed out. Both may be positioning for a future leadership contest. But even now, Downing Street will hope to avoid this. Boris Johnson still has his foreign secretary, home secretary, defence secretary and business secretary. And, remember, a beleaguered Gordon Brown survived a ministerial resignation because the rest of his cabinet stayed loyal, when he was in Number 10. But it now seems more likely that other ministers, in more junior roles, who have been privately critical of Boris Johnson could follow Mr Sunak and Mr Javid's lead. The last Conservative prime minister to face a party vote on their leadership was Theresa May, who won the vote but resigned six months later over her approach to Brexit. Mr Johnson's government has been dogged by a series of controversies in recent months, prompting some Tory MPs to call for the prime minister's resignation. Discontent among Tory MPs has grown sincea highly critical report into lockdown partiesin and near Downing Street during the Covid-19 pandemic was published earlier this year. The report laid bare the extent of Covid rule-breaking in Number 10, including at a birthday party for whichthe PM was fined by the police. The fine meant Mr Johnson became the UK's first serving prime minister to be sanctioned for breaking the law. Some Tory MPs have also expressed dissent over tax rises, the government's response to rising living costs and its policy direction. The loss of by-elections inTiverton and HonitonandWakefieldin June put more pressure on the prime minister and triggered the resignation of Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. This video can not be played Watch: Sajid Javid seen after shock resignation In a dramatic sequence of events on Tuesday evening, Mr Javid shared his resignation letter on Twitter shortly after 18:00 BST - minutes after the prime minister spoke to reporters in Downing Street. Mr Javid - who has been health secretary since June 2021 - said he could ""no longer in good conscience continue serving in this government"". ""I am instinctively a team player but the British people also rightly expect integrity from their government,"" he wrote. ""The tone you set as a leader and the values you represent, reflect on your colleagues, your party and ultimately the country."" A few minutes later at about 18:10, Mr Sunak tweeted out his resignation letter, leaving two top roles empty in Mr Johnson's cabinet. In his letter, Mr Sunak, who has been tipped as potential future leader of the Conservative Party, told the prime minister that standards in government were ""worth fighting for"". Since becoming chancellor in February 2020, Mr Sunak has not always been in sync with the prime minister on economic policy and public spending. ""I have been loyal to you,"" Mr Sunak wrote in his letter. ""I backed you to become leader of our party and encouraged others to do so. ""I have served as your chancellor with gratitude that you entrusted me with stewardship of the nation's economy and finances."" But Mr Sunak said that he could no longer back Mr Johnson, suggesting their differences could not be reconciled. He said: ""In preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it has become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different. ""I am sad to be leaving government but I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we cannot continue like this.""

"Butter brand Lurpak has said the price of its products has gone up so that dairy farmers get a fair deal. Lurpak was trending on Twitter as shoppers expressed shock at the price of the spread in supermarkets. A 750g tub is Â£7.25 in Sainsbury's. Asda said photos of the butter covered in security tags did not indicate that they were being stolen more often, but an issue in an individual store. Lurpak said: ""Prices on the shelves have had to rise in recent months."" A statement from Lurpak's owner Arla Foods said: ""We understand that recent inflation in food price is hitting many households really hard right now. ""Unfortunately, our farmers are facing a similar situation with prices for the feed, fertiliser and fuel they need to produce milk, all rising significantly in recent months. ""While we don't set the prices on the shelves, we do work closely with the retailers to ensure our farmers receive a fair price for the milk they produce."" Allow Twitter content?

Asda said its largest pack of Lurpak had been at about the Â£6 mark since last year, its price had not changed and it was not considered high value. ""We've no data to suggest it's being stolen more than anything else or more than it has been in the past,"" a spokesperson said. ""Asda hasn't started tagging this product as a rule, individual stores may add tags to products they may have noticed have been going missing."" Sainsbury's said: ""The price of products will be influenced by a range of factors, including manufacturer's costs, and we are doing all we can to mitigate rising costs where we can."" A spokesperson for the supermarket pointed out it had own brand options and butter was also part of its Sainsbury's Quality, Aldi Price Match campaign. Retail analyst Steve Dresser, chief executive of Grocery Insight, said high costs for production, energy, fuel and other raw materials at the start of the supply chain were now making their way to the shelf edge. He said: ""Paying farmers a fair price is important for our wider food security and as their costs rise, the price paid for their produce has to rise too. It all leads to a higher cost price and thus, a higher shelf price. ""Of course, Lurpak is a brand with a distinctive taste and lots of loyal fans, but it's a reminder that other (cheaper) brands are also available. ""A non-promotional price for Lurpak at Â£5/Â£7/Â£9 is a reminder of the significant inflationary pressure we're all feeling at the minute.

"Monmouth GP Dr Rowena Christmas said Covid was ""still very much with us"" All of Wales' seven health boards are either insisting on or encouraging the use of face masks for hospital visits. Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, has gone further by reinstating a temporary ban on visits. Hywel Dda health board in west and mid Wales is the latest to require use of masks, following a rise in Covid infections. Aneurin Bevan asked people to stay away from its hospitals unless ""absolutely necessary"" due to ""extreme pressure"". The health board did not mention Covid as a reason for this latest appeal. Meanwhile, some year groups at Ysgol Aberconwy, Conwy, arereceiving their lessons online from home,externalthis week due to staff absences relating to Covid. Wales' top doctor, Sir Frank Atherton, reminded people the pandemic had not gone away. ""While we are learning to live safely with it, we still need to think about taking the simple steps to help keep us safe and limit the spread of coronavirus,"" the chief medical officer said. ""The successful roll-out of the vaccine has significantly reduced cases of serious illness, however the virus is still spreading quickly in our communities."" While masks are no longer mandatory, Dr Sir Frank said people should still wear a facemask in health and care settings and in crowded indoor places. Wales has seen a rise in infections in the past month with one in 30 people testing positive, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). This is also reflected in a rise in patients testing positive for Covid in hospital - while more are catching it when in hospital. However, the most recent figures still show 88% of patients testing positive for Covid are primarily being treated for something else. Only 59 (10%) of confirmed Covid patients in acute beds on Monday were being primarily treated for the virus, with 515 patients in hospital being treated for other conditions. Numbers in critical care with Covid have been averaging 16 a day, up from 10 a week ago - half of these were ""incidental"" Covid patients and not treated primarily for the virus. There are 10 times more non-Covid patients in critical care than patients who have Covid, according to Digital Health and Care Wales figures. In Tuesday's First Minister's Questions, Mark Drakeford said that 1,500 NHS staff are currently not in work due to Covid, with a further 600 isolating because they are close contact with cases. Mr Drakeford said that was more than 2% of the NHS Wales workforce, and showed the ""continuing impact"" of the virus. ""Coronavirus has not gone away,"" he told the Senedd. Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan health boards, both in south Wales,asked people to wear masksat their hospitals last month, as did Betsi Cadwaladr health board which covers the north, and Swansea Bay health board. Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest is among the latest to reintroduce the use of face masks Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Waiting times record, with two years of increases Cardiff and Vale health board followed suit. Powys Teaching health board has required visitors to wear face masks for some time. Aneurin Bevan, which covers Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Monmouthshire, Newport, Torfaen and south Powys, said the emergency department at The Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran ""remains very busy"" on Monday evening. It asked people to attend only if they have ""a life-threatening illness or serious injury"". Anyone with a less serious issue is asked to visit a minor injury unit in Newport, Abergavenny, Ystrad Mynach, or Ebbw Vale. Across Aneurin Bevan last Thursday there were no vacant acute beds at all. In the last few days it has been 98.5% bed occupancy at the health board. That's just 16 available acute beds which are vacant. Hywel Dda is now encouraging staff and contractors to have a lateral flow test, and report the result, twice a week. ""We have made the decision to reinforce these measures at Withybush Hospital to reduce the risk to our patients and staff,"" said Mandy Rayani, director of nursing, quality and patient experience. ""We can all continue to take protective measures to reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-19 to protect vulnerable people and the NHS. People are also asked to attend outpatient clinics alone at Withybush. A designated partner can attend antenatal appointments or scans at Withybush Hospital midwifery-led unit and any visits considered necessary through agreement with a ward sister or charge nurse. Latest figures for Hywel Dda health board showed although the number of testing positive for Covid has risen by 79% in a week, only three patients on average were ""actively"" being treated for Covid in the last week;  97% of positive tests have been ""incidental"" Covid. More than half of Hywel Dda patients who tested positive for Covid in the most recent week had caught the infection in hospital, according to separate Public Health Wales figures. There were 212 ""probable"" and ""definite"" cases of Covid infections caught by patients while in hospital in Wales in the most recent week. This is the highest weekly total since mid-April. 91% of the patients concerned were over 60 and more than half over 80, according to Public Health Wales. 48% of positive tests in hospital are hospital-acquired in the latest week. Monmouth GP Dr Rowena Christmas said Covid was ""still very much with us"" with six residents at one care home testing positive despite its ""best interests to protect everyone"". ""We've got lots and lots of patients with symptoms which that could well be Covid,"" she toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales. ""We've got staff members off sick again, testing positive. ""Right now if we could get our masks back on and, I hate to say this, but avoid hugs and kisses with anyone who isn't our immediate contacts as much as you possibly can."" Little of this will come as a surprise to anyone with a friend, relative or colleague who has recently shared tales of feeling pretty rough, having come down with Covid. But those friends, family and colleagues invariably have jobs in the NHS, schools or local services. You take them out of the mix and we start to feel the pinch again, with hospitals under intense pressure, and schools without enough staff to get by safely. The positives: fewer people are needing to be hospitalised with Covid - in the main, people can cope with the symptoms. But right now, hospitals are already full. We've seen record highs for bed occupancy rates in recent weeks. Why? Well we know there's a backlog of patients waiting for care - but the longer they wait, the worse their conditions become, so their needs become more urgent, meaning many end up in hospital anyway. And getting them out once they're medically well enough is harder if they need additional support on the outside - we know there's a shortage of social care staff - but they too, unsurprisingly, are also being hit by Covid.

"Take two: the royal couple were shown around the new BBC Wales building, which will be open for guided tours to the public The Prince of Wales has voiced concern that the climate crisis gets too little coverage during weather reporting. Prince Charles aired his views during a visit with the Duchess of Cornwall to BBC Cymru Wales' new headquarters atCardiff Central Square. The visit began with a tour of the broadcast centre, including the new television studios. He told weather presenter Derek Brockway he was ""frustrated"" not enough of the climate crisis was incorporated. Prince Charles chatting with weather presenters Derek Brockway and Sabrina Lee ""It's about time some mention was made why it's so critical,"" said Charles. Prince Charles: We must learn from indigenous people on climate change Charles: I understand climate activists' anger ""We try and build it in,"" Derek said. His fellow weather presenter Sabrina Lee explained how she did a mini-series for the COP26 climate conference ""talking about the climate change stripes (a form of warning system) in Wales to see how the temperature has changed since 1850. ""Last summer Wales had its first extreme heat warning and we tried to investigate whether climate change played a part in this,"" she added. Derek told the prince his interest in the weather started in 1976 when he decided he wanted to be a meteorologist. The royal couple were welcomed to the new BBC Cymru Wales headquarters in central Cardiff ""I'm always intrigued watching the local weather,"" Prince Charles said in response. Charles'sinterest in environmental issues is well known, and he said earlier this year that time was ""rapidly running out"" to deal with climate change and biodiversity loss. The prince visited the studios and chatted with presenters and other staff The prince also met members of the BBC's centre of excellence for climate and science journalism, which is moving from London to Cardiff. ""Are you covering the remarkable advances and innovative approaches to energy?"" the prince asked. BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt replied that wind generation is ""getting better"" with the Crown Estatethis week announcinga tendering process for floating wind turbines ""As long as they're not sailing into my boat,"" Prince Charles said with a smile. ""I hope there's a bit of tethering."" Prince Charles met members of the BBC's climate and science team There was also a meeting with cafeteria staff, including 61-year-old cook Robert Jones, who said as he shook hands with the prince: ""It's my birthday today so thanks for making the effort"" ""Shouldn't you have a day off?"" Charles shot back. ""No, this was much more important,"" Mr Jones replied. Prince Charles shares a joke with BBC cafeteria staff Prince Charles and Camilla were greeted in the foyer of BBC Central Square by the choir from Mount Stuart Primary School in Cardiff. The royal couple's visit continued with avisit to the Betty Campbell statue, near the BBC building. It is Wales' first monument to a named, non-fictional woman in an outdoor space. Large crowds welcomed the royal couple to the new BBC Cymru Wales building She was head teacher of Mount Stuart school, Wales' first black head, and a black history campaigner. Betty's son, Antony Campbell said his family was ""very proud"" to have the royals visiting the monument. ""[My mum] probably would have said don't make a fuss,"" he said. ""For Prince Charles to come and have a look at it, that's incredible."" Camilla and Prince Charles visited a new monument to Betty Campbell in Cardiff They also have an engagement with the 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards in Cardiff and will host an evening of music and drama at their residence in Llandovery, Carmarthenshire.

"This video can not be played Actor Michael Sheen says the ""worst things imaginable"" are happening to children in care How would you feel if your child, or one you knew, was taken into care and ended up living in a B&B, a hostel, or even slept rough? What I'm talking about here is ""the care system"", the safety net we'd rely on if we couldn't look after our kids. I've been working on a BBC documentary which has found teenagers are still being placed in B&Bs and hostels - six years after theWelsh government said it wanted to ""eliminate"" it. Some of the stories have shocked me. With record numbers of children being taken into care in Wales and England, I've spoken to some young people who have been through the care system in an hour-long documentary, filmed over nearly three years, I've helped make for the BBC. âAbuse, assault, profitâ - childcare staff speak out Huge profits made from children's care - report 'It's hard to parent when you're the grandparent' My question is: does the care system always ""care"" for children who can't stay with mum or dad? ""I know for a fact prison would have been better than where I was placed,"" Niall told myBBC Wales Investigates 'Lifting the lid on the care system'documentary. Niall says one of his care placements was ""one of the worst places he'd ever lived"" He says he grew up moving in and out of care between the age of 14 and 18 - and after a place in a children's home broke down just as he turned 17, he was placed in a B&B. ""People moved there that had just come out of prison and stuff,"" Niall added. ""So I got robbed a couple of times in there. You'd see people kicking down doors on a daily basis, there'd be people smashing windows, people carrying knives."" Niall told me he was then moved into what he describes as a hostel, although his council insists it was supported housing as they tried to find him somewhere permanent to live. Social services found Niall a flat but he was targeted by the people who were with him in the hostel ""I was woken up by a punch basically,"" he recalled about one incident. ""So I had to start barricading my door which, obviously, they got through eventually. It was like they put all the troubled teenagers under one roof."" The people in charge of Niall's care said they made every effort to find him somewhere else to stay and that his case was not straightforward, but Caerphilly council did not comment on the threats and violence. Hope was taken into care at 14 but ran away after her foster placement broke down when she was 16. This video can not be played The state took charge of Hope as she had been exploited by people in her community ""I was a child in a tent with an adult who was over the age of 18, sleeping rough, where nobody knew where I was,"" Hope, now in her early 20s, told me. ""I was technically a child of the state. It wasn't OK... I was at risk."" Those responsible for Hope's care said it could not comment on individual cases but Wrexham council said its services had been transformed and it would use Hope's comments to improve things further. In 2016, I presented a petition to the Welsh government to end the practice of children being placed in B&Bs and hostels. Ministers said they wanted to ""eliminate"" it - but six years on, it's still happening. Research by the BBC Wales Investigates team suggests dozens of teenagers like Niall and Hope are still being put in that position. Hope has fond memories of growing up with her grandparents, but says bullying in school and the trauma of leaving her mum made her feel vulnerable Freedom of information requests to all councils in Wales showed at least 50 young people were placed in B&Bs, hostels and budget hotels in the past financial year, with at least 285 in other accommodation which is not regulated by the care watchdog. I don't want this to come across as an attack on social workers - because it's not. It is their job to look after these young people but they're working within a system that is, according to one report last year by those in charge of social services,facing a ""crisis"" to find suitable places,externalfor children to stay. While most children placed in such temporary accommodation are 16 or 17, our investigation found a small number are even younger. One example included an 11-year-old being housed in temporary accommodation with council staff, because there was nowhere else for them to go. SAM SMITH PRESENTS STORIES OF HIV:From Terrence Higgins to today LIFTING THE LID ON THE CARE SYSTEM:A shocking insight into the lives of young people in care Gemma - not her real name - felt she was let down by the system that was supposed to keep her safe. Gemma told me she was known to social services since she was born and remembered going missing 110 times one summer when she was about 12 She says she was exploited by older men when she was young before eventually being taken into care at 14, when she had become addicted to heroin. ""I'd moved house 12 times by the time I was 15,"" she said. ""I've never fully unpacked anywhere. Nobody ever keeps me very long anyway."" Leaving care: 'I fell through the cracks' Almost 100,000 children could be in care by 2025 Austerity blamed for children in care rise When she was 16 she was offered a hostel to stay in by social workers, which she said had a drug dealer staying there. ""I'd just spent nine months getting clean,"" Gemma said. ""They then placed me in this hostel where he was anyway. I was there less than a week before I was back on drugs."" After meeting Gemma and hearing all she'd been through, I broke down because what she had experienced and what she told me was just devastating. No child should have to live that life. My personal view is that we shouldn't tolerate that some young people just disappear and the worst possible things imaginable happen to them. Children who, from the beginning and often through no choice of their own, find themselves in circumstances that already makes things harder for them than it does for anyone else. People in social care tell you those are the children who are most likely to end up homeless, most likely to end up with mental health issues, with alcohol and drug dependency issues and even being sexually abused. The group that represents Wales' 22 local authorities said councils in Wales were ""committed to doing their best in responding to the growing demands and increasingly complex challenges in children's social care"". I launched a petition calling on the Welsh government to help homeless teenagers in Wales in 2015 The Welsh Local Government Association said it regretted the standard of care and support it wanted to achieve has not been met in everyone's case, and that it was keen to learn from young people's experiences. It also believes there is a need for additional funding to help children and families earlier, and that wider societal issues such as access to health services and ending child poverty are not things children's social care can solve alone. When I challenged Wales' deputy minister for social services on her government's record, she told me that while the majority of children in the care system grow up in loving families, she accepts that a minority of children do not have the experiences she would want them to have. ""What we really want to do is put as much support as we possibly can to parents and children at an earlier age, and stop so many numbers coming into care,"" said Julie Morgan MS. Julie Morgan has said the Welsh government is to invest more in foster carers and support workers for those leaving care ""Crises do happen, placements break down, families break down... and the children have to be put somewhere... we don't accept that that should be the situation and we're trying to do things to stop that."" She added there were plans for new specialist accommodation for children with complex needs across Wales and the government wasinvesting more in foster care and providing supportfor those leaving care. ""We have got it at the top of our agenda here in Wales... which doesn't mean that things don't go wrong,"" Ms Morgan added. ""To hear these tales from young people - and that I've heard so many times - that break your heart, you think how could this have happened? ""I absolutely accept that, but we're doing our utmost to make sure that every young person in Wales has, you know, a happy fulfilling life."" In England and Scotland, there has just been an independent review of the children's care system which called for earlier help for families too. Those in charge of social services departments there have longcalled for a ""system overhaul"",externalto address all sorts of issues The UK government said it had alreadybanned under-16s staying in places that aren't inspectedby the watchdog and will respond with more detailed plans later this year. But for everything the politicians are putting forward, based on what you'll see if you watch my BBC documentary, I wonder if you would be happy for the current care system to look after your child if you weren't around. If not, then don't we all need to consider whether that safety net - and the people who work within it - is being treated with the priority it deserves? Because if we continue to let these people down and continue to get this wrong, surely the consequences don't bear thinking about. Don't we feel we owe it to them - and society as whole - to sort this out?

"An artist's impression of the floating wind farm. Photo courtesy of Principle Power. Artist: DOCK90 Plans to generate electricity through floating wind farms off the south Wales coast could create thousands of new jobs, according to the Crown Estate. The property business owned by the monarch but run independently said the new industry could create about 29,000 jobs, including 10,000 in Wales. It is leasing the space to generate enough power for four million homes. But firms looking to win contracts from the plans have urged licensing authorities against delays. ""It's a big opportunity to create a new sector in Wales and the UK,"" said the Crown Estate's Nicola Clay. ""This is absolutely going to happen, interest is growing."" Nicola Clay from the Crown Estate says it will take time to grow companies in Wales that can supply the new industry What's in the UK's new energy strategy? More floating wind farms 'significant' for Wales Until now most offshore wind farms in the UK have been built into the seabed on fixed foundations. Floating wind farms can be deployed in deeper water  than conventional offshore wind farms, where there is often higher wind, such as off the coast of Pembrokeshire. The wind turbines are floated on massive steel structures and tethered or anchored to the seabed. The Crown Estate tenders will be issued in summer 2023 and could potentially inject Â£43.6bn into the UK economy by 2050, according to industry body the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult. It could bring new opportunities for Wales as the area of the seabed that the Crown Estate is licensing is 40 miles off south Wales. Of the estimated 29,00 jobs created, some 10,000 would be in Wales, building and running the sites. Areas like Port Talbot and parts of Pembrokeshire have the deep ports, empty sites and skills that the floating wind industry would need. Large open areas of land, a deep port, good connections with the electricity grid, vast amounts of steel as well as manufacturing and metal construction skills are all necessary. The floating wind turbines will be mounted onto huge steel structures that could be assembled on the side of the port at Pembroke Dock and towed out to sea. Ledwood Engineering, based in Pembroke Dock, is one of the local firms that has worked for the oil industry for many years and hopes to win some of that work. As refineries closed locally, the company and employees had to find new work. The firm recently won a large contract to work on the construction of the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point. Welder George James said there were few other options in Pembrokeshire For welders like Ryan Gwyther, that meant jobs in Newcastle, Belfast and beyond. He hopes he will now get work building the structures needed for building floating wind farms. ""It's my career, welding and pipework. If there was no work here I'd have to move elsewhere,"" he said. George James, also a welder, said there were few other options in Pembrokeshire. ""It is mainly these trades, unless you are going into domestic plumbing,"" he said. Nick Revell, managing director of Ledwood Engineering, has warned potential jobs could be lost if the public bodies involved in licensing the new industry were too slow. ""We have the Crown Estate that have got to do work on this and provide good solutions in a timely manner,"" he said. ""Similarly [Natural Resources Wales] NRW, they also have to come to the table and make it work."" The Crown Estate said is was working as quickly as possible. Andrea Winterton, marine services manager at Natural Resources Wales, which is responsible for looking after the environment and landscape of Wales' coastal areas, said: ""We are working with a number of offshore floating wind and other marine renewable developers with respect to their proposals, as well as with industry representatives, the Crown Estate and Welsh Government at a strategic level. ""We offer potential developers pre-application advice and guidance, and work with them throughout their application progress to achieve the sustainable management of our natural resources."" She added that this could be seen in the recent marine licensing decision reached for another marine renewables project, Morlais, off the west coast of Anglesey,. ""We will continue to advise the Crown Estate on their seabed leasing plans for floating offshore wind and continue to work with all our stakeholders to drive forward the crucial work of marine renewable energy in Wales"".

"Holidaymakers are advised against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka The UK government has reinstated advice against all but essential travel to Sri Lanka as a severe economic crisis has sparked civil unrest. A shortage of basic necessities including medicines, cooking gas, fuel and food has sparked protests and violence in the Asian country. Sri Lanka's government said it only had enough petrol to last one day as it faces its worst crisis in 70 years. The travel warning was previously in place from 13 May to 10 June. The popular tourist destination ended a state of emergency prompted by angry demonstrations over the economic crisis on 21 May. But on Sunday, the nation said its petrol stocks had almost run dry once again and its next shipment was not due for two weeks. What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? Sri Lanka warns petrol stocks about to run dry Sri Lanka: 'I canât afford milk for my babies' The Foreign Office warned holidaymakers could encounter ""demonstrations, roadblocks and violent unrest at short notice"". Visiting countries against Foreign Office advice would be likely to invalidate your travel insurance, the Association of British Insurers said. It said anyone who changed their plans as a result of a travel warning should also check their insurance could be transferred to cover their new destination. The Sri Lankan government has blamed the Covid pandemic for the crisis, which affected the country's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. Nearly 200,000 Britons travelled to Sri Lanka in 2019, but this figure dipped to 55,455 in 2020. But Sri Lanka's government exacerbated its foreign currency shortage in 2021, when it banned imports of chemical fertiliser.

For our latest story on the government resignations and Boris Johnson's leadership,head here. We'll be back with more live updates on the UK political situation later today. It's been an eventful 24 hours. Given recent developments - from sackings to resignations - we're all in need of a quick round-up of where we're up to on this political saga. Nadhim Zahawi, who was only appointed as chancellor on Tuesday, is ""solidly behind"" the prime minister, Boris Johnson's parliamentary private secretary has told Sky News. Zahawi was earlier reported to have been in No 10 Downing Street as part of a group of cabinet ministers telling Boris Johnson that he should resign. But James Duddridge told Sky News earlier that those reports are ""wrong"" and Zahawi will be announcing a new economic strategy ""some time next week"". Duddridge was emphatic that the PM would ""go on and deliver"". Conservative MP Gareth Davies has quit as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Health and Social Care. The Grantham and Stamford MP tweeted: ""It is with great regret that I have informed the whips office of my resignation as a PPS at the Department of Health and Social Care. ""It has been a privilege to serve in the role and not a decision I have taken lightly."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With a third of the government gone following the stream of resignations, can it still be described as functioning? Not according to Camilla Cavendish, the former director of the Number 10 Policy Unit. ""The key point here is exactly this - we don't have a functioning government,"" she tells the BBC. ""As of tonight there aren't enough people to keep the business of the government going. Members of Parliament have already been told there aren't even enough people on the bill committees to actually get the legislation through - that is the fundamental business of government."" Cavendish adds: ""He can try in the next few days to bring new people in and there's always bound to be somebody but he is going to run out of road."" Conservative backbencher Bob Seely has been speaking to BBC Radio 4
about Boris Johnsonâs refusal to resign. Speaking to the World Tonight, he said it's not a case of the
calm before the storm, but rather ""the storm before the calm"". He added the political crisis was ""a bit like the end of a
bad relationship - it's just emotionally exhausting"". ""You think well I've tried, it hasnât worked, we've given
it a few years and we need to move on."" Seely has withdrawn his support for Johnson after backing him in
last monthâs vote of confidence. He's now hoping there will be a second vote. Speaking to the BBC, former Conservative minister Margot James criticised Boris Johnson's decision to sack Michael Gove. After losing more than 40 ministers in 24 hours, she said it was ""grossly irresponsible"" to sack ""probably the most competent minister in the whole cabinet"". James added she suspected it was ""active vengeance for what happened three years ago"". In 2016, when David Cameron stepped down, Johnson dropped out of the race for the Conservative leadership bid when Gove - who had previously backed Johnson - announced his own bid. Theresa May went on to win, becoming PM. And in 2019, Gove took Johnson on again, after having previously backed him to replace May when she resigned. Matt Hancock - the former health secretary - says ""it's clear"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to resign. In an interview with ITV's Robert Peston, Hancock says it's a sad end for Johnson. He adds: ""It's clear whether it's tomorrow or next Tuesday, there's going to be a new prime minister"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

For our latest story on the government resignations and Boris Johnson's leadership,head here. We'll be back with more live updates on the UK political situation later today. It's been an eventful 24 hours. Given recent developments - from sackings to resignations - we're all in need of a quick round-up of where we're up to on this political saga. Nadhim Zahawi, who was only appointed as chancellor on Tuesday, is ""solidly behind"" the prime minister, Boris Johnson's parliamentary private secretary has told Sky News. Zahawi was earlier reported to have been in No 10 Downing Street as part of a group of cabinet ministers telling Boris Johnson that he should resign. But James Duddridge told Sky News earlier that those reports are ""wrong"" and Zahawi will be announcing a new economic strategy ""some time next week"". Duddridge was emphatic that the PM would ""go on and deliver"". Conservative MP Gareth Davies has quit as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Health and Social Care. The Grantham and Stamford MP tweeted: ""It is with great regret that I have informed the whips office of my resignation as a PPS at the Department of Health and Social Care.

With a third of the government gone following the stream of resignations, can it still be described as functioning? Not according to Camilla Cavendish, the former director of the Number 10 Policy Unit. ""The key point here is exactly this - we don't have a functioning government,"" she tells the BBC. ""As of tonight there aren't enough people to keep the business of the government going. Members of Parliament have already been told there aren't even enough people on the bill committees to actually get the legislation through - that is the fundamental business of government."" Cavendish adds: ""He can try in the next few days to bring new people in and there's always bound to be somebody but he is going to run out of road."" Conservative backbencher Bob Seely has been speaking to BBC Radio 4
about Boris Johnsonâs refusal to resign. Speaking to the World Tonight, he said it's not a case of the
calm before the storm, but rather ""the storm before the calm"". He added the political crisis was ""a bit like the end of a
bad relationship - it's just emotionally exhausting"". ""You think well I've tried, it hasnât worked, we've given
it a few years and we need to move on."" Seely has withdrawn his support for Johnson after backing him in
last monthâs vote of confidence. He's now hoping there will be a second vote. Speaking to the BBC, former Conservative minister Margot James criticised Boris Johnson's decision to sack Michael Gove. After losing more than 40 ministers in 24 hours, she said it was ""grossly irresponsible"" to sack ""probably the most competent minister in the whole cabinet"". James added she suspected it was ""active vengeance for what happened three years ago"". In 2016, when David Cameron stepped down, Johnson dropped out of the race for the Conservative leadership bid when Gove - who had previously backed Johnson - announced his own bid. Theresa May went on to win, becoming PM. And in 2019, Gove took Johnson on again, after having previously backed him to replace May when she resigned. Matt Hancock - the former health secretary - says ""it's clear"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to resign. In an interview with ITV's Robert Peston, Hancock says it's a sad end for Johnson. He adds: ""It's clear whether it's tomorrow or next Tuesday, there's going to be a new prime minister"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Police have been giving updates on a man held after a mass shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois They say Robert E Crimo III, 21, who is in custody, planned the shooting for several weeks and wore women's clothing to blend into the crowd He purchased his two rifles legally and fired more than 70 rounds, Chris Covelli, crime task force spokesman says The shooting appears to be completely random with no religion or race motives, he adds Two victims have been identified; The family of Nicolas Toledo, from Mexico, paid tribute to a ""loving, adventurous"" man Jacki Sundheim was described as a ""beloved"" staff member by her local synagogue They were among six people killed and more than three dozen injured It was devastating that a celebration of the US was ripped apart by a ""uniquely American plague"", Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker said US President Biden expressed shock and said he would not give up fighting the gun violence âepidemicâ Highland Park sits north of Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan Edited by Claire Heald We're closing our live coverage of the shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park near Chicago. Here are the latest developments:  For the latest updates, read our story here. Our live coverage was provided by Holly Honderich, Max Matza in the US and Alexandra Fouche and Malu Cursino in London. The debate over gun laws arises frequently in the wake of high-profile mass shootings in the US. Tuesday is the 186th day of the year, and the US has already seen 317 mass shootings in 2022. On average, they occur more than 11 times per week, according to the Gun Violence Archive organisation. A mass shooting is defined by the research group as an event in which four or more people are shot or killed, excluding the attacker. The killings in Highland Park have been the most widely-covered attack over the Independence Day weekend, but it is far from the only instance of recent fatal gun crime, which tends to rise in frequency during summer's hotter months. Also on Monday, two police officers were shot at a concert in Philadelphia, triggering panic among people who were there to watch fireworks. In Minneapolis, eight people were shot during an unofficial fireworks celebration. And in Gary, Indiana, three people were killed and seven wounded at a shooting at a holiday party in a residential neighbourhood. Less than 30 miles from Highland Park, 10 people were killed and 62 injured in shootings in Chicago - a drop over last year's total. Semi-automatic rifles, seen here, have been used in several of the country's worst recent shooting sprees This attack comes just weeks after the US Congress passed its first gun control law since 1994. The bipartisan bill came after mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde in Texas triggered lawmakers to finally act. The new law contains several provisions, including allowing the FBI to access juvenile and health records from younger gun buyers aged 18 to 20. The law does not include a provision that gun control campaigners hoped for - raising the age to buy a semi-automatic rifle to 21. Many of the most deadly mass shootings in recent history have occurred using semi-automatic rifles. But the new law comes as the Supreme Court tears down a New York state law that required people to prove a special need in order to carry a gun in public. Their ruling said that all Americans have the right under the Constitution to carry a gun outside their home. State bans on assault rifles are also expected to fall in light of the latest Supreme Court ruling. Here's a quick recap of the developments in the investigation into the Highland Park mass shooting: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot tells reporters she has been in
""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. The two mayors have known each other for three decades,
Lightfoot said, after meeting in law school. ""The minute I understood what had happened I reached out to
her [Rotering] and offered anything that I could do,"" Lightfoot says.
""Unfortunately I have a lot of experience here."" Lightfoot says she offered the support of the Chicago Police
Department, who ""sprang into action"". ""Whatever you need, we will be here for you,"" she
says.  President Joe Biden has ordered the American flag be lowered to half mast at the White House and other government buildings after Monday's shooting. ""As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of gun violence perpetrated on our Independence Day, July 4, 2022, in Highland Park, Illinois, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff,"" the president proclamation says. The flags will fly like that until 9 July. Biden made a similar proclamation just weeks ago, after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. What else did we learn during the Chicago police press conference about Monday's Highland Park attack? Officials said Robert E Crimo was dressed as a woman during the attack to hide his facial tattoos and help him escape in the crowd. The authorities also said they aimed to reveal charges against the suspect on Tuesday afternoon US time. Crime task force spokesman Chris Covelli says at this point authorities have not been able to identify any clear motive for the attack. Asked by reporters about the gunman's weapons, Covelli says Crimo used at least two rifles and pistols. All weapons examined were purchased lawfully by Crimo. Covelli adds that shooting appears to be completely random and there are no reasons to believe the attack was motivated by religion or race. We've been hearing more from the spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, Christopher Covelli. He says Crimo used his mother's car to escape the scene and blended in with the community because he concealed his identity by wearing women's clothing. Covelli adds that a second rifle was located inside Crimo's mother's car. He adds that Crimo remains in custody, and there are no indications he was acting with anyone else. Highland Park's authorities are delivering a news conference about the Fourth of July parade shooting, where six people were killed. Police say Robert E Crimo, 21, planned this attack for several weeks. Christopher Covelli, spokesman for Lake County Major Crime Task Force, says significant amount of information have been obtained from cell phone recordings and other footage. Crimo was dressed in women's clothing to conceal his identity, Covelli says. More than 70 rounds were fired from a legally purchased rifle, Covelli adds. We've heard from US President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the shootings and from the state's governor. Now its the turn of Illinois' lieutenant governor Juliana Stratton who says in atweet,external: ""Enough is enough."" Stratton echoed the governor's statement when he said gun violence was ""our uniquely American plague"". She added: ""I'm angry too. We all should be."" Highland Park's Independence Day shooting killed six people, and left at least three dozen others injured. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is speaking out about the ""horrible tragedy"" in Highland Park. Lightfoot appears with other Illinois lawmakers to discuss a bipartisan bill meant to address gun violence. ""The gun violence epidemic is deep and pervasive,"" she says. ""We saw that play out again in Highland Park yesterday."" Lightfoot says she has been in ""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. Gun violence is not just a Chicago problem, Lightfoot says. ""Gun violence knows no
borders or boundaries."" The bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, is meant to reduce gun violence nationwide. It includes enhanced background checks, a $250m (Â£205m) investment in community violence intervention and $100m for the national background check system. This video can not be played People, who had set up deck chairs in the street to watch the annual Independence Day parade, ran for safety as multiple shots rang out shortly after 1000 local time in Highland Park on 4 July. Toddlers in pushchairs, babes in arms, teenagers and the elderly fled the scene - and the gunfire - in fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones. ""He started shooting again, and we ran behind the building and I put my son in a dumpster,"" recalled one bystander. ""It was just horrible."" Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Illinois Senator Dick Durbin is here to view the remnants of the
Fourth of July parade. The Democrat looks shaken and tells me he is heart-broken
at what's happened. ""Are mass shootings now a tradition in America?"" I ask
him. ""I donât want
it to be but itâs becoming one,"" he sighs He backed recent major gun legislation aimed at addressing US gun
violence. He tells me it was an ""improvement"" but didnât go as far as
it should have. Senator Durbin says we have yet to see whether those new laws
would have stopped the gunman here. Illinois has tough gun laws but overall gun crime is high here. Republicans often point to Chicago as an example of a place
where gun control doesn't work. But some context - a report
in recent years from the city's police department has found a lot of guns come
from outside of Chicago and from neighbouring states like Kentucky and
Tennessee where the gun laws are more lax. The state of Illinois has the sixth strictest gun laws in the US,according to gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety,external. It also has the ninth lowest rate of gun ownership, according to the group. The state has universal background checks and requires firearms to be safely stored - but it does not ban assault weapons. Nancy Rotering, Highland Park's mayor, has told CNN the alleged shooter obtained his weapon legally. She criticised current gun laws, which enable individuals to lawfully purchase weapons. Rotering said: ""That being said, again, if you can have a weekly mass shooting with a legally purchased gun, then I think we need to talk about why those laws aren't protecting the very people that they're supposed to be protecting."" US President Joe Biden signed into law a landmark gun control bill in June, which aims to impose tougher checks on young buyers and encourage states to remove guns from people considered a threat. Robert Crimo, the alleged Independence Day shooter, has not yet been charged. But Rotering said she expects him to be charged today. So far, police have identified him as a ""person of interest"". Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Ken Pell is picking up his granddaughters' scooters. His wife
and family were at the parade and dumped everything for safety. ""I wasn't here, I was at a nearby golf club and got
notification of a shooting. We were then put into a basement for safety. I
couldnât get a signal and I was so panicked as I couldnât get hold of my family
for ages."" His daughter told him to leave the scooters because taking them
back ""would be bad karma"". ""I couldn't do that I wanted to collect them. My grandkids
donât seem too affected at the moment but you know my daughter is not doing
well. She is questioning raising her kids in a place like this."" The motivations of the gunman are unknown. Ken is Jewish and
says this is a predominantly Jewish area so he is worried that's why it may
have been targeted. ""We just never thought we would be hit like this but I
guess neither did Uvalde [the site of a mass school shooting]."" What does the data tell us about gun culture in the US and its impact? Here are some key charts. How many guns are there in the US? While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based leading research project - estimate that there were 390 million guns in circulation in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. How do US gun killings compare with other countries?  Nearly 53 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US, according to the official data from 2020. The data also shows that the vast majority of murders, 79%, were carried out with guns. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries Who supports gun control?  Despite widespread and vocal public outrage - often in the wake of gun violence - American support for stricter gun laws in 2020 fell to the lowest level since 2014,according to polling by Gallup,external. Only 52% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun laws, while 35% said they should remain the same. The issue is also one that is hyper-partisan - the Gallup study noted that Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans agreed with the same statement. See more key data and charts here The Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, was scheduled to include floats, marching bands, and community entertainment as part of the city's Fourth of July celebrations. But around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT) - just a few minutes after the parade had begun - a gunman who had climbed on to a roof near the parade route began shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. What should have been one of the happiest days of the year quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs left discarded on the street as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks. Police later recovered ""evidence of a firearm"" from the rooftop of a shop near to the parade route Five adults were killed at the scene, as well as a further victim who the local coroner said died in a nearby hospital. At least three dozen others were injured. At least eight victims remain in hospitals across Chicagoland (the Chicago metropolitan area) following yesterday's shooting, Jim
Anthony, spokesman for the North Shore University hospital group says. He did not provide updates on the patients' conditions. Thirty-eight patients were initially admitted for treatment after the parade, Anthony said, at three of the group's hospitals: Evanston Hospital, Glenbrook Hospital and Highland Park Hospital. ""We were able to mobilise quickly,"" Anthony said. ""Our physicians and nurses and medical support
staff train for situations like this, not that we ever want to see them in real
life."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99976176
"This video can not be played Watch: Sydney flash floods turn roads into rivers In the town of Windsor, north-west of Sydney, some roads have turned into small rivers. And the only way to get around is by boat. Mathew Benson has been rowing up and down one of the streets in a neighbourhood in the suburb of Australia's largest city. ""I'm bringing food and water to people over there,"" he tells me, pointing to the other side. ""We're just watching and waiting."" While some cars are barely visible, others are completely submerged. Many residents in the area have had to leave their homes and others are stranded as roads have been cut off. Thousands have been left without power. Matthew Benson used a rowing boat to distribute help Another local, Sam, points to her house just across the submerged road. ""We don't know about the second floor. But the first floor is definitely flooded,"" she tells me in tears. This is the second time this has happened to her this year. Her house was damaged in the floods back in March. This time, she has had to move in with her mother who now also has to evacuate. It's all been too exhausting and emotional and she breaks down. ""We just got back on our feet. We'd just cleaned up our house and fixed it up. And now thisâ¦"" she said. Sam's flooded house is on the other side of this submerged road Windsor is a close-knit community. Most of those I have spoken to have grown up in the area or have been here for at least two decades. Despite the fact that this is their third extreme flooding event in 18 months, many told me they wouldn't want to move. But you can sense that everyone is exhausted. Not just from dealing with the current crisis, but from having to deal with one disastrous weather event after another. How Australia is becoming more unliveable Australia's epic floods spur new warning systems ""Everybody is in shock. Everybody is traumatised,"" Linda Strickland tells me. She is the co-founder of local charity Hawkesbury's Helping Hands and has been helping people here for years, especially during natural disasters. I meet her on one of the streets in South Windsor where people have been stranded. Swathes of farmland now are completely covered in water. ""The community is still recovering from the last flood and the one before. Some people are still recovering from the fires,"" she said. ""Everyone is in disaster mode now. The most important thing is to make sure people are safe and have something to eat and know that someone cares."" Linda Strickland runs a local charity helping make people safe and ensure they have food Ms Strickland adds that while rebuilding will take a long time, her worry going forward is the mental and psychological toll this will take on the community. ""There needs to be someone counselling at every evacuation centre,"" she said. ""I've never seen a flood like this in the 20 years I've lived here."" The wet weather has been relentless, with parts of Sydney getting eight months' worth of rain in four days. The newly-built Windsor bridge, which was supposed to be flood resistant, is hardly visible as the water continues to rise. Submerged road signs on Monday along the Hawkesbury river in Windsor, near Sydney Stuart Reed, 55, has lived in Windsor all his life and said this is unprecedented. ""It just seems to be happening a lot more often,"" he said. ""Apart from the trauma that this causes it's financially crippling as well. I just walked through town here and half the shops are shut."" The New South Wales state Premier Dominic Perrottet has said it is time to let go of the idea that floods like this happen ""once in a century"" after some regions experienced their fourth deluge in less than two years. Sydney's main dam has been over-spilling through the night and the authorities have warned of more flood risks. Chloe Neich and her family had to evacuate in a hurry - and don't know how their house will be when they return ""It's crazy being told you have to leave your home and just grab what you can,"" Chloe Neich said. This is the first time she's had to evacuate. ""A lot of stuff has been left behind and we don't really know what we're going back to. We're just hoping that our house is safe. And that we can get back to normal."" I ask what normal is for her? ""Not flooding,"" she smiles. ""Kids out in the sun and park. Not worrying about whether they have a house.""

"Overall standards in reading, writing and maths have slipped among Year 6 pupils in England since the pandemic, according to Sats results. They show 59% of pupils met the expected level in these combined areas this year, down from 65% in 2019. The national curriculum tests were cancelled in 2020 and 2021. The government says the Sats results were ""expected due to the impact of the pandemic"" and that there is ""more work to do"" to help pupils catch up. By 2030, it wants 90% of children leaving primary school to reach the expected standards in reading, writing and maths. Unions have called for further investment in schools and teaching staff in order to achieve that target. The pupils who took Sats this summer - mostly 11-year-olds - were part-way through Year 4 when schools first closed to most children in March 2020. Further school closures followed while they were in Year 5, and many pupilsalso experienced disruption due to Covid at the beginning of Year 6. Pupils expected to do better in maths and English Covid fuels deepening education inequalities - MPs Pupils fell behind again in second lockdown Results from individual subjects suggest that reading levels increased slightly - with 74% of pupils meeting the expected standard, up from 73% in 2019. But the proportion of pupils reaching the expected level has fallen in all other subjects since 2019: 71% in maths, down from 79% 69% in writing, down from 78% 72% in grammar, punctuation and spelling, down from 78% 79% in science, down from 83% Minister for School Standards, Robin Walker, said of this year's results: ""While this is disappointing, it was expected due to the impact of the pandemic. ""The government recognises, and values, the work that teachers up and down the country are putting into education recovery, but also understands that there is more work to do."" He added that Â£5bn has been allocated to help pupils catch up, and that children falling behind in English and maths would ""receive the right evidence-based targeted support to get them back on track"". The government's recovery fund falls far shortof what education unions and the former catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, said was required - around Â£15bn. Cash to arrange catch-up tutoring will go directly to schools in England in the coming academic year, after the governmentaxed its contract with tutoring supplier Randstad. The amount of learning disrupted because of Covid varies significantly across England, and the poorest pupils have fallen further behind than the better-off, according toa report for the governmentby the Education Policy Institute and Renaissance. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, expressed caution about this year's Sats data because ""some families and school communities [were] hit far harder than others"" by the pandemic. ""It's important to remember that the support schools have put in place has not only been focused on academic progress, but also on social and emotional recovery too,"" he said. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the fall in maths and writing standards reflected ""the huge importance of direct classroom teaching in these subjects - which has, of course, been heavily disrupted"". He said the government's 2030 targets would ""require substantial investment in schools and the teaching workforce"". He added that it was ""hard to see how this can possibly be achieved"" under current plans. Stephen Morgan, Labour's shadow schools minister, said: ""While school staff have worked hard to mitigate the pandemic's impact, the government's decision to short-change post-pandemic support threatens to cast a long shadow over opportunity and attainment for children.""

He added that it was ""hard to see how this can possibly be achieved"" under current plans. Stephen Morgan, Labour's shadow schools minister, said: ""While school staff have worked hard to mitigate the pandemic's impact, the government's decision to short-change post-pandemic support threatens to cast a long shadow over opportunity and attainment for children.""

"The economic outlook for the UK and the rest of the world has ""deteriorated materially"", the Bank of England has warned. Energy and fuel costs are rising rapidly around the world, pushing up prices in general more quickly. However, UK banks are in a position to weather even a severe economic downturn, the Bank said. It told banks to keep more money in rainy day funds to ensure they can weather any storm. The Bank's comments came in its latest Financial Stability Report. International forecasters such as the IMF and OECD have said Britain is more susceptible to recession and persistently high inflation than other Western countries, all of which are grappling with energy and commodity market shocks. Why is the UK economy suffering more than other countries? While the Bank said the UK's banking sector was well-placed to cope with a severe downturn, it said banks must increase the amount of money they set aside to absorb shocks. Starting a year from now, banks will be required to set aside a sum equal to 2% of their assets as a buffer, as opposed to the normal 1%. The Financial Policy Committee said it could vary the rate in either direction depending on how the global economy pans out. Households have come under increasing pressure in recent months, as energy, food and fuel prices soar. In April, domestic energy bills jumped after the price cap was increased by 54% to Â£1,971 for the average household. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Experts believe this could rise again in October, to around Â£2,800, which could help to push inflation up to more than 11% later this year. ""Commodity price volatility following the Russian invasion of Ukraine has further exacerbated price pressures facing households and businesses, and has had implications for the financial system,"" the Bank said. Some households could struggle with debt. About 80% of mortgages are currently on fixed interest rates, but some 40% of these are set for renewal this year or next, which could push up costs for these households. ""Tighter financial conditions and reduced real incomes will weigh on debt affordability for households, businesses and governments in many countries, increasing the risks from global debt vulnerabilities,"" the Bank said. However, despite increasing pressure on household budgets, the Bank said financial institutions were resilient to debt vulnerabilities among households and businesses. The pound also lowered 1.6% against the dollar and hit a two-year low on Tuesday. Another surge in gas prices in Europe and the UK which could push inflation higher again, has added to fears the economy could slide into a recession. It says something about the lengths that have been gone to over the past 15 years to shore up the resilience of the banking system that it looks, according to this report, comfortably able to withstand not only the biggest economic contraction in 300 years over the pandemic, but also stagflation and the highest inflation in four decades. It's more households and small firms, rather than the financial sector, that are vulnerable at the moment. The Financial Policy Committee said that households' debts haven't shot up - yet - in response to the cost of living crisis, and it also takes the view that the proportion of households who spend a large portion of their incomes on servicing debts will remain manageable, in spite of rising interest rates, because of the package of help from the government. Its members are similarly sanguine about the effect on small businesses, acknowledging they could be hit by falling demand from households with declining real incomes, but forecasting that it would ""take large increases in borrowing costs"" to impair their ability to service their debts. Let's hope the committee's optimism isn't misplaced. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Bank's verdict seems to be that ""the situation isn't as quite as bad as previous crises"". ""Consumers might be coping with the biggest hikes in prices in four decades but compared to the months before the 2008 financial crisis hit, households aren't as likely to dig themselves deeper into more debt,"" she said. ""The escalating cost-of-living crisis is so stark that the government has already moved to pledge more support to those on lower incomes facing sky-high energy bills."" She added that the Bank ""expects businesses on the whole to struggle on"". While many firms were struggling with supply chain challenges and weakening consumer demand, ""overall it's going to take a much larger shock to see a domino collapse of companies unable to pay their debts"", Ms Streeter added.

"Father-of-two Jermaine Baker was shot in Bracknell Close, near Wood Green Crown Court A Metropolitan Police operation that led to an officer fatally shooting an unarmed man in north London was lawful but there were failings at almost every stage, an inquiry has found. Jermaine Baker, 28, was shot during a foiled attempt to free an inmate from a prison van near Wood Green Crown Court in 2015. No live firearm was found inside the car in which Mr Baker was killed. But Judge Clement Goldstone QC said race was not a factor in the shooting. Mr Baker's mother, Margaret Smith, rejected the conclusion her son did not die as a result of police failings, saying they meant her son was ""dead before he got in the car"". Speaking after the findings were published, Mr Baker's mother said: ""The judge has pointed out numerous, really serious failings by the Met. ""Running the risk that my son's life would be taken was never justified,"" Ms Smith said. ""I cannot agree with the judge's conclusion that Jermaine did not die as a result of these failures, that is a conclusion I cannot understand. ""After seven years of waiting... we deserve more."" The Met Police said it would take time to carefully study the inquiry's conclusions. Mr Baker was one of three men waiting in a stolen Audi to break out inmate Izzet Eren, a senior member of the notorious Tottenham Turks gang. An imitation firearm, an Uzi, was later found in the rear of the car. The inquiry heard officers had intelligence that the group had been unable to obtain a real gun, but this information was not passed on to the firearms team who confronted the men. Mr Baker may also have been asleep at the time he was shot and may have misunderstood contradictory instructions shouted by armed officers who challenged the men in the Audi, the inquiry was told. It also heard officers failed to consider any possible outcome other than an armed stop, and had not properly assessed the risk posed by Eren's cousin, Ozcan Eren, who was behind the escape plot. The police force also failed to engage with the Prison Service about Eren's escape risk or tell prison van staff of the planned jail break. Failures to keep notes of meetings showed ""an arrogant, dismissive attitude towards formality and a failure to appreciate the importance of accountability and maintaining an audit trail"", the inquiry found. The inquiry chairman concluded race was not a factor in the shooting of Jermaine Baker Judge Goldstone said the police failings should ""serve as a loud wake-up call"" to the nextMet Police Commissioner, following the resignation of Dame Cressida Dick earlier this year. However, he noted that when the firearms officer shot the father of two, he had ""held an honest and genuine belief that Mr Baker was moving in order to reach for the firearm"". He also said he ""found no evidence to support a finding that race played any part in Mr Baker's death"". Ms Smith said her son was ""no angel"", but he ""should have gone to prison"" rather than be shot dead. She had called on the inquiry chairman to consider whether her son being black could have been a factor in him being killed. Jermaine Baker died when he was shot by the Met marksman, known only as W80, near Wood Green Crown Court The inquiry heard that a police bug in the car had captured a wall of noise, with some officers telling the group to raise their hands. But the officer who fired the fatal shot, known only as W80, said he had instructed Mr Baker to put his hands on the dashboard. W80 told the inquiry he was convinced the men would be armed and would fight their way out rather than surrender when challenged by armed police. In his findings, Judge Goldstone said W80's ""overall credibility"" as a witness ""remained largely intact"". But, detailing the various failures, he said public safety should have been, but was not, the primary objective of the operation. He also described the operation's idea of ridding the streets of north London of lethal firearms as ""delusional"". Botched police operation led to man's fatal shooting' CPS confirms no charges after review In a statement, the Met Police said it had made changes to how its firearms officers operated in London, including through training and supporting officers. A spokeswoman added: ""We are always open to improving our capability to tackle the threat of firearms."" The Crown Prosecution Service decided not to bring criminal charges against W80 in 2017. The officerhas been involved in a legal battle over whether he should face misconduct proceedings. Follow BBC London onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Ivan Skyba Taxi driver and father of four, Ivan Skyba, found himself defending a suburban street at the start of the war. He narrowly avoided death at the hands of the Russians. All the other Ukrainian men with him were not so lucky. Prosecutors are treating what happened in the small city of Bucha as a war crime. Fergal Keane has been to meet Ivan, the sole survivor. There is the urge to breathe out. Just one big exhalation to relieve the pressure. But Ivan knows it will be the death of him if he does. The temperature is just above freezing. Warm breath rising into cold air will create a small fog and alert the killers. They are already checking the bodies of the men they have just shot, making sure, firing a final bullet where they see any sign of life. He hears one of the Russians say: ""That one is still alive!"" Ivan wonders if they are talking about him? Maybe it is one of the others. Still, he prepares himself for the bullet. He is already bleeding from a wound in his side. The other Russian says: ""He will die by himself!"" But then there is a shot. It strikes somebody else. A man fights different urges in such moments. The bullet wound in his side is agonisingly painful. But crying out would be fatal. All of this will come back later in dreams. But for now, he will lie among the dead. He will be as still as his murdered comrades. I meet Ivan Skyba in a small village in rural Poland where he has found shelter for his family. He has a job. The kids are living in a place without fear. The warm weather has arrived and in the evenings the family walk to a local park where Ivan fishes in the lake. The bruises on his face and body have healed. But at night, after everybody else is asleep, the wounds of memory are open. Ivan Skyba is the man who came back from the dead. When it all started in the early hours of 24 February, Ivan was driving his taxi in Kyiv. He heard explosions. Ivan struggled to believe it was actually happening. ""I didn't imagine it coming,"" he says. The dispatcher called and said all taxis were to return to base. Forty-three year old Ivan had been doing whatever work he could find to support his wife and four children. He drove the cab and sometimes worked as a building renovator. His first thought that morning was to get the family's identification documents. If they were going to have to flee, they needed passports. He quickly drove the 40km towards Brovary where they lived - and from there to Bucha where his wife and children were visiting her mother. That was where the family would stay until they could make a plan. ""Different rumours were circulating that [the Russians] were approaching Bucha. We started arranging shelters in the cellars, bringing things there."" Ivan (l) with his friend Svyatoslav Turovsky and Ivan's daughter Zlata Three days later, on 27 February, the Russians arrived nearby. Almost immediately they suffered a devastating ambush by Ukrainian artillery. A column of Russian airborne troops had taken up position on Vokzalna Street when the shells came screaming in. They retreated temporarily. But they were angry, convinced some locals had told the Ukrainian military of their location. By now, across Ukraine, people were mobilising to defend their communities. Bucha was no exception. Ivan Skyba and his friend, Svyatoslav Turovsky, the godfather to his two-year-old daughter Zlata, heard that some men who had fought in the eastern Donbas region against the Russian-backed separatists were forming in Bucha a unit of Ukraine's Territorial Defence Force, a militia to protect local communities in time of war. The two men joined up. ""We were doing duty at checkpoints, checking documents and making sure people didn't carry arms,"" says Ivan. ""We were helping to organise people's safe passage out because we knew the area."" Ivan's unit was poorly armed. They had one rifle, a grenade and a pair of binoculars to share among nine men. He and his comrades worked shifts on a checkpoint on Yablunska Street. In Ukrainian it means ""the street of the apples"", because of the trees that line much of its nearly 6km length. In peacetime, it is a pleasant place with a lake for fishing. Some of the houses back on to fields and orchards. It is also the site of an old office complex, built in the Soviet era, part of which has been transformed into workspaces for local businesses. These quarters at 144 Yablunska Street would become a Russian base notorious in the story of the war's brutality. By early March, Ukrainians were fleeing the country in their hundreds of thousands. Ivan and his wife decided the family should try to shelter in Bucha for the time being. He describes the atmosphere among the men as one of defiance. ""There was no fear. No fear. There was a desire to unite, to get together. We were on our feet all the time. When we were off duty, we would distribute food around cellars to those who were taking shelter there, the women and children. There was no time to be afraid."" That changed dramatically on 3 March. The Russians returned in force ""in the second half of the day, around lunchtime"". Immediately, Ivan and the others began directing cars away from the direction of the Russian advance. There was indiscriminate firing. Rockets were landing. He saw a white Renault being struck and a woman and her children trapped inside the burning car. There were eight men at Ivan's checkpoint and with the Russians rapidly approaching they decided to try to hide. Directly opposite the checkpoint, at number 31 Yablunska Street, was Valera Kotenko's house. The 53-year-old had given them hot drinks and food. He offered shelter now. Soon the Russians were outside. Ivan at the checkpoint outside 31 Yablunska Street ""We could hear them and the movement of their equipment. We were surrounded,"" says Ivan. The men whispered to each other. They could not run. The Russians had thermal imaging detectors that would surely pick up any attempt to escape at night. The men had already ditched their few weapons and now decided on a cover story - if the Russians found them they would say they were builders working in the district and had been sheltering from the fighting. They texted wives and girlfriends. One of the men, Anatoliy Prykhidko, aged 39, called his wife Olha that evening - 3 March - and whispered ""that he couldn't speak because he could be heard. It was so quiet. He said they were in hiding."" The following morning, Yulia, the wife of Andriy Dvornikov, a delivery driver, received a message saying: ""We have been encircled, we are sitting here, but I will be getting away from here as soon as there is an opportunity."" He told her to delete all messages and photographs from her phone. And he told her that he loved her. ""At 10am, [Anatoliy] sent me a message saying 'we are still sitting tight.' That was his last message,"" says Olha Prykhidko With tears streaming down her face, Olha Prykhidko, tells me of her last communication from Anatoliy on the morning of 4 March: ""At 10:00, he sent me a message saying 'we are still sitting tight.' That was his last message."" Less than an hour later the Russians broke in. Ivan Skyba remembers beatings and shouted questions. Mobile phones and shoes were confiscated. By 11:00 two different sets of CCTV images captured the men being led across and then down Yablunska Street towards number 144. Each had one hand on the belt of the man in front and the other on their own head. They were lined up against a wall next to the Russian base and made to kneel. The Russians forced their shirts and sweaters over their heads so that they could not see . They were beaten with rifle butts and verbally abused. According to Ivan they shouted: ""You are the Bandera fighters (an anti-Soviet nationalist group in World War Two). You wanted to burn us with Molotov cocktails! We'll burn you alive now!"" This video can not be played CCTV shows the men being marched at gunpoint to the location where they were killed Ivan says the Russians decided to intimidate the others by shooting 28-year-old Vitaliy Karpenko, a worker at a co-operative store. After this, a younger man in the group panicked and told the Russians that all of them belonged to the Territorial Defence Unit. The beatings intensified. Ivan Skyba and another man, Andriy Verbovyi, a father of one and a woodworker, were brought into the building. In the interrogation that followed, Ivan had a bucket placed over his head and was made to bend and lean against the wall. Bricks were piled, one after the other on his back, until he collapsed. He was beaten again and a brick was repeatedly smashed against the bucket. At some point he heard the police tell Andriy Verbovyi that they would shoot him in the foot. There was a shot. After that he didn't hear Andriy any more. Ivan was then led back out of the building to join the other men. Some of what took place was witnessed by local residents who were ordered to gather by the Russians in front of number 144, but kept separate from the arrested men. Lucy Moskalenko remembers a Russian officer telling her to cover her daughters' eyes because they would see things they would never forget. ""He told us, 'Don't look at those people lying on the ground. They are not humans. They are absolute dirt. Dirt. They are not human. They are beasts.'"" Her sister, Irina Volynets, had accompanied Lucy. Both recall the noise of the Russian armoured vehicles, the sound of shelling, and how the dogs of the neighbourhood were fighting with each other. It was as if a madness had descended on the place. Then Irina had a shock. She saw that her old classmate, Andriy Verbovyi, the boy who had sat beside her from kindergarten, and all the way up through school, was lying bleeding on the ground. Only a few weeks before, they had walked home from the shopping centre together. There was a sheet thrown on the ground near him. ""He was lying there, all twisted from cold. He was looking straight at me. We looked into each other's eyes,"" she says. Irina wanted to go and cover her old friend with the sheet, anything that might make him warmer. But she did not. ""Was she too afraid?"" I ask. ""It was not so much fear as despair,"" she replies, ""and I was really confused at the time, and couldn't seem to grasp how it happened, and why my classmate was lying there on the ground."" Everything was happening so fast. Besides, she had just seen that her son Slavyk was among the line of men. He had been captured separately and beaten, before being brought to join the others. Waiting in the line Slavyk saw blood on the ground nearby, and heard the Russians talking about a wounded man. This was almost certainly Andriy Verbovyi. ""I heard them talk among themselves to finish him off because he wouldn't make it,"" recalls Slavyk. He began to fear for his own life. Irina found an officer and pleaded for Slavyk's life. The soldier listened. Then he called over a Ukrainian informer - possibly the arrested man who had cracked after the shooting of Vitaliy Karpenko - and asked him: ""Is he one of them?"" ""No,"" came the reply. Slavyk was released to his mother. The residents were told to go home, but Irina remembers an ominous feeling as she left. ""I was afraid horrible things would happen."" On the following day, 5 March, Andriy Verbovyi's wife, Natalya, sent him a message. ""Where are you? Your [good luck] chain is with me, the amulet as well. I am protecting you from all bad things. We are praying for you. We are waiting for your call. Write us at least two words."" By then, Andriy was dead. Ivan Skyba sensed time was running out. By late afternoon on 4 March, two of the eight men captured with him had been shot dead. ""The Russians started talking between themselves as to what they would do with us. The conversation was as follows: 'What shall we do with them?' The second man says, 'Finish them off, but just take them out, so that they wouldn't be lying here.'"" The remaining men were led around the corner into a small courtyard. From under the edge of his clothing Ivan saw the body of a man lying on a small concrete platform. He had clearly been shot earlier. The Russians began taunting their victims. ""They were enjoying the execution, using swear words, saying, ""That's it. It's kapooey (death) for you!"" Ivan recalls a final exchange of words with his comrades. ""We said goodbye to each other. That was it."" Among those to whom he bade farewell was Svyatoslav Turovsky, the godfather of his daughter. According to Ivan, Anatoliy Prykhidko suddenly decided to make a run for it but was shot straight away. Then the Russians opened fire on the others. ""I felt a bullet go into my side,"" Ivan remembers. ""It wounded me and I fell."" Ivan Skyba's bruised face and bullet wounds on his torso Ivan cannot remember exactly how long the Russians stayed, but it was more like minutes than hours. When he sensed they were gone he risked a glance from under his jacket. The courtyard was empty of life. Now was his chance. He reached out towards a pair of feet near him - those of the dead man he had noticed when they first entered the courtyard. He pulled off the man's shoes to put on his own exposed feet. He then crawled to a fence and dragged himself across into nearby gardens. There was another fence to cross before he made it into a house abandoned by its owners during the shelling. What followed was another terrifying ordeal. Inside the house, Ivan treated his wound with some antiseptic liquid he found in the bathroom and changed into clothes left behind by the householder. He wrapped himself in a blanket and tried to sleep. But he was disturbed by voices. Russian voices. It turned out that several Russian soldiers were also resting in the house. ""They saw me and started asking me who I was and what I was doing there."" He persuaded them that he was the owner of the house and that his family had been evacuated. His wounds, he explained, were the result of shelling. The soldiers believed his story but they told him he couldn't stay where he was. Instead, they said they would take him to their base for medical treatment. Back at 144 Yablunska Street. ""I was terrified what would happen next - from one captivity into another."" But Ivan's luck held. At the base, combat medics treated his wounds. If the troops who shot him were still around, they either did not see him return, or did not recognise him. He was placed with civilians sheltering in the bunker of the building. After several days, they were allowed to leave. The bodies of the murdered men who had been defending Bucha with Ivan were left lying in the courtyard, where the Russians dumped rubbish, for the remaining month of the occupation. Ivan found his family, still sheltering from the war, at home. They were able to flee Bucha, and eventually Ukraine into Poland, but not the legacy of the terrible hours at 144 Yablunska. The office building at 144 Yablunska Street where the killings happened Military defeat forced the retreat. Harried by Ukrainian forces the Russians pulled out of Bucha on 31 March and headed north to the border with Belarus. The invaders left behind numerous traces of their presence. From the banal - obscene graffiti scrawled on the walls - to the potentially significant. We found a soldier's military-issued debit card on the floor of 144 Yablunska, and traced him to Pskov in north-western Russia, a major base for airborne forces. Other journalists found evidence leading to the same units - the 104th and 234th Airborne Assault regiments. A Bucha resident found Ivan Skyba's mobile phone, left behind by the Russians as they retreated. It contained records of calls made to several numbers in Russia. The records don't link any of the callers directly to the massacre. The phone might easily have been passed around among a large group of soldiers. But the call records could help narrow down the search for perpetrators to smaller units within the regiments present when Ivan and the others were shot. Bucha satellite image contradicts Russian claims Collecting the dead in Bucha The killings at 144 Yablunska Street and elsewhere in Bucha are the focus of a huge war crimes investigation by the International Criminal Court and Ukraine. The Ukrainian investigation is led by a police lawyer who, until recently, was best known for investigating cases of brutality within the country's police force. Walking me around the crime scene, Yuriy Belousov is hopeful the perpetrators will ultimately face justice. ""These Russian soldiers who have committed this crime, they could be captured somewhere,"" he says, pointing to the recent trial of a Russian prisoner of war accused of murdering a civilian near Kyiv. But the big targets of the investigation are President Putin and the Russian military and political elite. ""It was planned in advance,"" Mr Belousov says. ""It was instructed from the top how to behave. So the suspects would be top of the top, the guys who actually launch the war, let's say. It's like a chain of people whose decisions led to the invasion of Ukraine."" Barring a change of regime in Moscow, any imminent prosecution seems highly unlikely. Ivan Skyba with Fergal Keane in Poland If there are prosecutions, Ivan Skyba will be a vital witness. For now, he works with the Polish man who has given the family shelter. The Russians seem physically far away. But there is the terror that comes at night. ""You wake up because you are anticipating that shot in your head. I have this feeling. It comes like a wave."" When we walk to a nearby lake in the evening, I notice that a teenaged boy has joined the family group. He plays with Ivan's son who is just a few years younger. Ivan tells me that the teenager is the child of his murdered friend and godfather to his daughter, Svyatoslav Turovsky. The boy and his mother moved to Poland with the Skyba family. It is a perfect early summer's evening - the boys fishing, Ivan leaning against a tree and looking on, his wife shepherding their young daughter away from the water's edge. But for Ivan and his family, for their friends the Turovskyis, for all the families of the men of 144 Yablunska, Russia's invasion and the massacre it unleashed has changed everything. I remember the words of Olha Prykhidko, whose husband Anatoliy tried to run for his life, and whose grave she visits every day with two cups of coffee, one for him and one for her.  ""When no-one can hear me,"" she says, ""I call him by his name."" Day after day she calls to him, from silence to silence, into the emptiness made by war.

"Widespread flooding has hit Australia several times this year About 50,000 people have been urged to evacuate their homes as floods hit Australia's largest city for the third time this year. Parts of Sydney have received about eight months of rain in four days. Roads have been cut off, some houses are under water and thousands have been left without power. Widespread flooding across Australia - driven by a La NiÃ±a weather pattern - has killed more than 20 people this year, many in New South Wales (NSW). More than 100 evacuation orders have been issued across Greater Sydney for the current emergency. People in another 50 areas have been warned to prepare to leave, as several major rivers flood. Severe weather is also hitting the nearby Hunter and Illawarra regions. Some areas of NSW have seen 800mm of rain in four days, says the Bureau of Meteorology, almost a third more than the average rainfall Greater London receives in a year. The downpour is expected to begin easing in Sydney on Tuesday, but gale-force winds are also forecast, bringing a risk of falling trees and powerlines. ""The emergency is far from over,"" NSW Emergency Services Minister Stephanie Cooke said.

How Australia is becoming more unliveable How is extreme weather connected to climate change? A really simple guide to climate change Speaking after evacuating his partner from their house by kayak, Tyler Cassel said locals were tired of the constant threat to their homes and lives. He moved into his home in the Sydney suburb of Windsor last year, and was told major flood events were supposed to be ""one in 25 years, one in 50 years or whatever it was"". ""Now it has been three in 2022,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""We've become experts around this area now... you are almost living on the edge."" Experts say the flooding emergency has been worsened by climate change and a La NiÃ±a weather phenomenon. A La NiÃ±a develops when strong winds blow the warm surface waters of the Pacific away from South America and towards Indonesia. In their place, colder waters come up to the surface. In Australia, a La NiÃ±a increases the likelihood of rain, cyclones and cooler daytime temperatures.

"Take two: the royal couple were shown around the new BBC Wales building, which will be open for guided tours to the public The Prince of Wales has voiced concern that the climate crisis gets too little coverage during weather reporting. Prince Charles aired his views during a visit with the Duchess of Cornwall to BBC Cymru Wales' new headquarters atCardiff Central Square. The visit began with a tour of the broadcast centre, including the new television studios. He told weather presenter Derek Brockway he was ""frustrated"" not enough of the climate crisis was incorporated. Prince Charles chatting with weather presenters Derek Brockway and Sabrina Lee ""It's about time some mention was made why it's so critical,"" said Charles. Prince Charles: We must learn from indigenous people on climate change Charles: I understand climate activists' anger ""We try and build it in,"" Derek said. His fellow weather presenter Sabrina Lee explained how she did a mini-series for the COP26 climate conference ""talking about the climate change stripes (a form of warning system) in Wales to see how the temperature has changed since 1850. ""Last summer Wales had its first extreme heat warning and we tried to investigate whether climate change played a part in this,"" she added. Derek told the prince his interest in the weather started in 1976 when he decided he wanted to be a meteorologist. The royal couple were welcomed to the new BBC Cymru Wales headquarters in central Cardiff ""I'm always intrigued watching the local weather,"" Prince Charles said in response. Charles'sinterest in environmental issues is well known, and he said earlier this year that time was ""rapidly running out"" to deal with climate change and biodiversity loss. The prince visited the studios and chatted with presenters and other staff The prince also met members of the BBC's centre of excellence for climate and science journalism, which is moving from London to Cardiff. ""Are you covering the remarkable advances and innovative approaches to energy?"" the prince asked. BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt replied that wind generation is ""getting better"" with the Crown Estatethis week announcinga tendering process for floating wind turbines ""As long as they're not sailing into my boat,"" Prince Charles said with a smile. ""I hope there's a bit of tethering."" Prince Charles met members of the BBC's climate and science team There was also a meeting with cafeteria staff, including 61-year-old cook Robert Jones, who said as he shook hands with the prince: ""It's my birthday today so thanks for making the effort"" ""Shouldn't you have a day off?"" Charles shot back. ""No, this was much more important,"" Mr Jones replied. Prince Charles shares a joke with BBC cafeteria staff Prince Charles and Camilla were greeted in the foyer of BBC Central Square by the choir from Mount Stuart Primary School in Cardiff. The royal couple's visit continued with avisit to the Betty Campbell statue, near the BBC building. It is Wales' first monument to a named, non-fictional woman in an outdoor space. Large crowds welcomed the royal couple to the new BBC Cymru Wales building She was head teacher of Mount Stuart school, Wales' first black head, and a black history campaigner. Betty's son, Antony Campbell said his family was ""very proud"" to have the royals visiting the monument. ""[My mum] probably would have said don't make a fuss,"" he said. ""For Prince Charles to come and have a look at it, that's incredible."" Camilla and Prince Charles visited a new monument to Betty Campbell in Cardiff They also have an engagement with the 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards in Cardiff and will host an evening of music and drama at their residence in Llandovery, Carmarthenshire.

"The economic outlook for the UK and the rest of the world has ""deteriorated materially"", the Bank of England has warned. Energy and fuel costs are rising rapidly around the world, pushing up prices in general more quickly. However, UK banks are in a position to weather even a severe economic downturn, the Bank said. It told banks to keep more money in rainy day funds to ensure they can weather any storm. The Bank's comments came in its latest Financial Stability Report. International forecasters such as the IMF and OECD have said Britain is more susceptible to recession and persistently high inflation than other Western countries, all of which are grappling with energy and commodity market shocks. Why is the UK economy suffering more than other countries? While the Bank said the UK's banking sector was well-placed to cope with a severe downturn, it said banks must increase the amount of money they set aside to absorb shocks. Starting a year from now, banks will be required to set aside a sum equal to 2% of their assets as a buffer, as opposed to the normal 1%. The Financial Policy Committee said it could vary the rate in either direction depending on how the global economy pans out. Households have come under increasing pressure in recent months, as energy, food and fuel prices soar. In April, domestic energy bills jumped after the price cap was increased by 54% to Â£1,971 for the average household. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Experts believe this could rise again in October, to around Â£2,800, which could help to push inflation up to more than 11% later this year. ""Commodity price volatility following the Russian invasion of Ukraine has further exacerbated price pressures facing households and businesses, and has had implications for the financial system,"" the Bank said. Some households could struggle with debt. About 80% of mortgages are currently on fixed interest rates, but some 40% of these are set for renewal this year or next, which could push up costs for these households. ""Tighter financial conditions and reduced real incomes will weigh on debt affordability for households, businesses and governments in many countries, increasing the risks from global debt vulnerabilities,"" the Bank said. However, despite increasing pressure on household budgets, the Bank said financial institutions were resilient to debt vulnerabilities among households and businesses. The pound also lowered 1.6% against the dollar and hit a two-year low on Tuesday. Another surge in gas prices in Europe and the UK which could push inflation higher again, has added to fears the economy could slide into a recession. It says something about the lengths that have been gone to over the past 15 years to shore up the resilience of the banking system that it looks, according to this report, comfortably able to withstand not only the biggest economic contraction in 300 years over the pandemic, but also stagflation and the highest inflation in four decades. It's more households and small firms, rather than the financial sector, that are vulnerable at the moment. The Financial Policy Committee said that households' debts haven't shot up - yet - in response to the cost of living crisis, and it also takes the view that the proportion of households who spend a large portion of their incomes on servicing debts will remain manageable, in spite of rising interest rates, because of the package of help from the government. Its members are similarly sanguine about the effect on small businesses, acknowledging they could be hit by falling demand from households with declining real incomes, but forecasting that it would ""take large increases in borrowing costs"" to impair their ability to service their debts. Let's hope the committee's optimism isn't misplaced. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Bank's verdict seems to be that ""the situation isn't as quite as bad as previous crises"". ""Consumers might be coping with the biggest hikes in prices in four decades but compared to the months before the 2008 financial crisis hit, households aren't as likely to dig themselves deeper into more debt,"" she said. ""The escalating cost-of-living crisis is so stark that the government has already moved to pledge more support to those on lower incomes facing sky-high energy bills."" She added that the Bank ""expects businesses on the whole to struggle on"". While many firms were struggling with supply chain challenges and weakening consumer demand, ""overall it's going to take a much larger shock to see a domino collapse of companies unable to pay their debts"", Ms Streeter added.

"This video can not be played WATCH: People run for safety during a mass shooting at a US Independence Day parade US police have arrested a suspect after six people were killed in a shooting attack on an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois. Robert E Crimo III, 22, was detained after a brief chase, police said. The gunman climbed on to a roof, shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. It is the latest mass shooting to hit the US - there has been one in every week of 2022. President Joe Biden said he was ""shocked"" by the violence. Mr Crimo was detained after a manhunt. He was referred to as a ""person of interest"" in Monday's shooting, but after his arrest police said they believed he was responsible. The gunman began firing at members of the public from the rooftop of a shop at around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT), just a few minutes after the parade began. Tributes paid to victims of 4 July shooting What should have been a day of celebration quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs abandoned as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks or a car backfiring. One man, who was having breakfast at a nearby Starbucks when the shooting happened, told the BBC that 30 people came running into the coffee shop looking for cover. But they all had to be evacuated because they thought the gunman was trying to get in through the back door. Five adults were killed at the scene and one died later in hospital. At least two dozen others were injured. One of those who died has been named as Nicolas Toledo, a man in his late 70s, who was only there because he requires full-time care and his family did not want to miss the event. ""What was supposed to be a fun family day turned into a horrific nightmare for us all,"" his granddaughter Xochil Toledo wrote on GoFundMe. ""As a family we are broken, and numb. Our condolences go out to all the other families who lost a love one today."" Another victim of the shooting has been named as Jacki Sundheim, who was described by her local synagogue as a ""beloved"" member who taught and worshipped there. ""There are no words sufficient to express the depth of our grief for Jacki's death and sympathy for her family and loved ones,""a statement,externalby North Shore Congregation Israel synagogue said. The suspect has been named as Robert E Crimo III No charges have been filed against Mr Crimo and there is no indication of any motive. Social media firms suspended accounts apparently belonging to Mr Crimo, who posted rap videos under an alias as well as videos depicting shootings, gun violence and other violent themes. He also posted pictures of himself draped in a Donald Trump flag and a video of him greeting Mr Trump's motorcade at an airport. The attack in Highland Park comes just a month after deadly shootings in Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, New York. The the Gun Violence Archive, a group tracking gun violence incidents across the US, says there have been almost 250 mass shootings in 2022 alone - defining these as incidents where at least four people are shot. Illinois Governor Jay Robert Pritzker warned that mass shootings were becoming an ""American tradition"". ""There are going to be people who are going to say that today is not the day, that now is not the time to talk about guns. I'm telling you there is no better day and no better time then right here and right now,"" the Democratic governor said. President Biden vowed to keep fighting ""the epidemic of gun violence"" in the country. ""I'm not going to give up,"" he said, speaking outside the White House in Washington. Last week, the president signed the first significant federal bill on gun safety in nearly 30 years. It imposes tougher checks on young buyers and encourages states to remove guns from people considered a threat - but critics say the measures don't go far enough. Were you at the parade?

Pritzker said US President Biden expressed shock and said he would not give up fighting the gun violence âepidemicâ Highland Park sits north of Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan Edited by Claire Heald We're closing our live coverage of the shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park near Chicago. Here are the latest developments:  For the latest updates, read our story here. Our live coverage was provided by Holly Honderich, Max Matza in the US and Alexandra Fouche and Malu Cursino in London. The debate over gun laws arises frequently in the wake of high-profile mass shootings in the US. Tuesday is the 186th day of the year, and the US has already seen 317 mass shootings in 2022. On average, they occur more than 11 times per week, according to the Gun Violence Archive organisation. A mass shooting is defined by the research group as an event in which four or more people are shot or killed, excluding the attacker. The killings in Highland Park have been the most widely-covered attack over the Independence Day weekend, but it is far from the only instance of recent fatal gun crime, which tends to rise in frequency during summer's hotter months. Also on Monday, two police officers were shot at a concert in Philadelphia, triggering panic among people who were there to watch fireworks. In Minneapolis, eight people were shot during an unofficial fireworks celebration. And in Gary, Indiana, three people were killed and seven wounded at a shooting at a holiday party in a residential neighbourhood. Less than 30 miles from Highland Park, 10 people were killed and 62 injured in shootings in Chicago - a drop over last year's total. Semi-automatic rifles, seen here, have been used in several of the country's worst recent shooting sprees This attack comes just weeks after the US Congress passed its first gun control law since 1994. The bipartisan bill came after mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde in Texas triggered lawmakers to finally act. The new law contains several provisions, including allowing the FBI to access juvenile and health records from younger gun buyers aged 18 to 20. The law does not include a provision that gun control campaigners hoped for - raising the age to buy a semi-automatic rifle to 21. Many of the most deadly mass shootings in recent history have occurred using semi-automatic rifles. But the new law comes as the Supreme Court tears down a New York state law that required people to prove a special need in order to carry a gun in public. Their ruling said that all Americans have the right under the Constitution to carry a gun outside their home. State bans on assault rifles are also expected to fall in light of the latest Supreme Court ruling. Here's a quick recap of the developments in the investigation into the Highland Park mass shooting: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot tells reporters she has been in
""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. The two mayors have known each other for three decades,
Lightfoot said, after meeting in law school. ""The minute I understood what had happened I reached out to
her [Rotering] and offered anything that I could do,"" Lightfoot says.
""Unfortunately I have a lot of experience here."" Lightfoot says she offered the support of the Chicago Police
Department, who ""sprang into action"". ""Whatever you need, we will be here for you,"" she
says.  President Joe Biden has ordered the American flag be lowered to half mast at the White House and other government buildings after Monday's shooting. ""As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of gun violence perpetrated on our Independence Day, July 4, 2022, in Highland Park, Illinois, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff,"" the president proclamation says. The flags will fly like that until 9 July. Biden made a similar proclamation just weeks ago, after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. What else did we learn during the Chicago police press conference about Monday's Highland Park attack? Officials said Robert E Crimo was dressed as a woman during the attack to hide his facial tattoos and help him escape in the crowd. The authorities also said they aimed to reveal charges against the suspect on Tuesday afternoon US time. Crime task force spokesman Chris Covelli says at this point authorities have not been able to identify any clear motive for the attack. Asked by reporters about the gunman's weapons, Covelli says Crimo used at least two rifles and pistols. All weapons examined were purchased lawfully by Crimo. Covelli adds that shooting appears to be completely random and there are no reasons to believe the attack was motivated by religion or race. We've been hearing more from the spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, Christopher Covelli. He says Crimo used his mother's car to escape the scene and blended in with the community because he concealed his identity by wearing women's clothing. Covelli adds that a second rifle was located inside Crimo's mother's car. He adds that Crimo remains in custody, and there are no indications he was acting with anyone else. Highland Park's authorities are delivering a news conference about the Fourth of July parade shooting, where six people were killed. Police say Robert E Crimo, 21, planned this attack for several weeks. Christopher Covelli, spokesman for Lake County Major Crime Task Force, says significant amount of information have been obtained from cell phone recordings and other footage. Crimo was dressed in women's clothing to conceal his identity, Covelli says. More than 70 rounds were fired from a legally purchased rifle, Covelli adds. We've heard from US President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the shootings and from the state's governor. Now its the turn of Illinois' lieutenant governor Juliana Stratton who says in atweet,external: ""Enough is enough."" Stratton echoed the governor's statement when he said gun violence was ""our uniquely American plague"". She added: ""I'm angry too. We all should be."" Highland Park's Independence Day shooting killed six people, and left at least three dozen others injured. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is speaking out about the ""horrible tragedy"" in Highland Park. Lightfoot appears with other Illinois lawmakers to discuss a bipartisan bill meant to address gun violence. ""The gun violence epidemic is deep and pervasive,"" she says. ""We saw that play out again in Highland Park yesterday."" Lightfoot says she has been in ""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. Gun violence is not just a Chicago problem, Lightfoot says. ""Gun violence knows no
borders or boundaries."" The bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, is meant to reduce gun violence nationwide. It includes enhanced background checks, a $250m (Â£205m) investment in community violence intervention and $100m for the national background check system. This video can not be played People, who had set up deck chairs in the street to watch the annual Independence Day parade, ran for safety as multiple shots rang out shortly after 1000 local time in Highland Park on 4 July. Toddlers in pushchairs, babes in arms, teenagers and the elderly fled the scene - and the gunfire - in fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones. ""He started shooting again, and we ran behind the building and I put my son in a dumpster,"" recalled one bystander. ""It was just horrible."" Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Illinois Senator Dick Durbin is here to view the remnants of the
Fourth of July parade. The Democrat looks shaken and tells me he is heart-broken
at what's happened. ""Are mass shootings now a tradition in America?"" I ask
him. ""I donât want
it to be but itâs becoming one,"" he sighs He backed recent major gun legislation aimed at addressing US gun
violence. He tells me it was an ""improvement"" but didnât go as far as
it should have. Senator Durbin says we have yet to see whether those new laws
would have stopped the gunman here. Illinois has tough gun laws but overall gun crime is high here. Republicans often point to Chicago as an example of a place
where gun control doesn't work. But some context - a report
in recent years from the city's police department has found a lot of guns come
from outside of Chicago and from neighbouring states like Kentucky and
Tennessee where the gun laws are more lax. The state of Illinois has the sixth strictest gun laws in the US,according to gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety,external. It also has the ninth lowest rate of gun ownership, according to the group. The state has universal background checks and requires firearms to be safely stored - but it does not ban assault weapons. Nancy Rotering, Highland Park's mayor, has told CNN the alleged shooter obtained his weapon legally. She criticised current gun laws, which enable individuals to lawfully purchase weapons. Rotering said: ""That being said, again, if you can have a weekly mass shooting with a legally purchased gun, then I think we need to talk about why those laws aren't protecting the very people that they're supposed to be protecting."" US President Joe Biden signed into law a landmark gun control bill in June, which aims to impose tougher checks on young buyers and encourage states to remove guns from people considered a threat. Robert Crimo, the alleged Independence Day shooter, has not yet been charged. But Rotering said she expects him to be charged today. So far, police have identified him as a ""person of interest"". Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Ken Pell is picking up his granddaughters' scooters. His wife
and family were at the parade and dumped everything for safety. ""I wasn't here, I was at a nearby golf club and got
notification of a shooting. We were then put into a basement for safety. I
couldnât get a signal and I was so panicked as I couldnât get hold of my family
for ages."" His daughter told him to leave the scooters because taking them
back ""would be bad karma"". ""I couldn't do that I wanted to collect them. My grandkids
donât seem too affected at the moment but you know my daughter is not doing
well. She is questioning raising her kids in a place like this."" The motivations of the gunman are unknown. Ken is Jewish and
says this is a predominantly Jewish area so he is worried that's why it may
have been targeted. ""We just never thought we would be hit like this but I
guess neither did Uvalde [the site of a mass school shooting]."" What does the data tell us about gun culture in the US and its impact? Here are some key charts. How many guns are there in the US? While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based leading research project - estimate that there were 390 million guns in circulation in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. How do US gun killings compare with other countries?  Nearly 53 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US, according to the official data from 2020. The data also shows that the vast majority of murders, 79%, were carried out with guns. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries Who supports gun control?  Despite widespread and vocal public outrage - often in the wake of gun violence - American support for stricter gun laws in 2020 fell to the lowest level since 2014,according to polling by Gallup,external. Only 52% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun laws, while 35% said they should remain the same. The issue is also one that is hyper-partisan - the Gallup study noted that Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans agreed with the same statement. See more key data and charts here The Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, was scheduled to include floats, marching bands, and community entertainment as part of the city's Fourth of July celebrations. But around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT) - just a few minutes after the parade had begun - a gunman who had climbed on to a roof near the parade route began shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. What should have been one of the happiest days of the year quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs left discarded on the street as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks. Police later recovered ""evidence of a firearm"" from the rooftop of a shop near to the parade route Five adults were killed at the scene, as well as a further victim who the local coroner said died in a nearby hospital. At least three dozen others were injured. At least eight victims remain in hospitals across Chicagoland (the Chicago metropolitan area) following yesterday's shooting, Jim
Anthony, spokesman for the North Shore University hospital group says. He did not provide updates on the patients' conditions. Thirty-eight patients were initially admitted for treatment after the parade, Anthony said, at three of the group's hospitals: Evanston Hospital, Glenbrook Hospital and Highland Park Hospital. ""We were able to mobilise quickly,"" Anthony said. ""Our physicians and nurses and medical support
staff train for situations like this, not that we ever want to see them in real
life."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.1143679e-06

"This video can not be played WATCH: People run for safety during a mass shooting at a US Independence Day parade US police have arrested a suspect after six people were killed in a shooting attack on an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois. Robert E Crimo III, 22, was detained after a brief chase, police said. The gunman climbed on to a roof, shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. It is the latest mass shooting to hit the US - there has been one in every week of 2022. President Joe Biden said he was ""shocked"" by the violence. Mr Crimo was detained after a manhunt. He was referred to as a ""person of interest"" in Monday's shooting, but after his arrest police said they believed he was responsible. The gunman began firing at members of the public from the rooftop of a shop at around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT), just a few minutes after the parade began. Tributes paid to victims of 4 July shooting What should have been a day of celebration quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs abandoned as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks or a car backfiring. One man, who was having breakfast at a nearby Starbucks when the shooting happened, told the BBC that 30 people came running into the coffee shop looking for cover. But they all had to be evacuated because they thought the gunman was trying to get in through the back door. Five adults were killed at the scene and one died later in hospital. At least two dozen others were injured. One of those who died has been named as Nicolas Toledo, a man in his late 70s, who was only there because he requires full-time care and his family did not want to miss the event. ""What was supposed to be a fun family day turned into a horrific nightmare for us all,"" his granddaughter Xochil Toledo wrote on GoFundMe. ""As a family we are broken, and numb. Our condolences go out to all the other families who lost a love one today."" Another victim of the shooting has been named as Jacki Sundheim, who was described by her local synagogue as a ""beloved"" member who taught and worshipped there. ""There are no words sufficient to express the depth of our grief for Jacki's death and sympathy for her family and loved ones,""a statement,externalby North Shore Congregation Israel synagogue said. The suspect has been named as Robert E Crimo III No charges have been filed against Mr Crimo and there is no indication of any motive. Social media firms suspended accounts apparently belonging to Mr Crimo, who posted rap videos under an alias as well as videos depicting shootings, gun violence and other violent themes. He also posted pictures of himself draped in a Donald Trump flag and a video of him greeting Mr Trump's motorcade at an airport. The attack in Highland Park comes just a month after deadly shootings in Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, New York. The the Gun Violence Archive, a group tracking gun violence incidents across the US, says there have been almost 250 mass shootings in 2022 alone - defining these as incidents where at least four people are shot. Illinois Governor Jay Robert Pritzker warned that mass shootings were becoming an ""American tradition"". ""There are going to be people who are going to say that today is not the day, that now is not the time to talk about guns. I'm telling you there is no better day and no better time then right here and right now,"" the Democratic governor said. President Biden vowed to keep fighting ""the epidemic of gun violence"" in the country. ""I'm not going to give up,"" he said, speaking outside the White House in Washington. Last week, the president signed the first significant federal bill on gun safety in nearly 30 years. It imposes tougher checks on young buyers and encourages states to remove guns from people considered a threat - but critics say the measures don't go far enough. Were you at the parade?

"Firms say staffing shortages and supply chain issues among other problems are putting a huge strain on customer service Six in 10 consumers say low prices will become more influential when choosing where to shop and what to buy in the next two years, a survey has suggested. But businesses need to offer more than just discounts to customers, according to the Institute of Customer Service. The organisation, which surveyed 10,000 people, said firms should offer value and a choice of ways to pay. About a third of those asked were still prepared to pay more to guarantee good service. Jo Causon, the institute's chief executive, said customers did not want products and services that were ""just cheap"" - so businesses needed to be flexible and transparent about what they were offering their customers. That could include being upfront about products and when they were available if the supply was held up. Staff needed to be understanding of the financial pressures their customers faced and offer a range of payment options, she said. And they should also consider giving advice on budgeting or getting the most value out of products. Firms should also gauge whether technology was the best solution to problems, and when a discussion with a real person was required. Five hacks to help save money on your food shop Worse to come for food price rises, warns industry The institute questioned consumers as part of a regular review of customer service, at a time when prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years and the costs of energy, fuel and food continue to climb. A shortage of skills and staff, problems with supplies from around the world, and the economic environment were all putting pressure on businesses to deliver a consistent service for customers, the institute said. ""Organisations cannot avoid these issues. They will need to develop service strategies that are responsive to evolving customer needs but also protect short and long-term business performance,"" Ms Causon said. More than 17% of those surveyed were experiencing a product or service problem, the highest overall level since records began in 2008. The quality and reliability of goods and services, in particular, was a growing problem, the survey suggested. The cost of dealing with poor service added to ongoing expenses for businesses. The institute estimated the collective cost to be Â£9.24bn a month in staff hours. Ms Causon said UK firms had got much better at dealing with, and resolving, complaints, but more work was required to prevent the problems in the first place. A year ago, the institute warned that customers were fed up of companies using Covid as an excuse for long waits on the telephone or late deliveries - but that issue had now clearly been overtaken by the issues relating to the cost of living. Customer service staff coping with more hostility attributed it to the stress the rising cost of living is putting on their customers However, the institute has also stressed that the problems were not all one way. Some consumers have been violent and abusive towards staff in shops. Recent data revealed 44% of frontline service staff had experienced hostility from customers in the past six months - a rise from 35% during the previous six months. A quarter of staff who have faced increased hostility said they believed the increase was partly down to the sharp rise in the cost of living and the stress this had placed on customers. Fraud victims face call waiting lottery from banks Young consumers 'expect better service' The survey follows a critical report from Citizens Advice oncustomer service performance from energy firms. On Friday, the charity - which ranks suppliers using a star rating system - said that standards had ""plummeted"" to a record low since June 2021 when several suppliers went bust due to high global gas prices. The average waiting time on the phone to speak to a firm was now about six and a half minutes, compared with just under four minutes the year before, it said. It added that standards risked falling further at the same time as prices would rise this winter. This month, the Financial Ombudsman Service - an independent arbiter of unresolved disputes - also told financial firms todeal with problems quicker, especially for victims of fraud and scams.

For our latest story on the government resignations and Boris Johnson's leadership,head here. We'll be back with more live updates on the UK political situation later today. It's been an eventful 24 hours. Given recent developments - from sackings to resignations - we're all in need of a quick round-up of where we're up to on this political saga. Nadhim Zahawi, who was only appointed as chancellor on Tuesday, is ""solidly behind"" the prime minister, Boris Johnson's parliamentary private secretary has told Sky News. Zahawi was earlier reported to have been in No 10 Downing Street as part of a group of cabinet ministers telling Boris Johnson that he should resign. But James Duddridge told Sky News earlier that those reports are ""wrong"" and Zahawi will be announcing a new economic strategy ""some time next week"". Duddridge was emphatic that the PM would ""go on and deliver"". Conservative MP Gareth Davies has quit as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Health and Social Care. The Grantham and Stamford MP tweeted: ""It is with great regret that I have informed the whips office of my resignation as a PPS at the Department of Health and Social Care. ""It has been a privilege to serve in the role and not a decision I have taken lightly."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With a third of the government gone following the stream of resignations, can it still be described as functioning? Not according to Camilla Cavendish, the former director of the Number 10 Policy Unit. ""The key point here is exactly this - we don't have a functioning government,"" she tells the BBC. ""As of tonight there aren't enough people to keep the business of the government going. Members of Parliament have already been told there aren't even enough people on the bill committees to actually get the legislation through - that is the fundamental business of government."" Cavendish adds: ""He can try in the next few days to bring new people in and there's always bound to be somebody but he is going to run out of road."" Conservative backbencher Bob Seely has been speaking to BBC Radio 4
about Boris Johnsonâs refusal to resign. Speaking to the World Tonight, he said it's not a case of the
calm before the storm, but rather ""the storm before the calm"". He added the political crisis was ""a bit like the end of a
bad relationship - it's just emotionally exhausting"". ""You think well I've tried, it hasnât worked, we've given
it a few years and we need to move on."" Seely has withdrawn his support for Johnson after backing him in
last monthâs vote of confidence. He's now hoping there will be a second vote. Speaking to the BBC, former Conservative minister Margot James criticised Boris Johnson's decision to sack Michael Gove. After losing more than 40 ministers in 24 hours, she said it was ""grossly irresponsible"" to sack ""probably the most competent minister in the whole cabinet"". James added she suspected it was ""active vengeance for what happened three years ago"". In 2016, when David Cameron stepped down, Johnson dropped out of the race for the Conservative leadership bid when Gove - who had previously backed Johnson - announced his own bid. Theresa May went on to win, becoming PM. And in 2019, Gove took Johnson on again, after having previously backed him to replace May when she resigned. Matt Hancock - the former health secretary - says ""it's clear"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to resign. In an interview with ITV's Robert Peston, Hancock says it's a sad end for Johnson. He adds: ""It's clear whether it's tomorrow or next Tuesday, there's going to be a new prime minister"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This brings the total number of resignations from ministers and aides up to 44. Simon Hart, MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, had been a part of Boris Johnson's cabinet since 2019. In his resignation letter he said PM will be remembered with ""energy, vision, determination and humour"", Hart said he had never been a ""massive fan of ministerial resignations being the best means of forcing change"". But, he adds, it's now past the point where utmost support to help the PM ""turn the ship around"" is enough. Hart was thought to be among a group of cabinet ministers who reportedly went
into No 10 earlier today to tell Johnson it was time to go. Yesterday, Hart made it made it clear to No 10 that it was ""game over"" but it shouldnât have to come by ministerial resignations. Simon Hart, former secretary of state for Wales, has just resigned, bringing the number of cabinet members who have resigned up to three - alongside Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak. In his resignation letter to Boris Johnson, Hart says: ""I had desperately hoped that I could avoid writing this letter, but alas there seems no other option left but to step down from my role as secretary of state for Wales"". He adds: ""Colleagues have done their upmost [sic] in private and public to help you turn the ship around, but it is with sadness that I feel we have passed the point where this is possible"". So far 43 ministers and aides have resigned from Johnson's government. Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart has resigned from Boris Johnson's government Allow Twitter content?

Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent As a rule of thumb, you can define the significance of
the occasion by the number of cameras in Downing Street. In the summer sunshine, the street was as busy as it was
in the cold of Christmas Eve 2019 when the Brexit deal was about to be struck. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps strode towards No 10, making very public his role as a messenger telling the prime minister what he didn't want to hear. Equally publicly, staunch supporter Nadine Dorries arrived at No 10 to express her loyalty. It's a great British tradition for the massed ranks of the media to shout questions at ministers, rarely expecting a reply. But when she left not only did she say that she supported Johnson but when asked if any of her colleagues still did she emphatically declared ""yes, definitely"" - suggesting the PM wasn't ready to throw in the towel. Anne Marie Trevelyan followed in her wake but was tight-lipped on whether she was still in support. And the Home Secretary Priti Patel avoided the glare of the cameras entirely - delivering her blow to the PM in private. All this has taken place against a soundtrack of an anti-Boris Johnson demonstrator blaring out 'bye bye Boris' to the tune of the similarly titled Bay City Rollers hit, occasionally drowned out by the strains of a marching band practicing in nearby Horse Guards Parade and a helicopter overhead. Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, has a novel take on Boris Johnson's firing of Michael Gove. He tells Sky News that Michael Gove offered Johnson the ""metaphorical bottle of whisky and the revolver"". ""Well clearly Boris has downed the whisky and turned the revolver on Michael Gove. ""Who would have believed it?"" The Tories have a ""patriotic duty"" to conclude the
chaos that has engulfed government,says Conservative MP Tobias Elwood.,external Elwood represents Bournemouth East and is Chair of the House of
Commons Defence Select Committee. He quizzed Johnson earlier at the Liaison Committee meeting. ""We have a patriotic duty to conclude this,"" he
tweeted. ""It's not just damaging the Conservative brand and
diminishing our own electoral prospects it is also undermining the nationâs
standing internationally. ""Britain is better than this."" Meanwhile, there have been three more resignations from Johnson's government. Taking the number of ministers and aides that have resigned - or been sacked - up to at least 41. Danny Krugerhas now resigned as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities - Michael Gove's former department. Kruger says he's ""very sorry indeed to hear Michael Gove has been fired"". James Daly, parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Work and Pensions, resigned from his role ""with great regret"". In aletter,externalDaly says Johnson is ""sadly unable to lead our government"". David Mundellalso resigned from his role as trade envoy to New Zealand. In atweet,externalMundell says he has no confidence in the PM and is ""very disappointed"". We've been hearing from a No 10 source who has been talking about why the PM is staying on. ""There is no lectern outside No 10 tonight... the PM fights on,"" the source says. Any suggestion there's a procession of cabinet ministers telling Johnson to go ""is not true"", the source claims, adding: ""He's called their bluff."" ""He has been spelling out to them [cabinet ministers] that 14 million people voted for him,"" the source says, adding that if the Conservative Party ""want to deprive him [Johnson] doing that job, they have take to take that mandate off them"". The source adds that Johnson explained to cabinet ministers tonight that the options are not ""Boris or no Boris"". Rather, it's about giving Johnson either a ""fresh chancellor and new programme, that Rishi was not prepared to do"" or ""spend months ripping each other apart to elect a leader without a mandate - coalition of chaos and Labour who will break up Britain"". Michael Gove and Boris Johnson worked together on the Vote Leave campaign Michael Gove is a senior and long-standing figure in the Conservative Party and has served in a strong of high-level posts, from his 2010 appointment as Education Secretary onwards. He has been Chief Whip, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Justice Secretary and Environment Secretary, as well as the role he was just sacked from, Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Gove worked closely with Johnson on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign. He has remained loyal to Johnson since he became prime minister. However, during the 2016 Conservative leadership race he initially backed Boris Johnson but later dramatically withdrew his backing, announcing he would run himself. That contest was ultimately won by Theresa May. Gove also ran
against Johnson in the 2019 Tory leadership race. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.3326641
"This video can not be played Actor Michael Sheen says the ""worst things imaginable"" are happening to children in care How would you feel if your child, or one you knew, was taken into care and ended up living in a B&B, a hostel, or even slept rough? What I'm talking about here is ""the care system"", the safety net we'd rely on if we couldn't look after our kids. I've been working on a BBC documentary which has found teenagers are still being placed in B&Bs and hostels - six years after theWelsh government said it wanted to ""eliminate"" it. Some of the stories have shocked me. With record numbers of children being taken into care in Wales and England, I've spoken to some young people who have been through the care system in an hour-long documentary, filmed over nearly three years, I've helped make for the BBC. âAbuse, assault, profitâ - childcare staff speak out Huge profits made from children's care - report 'It's hard to parent when you're the grandparent' My question is: does the care system always ""care"" for children who can't stay with mum or dad? ""I know for a fact prison would have been better than where I was placed,"" Niall told myBBC Wales Investigates 'Lifting the lid on the care system'documentary. Niall says one of his care placements was ""one of the worst places he'd ever lived"" He says he grew up moving in and out of care between the age of 14 and 18 - and after a place in a children's home broke down just as he turned 17, he was placed in a B&B. ""People moved there that had just come out of prison and stuff,"" Niall added. ""So I got robbed a couple of times in there. You'd see people kicking down doors on a daily basis, there'd be people smashing windows, people carrying knives."" Niall told me he was then moved into what he describes as a hostel, although his council insists it was supported housing as they tried to find him somewhere permanent to live. Social services found Niall a flat but he was targeted by the people who were with him in the hostel ""I was woken up by a punch basically,"" he recalled about one incident. ""So I had to start barricading my door which, obviously, they got through eventually. It was like they put all the troubled teenagers under one roof."" The people in charge of Niall's care said they made every effort to find him somewhere else to stay and that his case was not straightforward, but Caerphilly council did not comment on the threats and violence. Hope was taken into care at 14 but ran away after her foster placement broke down when she was 16. This video can not be played The state took charge of Hope as she had been exploited by people in her community ""I was a child in a tent with an adult who was over the age of 18, sleeping rough, where nobody knew where I was,"" Hope, now in her early 20s, told me. ""I was technically a child of the state. It wasn't OK... I was at risk."" Those responsible for Hope's care said it could not comment on individual cases but Wrexham council said its services had been transformed and it would use Hope's comments to improve things further. In 2016, I presented a petition to the Welsh government to end the practice of children being placed in B&Bs and hostels. Ministers said they wanted to ""eliminate"" it - but six years on, it's still happening. Research by the BBC Wales Investigates team suggests dozens of teenagers like Niall and Hope are still being put in that position. Hope has fond memories of growing up with her grandparents, but says bullying in school and the trauma of leaving her mum made her feel vulnerable Freedom of information requests to all councils in Wales showed at least 50 young people were placed in B&Bs, hostels and budget hotels in the past financial year, with at least 285 in other accommodation which is not regulated by the care watchdog. I don't want this to come across as an attack on social workers - because it's not. It is their job to look after these young people but they're working within a system that is, according to one report last year by those in charge of social services,facing a ""crisis"" to find suitable places,externalfor children to stay. While most children placed in such temporary accommodation are 16 or 17, our investigation found a small number are even younger. One example included an 11-year-old being housed in temporary accommodation with council staff, because there was nowhere else for them to go. SAM SMITH PRESENTS STORIES OF HIV:From Terrence Higgins to today LIFTING THE LID ON THE CARE SYSTEM:A shocking insight into the lives of young people in care Gemma - not her real name - felt she was let down by the system that was supposed to keep her safe. Gemma told me she was known to social services since she was born and remembered going missing 110 times one summer when she was about 12 She says she was exploited by older men when she was young before eventually being taken into care at 14, when she had become addicted to heroin. ""I'd moved house 12 times by the time I was 15,"" she said. ""I've never fully unpacked anywhere. Nobody ever keeps me very long anyway."" Leaving care: 'I fell through the cracks' Almost 100,000 children could be in care by 2025 Austerity blamed for children in care rise When she was 16 she was offered a hostel to stay in by social workers, which she said had a drug dealer staying there. ""I'd just spent nine months getting clean,"" Gemma said. ""They then placed me in this hostel where he was anyway. I was there less than a week before I was back on drugs."" After meeting Gemma and hearing all she'd been through, I broke down because what she had experienced and what she told me was just devastating. No child should have to live that life. My personal view is that we shouldn't tolerate that some young people just disappear and the worst possible things imaginable happen to them. Children who, from the beginning and often through no choice of their own, find themselves in circumstances that already makes things harder for them than it does for anyone else. People in social care tell you those are the children who are most likely to end up homeless, most likely to end up with mental health issues, with alcohol and drug dependency issues and even being sexually abused. The group that represents Wales' 22 local authorities said councils in Wales were ""committed to doing their best in responding to the growing demands and increasingly complex challenges in children's social care"". I launched a petition calling on the Welsh government to help homeless teenagers in Wales in 2015 The Welsh Local Government Association said it regretted the standard of care and support it wanted to achieve has not been met in everyone's case, and that it was keen to learn from young people's experiences. It also believes there is a need for additional funding to help children and families earlier, and that wider societal issues such as access to health services and ending child poverty are not things children's social care can solve alone. When I challenged Wales' deputy minister for social services on her government's record, she told me that while the majority of children in the care system grow up in loving families, she accepts that a minority of children do not have the experiences she would want them to have. ""What we really want to do is put as much support as we possibly can to parents and children at an earlier age, and stop so many numbers coming into care,"" said Julie Morgan MS. Julie Morgan has said the Welsh government is to invest more in foster carers and support workers for those leaving care ""Crises do happen, placements break down, families break down... and the children have to be put somewhere... we don't accept that that should be the situation and we're trying to do things to stop that."" She added there were plans for new specialist accommodation for children with complex needs across Wales and the government wasinvesting more in foster care and providing supportfor those leaving care. ""We have got it at the top of our agenda here in Wales... which doesn't mean that things don't go wrong,"" Ms Morgan added. ""To hear these tales from young people - and that I've heard so many times - that break your heart, you think how could this have happened? ""I absolutely accept that, but we're doing our utmost to make sure that every young person in Wales has, you know, a happy fulfilling life."" In England and Scotland, there has just been an independent review of the children's care system which called for earlier help for families too. Those in charge of social services departments there have longcalled for a ""system overhaul"",externalto address all sorts of issues The UK government said it had alreadybanned under-16s staying in places that aren't inspectedby the watchdog and will respond with more detailed plans later this year. But for everything the politicians are putting forward, based on what you'll see if you watch my BBC documentary, I wonder if you would be happy for the current care system to look after your child if you weren't around. If not, then don't we all need to consider whether that safety net - and the people who work within it - is being treated with the priority it deserves? Because if we continue to let these people down and continue to get this wrong, surely the consequences don't bear thinking about. Don't we feel we owe it to them - and society as whole - to sort this out?

"The sand battery has been installed and is functioning well according to the power company Finnish researchers have installed the world's first fully working ""sand battery"" which can store green power for months at a time. The developers say this could solve the problem of year-round supply, a major issue for green energy. Using low-grade sand, the device is charged up with heat made from cheap electricity from solar or wind. The sand stores the heat at around 500C, which can then warm homes in winter when energy is more expensive. UK must insulate to reduce energy bills - report Could nuclear desalination plants solve droughts? Could I save money driving an electric car? Finland gets most of its gas from Russia, so the war in Ukraine has drawn the issue of green power into sharp focus. It has the longest Russian border in the EU and Moscow hasnow halted gas and electricity suppliesin the wake of Finland's decision to join NATO. Concerns over sources of heat and light, especially with the long, cold Finnish winter on the horizon are preoccupying politicians and citizens alike. But in a corner of a small power plant in western Finland stands a new piece of technology that has the potential to ease some of these worries. The key element in this device? Around 100 tonnes of builder's sand, piled high inside a dull grey silo. These rough and ready grains may well represent a simple, cost-effective way of storing power for when it's needed most. Because of climate change and now thanks to the rapidly rising price of fossil fuels, there's a surge of investment in new renewable energy production. But while new solar panels and wind turbines can be quickly added to national grids, these extra sources also present huge challenges. The toughest question is about intermittency - how do you keep the lights on when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow? Adding more renewables to the electricity grid also means you need to boost other energy sources to balance the network, as too much or too little power can cause it to collapse. The most obvious answer to these problems is large scale batteries which can store and balance energy demands as the grid becomes greener. A bucket of sand used in the battery pilot plant Right now,most batteries are made with lithiumand are expensive with a large, physical footprint, and can only cope with a limited amount of excess power. But in the town of KankaanpÃ¤Ã¤, a team of young Finnish engineers have completed the first commercial installation of a battery made from sand that they believe can solve the storage problem in a low-cost, low impact way. ""Whenever there's like this high surge of available green electricity, we want to be able to get it into the storage really quickly,"" said Markku YlÃ¶nen, one of the two founders ofPolar Night Energy,externalwho have developed the product. The device has been installed in the Vatajankoski power plant which runs the district heating system for the area. Low-cost electricity warms the sand up to 500C by resistive heating (the same process that makes electric fires work). This generates hot air which is circulated in the sand by means of a heat exchanger. Sand is a very effective medium for storing heat and loses little over time. The developers say that their device could keep sand at 500C for several months. So when energy prices are higher, the battery discharges the hot air which warms water for the district heating system which is then pumped around homes, offices and even the local swimming pool. Finnish researchers Markku YlÃ¶nen and Tommi Eronen, who came up with the sand battery idea The idea for the sand battery was first developed at a former pulp mill in the city of Tampere, with the council donating the work space and providing funding to get it off the ground. ""If we have some power stations that are just working for a few hours in the wintertime, when it's the coldest, it's going to be extremely expensive,"" said Elina SeppÃ¤nen, an energy and climate specialist for the city. ""But if we have this sort of solution that provides flexibility for the use, and storage of heat, that would help a lot in terms of expense, I think."" The sand battery helps to warm homes, offices and the local swimming pool One of the big challenges now is whether the technology can be scaled up to really make a difference - and will the developers be able to use it to get electricity out as well as heat? The efficiency falls dramatically when the sand is used to just return power to the electricity grid. But storing green energy as heat for the longer term is also a huge opportunity for industry, where most of the process heat that's used in food and drink, textiles or pharmaceuticals comes from the burning of fossil fuels. Other research groups, such as the US National Renewable Energy Laboratoryare actively looking at sand as a viable form of battery for green power,external. But the Finns are the first with a working, commercial system, that so far is performing well, according to the man who's invested in the system. ""It's really simple, but we liked the idea of trying something new, to be the first in the world to do something like this,"" said Pekka Passi, the managing director of the Vatajankoski power plant. ""It's a bit crazy, if you wish, but I think it's going to be a success."" Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

"Just Stop oil protesters said they were highlighting the 'road to disaster' Climate protesters have attached their own ""apocalyptic vision of the future"" to a John Constable masterpiece in the National Gallery. Two activists from Just Stop Oil (JSO) stepped over the rope barrier in front of the Hay Wain oil painting before attaching their own version. Then they glued themselves to its frame, National Gallery (NG) said. Art lovers, tourists and 11-year-old schoolchildren were among those ushered out of the room. NG said police attended at about 14:25 BST and removed the protesters by 16:40. They were then arrested. The painting was removed from the wall and examined by NG's conservation team who found it had minor damage to its frame and some ""disruption to the surface of the varnish on the painting - both of which have now been successfully dealt with"", NG added.

Painted in 1821,the Hay Wain shows a hay wagon travelling across fields,externalin the Suffolk countryside. It is one of the most popular paintings in the National Gallery. JSO said they had attached an ""apocalyptic vision of the future"" that depicts ""the climate collapse and what it will do to this landscape"". The protesters attached their own version of the painting The pair then glued themselves to the frame The colour printout shows double yellow lines and pollution. Mr Lazarus, who described himself as an art lover, said: ""Art is important, it should be held for future generations to see, but when there is no food what use is art? ""When there is no water, what use is art? When billions of people are in pain and suffering, what use then is art? ""We have stuck a reimagined version of the Hay Wain that demonstrates our road to disaster."" The painting will be rehung in Room 34 ready for when the National Gallery opens on Tuesday. The incident happened at the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square Earlier this week JSO allegedly targeted a Scottish art gallery and stormed Sunday's British Grand Prix. A 19th-century landscape by Horatio McCulloch called My Heart's In The Highlands was the target of five JSO members, who are also alleged to have sprayed the group's logo on the walls and floor of Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.

This video can not be played The state took charge of Hope as she had been exploited by people in her community ""I was a child in a tent with an adult who was over the age of 18, sleeping rough, where nobody knew where I was,"" Hope, now in her early 20s, told me. ""I was technically a child of the state. It wasn't OK... I was at risk."" Those responsible for Hope's care said it could not comment on individual cases but Wrexham council said its services had been transformed and it would use Hope's comments to improve things further. In 2016, I presented a petition to the Welsh government to end the practice of children being placed in B&Bs and hostels. Ministers said they wanted to ""eliminate"" it - but six years on, it's still happening. Research by the BBC Wales Investigates team suggests dozens of teenagers like Niall and Hope are still being put in that position. Hope has fond memories of growing up with her grandparents, but says bullying in school and the trauma of leaving her mum made her feel vulnerable Freedom of information requests to all councils in Wales showed at least 50 young people were placed in B&Bs, hostels and budget hotels in the past financial year, with at least 285 in other accommodation which is not regulated by the care watchdog. I don't want this to come across as an attack on social workers - because it's not. It is their job to look after these young people but they're working within a system that is, according to one report last year by those in charge of social services,facing a ""crisis"" to find suitable places,externalfor children to stay. While most children placed in such temporary accommodation are 16 or 17, our investigation found a small number are even younger. One example included an 11-year-old being housed in temporary accommodation with council staff, because there was nowhere else for them to go. SAM SMITH PRESENTS STORIES OF HIV:From Terrence Higgins to today LIFTING THE LID ON THE CARE SYSTEM:A shocking insight into the lives of young people in care Gemma - not her real name - felt she was let down by the system that was supposed to keep her safe. Gemma told me she was known to social services since she was born and remembered going missing 110 times one summer when she was about 12 She says she was exploited by older men when she was young before eventually being taken into care at 14, when she had become addicted to heroin. ""I'd moved house 12 times by the time I was 15,"" she said. ""I've never fully unpacked anywhere. Nobody ever keeps me very long anyway."" Leaving care: 'I fell through the cracks' Almost 100,000 children could be in care by 2025 Austerity blamed for children in care rise When she was 16 she was offered a hostel to stay in by social workers, which she said had a drug dealer staying there. ""I'd just spent nine months getting clean,"" Gemma said. ""They then placed me in this hostel where he was anyway. I was there less than a week before I was back on drugs."" After meeting Gemma and hearing all she'd been through, I broke down because what she had experienced and what she told me was just devastating. No child should have to live that life. My personal view is that we shouldn't tolerate that some young people just disappear and the worst possible things imaginable happen to them. Children who, from the beginning and often through no choice of their own, find themselves in circumstances that already makes things harder for them than it does for anyone else. People in social care tell you those are the children who are most likely to end up homeless, most likely to end up with mental health issues, with alcohol and drug dependency issues and even being sexually abused. The group that represents Wales' 22 local authorities said councils in Wales were ""committed to doing their best in responding to the growing demands and increasingly complex challenges in children's social care"". I launched a petition calling on the Welsh government to help homeless teenagers in Wales in 2015 The Welsh Local Government Association said it regretted the standard of care and support it wanted to achieve has not been met in everyone's case, and that it was keen to learn from young people's experiences. It also believes there is a need for additional funding to help children and families earlier, and that wider societal issues such as access to health services and ending child poverty are not things children's social care can solve alone. When I challenged Wales' deputy minister for social services on her government's record, she told me that while the majority of children in the care system grow up in loving families, she accepts that a minority of children do not have the experiences she would want them to have. ""What we really want to do is put as much support as we possibly can to parents and children at an earlier age, and stop so many numbers coming into care,"" said Julie Morgan MS. Julie Morgan has said the Welsh government is to invest more in foster carers and support workers for those leaving care ""Crises do happen, placements break down, families break down... and the children have to be put somewhere... we don't accept that that should be the situation and we're trying to do things to stop that."" She added there were plans for new specialist accommodation for children with complex needs across Wales and the government wasinvesting more in foster care and providing supportfor those leaving care. ""We have got it at the top of our agenda here in Wales... which doesn't mean that things don't go wrong,"" Ms Morgan added. ""To hear these tales from young people - and that I've heard so many times - that break your heart, you think how could this have happened? ""I absolutely accept that, but we're doing our utmost to make sure that every young person in Wales has, you know, a happy fulfilling life."" In England and Scotland, there has just been an independent review of the children's care system which called for earlier help for families too. Those in charge of social services departments there have longcalled for a ""system overhaul"",externalto address all sorts of issues The UK government said it had alreadybanned under-16s staying in places that aren't inspectedby the watchdog and will respond with more detailed plans later this year. But for everything the politicians are putting forward, based on what you'll see if you watch my BBC documentary, I wonder if you would be happy for the current care system to look after your child if you weren't around. If not, then don't we all need to consider whether that safety net - and the people who work within it - is being treated with the priority it deserves? Because if we continue to let these people down and continue to get this wrong, surely the consequences don't bear thinking about. Don't we feel we owe it to them - and society as whole - to sort this out?

"Firms say staffing shortages and supply chain issues among other problems are putting a huge strain on customer service Six in 10 consumers say low prices will become more influential when choosing where to shop and what to buy in the next two years, a survey has suggested. But businesses need to offer more than just discounts to customers, according to the Institute of Customer Service. The organisation, which surveyed 10,000 people, said firms should offer value and a choice of ways to pay. About a third of those asked were still prepared to pay more to guarantee good service. Jo Causon, the institute's chief executive, said customers did not want products and services that were ""just cheap"" - so businesses needed to be flexible and transparent about what they were offering their customers. That could include being upfront about products and when they were available if the supply was held up. Staff needed to be understanding of the financial pressures their customers faced and offer a range of payment options, she said. And they should also consider giving advice on budgeting or getting the most value out of products. Firms should also gauge whether technology was the best solution to problems, and when a discussion with a real person was required. Five hacks to help save money on your food shop Worse to come for food price rises, warns industry The institute questioned consumers as part of a regular review of customer service, at a time when prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years and the costs of energy, fuel and food continue to climb. A shortage of skills and staff, problems with supplies from around the world, and the economic environment were all putting pressure on businesses to deliver a consistent service for customers, the institute said. ""Organisations cannot avoid these issues. They will need to develop service strategies that are responsive to evolving customer needs but also protect short and long-term business performance,"" Ms Causon said. More than 17% of those surveyed were experiencing a product or service problem, the highest overall level since records began in 2008. The quality and reliability of goods and services, in particular, was a growing problem, the survey suggested. The cost of dealing with poor service added to ongoing expenses for businesses. The institute estimated the collective cost to be Â£9.24bn a month in staff hours. Ms Causon said UK firms had got much better at dealing with, and resolving, complaints, but more work was required to prevent the problems in the first place. A year ago, the institute warned that customers were fed up of companies using Covid as an excuse for long waits on the telephone or late deliveries - but that issue had now clearly been overtaken by the issues relating to the cost of living. Customer service staff coping with more hostility attributed it to the stress the rising cost of living is putting on their customers However, the institute has also stressed that the problems were not all one way. Some consumers have been violent and abusive towards staff in shops. Recent data revealed 44% of frontline service staff had experienced hostility from customers in the past six months - a rise from 35% during the previous six months. A quarter of staff who have faced increased hostility said they believed the increase was partly down to the sharp rise in the cost of living and the stress this had placed on customers. Fraud victims face call waiting lottery from banks Young consumers 'expect better service' The survey follows a critical report from Citizens Advice oncustomer service performance from energy firms. On Friday, the charity - which ranks suppliers using a star rating system - said that standards had ""plummeted"" to a record low since June 2021 when several suppliers went bust due to high global gas prices. The average waiting time on the phone to speak to a firm was now about six and a half minutes, compared with just under four minutes the year before, it said. It added that standards risked falling further at the same time as prices would rise this winter. This month, the Financial Ombudsman Service - an independent arbiter of unresolved disputes - also told financial firms todeal with problems quicker, especially for victims of fraud and scams.

"Monmouth GP Dr Rowena Christmas said Covid was ""still very much with us"" All of Wales' seven health boards are either insisting on or encouraging the use of face masks for hospital visits. Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, has gone further by reinstating a temporary ban on visits. Hywel Dda health board in west and mid Wales is the latest to require use of masks, following a rise in Covid infections. Aneurin Bevan asked people to stay away from its hospitals unless ""absolutely necessary"" due to ""extreme pressure"". The health board did not mention Covid as a reason for this latest appeal. Meanwhile, some year groups at Ysgol Aberconwy, Conwy, arereceiving their lessons online from home,externalthis week due to staff absences relating to Covid. Wales' top doctor, Sir Frank Atherton, reminded people the pandemic had not gone away. ""While we are learning to live safely with it, we still need to think about taking the simple steps to help keep us safe and limit the spread of coronavirus,"" the chief medical officer said. ""The successful roll-out of the vaccine has significantly reduced cases of serious illness, however the virus is still spreading quickly in our communities."" While masks are no longer mandatory, Dr Sir Frank said people should still wear a facemask in health and care settings and in crowded indoor places. Wales has seen a rise in infections in the past month with one in 30 people testing positive, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). This is also reflected in a rise in patients testing positive for Covid in hospital - while more are catching it when in hospital. However, the most recent figures still show 88% of patients testing positive for Covid are primarily being treated for something else. Only 59 (10%) of confirmed Covid patients in acute beds on Monday were being primarily treated for the virus, with 515 patients in hospital being treated for other conditions. Numbers in critical care with Covid have been averaging 16 a day, up from 10 a week ago - half of these were ""incidental"" Covid patients and not treated primarily for the virus. There are 10 times more non-Covid patients in critical care than patients who have Covid, according to Digital Health and Care Wales figures. In Tuesday's First Minister's Questions, Mark Drakeford said that 1,500 NHS staff are currently not in work due to Covid, with a further 600 isolating because they are close contact with cases. Mr Drakeford said that was more than 2% of the NHS Wales workforce, and showed the ""continuing impact"" of the virus. ""Coronavirus has not gone away,"" he told the Senedd. Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan health boards, both in south Wales,asked people to wear masksat their hospitals last month, as did Betsi Cadwaladr health board which covers the north, and Swansea Bay health board. Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest is among the latest to reintroduce the use of face masks Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Waiting times record, with two years of increases Cardiff and Vale health board followed suit. Powys Teaching health board has required visitors to wear face masks for some time. Aneurin Bevan, which covers Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Monmouthshire, Newport, Torfaen and south Powys, said the emergency department at The Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran ""remains very busy"" on Monday evening. It asked people to attend only if they have ""a life-threatening illness or serious injury"". Anyone with a less serious issue is asked to visit a minor injury unit in Newport, Abergavenny, Ystrad Mynach, or Ebbw Vale. Across Aneurin Bevan last Thursday there were no vacant acute beds at all. In the last few days it has been 98.5% bed occupancy at the health board. That's just 16 available acute beds which are vacant. Hywel Dda is now encouraging staff and contractors to have a lateral flow test, and report the result, twice a week. ""We have made the decision to reinforce these measures at Withybush Hospital to reduce the risk to our patients and staff,"" said Mandy Rayani, director of nursing, quality and patient experience. ""We can all continue to take protective measures to reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-19 to protect vulnerable people and the NHS. People are also asked to attend outpatient clinics alone at Withybush. A designated partner can attend antenatal appointments or scans at Withybush Hospital midwifery-led unit and any visits considered necessary through agreement with a ward sister or charge nurse. Latest figures for Hywel Dda health board showed although the number of testing positive for Covid has risen by 79% in a week, only three patients on average were ""actively"" being treated for Covid in the last week;  97% of positive tests have been ""incidental"" Covid. More than half of Hywel Dda patients who tested positive for Covid in the most recent week had caught the infection in hospital, according to separate Public Health Wales figures. There were 212 ""probable"" and ""definite"" cases of Covid infections caught by patients while in hospital in Wales in the most recent week. This is the highest weekly total since mid-April. 91% of the patients concerned were over 60 and more than half over 80, according to Public Health Wales. 48% of positive tests in hospital are hospital-acquired in the latest week. Monmouth GP Dr Rowena Christmas said Covid was ""still very much with us"" with six residents at one care home testing positive despite its ""best interests to protect everyone"". ""We've got lots and lots of patients with symptoms which that could well be Covid,"" she toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales. ""We've got staff members off sick again, testing positive. ""Right now if we could get our masks back on and, I hate to say this, but avoid hugs and kisses with anyone who isn't our immediate contacts as much as you possibly can."" Little of this will come as a surprise to anyone with a friend, relative or colleague who has recently shared tales of feeling pretty rough, having come down with Covid. But those friends, family and colleagues invariably have jobs in the NHS, schools or local services. You take them out of the mix and we start to feel the pinch again, with hospitals under intense pressure, and schools without enough staff to get by safely. The positives: fewer people are needing to be hospitalised with Covid - in the main, people can cope with the symptoms. But right now, hospitals are already full. We've seen record highs for bed occupancy rates in recent weeks. Why? Well we know there's a backlog of patients waiting for care - but the longer they wait, the worse their conditions become, so their needs become more urgent, meaning many end up in hospital anyway. And getting them out once they're medically well enough is harder if they need additional support on the outside - we know there's a shortage of social care staff - but they too, unsurprisingly, are also being hit by Covid.

"Take two: the royal couple were shown around the new BBC Wales building, which will be open for guided tours to the public The Prince of Wales has voiced concern that the climate crisis gets too little coverage during weather reporting. Prince Charles aired his views during a visit with the Duchess of Cornwall to BBC Cymru Wales' new headquarters atCardiff Central Square. The visit began with a tour of the broadcast centre, including the new television studios. He told weather presenter Derek Brockway he was ""frustrated"" not enough of the climate crisis was incorporated. Prince Charles chatting with weather presenters Derek Brockway and Sabrina Lee ""It's about time some mention was made why it's so critical,"" said Charles. Prince Charles: We must learn from indigenous people on climate change Charles: I understand climate activists' anger ""We try and build it in,"" Derek said. His fellow weather presenter Sabrina Lee explained how she did a mini-series for the COP26 climate conference ""talking about the climate change stripes (a form of warning system) in Wales to see how the temperature has changed since 1850. ""Last summer Wales had its first extreme heat warning and we tried to investigate whether climate change played a part in this,"" she added. Derek told the prince his interest in the weather started in 1976 when he decided he wanted to be a meteorologist. The royal couple were welcomed to the new BBC Cymru Wales headquarters in central Cardiff ""I'm always intrigued watching the local weather,"" Prince Charles said in response. Charles'sinterest in environmental issues is well known, and he said earlier this year that time was ""rapidly running out"" to deal with climate change and biodiversity loss. The prince visited the studios and chatted with presenters and other staff The prince also met members of the BBC's centre of excellence for climate and science journalism, which is moving from London to Cardiff. ""Are you covering the remarkable advances and innovative approaches to energy?"" the prince asked. BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt replied that wind generation is ""getting better"" with the Crown Estatethis week announcinga tendering process for floating wind turbines ""As long as they're not sailing into my boat,"" Prince Charles said with a smile. ""I hope there's a bit of tethering."" Prince Charles met members of the BBC's climate and science team There was also a meeting with cafeteria staff, including 61-year-old cook Robert Jones, who said as he shook hands with the prince: ""It's my birthday today so thanks for making the effort"" ""Shouldn't you have a day off?"" Charles shot back. ""No, this was much more important,"" Mr Jones replied. Prince Charles shares a joke with BBC cafeteria staff Prince Charles and Camilla were greeted in the foyer of BBC Central Square by the choir from Mount Stuart Primary School in Cardiff. The royal couple's visit continued with avisit to the Betty Campbell statue, near the BBC building. It is Wales' first monument to a named, non-fictional woman in an outdoor space. Large crowds welcomed the royal couple to the new BBC Cymru Wales building She was head teacher of Mount Stuart school, Wales' first black head, and a black history campaigner. Betty's son, Antony Campbell said his family was ""very proud"" to have the royals visiting the monument. ""[My mum] probably would have said don't make a fuss,"" he said. ""For Prince Charles to come and have a look at it, that's incredible."" Camilla and Prince Charles visited a new monument to Betty Campbell in Cardiff They also have an engagement with the 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards in Cardiff and will host an evening of music and drama at their residence in Llandovery, Carmarthenshire.

"Sainsbury's customers are switching to own-brand products and cutting back on non-essential spending as prices rise more quickly, the supermarket's boss has said. Simon Roberts added that pressure on household budgets is set to increase over the rest of the year. Households have been struggling with the cost of living as energy, food and fuel bills soar. Mr Roberts said Sainsbury's was ""doing everything we can to keep prices low"". Some customers are ""switching into economy own-label"" when food shopping, while Sainsbury's is seeing customers ""pulling back"" some spending on general merchandise, Mr Roberts said, with larger ""big ticket"" items ""more challenged"". Sainsbury's sales fell 4% in the 16 weeks to 25 June compared with last year, but that difference was mainly down to how lockdowns in 2021 had pushed up sales, he said. Sales at Argos were also down, in part due to the squeeze on household budgets, chief financial officer Kevin O'Byrne said. Last month, a BBC-commissioned survey suggested that people were cutting back on food, fuel and clothes as prices rise. And nearly half of adults in anOffice for National Statistics (ONS),externalsurvey in June said they had bought less food in the past fortnight due to higher prices. The price of food was also the most common reason for why those asked were seeing their monthly outgoings rising overall, the ONS said. Supermarkets Asda and Tesco have also previously said that customers were cutting back on shopping. People cut back on food, fuel and clothes as prices rise, BBC survey suggests Announcing Sainsbury's latest trading update, Mr Roberts said: ""We really understand how hard it is for millions of households right now and that's why we are investing Â£500m and doing everything we can to keep our prices low, especially on the products customers buy most often."" ""The pressure on household budgets will only intensify over the remainder of the year and I am very clear that doing the right thing for our customers and colleagues will remain at the very top of our agenda,"" he added. Sainsbury's suppliers are also under pressure as commodities such as fuel and fertiliser prices rise, in part due to the war in Ukraine, Mr Roberts said. The supermarket chain was working ""very closely"" with suppliers ""to focus on how we navigate"" these price rises, he said. He said it was a matter of balancing ""keeping prices low for customers but also keeping products in stock"". The supermarket has also beenunder pressure from campaign group Shareactionover paying the Living Wage of Â£9.90 per hour not only to its own staff, but also to contractors such as cleaners and security guards. Mr Roberts said Sainsbury's pays colleagues ""as fully as we can"". Thecost of living is rising at its highest rate for 40 years, and the Bank of England has warned prices could rise faster within months. Despite its latest comments, Sainsbury's said it still expected full year underlying profit before tax to be in line its previous estimate of between Â£630m and Â£690m. Last month, research firm Kantar saidthe average annual grocery bill was set to climb by Â£380 this year. The researchers also found shoppers are switching from branded items to supermarkets' own-label products. To try to ease the burden on households, retailers and other businesses have beenunder pressure from the government to cut prices. But small firms have said the plans are a ""slap in the face"" saying they had ""already cut all expenses, even necessary ones, to the bone.""

"President Erdogan says Sweden has promised to hand over 73 people Nato has formally launched the process to bring Sweden and Finland into its military alliance. But a key condition for Nato member Turkey is the handover of more than 70 people described by its president as terrorists. The leaders of the two Nordic nations say they are taking the issue seriously, but ultimately extradition is up to the courts not politicians. So who does Turkey want and could they ever be deported to Ankara? Sweden and Finland applied to join the West's defensive alliance after Russia launched its war in Ukraine. Turkey was the only one of Nato's 30 member states to block their bids until the two Nordic states agreed to a set of demands - including handing over individuals with alleged terror links. This video can not be played Watch: Handshakes as Turkey signs agreement to support Finland and Sweden joining Nato Under a memorandum signed at a Nato summit last week,external, Finland and Sweden agreed to address Turkey's ""pending deportation or extradition requests of terror suspects expeditiously and thoroughly"", with ""bilateral legal frameworks to facilitate extradition"". President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sweden had promised to extradite 73 ""terrorists"" and had already sent three or four of them. Pro-government Turkish daily Hurriyet published a list of 45 people, including 33 sought from Sweden and 12 from Finland. Turkey is particularly keen on the handover of individuals it considers linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terror group by the EU, US and UK. It is also after followers of exiled Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen. Gulenists are blamed by Turkey for a failed coup against President Erdogan in 2016. The BBC has spoken to three of the people sought by Turkey. For years, he was editor-in-chief of Today's Zaman, a major English-language daily in Turkey, before it was shut down in 2016. Now, he lives in exile in Stockholm. Bulent Kenes was a highly respected journalist at Today's Zaman Turkish authorities accuse him of being part of theGulen movement, or what they call the Fethullah Terrorist Organisation (Feto). It is known for its network of schools and is not considered a terror group in the EU, UK or US. Mr Kenes said he became a target for his outspoken criticism of President Erdogan and faced accusations of plotting to topple the government: ""All the allegations are fabricated. I am an independent journalist with no affiliations with any organisation."" Turkish journalist jailed for reciting proverb The case that set Turkey on collision course with the West He was given a suspended jail term in 2015 for ""insulting the president"", in a tweet that said Mr Erdogan's late mother would be ashamed of him. Insulting President Erdogan remains a common charge today, with 17 journalists and cartoonists put on trial in the first three months of 2022, according to independent Turkish organisation Bianet. The deal struck by the countries' leaders says Sweden and Finland will support Turkey in its fight against terrorism Bulent Kenes believes he has become a bargaining chip between Mr Erdogan and Sweden in Nato negotiations. He is not particularly afraid of being extradited, as that would be a ""betrayal of Sweden's own values"" of democracy and protecting dissidents. ""This is not a test for the Erdogan regime... this is a test for the Swedish authorities,"" he said. Sweden and Finland's journey from neutral to Nato What is Nato and how is it changing? Others on Turkey's list are far less prominent. Fatih, a Finnish Kurd, was part of a group of five young men who set fire to the door of the Turkish embassy in 2008. Now a 37-year-old business owner and entrepreneur, he told the BBC he regretted what he did: ""At that time, my life was messed up, I had many kinds of problems."" He was surprised to find his name on the list as he finished serving a14-month suspended sentence,externallong ago - and paid damages to the embassy. Finnish authorities granted him citizenship a few years ago and considered the embassy case closed, he said. One person in the embassy was injured in the 2008 attack on the Turkish embassy in Helsinki Turkey accuses him of being a member of the militant PKK, which calls for greater Kurdish self-governance and is involved in an armed struggle with the Turkish state. Fatih said he had no ties or ideological connections to the PKK, and believed he was targeted purely because of his Kurdish background. Kurds make up 15-20% of Turkey's population but have faced persecution in Turkey for generations. The government in Ankara is trying to ban the pro-Kurdish HDP party, the third biggest in parliament. Turkey moves to ban pro-Kurdish opposition party While Fatih did not believe he would be extradited as a Finnish citizen, he feared harassment in the local Turkish community or possible arrest abroad at Turkey's request. He said he was very sad that Finland was having to ""fight for him"". Aysen Furhoff came to Sweden after serving five years of a life sentence in Turkey for trying to ""subvert the constitutional order"" when she was 17 and a member of the Turkish Communist Party. She said she was offered protection in Sweden after being tortured in jail. Now 45, she lives in Stockholm with her husband and daughter and works as a teacher, and insists she is no longer involved in Turkish politics. Aysen Furhoff says she is disappointed with Sweden's decision to sign a deal with Mr Erdogan ""I left Turkey 20 years ago. If I get sent there, they will have no use for me. Everyone I know is either dead or in prison. That's why being on the list was surprising - who am I to them?"" Ms Furhoff says she is also being prosecuted in Turkey for being a PKK member. She admits collaborating with them for three months some 25 years ago. While she no longer sympathises with the PKK, she denies they are a terror group and believes they should be part of discussions for a negotiated peace in Turkey. Citing Swedish law, she is not worried about extradition but finds it hard to believe she could be an important case for Ankara. Legal requirements in Sweden and Finland make it very hard for Turkey to extradite the kind of numbers it wants: An independent court has the final say on extradition - not politicians Citizens of neither Sweden nor Finland can be extradited Foreign nationals can be extradited - but only if in line with the European Convention on Extradition Extradition is not allowed for political crimes or to countries where people risk persecution Alleged offences must be seen as a crime in Sweden or Finland. According to Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter, of the 33 Swedish names listed in Turkish media, 19 have already been rejected for extradition by Stockholm's Supreme Court. ""We cannot go through earlier cases that have already been processed,"" said Chief Justice Anders Eka. Finland has extraditedtwo people to Turkey out of more than a dozen requests over the past decade,external. The justice ministry says no new requests have been received and it has promised the Kurdish community there will be no change to the law. If Turkey's demands are rejected, it could withdraw its support for the Nordic nations' accession to Nato, says Murat Yesiltas of pro-government think tank Seta. Parliaments in all 30 Nato countries will need to approve Sweden and Finland as members and that includes Turkish lawmakers. So Mr Yesiltas warns it is also about the ""dignity of the Turkish parliament"". Mr Erdogan is seeking to change European perceptions of the PKK, says analyst Murat Yesiltas Other commentators suggest Ankara's push for extradition may be an Erdogan re-election strategy, or a tool to help land a US weapons sale. There is little chance of Sweden or Finland handing over anyone on the list any time soon. One former PKK member on the list, Cemil Aygan, has been targeted for extradition by Turkey in the past but believes Sweden's Supreme Court will stand in its way. ""If Sweden were to hand me over, my life would be over,"" he told public broadcaster SVT. How Sweden and Finland went from neutral to Nato Who are Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) rebels?

"Fire engulfed 20 flats in Redwood Grove, Bedford, on Monday morning Dozens of people spent the night away from home unaware if their flats were destroyed in a fatal gas explosion. One person died and three others were injured when 20 flats in Redwood Grove, Bedford, wereengulfed in flames in the blast at about 09:30 BST on Monday. One neighbour said he believed he had lost everything he owned in his flat, which he understood was destroyed. Bedfordshire Police said further bodies could be found in the coming days as crews searched the scene. The fire service said an investigation was under way and more details would become known in the coming days. Many residents were unaware how badly their homes had been affected by the blast Jas, who lives in a flat in the affected building, said he had been sitting on his sofa when he heard a ""massive explosion"". ""I thought it was an earthquake but when I went to have a look the door had come off the hinges and the attic had split in half and the roof had collapsed,"" he said. ""People were jumping out the window, someone had collapsed in the hallway, there was dense smoke and fire everywhere."" Jas's daughter, Cornelia, said his entire flat was ""gone"". ""Everything he owned was in there,"" she said. ""It's his whole life, all his possessions. ""It's been very traumatic."" This video can not be played The flats partially collapsed following the blast Lauren Townsend was with her young daughter at their home in the neighbouring building when the blast happened. The 21-year-old said: ""I just heard an explosion, the flat shook and then I heard my neighbours screaming, telling us there was a fire. ""It seemed like it was in our block so obviously I panicked and got my little girl out of bed, got the dog out and just started banging on doors trying to get everyone out."" Ms Townsend said she had been waiting to speak to the council about where she and her family could stay as they were unable to return home. ""All my stuff is in there, my little girl's stuff is in there - her nappies, wipes, milk, everything,"" she said. ""Obviously you can get that from the shops but there's all her comforts, toys, clothes."" Ms Townsend said the incident was ""shocking"". ""To think how close to home that was and that it could have been us - it's mad,"" she said. This video can not be played Witness Alex Feltham said he heard ""a large boom"" at about 09:30 BST ""and the roof of the block of flats had been destroyed"" Another resident, who did not want to be named, said she and her husband had been on their way to Wales when they were called about the explosion. The couple said they did not know how badly their home had been affected but said they were in ""a better situation than some people"" as they had clothes and toiletries with them in a suitcase for their holiday. ""When I saw the aerial photo I just burst into tears,"" she said. ""I just thought, 'thank god we weren't in the building'."" The couple said they were ""lucky"" they could stay with family nearby but hoped they could return at some point to ""collect sentimental things"".

"Sainsbury's customers are switching to own-brand products and cutting back on non-essential spending as prices rise more quickly, the supermarket's boss has said. Simon Roberts added that pressure on household budgets is set to increase over the rest of the year. Households have been struggling with the cost of living as energy, food and fuel bills soar. Mr Roberts said Sainsbury's was ""doing everything we can to keep prices low"". Some customers are ""switching into economy own-label"" when food shopping, while Sainsbury's is seeing customers ""pulling back"" some spending on general merchandise, Mr Roberts said, with larger ""big ticket"" items ""more challenged"". Sainsbury's sales fell 4% in the 16 weeks to 25 June compared with last year, but that difference was mainly down to how lockdowns in 2021 had pushed up sales, he said. Sales at Argos were also down, in part due to the squeeze on household budgets, chief financial officer Kevin O'Byrne said. Last month, a BBC-commissioned survey suggested that people were cutting back on food, fuel and clothes as prices rise. And nearly half of adults in anOffice for National Statistics (ONS),externalsurvey in June said they had bought less food in the past fortnight due to higher prices. The price of food was also the most common reason for why those asked were seeing their monthly outgoings rising overall, the ONS said. Supermarkets Asda and Tesco have also previously said that customers were cutting back on shopping. People cut back on food, fuel and clothes as prices rise, BBC survey suggests Announcing Sainsbury's latest trading update, Mr Roberts said: ""We really understand how hard it is for millions of households right now and that's why we are investing Â£500m and doing everything we can to keep our prices low, especially on the products customers buy most often."" ""The pressure on household budgets will only intensify over the remainder of the year and I am very clear that doing the right thing for our customers and colleagues will remain at the very top of our agenda,"" he added. Sainsbury's suppliers are also under pressure as commodities such as fuel and fertiliser prices rise, in part due to the war in Ukraine, Mr Roberts said. The supermarket chain was working ""very closely"" with suppliers ""to focus on how we navigate"" these price rises, he said. He said it was a matter of balancing ""keeping prices low for customers but also keeping products in stock"". The supermarket has also beenunder pressure from campaign group Shareactionover paying the Living Wage of Â£9.90 per hour not only to its own staff, but also to contractors such as cleaners and security guards. Mr Roberts said Sainsbury's pays colleagues ""as fully as we can"". Thecost of living is rising at its highest rate for 40 years, and the Bank of England has warned prices could rise faster within months.

Last month, research firm Kantar saidthe average annual grocery bill was set to climb by Â£380 this year. The researchers also found shoppers are switching from branded items to supermarkets' own-label products.

"The drones will carry chemotherapy drugs from the pharmacy at Portsmouth hospital to the Isle of Wight Drones are to be used to courier drugs in a bid to speed up the delivery of vital medicines, the NHS has announced. Chemotherapy drugs will be flown from Portsmouth to a hospital on the Isle of Wight as part of a pilot scheme. NHS England said it was hoped that the technology would lead to ""same-day delivery"" of orders across the country. Chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the scheme, which will also be trialled in Northumbria, was ""extraordinary"". If successful, it's believed the trust would be the first in the world to deliver chemotherapy drugs by drone. Announcing it ahead of the 74th anniversary of the founding of the NHS, she said it was ""clear that the pace of change and improvement across the health service is only accelerating"". ""Delivering chemo by drone is another extraordinary development for cancer patients and shows how the NHS will stop at nothing to ensure people get the treatment they need as promptly as possible - while also cutting costs,"" she added. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he wanted patients to get the best care ""no matter where they live"" The scheme will cut delivery times to the island from four hours to 30 minutes, with one flight replacing two car journeys and one hovercraft or ferry journey per delivery. The drugs will be flown directly from the pharmacy at Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust to St Mary's Hospital, where staff will collect them before distributing it to hospital teams and patients. An NHS England spokesman said chemotherapy drugs were difficult to transport as some doses have a short shelf life. He added that it was hoped the new delivery method, which has been created in partnership with tech company Apian, would offer a better option for cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight, many of whom currently have to travel to the mainland for treatment. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he wanted England to ""become a world leader in cancer care"" and using the drones would mean patients ""will have quicker, fairer access to treatment, no matter where they live"". A trial of the drone programme in Northumbria is expected to follow the initial Isle of Wight trial. Follow BBC South onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

Zahawi was earlier reported to have been in No 10 Downing Street as part of a group of cabinet ministers telling Boris Johnson that he should resign. But James Duddridge told Sky News earlier that those reports are ""wrong"" and Zahawi will be announcing a new economic strategy ""some time next week"". Duddridge was emphatic that the PM would ""go on and deliver"". Conservative MP Gareth Davies has quit as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Health and Social Care. The Grantham and Stamford MP tweeted: ""It is with great regret that I have informed the whips office of my resignation as a PPS at the Department of Health and Social Care. ""It has been a privilege to serve in the role and not a decision I have taken lightly."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With a third of the government gone following the stream of resignations, can it still be described as functioning? Not according to Camilla Cavendish, the former director of the Number 10 Policy Unit. ""The key point here is exactly this - we don't have a functioning government,"" she tells the BBC. ""As of tonight there aren't enough people to keep the business of the government going. Members of Parliament have already been told there aren't even enough people on the bill committees to actually get the legislation through - that is the fundamental business of government."" Cavendish adds: ""He can try in the next few days to bring new people in and there's always bound to be somebody but he is going to run out of road."" Conservative backbencher Bob Seely has been speaking to BBC Radio 4
about Boris Johnsonâs refusal to resign. Speaking to the World Tonight, he said it's not a case of the
calm before the storm, but rather ""the storm before the calm"". He added the political crisis was ""a bit like the end of a
bad relationship - it's just emotionally exhausting"". ""You think well I've tried, it hasnât worked, we've given
it a few years and we need to move on."" Seely has withdrawn his support for Johnson after backing him in
last monthâs vote of confidence. He's now hoping there will be a second vote. Speaking to the BBC, former Conservative minister Margot James criticised Boris Johnson's decision to sack Michael Gove. After losing more than 40 ministers in 24 hours, she said it was ""grossly irresponsible"" to sack ""probably the most competent minister in the whole cabinet"". James added she suspected it was ""active vengeance for what happened three years ago"". In 2016, when David Cameron stepped down, Johnson dropped out of the race for the Conservative leadership bid when Gove - who had previously backed Johnson - announced his own bid. Theresa May went on to win, becoming PM. And in 2019, Gove took Johnson on again, after having previously backed him to replace May when she resigned. Matt Hancock - the former health secretary - says ""it's clear"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to resign. In an interview with ITV's Robert Peston, Hancock says it's a sad end for Johnson. He adds: ""It's clear whether it's tomorrow or next Tuesday, there's going to be a new prime minister"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He adds: ""Colleagues have done their upmost [sic] in private and public to help you turn the ship around, but it is with sadness that I feel we have passed the point where this is possible"".

Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent As a rule of thumb, you can define the significance of
the occasion by the number of cameras in Downing Street. In the summer sunshine, the street was as busy as it was
in the cold of Christmas Eve 2019 when the Brexit deal was about to be struck. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps strode towards No 10, making very public his role as a messenger telling the prime minister what he didn't want to hear. Equally publicly, staunch supporter Nadine Dorries arrived at No 10 to express her loyalty. It's a great British tradition for the massed ranks of the media to shout questions at ministers, rarely expecting a reply. But when she left not only did she say that she supported Johnson but when asked if any of her colleagues still did she emphatically declared ""yes, definitely"" - suggesting the PM wasn't ready to throw in the towel. Anne Marie Trevelyan followed in her wake but was tight-lipped on whether she was still in support. And the Home Secretary Priti Patel avoided the glare of the cameras entirely - delivering her blow to the PM in private. All this has taken place against a soundtrack of an anti-Boris Johnson demonstrator blaring out 'bye bye Boris' to the tune of the similarly titled Bay City Rollers hit, occasionally drowned out by the strains of a marching band practicing in nearby Horse Guards Parade and a helicopter overhead. Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, has a novel take on Boris Johnson's firing of Michael Gove. He tells Sky News that Michael Gove offered Johnson the ""metaphorical bottle of whisky and the revolver"". ""Well clearly Boris has downed the whisky and turned the revolver on Michael Gove. ""Who would have believed it?"" The Tories have a ""patriotic duty"" to conclude the
chaos that has engulfed government,says Conservative MP Tobias Elwood.,external Elwood represents Bournemouth East and is Chair of the House of
Commons Defence Select Committee. He quizzed Johnson earlier at the Liaison Committee meeting. ""We have a patriotic duty to conclude this,"" he
tweeted. ""It's not just damaging the Conservative brand and
diminishing our own electoral prospects it is also undermining the nationâs
standing internationally. ""Britain is better than this."" Meanwhile, there have been three more resignations from Johnson's government. Taking the number of ministers and aides that have resigned - or been sacked - up to at least 41. Danny Krugerhas now resigned as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities - Michael Gove's former department. Kruger says he's ""very sorry indeed to hear Michael Gove has been fired"". James Daly, parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Work and Pensions, resigned from his role ""with great regret"". In aletter,externalDaly says Johnson is ""sadly unable to lead our government"". David Mundellalso resigned from his role as trade envoy to New Zealand. In atweet,externalMundell says he has no confidence in the PM and is ""very disappointed"". We've been hearing from a No 10 source who has been talking about why the PM is staying on. ""There is no lectern outside No 10 tonight... the PM fights on,"" the source says. Any suggestion there's a procession of cabinet ministers telling Johnson to go ""is not true"", the source claims, adding: ""He's called their bluff."" ""He has been spelling out to them [cabinet ministers] that 14 million people voted for him,"" the source says, adding that if the Conservative Party ""want to deprive him [Johnson] doing that job, they have take to take that mandate off them"". The source adds that Johnson explained to cabinet ministers tonight that the options are not ""Boris or no Boris"". Rather, it's about giving Johnson either a ""fresh chancellor and new programme, that Rishi was not prepared to do"" or ""spend months ripping each other apart to elect a leader without a mandate - coalition of chaos and Labour who will break up Britain"". Michael Gove and Boris Johnson worked together on the Vote Leave campaign Michael Gove is a senior and long-standing figure in the Conservative Party and has served in a strong of high-level posts, from his 2010 appointment as Education Secretary onwards. He has been Chief Whip, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Justice Secretary and Environment Secretary, as well as the role he was just sacked from, Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Gove worked closely with Johnson on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign. He has remained loyal to Johnson since he became prime minister. However, during the 2016 Conservative leadership race he initially backed Boris Johnson but later dramatically withdrew his backing, announcing he would run himself. That contest was ultimately won by Theresa May. Gove also ran

In his resignation letter to Boris Johnson, Hart says: ""I had desperately hoped that I could avoid writing this letter, but alas there seems no other option left but to step down from my role as secretary of state for Wales"". He adds: ""Colleagues have done their upmost [sic] in private and public to help you turn the ship around, but it is with sadness that I feel we have passed the point where this is possible"". So far 43 ministers and aides have resigned from Johnson's government. Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart has resigned from Boris Johnson's government Allow Twitter content?

Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent As a rule of thumb, you can define the significance of
the occasion by the number of cameras in Downing Street. In the summer sunshine, the street was as busy as it was
in the cold of Christmas Eve 2019 when the Brexit deal was about to be struck. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps strode towards No 10, making very public his role as a messenger telling the prime minister what he didn't want to hear. Equally publicly, staunch supporter Nadine Dorries arrived at No 10 to express her loyalty. It's a great British tradition for the massed ranks of the media to shout questions at ministers, rarely expecting a reply. But when she left not only did she say that she supported Johnson but when asked if any of her colleagues still did she emphatically declared ""yes, definitely"" - suggesting the PM wasn't ready to throw in the towel. Anne Marie Trevelyan followed in her wake but was tight-lipped on whether she was still in support. And the Home Secretary Priti Patel avoided the glare of the cameras entirely - delivering her blow to the PM in private. All this has taken place against a soundtrack of an anti-Boris Johnson demonstrator blaring out 'bye bye Boris' to the tune of the similarly titled Bay City Rollers hit, occasionally drowned out by the strains of a marching band practicing in nearby Horse Guards Parade and a helicopter overhead. Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, has a novel take on Boris Johnson's firing of Michael Gove. He tells Sky News that Michael Gove offered Johnson the ""metaphorical bottle of whisky and the revolver"". ""Well clearly Boris has downed the whisky and turned the revolver on Michael Gove. ""Who would have believed it?"" The Tories have a ""patriotic duty"" to conclude the
chaos that has engulfed government,says Conservative MP Tobias Elwood.,external Elwood represents Bournemouth East and is Chair of the House of
Commons Defence Select Committee. He quizzed Johnson earlier at the Liaison Committee meeting. ""We have a patriotic duty to conclude this,"" he
tweeted. ""It's not just damaging the Conservative brand and
diminishing our own electoral prospects it is also undermining the nationâs
standing internationally. ""Britain is better than this."" Meanwhile, there have been three more resignations from Johnson's government. Taking the number of ministers and aides that have resigned - or been sacked - up to at least 41. Danny Krugerhas now resigned as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities - Michael Gove's former department. Kruger says he's ""very sorry indeed to hear Michael Gove has been fired"". James Daly, parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Work and Pensions, resigned from his role ""with great regret"". In aletter,externalDaly says Johnson is ""sadly unable to lead our government"". David Mundellalso resigned from his role as trade envoy to New Zealand. In atweet,externalMundell says he has no confidence in the PM and is ""very disappointed"". We've been hearing from a No 10 source who has been talking about why the PM is staying on. ""There is no lectern outside No 10 tonight... the PM fights on,"" the source says. Any suggestion there's a procession of cabinet ministers telling Johnson to go ""is not true"", the source claims, adding: ""He's called their bluff."" ""He has been spelling out to them [cabinet ministers] that 14 million people voted for him,"" the source says, adding that if the Conservative Party ""want to deprive him [Johnson] doing that job, they have take to take that mandate off them"". The source adds that Johnson explained to cabinet ministers tonight that the options are not ""Boris or no Boris"". Rather, it's about giving Johnson either a ""fresh chancellor and new programme, that Rishi was not prepared to do"" or ""spend months ripping each other apart to elect a leader without a mandate - coalition of chaos and Labour who will break up Britain"". Michael Gove and Boris Johnson worked together on the Vote Leave campaign Michael Gove is a senior and long-standing figure in the Conservative Party and has served in a strong of high-level posts, from his 2010 appointment as Education Secretary onwards. He has been Chief Whip, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Justice Secretary and Environment Secretary, as well as the role he was just sacked from, Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities. Gove worked closely with Johnson on the Vote Leave Brexit campaign. He has remained loyal to Johnson since he became prime minister. However, during the 2016 Conservative leadership race he initially backed Boris Johnson but later dramatically withdrew his backing, announcing he would run himself. That contest was ultimately won by Theresa May. Gove also ran
against Johnson in the 2019 Tory leadership race. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.6430998e-10
"This video can not be played WATCH: People run for safety during a mass shooting at a US Independence Day parade US police have arrested a suspect after six people were killed in a shooting attack on an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois. Robert E Crimo III, 22, was detained after a brief chase, police said. The gunman climbed on to a roof, shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. It is the latest mass shooting to hit the US - there has been one in every week of 2022. President Joe Biden said he was ""shocked"" by the violence. Mr Crimo was detained after a manhunt. He was referred to as a ""person of interest"" in Monday's shooting, but after his arrest police said they believed he was responsible. The gunman began firing at members of the public from the rooftop of a shop at around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT), just a few minutes after the parade began. Tributes paid to victims of 4 July shooting What should have been a day of celebration quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs abandoned as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks or a car backfiring. One man, who was having breakfast at a nearby Starbucks when the shooting happened, told the BBC that 30 people came running into the coffee shop looking for cover. But they all had to be evacuated because they thought the gunman was trying to get in through the back door. Five adults were killed at the scene and one died later in hospital. At least two dozen others were injured. One of those who died has been named as Nicolas Toledo, a man in his late 70s, who was only there because he requires full-time care and his family did not want to miss the event. ""What was supposed to be a fun family day turned into a horrific nightmare for us all,"" his granddaughter Xochil Toledo wrote on GoFundMe. ""As a family we are broken, and numb. Our condolences go out to all the other families who lost a love one today."" Another victim of the shooting has been named as Jacki Sundheim, who was described by her local synagogue as a ""beloved"" member who taught and worshipped there. ""There are no words sufficient to express the depth of our grief for Jacki's death and sympathy for her family and loved ones,""a statement,externalby North Shore Congregation Israel synagogue said. The suspect has been named as Robert E Crimo III No charges have been filed against Mr Crimo and there is no indication of any motive. Social media firms suspended accounts apparently belonging to Mr Crimo, who posted rap videos under an alias as well as videos depicting shootings, gun violence and other violent themes. He also posted pictures of himself draped in a Donald Trump flag and a video of him greeting Mr Trump's motorcade at an airport. The attack in Highland Park comes just a month after deadly shootings in Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, New York. The the Gun Violence Archive, a group tracking gun violence incidents across the US, says there have been almost 250 mass shootings in 2022 alone - defining these as incidents where at least four people are shot. Illinois Governor Jay Robert Pritzker warned that mass shootings were becoming an ""American tradition"". ""There are going to be people who are going to say that today is not the day, that now is not the time to talk about guns. I'm telling you there is no better day and no better time then right here and right now,"" the Democratic governor said. President Biden vowed to keep fighting ""the epidemic of gun violence"" in the country. ""I'm not going to give up,"" he said, speaking outside the White House in Washington. Last week, the president signed the first significant federal bill on gun safety in nearly 30 years. It imposes tougher checks on young buyers and encourages states to remove guns from people considered a threat - but critics say the measures don't go far enough. Were you at the parade?

"The PM has fired Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove, who earlier called for him to resign A No 10 source calls Gove a ""snake"" and insists the PM will ""fight on"" It comes after a group of cabinet ministers - Home Secretary Priti Patel among them - visited the PM to tell him to quit Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart was also said to be in that delegation and has now become the third cabinet minister to resign Attorney General Suella Braverman and ex-minister Matt Hancock have also called for Johnson to go, with Braverman saying she would stand for leader Another group - including Nadine Dorries and Jacob Rees-Mogg - are thought to have been at No 10 to show support for Johnson At least 44 ministers and aides have quit since yesterday when Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak said they were resigning MPs are angry at Johnson's handling of sexual misconduct claims against former deputy chief whip Chris Pincher Edited by Francesca Gillett We're ending our live coverage for today, thanks for following. For our latest story on the government resignations and Boris Johnson's leadership,head here. We'll be back with more live updates on the UK political situation later today. It's been an eventful 24 hours. Given recent developments - from sackings to resignations - we're all in need of a quick round-up of where we're up to on this political saga. Nadhim Zahawi, who was only appointed as chancellor on Tuesday, is ""solidly behind"" the prime minister, Boris Johnson's parliamentary private secretary has told Sky News. Zahawi was earlier reported to have been in No 10 Downing Street as part of a group of cabinet ministers telling Boris Johnson that he should resign. But James Duddridge told Sky News earlier that those reports are ""wrong"" and Zahawi will be announcing a new economic strategy ""some time next week"". Duddridge was emphatic that the PM would ""go on and deliver"". Conservative MP Gareth Davies has quit as parliamentary private secretary to the Department of Health and Social Care. The Grantham and Stamford MP tweeted: ""It is with great regret that I have informed the whips office of my resignation as a PPS at the Department of Health and Social Care. ""It has been a privilege to serve in the role and not a decision I have taken lightly."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With a third of the government gone following the stream of resignations, can it still be described as functioning? Not according to Camilla Cavendish, the former director of the Number 10 Policy Unit. ""The key point here is exactly this - we don't have a functioning government,"" she tells the BBC. ""As of tonight there aren't enough people to keep the business of the government going. Members of Parliament have already been told there aren't even enough people on the bill committees to actually get the legislation through - that is the fundamental business of government."" Cavendish adds: ""He can try in the next few days to bring new people in and there's always bound to be somebody but he is going to run out of road."" Conservative backbencher Bob Seely has been speaking to BBC Radio 4
about Boris Johnsonâs refusal to resign. Speaking to the World Tonight, he said it's not a case of the
calm before the storm, but rather ""the storm before the calm"". He added the political crisis was ""a bit like the end of a
bad relationship - it's just emotionally exhausting"". ""You think well I've tried, it hasnât worked, we've given
it a few years and we need to move on."" Seely has withdrawn his support for Johnson after backing him in
last monthâs vote of confidence. He's now hoping there will be a second vote. Speaking to the BBC, former Conservative minister Margot James criticised Boris Johnson's decision to sack Michael Gove. After losing more than 40 ministers in 24 hours, she said it was ""grossly irresponsible"" to sack ""probably the most competent minister in the whole cabinet"". James added she suspected it was ""active vengeance for what happened three years ago"". In 2016, when David Cameron stepped down, Johnson dropped out of the race for the Conservative leadership bid when Gove - who had previously backed Johnson - announced his own bid. Theresa May went on to win, becoming PM. And in 2019, Gove took Johnson on again, after having previously backed him to replace May when she resigned. Matt Hancock - the former health secretary - says ""it's clear"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs to resign. In an interview with ITV's Robert Peston, Hancock says it's a sad end for Johnson. He adds: ""It's clear whether it's tomorrow or next Tuesday, there's going to be a new prime minister"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This brings the total number of resignations from ministers and aides up to 44. Simon Hart, MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire, had been a part of Boris Johnson's cabinet since 2019. In his resignation letter he said PM will be remembered with ""energy, vision, determination and humour"", Hart said he had never been a ""massive fan of ministerial resignations being the best means of forcing change"". But, he adds, it's now past the point where utmost support to help the PM ""turn the ship around"" is enough. Hart was thought to be among a group of cabinet ministers who reportedly went
into No 10 earlier today to tell Johnson it was time to go. Yesterday, Hart made it made it clear to No 10 that it was ""game over"" but it shouldnât have to come by ministerial resignations.

"The government has said it wants all new public buildings in England to have separate male and female toilets. Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said it was ""vital that women feel safe"" and ""that their needs are respected"". The ""rise in gender-neutral toilets"" meant female users had felt ""unfairly disadvantaged"" and faced longer queues, the government added. But transgender rights groups argue gender-neutral toilets can protect trans people from discrimination. The rights groups say that, along with other people who do not conform to the gender binary, trans people can face intrusive challenges when using male or female toilets. I'm trans so I've never used the school toilets The government announcement draws a distinction between gender-neutral toilets - which have shared waiting and hand-washing facilities along with a number of cubicles - and unisex toilets, which are single, standalone facilities used by both genders. The government says separate unisex - or universal - toilets should be provided in new public buildings if there is space, but should not be installed at the expense of female toilets. It said the revised approach, first mooted last year, would mean women, who may have to use facilities more often, for example because of pregnancy and sanitary needs, were guaranteed ""appropriate facilities"". The government's plans, which will require changes to building regulations and guidance, follow a call for evidence which began in late 2020. A further technical consultation will begin in the autumn, looking at the design of unisex self-contained cubicles to improve privacy, and what improvements are needed for disabled toilets. This video can not be played The government says its review of public toilets will help âensure there is a diversity of provision and facilities for everyone Ms Badenoch said: ""It is vital that women feel safe and comfortable when using public facilities, and that their needs are respected. ""These changes will ensure that separate toilets for men and women are preserved at the same time as providing universal toilets for those that want them. This is a common-sense approach."" The department said the proposed measures would apply to new public buildings over a certain size - which would be determined during the consultation process.

"Monmouth GP Dr Rowena Christmas said Covid was ""still very much with us"" All of Wales' seven health boards are either insisting on or encouraging the use of face masks for hospital visits. Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, has gone further by reinstating a temporary ban on visits. Hywel Dda health board in west and mid Wales is the latest to require use of masks, following a rise in Covid infections. Aneurin Bevan asked people to stay away from its hospitals unless ""absolutely necessary"" due to ""extreme pressure"". The health board did not mention Covid as a reason for this latest appeal. Meanwhile, some year groups at Ysgol Aberconwy, Conwy, arereceiving their lessons online from home,externalthis week due to staff absences relating to Covid. Wales' top doctor, Sir Frank Atherton, reminded people the pandemic had not gone away. ""While we are learning to live safely with it, we still need to think about taking the simple steps to help keep us safe and limit the spread of coronavirus,"" the chief medical officer said. ""The successful roll-out of the vaccine has significantly reduced cases of serious illness, however the virus is still spreading quickly in our communities."" While masks are no longer mandatory, Dr Sir Frank said people should still wear a facemask in health and care settings and in crowded indoor places. Wales has seen a rise in infections in the past month with one in 30 people testing positive, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). This is also reflected in a rise in patients testing positive for Covid in hospital - while more are catching it when in hospital. However, the most recent figures still show 88% of patients testing positive for Covid are primarily being treated for something else. Only 59 (10%) of confirmed Covid patients in acute beds on Monday were being primarily treated for the virus, with 515 patients in hospital being treated for other conditions. Numbers in critical care with Covid have been averaging 16 a day, up from 10 a week ago - half of these were ""incidental"" Covid patients and not treated primarily for the virus. There are 10 times more non-Covid patients in critical care than patients who have Covid, according to Digital Health and Care Wales figures. In Tuesday's First Minister's Questions, Mark Drakeford said that 1,500 NHS staff are currently not in work due to Covid, with a further 600 isolating because they are close contact with cases. Mr Drakeford said that was more than 2% of the NHS Wales workforce, and showed the ""continuing impact"" of the virus. ""Coronavirus has not gone away,"" he told the Senedd. Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan health boards, both in south Wales,asked people to wear masksat their hospitals last month, as did Betsi Cadwaladr health board which covers the north, and Swansea Bay health board. Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest is among the latest to reintroduce the use of face masks Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? Waiting times record, with two years of increases Cardiff and Vale health board followed suit. Powys Teaching health board has required visitors to wear face masks for some time. Aneurin Bevan, which covers Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Monmouthshire, Newport, Torfaen and south Powys, said the emergency department at The Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran ""remains very busy"" on Monday evening. It asked people to attend only if they have ""a life-threatening illness or serious injury"". Anyone with a less serious issue is asked to visit a minor injury unit in Newport, Abergavenny, Ystrad Mynach, or Ebbw Vale. Across Aneurin Bevan last Thursday there were no vacant acute beds at all. In the last few days it has been 98.5% bed occupancy at the health board. That's just 16 available acute beds which are vacant. Hywel Dda is now encouraging staff and contractors to have a lateral flow test, and report the result, twice a week. ""We have made the decision to reinforce these measures at Withybush Hospital to reduce the risk to our patients and staff,"" said Mandy Rayani, director of nursing, quality and patient experience. ""We can all continue to take protective measures to reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-19 to protect vulnerable people and the NHS. People are also asked to attend outpatient clinics alone at Withybush. A designated partner can attend antenatal appointments or scans at Withybush Hospital midwifery-led unit and any visits considered necessary through agreement with a ward sister or charge nurse. Latest figures for Hywel Dda health board showed although the number of testing positive for Covid has risen by 79% in a week, only three patients on average were ""actively"" being treated for Covid in the last week;  97% of positive tests have been ""incidental"" Covid. More than half of Hywel Dda patients who tested positive for Covid in the most recent week had caught the infection in hospital, according to separate Public Health Wales figures. There were 212 ""probable"" and ""definite"" cases of Covid infections caught by patients while in hospital in Wales in the most recent week. This is the highest weekly total since mid-April. 91% of the patients concerned were over 60 and more than half over 80, according to Public Health Wales. 48% of positive tests in hospital are hospital-acquired in the latest week. Monmouth GP Dr Rowena Christmas said Covid was ""still very much with us"" with six residents at one care home testing positive despite its ""best interests to protect everyone"". ""We've got lots and lots of patients with symptoms which that could well be Covid,"" she toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales. ""We've got staff members off sick again, testing positive. ""Right now if we could get our masks back on and, I hate to say this, but avoid hugs and kisses with anyone who isn't our immediate contacts as much as you possibly can."" Little of this will come as a surprise to anyone with a friend, relative or colleague who has recently shared tales of feeling pretty rough, having come down with Covid. But those friends, family and colleagues invariably have jobs in the NHS, schools or local services. You take them out of the mix and we start to feel the pinch again, with hospitals under intense pressure, and schools without enough staff to get by safely. The positives: fewer people are needing to be hospitalised with Covid - in the main, people can cope with the symptoms. But right now, hospitals are already full. We've seen record highs for bed occupancy rates in recent weeks. Why? Well we know there's a backlog of patients waiting for care - but the longer they wait, the worse their conditions become, so their needs become more urgent, meaning many end up in hospital anyway. And getting them out once they're medically well enough is harder if they need additional support on the outside - we know there's a shortage of social care staff - but they too, unsurprisingly, are also being hit by Covid.

"Hospices across the UK are facing up to Â£100m of additional costs this year due to rising inflation and the cost of matching NHS pay, a charity told the BBC. At one provider, Steve Smith, CEO of Havens Hospices in Essex said it expects its energy bills alone to soar by 85% in the next 12 months, from Â£40,500 to around Â£75,000. On top of that, matching NHS rates of pay to recruit and retain staff has pushed up its wage bill up by 37% - an additional Â£2.8m a year. The charity which runs two sites in Southend and Benfleet has simultaneously seen food costs rise, as well as fuel for the vehicles its community teams use. Havens is not the only hospice facing financial uncertainty Hospice UK estimates this works out as an extra Â£500,000 a year, for an average hospice. Like many other hospices about 80% of its income comes from donations. Havens Hospices has two sites in Essex ""That's from people jumping out of aeroplanes, running marathons, holding cake sales and all sorts of other activities,"" he said. ""But we're losing supporters at the moment. People are giving less and can't afford to give regular payments."" As well as looking at other ways to raise money, Mr Smith said Havens was trying to make savings where it could. ""We've looked at getting food supplied to us by donations, we use motion sensors to make sure lights aren't left on, and we're looking at whether we can move to electric vehicles to reduce our fuel costs,"" he said. Amanda-Jane Freemantle has been coming to Fair Havens in Southend for around a year Havens Hospices needs to raise around Â£85,000 a week to provide all their services, which are free to those who use them. As well as inpatient care, they offer counselling, creative workshops and complimentary therapies like massage and reiki. Amanda-Jane Freemantle, who has a congenital heart condition, has been going to Fair Havens in Southend for around a year. ""The complimentary therapies relax me,"" she told the BBC. ""I can bring a family member or friend and they can relax with me as well."" ""It gives me a purpose to go out,"" she added. ""I meet people who have an illness like myself and we are able to chat and have fun. And I learn new skills, which is amazing. Without the funding I wouldn't be able to do all that."" Amanda-Jane is supporting the hospice too, by making pamper packages for the inpatients. Elsewhere, the hospice's staff are helping lead the fundraising efforts. Cost of living adding to GP prescriptions pressure Soaring bills damaging people's health - medics Ward manager Pamela Houghton-Clarke plans to run the London Marathon next year alongside two colleagues. ""It's going to be a challenge, none of us are runners!"" she said. But she and the team are ""very aware"" of the hospice's challenges and keen ""to do our bit"". It's clear that the cost pressures hitting households across the UK could affect how vital hospice services are funded. Mr Smith says Havens is thinking about ""different ways of fundraising and diversifying our income"", a process that's already underway as it looks ahead to the next couple of years. But he acknowledges there could be tough decisions to make. ""The risk is we will need to consider what we are offering and what is the most effective use of the income we receive. We will have to prioritise those services essentially for those who need them most.""

"The drones will carry chemotherapy drugs from the pharmacy at Portsmouth hospital to the Isle of Wight Drones are to be used to courier drugs in a bid to speed up the delivery of vital medicines, the NHS has announced. Chemotherapy drugs will be flown from Portsmouth to a hospital on the Isle of Wight as part of a pilot scheme. NHS England said it was hoped that the technology would lead to ""same-day delivery"" of orders across the country. Chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the scheme, which will also be trialled in Northumbria, was ""extraordinary"". If successful, it's believed the trust would be the first in the world to deliver chemotherapy drugs by drone. Announcing it ahead of the 74th anniversary of the founding of the NHS, she said it was ""clear that the pace of change and improvement across the health service is only accelerating"". ""Delivering chemo by drone is another extraordinary development for cancer patients and shows how the NHS will stop at nothing to ensure people get the treatment they need as promptly as possible - while also cutting costs,"" she added. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he wanted patients to get the best care ""no matter where they live"" The scheme will cut delivery times to the island from four hours to 30 minutes, with one flight replacing two car journeys and one hovercraft or ferry journey per delivery. The drugs will be flown directly from the pharmacy at Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust to St Mary's Hospital, where staff will collect them before distributing it to hospital teams and patients. An NHS England spokesman said chemotherapy drugs were difficult to transport as some doses have a short shelf life. He added that it was hoped the new delivery method, which has been created in partnership with tech company Apian, would offer a better option for cancer patients living on the Isle of Wight, many of whom currently have to travel to the mainland for treatment. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he wanted England to ""become a world leader in cancer care"" and using the drones would mean patients ""will have quicker, fairer access to treatment, no matter where they live"".

"Police have been giving updates on a man held after a mass shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois They say Robert E Crimo III, 21, who is in custody, planned the shooting for several weeks and wore women's clothing to blend into the crowd He purchased his two rifles legally and fired more than 70 rounds, Chris Covelli, crime task force spokesman says The shooting appears to be completely random with no religion or race motives, he adds Two victims have been identified; The family of Nicolas Toledo, from Mexico, paid tribute to a ""loving, adventurous"" man Jacki Sundheim was described as a ""beloved"" staff member by her local synagogue They were among six people killed and more than three dozen injured It was devastating that a celebration of the US was ripped apart by a ""uniquely American plague"", Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker said US President Biden expressed shock and said he would not give up fighting the gun violence âepidemicâ Highland Park sits north of Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan Edited by Claire Heald We're closing our live coverage of the shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park near Chicago. Here are the latest developments:  For the latest updates, read our story here. Our live coverage was provided by Holly Honderich, Max Matza in the US and Alexandra Fouche and Malu Cursino in London. The debate over gun laws arises frequently in the wake of high-profile mass shootings in the US. Tuesday is the 186th day of the year, and the US has already seen 317 mass shootings in 2022. On average, they occur more than 11 times per week, according to the Gun Violence Archive organisation. A mass shooting is defined by the research group as an event in which four or more people are shot or killed, excluding the attacker. The killings in Highland Park have been the most widely-covered attack over the Independence Day weekend, but it is far from the only instance of recent fatal gun crime, which tends to rise in frequency during summer's hotter months. Also on Monday, two police officers were shot at a concert in Philadelphia, triggering panic among people who were there to watch fireworks. In Minneapolis, eight people were shot during an unofficial fireworks celebration. And in Gary, Indiana, three people were killed and seven wounded at a shooting at a holiday party in a residential neighbourhood. Less than 30 miles from Highland Park, 10 people were killed and 62 injured in shootings in Chicago - a drop over last year's total. Semi-automatic rifles, seen here, have been used in several of the country's worst recent shooting sprees This attack comes just weeks after the US Congress passed its first gun control law since 1994. The bipartisan bill came after mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde in Texas triggered lawmakers to finally act. The new law contains several provisions, including allowing the FBI to access juvenile and health records from younger gun buyers aged 18 to 20. The law does not include a provision that gun control campaigners hoped for - raising the age to buy a semi-automatic rifle to 21. Many of the most deadly mass shootings in recent history have occurred using semi-automatic rifles. But the new law comes as the Supreme Court tears down a New York state law that required people to prove a special need in order to carry a gun in public. Their ruling said that all Americans have the right under the Constitution to carry a gun outside their home. State bans on assault rifles are also expected to fall in light of the latest Supreme Court ruling. Here's a quick recap of the developments in the investigation into the Highland Park mass shooting: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot tells reporters she has been in
""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. The two mayors have known each other for three decades,
Lightfoot said, after meeting in law school. ""The minute I understood what had happened I reached out to
her [Rotering] and offered anything that I could do,"" Lightfoot says.
""Unfortunately I have a lot of experience here."" Lightfoot says she offered the support of the Chicago Police
Department, who ""sprang into action"". ""Whatever you need, we will be here for you,"" she
says.  President Joe Biden has ordered the American flag be lowered to half mast at the White House and other government buildings after Monday's shooting. ""As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of gun violence perpetrated on our Independence Day, July 4, 2022, in Highland Park, Illinois, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff,"" the president proclamation says. The flags will fly like that until 9 July. Biden made a similar proclamation just weeks ago, after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. What else did we learn during the Chicago police press conference about Monday's Highland Park attack? Officials said Robert E Crimo was dressed as a woman during the attack to hide his facial tattoos and help him escape in the crowd. The authorities also said they aimed to reveal charges against the suspect on Tuesday afternoon US time. Crime task force spokesman Chris Covelli says at this point authorities have not been able to identify any clear motive for the attack. Asked by reporters about the gunman's weapons, Covelli says Crimo used at least two rifles and pistols. All weapons examined were purchased lawfully by Crimo. Covelli adds that shooting appears to be completely random and there are no reasons to believe the attack was motivated by religion or race. We've been hearing more from the spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, Christopher Covelli. He says Crimo used his mother's car to escape the scene and blended in with the community because he concealed his identity by wearing women's clothing. Covelli adds that a second rifle was located inside Crimo's mother's car. He adds that Crimo remains in custody, and there are no indications he was acting with anyone else. Highland Park's authorities are delivering a news conference about the Fourth of July parade shooting, where six people were killed. Police say Robert E Crimo, 21, planned this attack for several weeks. Christopher Covelli, spokesman for Lake County Major Crime Task Force, says significant amount of information have been obtained from cell phone recordings and other footage. Crimo was dressed in women's clothing to conceal his identity, Covelli says. More than 70 rounds were fired from a legally purchased rifle, Covelli adds. We've heard from US President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the shootings and from the state's governor. Now its the turn of Illinois' lieutenant governor Juliana Stratton who says in atweet,external: ""Enough is enough."" Stratton echoed the governor's statement when he said gun violence was ""our uniquely American plague"". She added: ""I'm angry too. We all should be."" Highland Park's Independence Day shooting killed six people, and left at least three dozen others injured. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is speaking out about the ""horrible tragedy"" in Highland Park. Lightfoot appears with other Illinois lawmakers to discuss a bipartisan bill meant to address gun violence. ""The gun violence epidemic is deep and pervasive,"" she says. ""We saw that play out again in Highland Park yesterday."" Lightfoot says she has been in ""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. Gun violence is not just a Chicago problem, Lightfoot says. ""Gun violence knows no
borders or boundaries."" The bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, is meant to reduce gun violence nationwide. It includes enhanced background checks, a $250m (Â£205m) investment in community violence intervention and $100m for the national background check system. This video can not be played People, who had set up deck chairs in the street to watch the annual Independence Day parade, ran for safety as multiple shots rang out shortly after 1000 local time in Highland Park on 4 July. Toddlers in pushchairs, babes in arms, teenagers and the elderly fled the scene - and the gunfire - in fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones. ""He started shooting again, and we ran behind the building and I put my son in a dumpster,"" recalled one bystander. ""It was just horrible."" Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Illinois Senator Dick Durbin is here to view the remnants of the
Fourth of July parade. The Democrat looks shaken and tells me he is heart-broken
at what's happened. ""Are mass shootings now a tradition in America?"" I ask
him. ""I donât want
it to be but itâs becoming one,"" he sighs He backed recent major gun legislation aimed at addressing US gun
violence. He tells me it was an ""improvement"" but didnât go as far as
it should have. Senator Durbin says we have yet to see whether those new laws
would have stopped the gunman here. Illinois has tough gun laws but overall gun crime is high here. Republicans often point to Chicago as an example of a place
where gun control doesn't work. But some context - a report
in recent years from the city's police department has found a lot of guns come
from outside of Chicago and from neighbouring states like Kentucky and
Tennessee where the gun laws are more lax. The state of Illinois has the sixth strictest gun laws in the US,according to gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety,external. It also has the ninth lowest rate of gun ownership, according to the group. The state has universal background checks and requires firearms to be safely stored - but it does not ban assault weapons. Nancy Rotering, Highland Park's mayor, has told CNN the alleged shooter obtained his weapon legally. She criticised current gun laws, which enable individuals to lawfully purchase weapons. Rotering said: ""That being said, again, if you can have a weekly mass shooting with a legally purchased gun, then I think we need to talk about why those laws aren't protecting the very people that they're supposed to be protecting."" US President Joe Biden signed into law a landmark gun control bill in June, which aims to impose tougher checks on young buyers and encourage states to remove guns from people considered a threat. Robert Crimo, the alleged Independence Day shooter, has not yet been charged. But Rotering said she expects him to be charged today. So far, police have identified him as a ""person of interest"". Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Ken Pell is picking up his granddaughters' scooters. His wife
and family were at the parade and dumped everything for safety. ""I wasn't here, I was at a nearby golf club and got
notification of a shooting. We were then put into a basement for safety. I
couldnât get a signal and I was so panicked as I couldnât get hold of my family
for ages."" His daughter told him to leave the scooters because taking them
back ""would be bad karma"". ""I couldn't do that I wanted to collect them. My grandkids
donât seem too affected at the moment but you know my daughter is not doing
well. She is questioning raising her kids in a place like this."" The motivations of the gunman are unknown. Ken is Jewish and
says this is a predominantly Jewish area so he is worried that's why it may
have been targeted. ""We just never thought we would be hit like this but I
guess neither did Uvalde [the site of a mass school shooting]."" What does the data tell us about gun culture in the US and its impact? Here are some key charts. How many guns are there in the US? While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based leading research project - estimate that there were 390 million guns in circulation in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. How do US gun killings compare with other countries?  Nearly 53 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US, according to the official data from 2020. The data also shows that the vast majority of murders, 79%, were carried out with guns. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries Who supports gun control?  Despite widespread and vocal public outrage - often in the wake of gun violence - American support for stricter gun laws in 2020 fell to the lowest level since 2014,according to polling by Gallup,external. Only 52% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun laws, while 35% said they should remain the same. The issue is also one that is hyper-partisan - the Gallup study noted that Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans agreed with the same statement. See more key data and charts here The Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, was scheduled to include floats, marching bands, and community entertainment as part of the city's Fourth of July celebrations. But around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT) - just a few minutes after the parade had begun - a gunman who had climbed on to a roof near the parade route began shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. What should have been one of the happiest days of the year quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs left discarded on the street as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks. Police later recovered ""evidence of a firearm"" from the rooftop of a shop near to the parade route Five adults were killed at the scene, as well as a further victim who the local coroner said died in a nearby hospital. At least three dozen others were injured. At least eight victims remain in hospitals across Chicagoland (the Chicago metropolitan area) following yesterday's shooting, Jim
Anthony, spokesman for the North Shore University hospital group says. He did not provide updates on the patients' conditions. Thirty-eight patients were initially admitted for treatment after the parade, Anthony said, at three of the group's hospitals: Evanston Hospital, Glenbrook Hospital and Highland Park Hospital. ""We were able to mobilise quickly,"" Anthony said. ""Our physicians and nurses and medical support
staff train for situations like this, not that we ever want to see them in real
life."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99999297
"This video can not be played WATCH: People run for safety during a mass shooting at a US Independence Day parade US police have arrested a suspect after six people were killed in a shooting attack on an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois. Robert E Crimo III, 22, was detained after a brief chase, police said. The gunman climbed on to a roof, shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. It is the latest mass shooting to hit the US - there has been one in every week of 2022. President Joe Biden said he was ""shocked"" by the violence. Mr Crimo was detained after a manhunt. He was referred to as a ""person of interest"" in Monday's shooting, but after his arrest police said they believed he was responsible. The gunman began firing at members of the public from the rooftop of a shop at around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT), just a few minutes after the parade began. Tributes paid to victims of 4 July shooting What should have been a day of celebration quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs abandoned as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks or a car backfiring. One man, who was having breakfast at a nearby Starbucks when the shooting happened, told the BBC that 30 people came running into the coffee shop looking for cover. But they all had to be evacuated because they thought the gunman was trying to get in through the back door. Five adults were killed at the scene and one died later in hospital. At least two dozen others were injured. One of those who died has been named as Nicolas Toledo, a man in his late 70s, who was only there because he requires full-time care and his family did not want to miss the event. ""What was supposed to be a fun family day turned into a horrific nightmare for us all,"" his granddaughter Xochil Toledo wrote on GoFundMe. ""As a family we are broken, and numb. Our condolences go out to all the other families who lost a love one today."" Another victim of the shooting has been named as Jacki Sundheim, who was described by her local synagogue as a ""beloved"" member who taught and worshipped there. ""There are no words sufficient to express the depth of our grief for Jacki's death and sympathy for her family and loved ones,""a statement,externalby North Shore Congregation Israel synagogue said. The suspect has been named as Robert E Crimo III No charges have been filed against Mr Crimo and there is no indication of any motive. Social media firms suspended accounts apparently belonging to Mr Crimo, who posted rap videos under an alias as well as videos depicting shootings, gun violence and other violent themes. He also posted pictures of himself draped in a Donald Trump flag and a video of him greeting Mr Trump's motorcade at an airport. The attack in Highland Park comes just a month after deadly shootings in Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, New York. The the Gun Violence Archive, a group tracking gun violence incidents across the US, says there have been almost 250 mass shootings in 2022 alone - defining these as incidents where at least four people are shot. Illinois Governor Jay Robert Pritzker warned that mass shootings were becoming an ""American tradition"". ""There are going to be people who are going to say that today is not the day, that now is not the time to talk about guns. I'm telling you there is no better day and no better time then right here and right now,"" the Democratic governor said. President Biden vowed to keep fighting ""the epidemic of gun violence"" in the country. ""I'm not going to give up,"" he said, speaking outside the White House in Washington. Last week, the president signed the first significant federal bill on gun safety in nearly 30 years. It imposes tougher checks on young buyers and encourages states to remove guns from people considered a threat - but critics say the measures don't go far enough. Were you at the parade?
