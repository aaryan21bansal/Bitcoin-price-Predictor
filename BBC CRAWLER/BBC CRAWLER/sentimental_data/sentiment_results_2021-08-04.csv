"This video can not be played Children aged 16-17 should be vaccinated ""as fast as practically possible"", Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says All 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK will start being offered a first dose of the Covid jab within weeks, after a recommendation from vaccine experts. They will not need parental consent and will receive the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation said on Wednesday. Advice on when to offer the second dose will come later, the JCVI added. The change in guidance means around 1.4 million teenagers will be eligible. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, said there were plenty of vaccines available, adding: ""We have the supply and I'm expecting this to start in a very short number of weeks indeed."" ""There is no time to waste in getting on with this,"" he said, highlighting that children will start going back to sixth forms and colleges soon. ""I want us to proceed as fast as is practically possible."" How many people have been vaccinated so far? Should all children get a Covid vaccine? The JCVI is a group of independent experts and their advice is a recommendation upon which governments then act. England,Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandhave all confirmed they will follow it. Until now, children over 12 have been able to get a jab if they have certain health conditions, live with others who are at a high risk or are nearing their 18th birthday. The only vaccine currently approved for under-18s in the UK is Pfizer-BioNTech. Some other countries have already been routinely vaccinating children over 12. The US has been doing so from May, as well as some European countries, such as France and Italy, after EU regulators gave them the go-ahead. Other countries that are vaccinating children include Brazil, Japan, Israel and Hong Kong. Last month, the JCVI stopped short of opening up jabs to 16 and 17-year-olds as it wanted time to examine the risks and benefits, as well as reports of rare adverse effects such as inflammation of heart muscles. But on Wednesday it said these events were ""extremely rare"" and usually occurred within a few days of a second dose, typically more in young men. Data from the US suggests that in males aged 12 to 17 years 9.8 cases of myocarditis were reported per million first doses given. This rises to 67 per million after the second dose. Most people recovered quickly. The JCVI said it expected one dose of the vaccine would give the 16 and 17-year-old age group good protection against severe illness and around 80% protection against hospitalisation. This video can not be played 16 and 17-year-olds on Weston-super-Mare seafront say if they would get the vaccine Prof Wei Shen Lim, who chairs the Covid part of the JCVI, said the change in advice was not just for the benefit of wider society, but for teenagers themselves. ""While Covid-19 is typically mild or asymptomatic in most young people, it can be very unpleasant for some,"" he said. On whether to roll out jabs to over-12s, he said the JCVI will review the data but it is a decision they ""prefer not to make at this point"". After the announcement, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to ""listen to the JCVI"" and get the jab. ""They are extremely expert, they're amongst the best, if not the best in the world - they know what's safe and I think we should listen to them and take our lead from them,"" he said. The ambition is still two, but the route to getting there is fuzzy. The advice today is to give 16 and 17-year-olds their first dose and then wait for more details. One reason is the risk of inflamed heart tissue (myocarditis or pericarditis) is higher after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The JCVI says one dose will still give children significant protection against Covid, especially if they have already caught the virus. And that the high uptake in vulnerable older adults means it can afford to go more slowly, and wait for more evidence on the risks, in the young. A longer gap between the two doses would lead to more protection in the end. However, it looks unlikely they will be fully immunised before the return to school in September. Almost all children and young people are at a very low risk of being seriously ill with Covid.New research suggestsmost children who become ill with coronavirus recover within less than a week. But they can act as a reservoir of virus and pass it on to their friends, classmates, families and other vulnerable adults. The move to vaccinate children is likely to have its critics, as much of the world is far behind in their vaccine rollouts, with millions of adults still at risk of serious illness or death. Some argue that the doses given to children would save more lives if they were given to health workers and vulnerable adults in poorer countries. The World Health Organization has urged wealthy countries to share more of its vaccines, and sooner. The UK has pledged to donate more than 100 million leftover doses via the Covax scheme and through direct country-to-country donations. It sent a first batch of nine million doses last week. ""Vaccination of teenagers may have a major effect on the return of Covid next winter, assuming that the rates will drop this summer. Full vaccination takes time, so the sooner we start the sooner this age group will be protected."" -Prof Peter Openshaw, Imperial College London Dr Peter English, former chair of the BMA public health medicine committee, queried why they had not gone further, sooner: ""Why they did not recommend vaccinating 12 plus-year-olds outside risk groups in mid-July, and why it seems they will restrict their recommendation to people aged 16 plus today, are questions that remain unanswered to my satisfaction."" ""This step is particularly useful now as high vaccination levels are concentrating infection amongst the unvaccinated children and teenagers."" -Prof Russell Viner, University College London ""The moral failure... is to allow people to die around the world, whilst we vaccinate people who are at extremely low risk of of serious disease or death or even zero risk."" -Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who says teenagers should not be a priority when there are ""plenty of other people who are at serious risk of death"". A further 29,312 cases of people testing positive for coronavirus were recorded in the UK on Wednesday and 119 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. So far, 73% of adults in the UK have received two jabs, and more than 88% have had a first dose. All over-18s have now been offered the vaccine. NHS data for England shows 223,755 under-18s have received a first vaccine dose since the rules were changed last month. Last month, there were suggestions that vaccines could become compulsory for university students moving to halls of residence, but ministershave since shelved that idea. There are alsoplans to offer booster jabsfor those aged 50 and over later this year. SHOULD YOU GET BACK WITH YOUR EX?:Can a relationship with an ex ever really work?

"Research into people's experiences of so-called conversion therapy in the UK has been buried, campaigners say. A report - commissioned over two years ago - hit minsters' desks last December, the BBC has discovered, but has yet to appear. Boris Johnson has promised to ban what he called the ""abhorrent"" practice of conversion therapy. The government says the study will be published shortly when a consultation is launched. Conversion therapy is defined as an attempt to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity, according toa document signed by a number of health groups,external. The prime ministersaid in July 2020he would put a stop to the practice. In the same interview, he said a study was examining ""how prevalent"" it was, adding: ""We will then bring forward plans to ban it"". What is conversion therapy and will it be banned? Groups criticise conversion therapy 'Groundhog Day' Act now on LGBT+ conversion therapy, ministers urged Research funded by the Government Equalities Office was commissioned when Theresa May was in Downing Street. It was led by Adam Jowett, of Coventry University's Psychological, Social and Behavioural Sciences department. In April 2019,the project called for people to share their first-hand experiences,externalof conversion therapy, ""whether it happened in a medical, commercial or faith-based context"". But the findings have never been published despite a Freedom of Information request by the BBC showing that a final draft was received on 15 December 2020. Dr Jowett, who also chairs the British Psychological Society's sexualities section, called in May this yearfor a conversion therapy ban to be implemented ""as soon as possible"".,external Coventry University has been approached for comment. Matt Hyndman, co-founder of the Ban Conversion Therapy campaign group, said the report should have been published back in January. ""It sounds like it's just been buried in a drawer somewhere and it's not that urgent."" Campaigners have previouslyclaimed the government has ""dragged its feet"" on the issue. Mr Hyndman said: ""If they've commissioned a study which says conversion therapy is happening and it's quite severe and they've been delaying to ban it, it's not a good look."" He added he didn't think more information was needed to move ahead with a ban. ""We have so many stories of people and organisations that can attest to the harm it causes."" It was confirmed in May's Queen's Speech that conversion therapy would be banned in England and Wales. But the government said a public consultation would take place first, in September, to ask how the legislation can best stop the practice while protecting the medical profession, defending freedom of speech and upholding religious freedom. A government spokesperson said: ""Our approach is based on a range of evidence, which we will publish alongside the consultation, including the Coventry University report."" Some groups had welcomed the consultation, including the Evangelical Alliance which represents 3,500 churches. Its UK director, Peter Lynas, said at the time that they wanted to avoid a situation where ""a person can be accused of conversion therapy for praying with someone who freely chooses and asks for prayer"". The Royal College of Psychiatrists has said it would be taking part to highlight why conversion therapy is ""harmful"" but also ""to ensure clinicians can still help people fully explore their gender identity where appropriate."" The UK government indicated that the consultation will be short, with legislation to follow ""as soon as possible"". Whilst the legislation would apply to Wales the Welsh Government said it would ""if necessary"" seek additional powers in order to ban ""all aspects"" of the practice. The Scottish government says conversion therapy is an ""abhorrent practice"" and that it's waiting on details of the UK government's proposals. Northern Ireland's Department for Communities said that the ""inhumane"" practice should be ended and that the minister ""wishes to explore all legislative options"".

"Adrian Underwood died when the ship was hit on Thursday A British security guard killed in a drone attack on a ship off the coast of Oman has been named. Adrian Underwood and the merchant tanker's Romanian captain died when the MV Mercer Street was hit on Thursday. The UK, US and Israel have blamed Iran, which denies responsibility. Mr Underwood served in the British Army and was working for a Hereford-based security company, Ambrey, when he was killed. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the incident on behalf of a coroner. MT Mercer Street is managed by the London-based company Zodiac Maritime. The private maritime security guard's name was revealed by a newspaper in Fiji, the country of his birth, and later confirmed by sources in Britain. Ambrey said the former soldier had a distinguished record of service in the British Army. It said his qualities were quickly recognised and he had been promoted to team leader. The explosive-laden drone blew up close to the bridge. The Mercer Street was attacked off the coast of Oman Britain, the US, Israel and Romania have blamed Iran, promising a co-ordinated response. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Chief of Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter said Iran had made a big mistake with the incident and that it needed to be deterred from attacking shipping. He said: ""Convoys may not necessarily be the right method, we've used other methods, and ultimately we've got to keep reviewing this. ""But ultimately, we have got to restore deterrence because it is behaviour like that which leads to escalation, and that could very easily lead to miscalculation and would be very disastrous for all the peoples of the Gulf and the international community."" Latest news from the West Midlands The UK's Maritime Trade Operations unit, which monitors security in the Gulf region, has warned ship operators to be extra vigilant in the Gulf of Oman. A second tanker was attacked on Tuesday, but the two events appeared to be unrelated, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said. Up to nine armed men are reported to have boarded a medium-sized tanker in the Gulf of Oman. But less than 24 hours later they had left the ship to go on its way. Maritime sources believe this event may have been related to criminal networks and smuggling. Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"The Mexican government has sued some of the biggest US gun manufacturers, accusing them of fuelling bloodshed through reckless business practices. The lawsuit alleges that the companies knew they were contributing to illegal arms trafficking, which has been linked to many deaths. Officials say Mexico is seeking as much as $10bn (Â£7.2bn) in compensation, though any amount would be decided by the court. The companies have not yet commented. They include Smith & Wesson and Barrett Firearms, among others. The BBC has contacted both companies for comment. The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in the US state of Massachusetts. It says the Mexican government took the action ""to put an end to the massive damage that the [companies] cause by actively facilitating the unlawful trafficking of their guns to drug cartels and other criminals in Mexico"". This video can not be played The deadly trade killing Mexicans and Americans The gun manufacturers ""are conscious of the fact that their products are trafficked and used in illicit activities against the civilian population and authorities of Mexico"", the Foreign Ministry said in a document related to the lawsuit. Mexico said the companies had used ""marketing strategies to promote weapons that are ever more lethal, without mechanisms of security or traceability"". Mexican officials said that some of the guns made by Colt appeared to target the Mexican market in particular, such as a pistol engraved with the face and name of Mexican revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata. Mexico has strict rules regulating the sale of weapons and they can only be purchased legally at one shop located on an army base in the capital. As a result, those who want to buy weapons often get them from the US. According to a Mexican government statement, criminal organisations buy thousands of pistols, rifles, assault weapons and ammunition in supermarkets, on the internet and at arms fairs in the US which are then used to commit crimes in Mexico. The US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives found that 70% of firearms recovered in Mexico between 2014 and 2018 which were submitted for tracing had come from the US. In 2019 alone, more than 17,000 murders in Mexico were linked to trafficked weapons. Could this become Mexico's bloodiest year on record? One official told reporters the damage caused by trafficked guns would be equal to around 1.7% of Mexico's gross domestic product (GDP). Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said: ""We are going to win the trial and we are going to drastically reduce illicit arms trafficking to Mexico."" Mexican officials stressed that the lawsuit was not aimed at the US government. Mr Ebrard said he believed that President Joe Biden's administration was willing to work with Mexico to curb arms trafficking. But experts have cast doubt on Mexico's likelihood of success with the lawsuit. Lorenzo Meyer, an emeritus professor at the College of Mexico, told AFP news agency that US law ""makes it almost impossible for gun manufacturers to be held responsible"" for the illegal trade.

"A sprawling network of more than 350 fake social media profiles is pushing pro-China narratives and attempting to discredit those seen as opponents of China's government, according to a new study. The aim is to delegitimise the West and boost China's influence and image overseas, the report by the Centre for Information Resilience (CIR) suggests. The study,external, shared with the BBC, found that the network of fake profiles circulated garish cartoons depicting, among others, exiled Chinese tycoon Guo Wengui, an outspoken critic of China. Other controversial figures featured in the cartoons included ""whistleblower"" scientist Li-Meng Yan, and Steve Bannon, former political strategist for Donald Trump. Each of these individuals has themselves been accused of spreading disinformation, including false information about Covid-19. The cartoons shared seek to ridicule (left-right) Bannon, Li-Meng Yan and Guo Wengui Some of the accounts - spread across Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube - use fake AI-generated profile pictures, while others appear to have been hijacked after previously posting in other languages. There is no concrete evidence that the network is linked to the Chinese government, but according to the CIR, a non-profit group which works to counter disinformation, it resembles pro-China networks previously taken down by Twitter and Facebook. These networks amplified pro-China narratives similar to those promoted by Chinese state representatives and state media. Much of the content shared by the network focuses on the US, and in particular on divisive issues like gun laws and race politics. One of the narratives pushed by the network paints the US as having a poor human rights record. Posts from the fake accounts cite the murder of George Floyd among examples, as well as discrimination against Asians. This account has since been suspended by Twitter for violating its rules Some accounts repeatedly deny human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region, where experts say China has detained at least a million Muslims against their will, calling the allegations ""lies fabricated by the United States and the West"". ""The aim of the network appears to be to delegitimise the West by amplifying pro-Chinese narratives,"" said Benjamin Strick, the author of the CIR report. There are strong similarities between this network and the so-called ""Spamouflage Dragon,external"" propaganda network identified by social analytics firm Graphika. Commenting on the new study Ira Hubert, a senior investigative analyst at Graphika, said: ""The report shows that on US platforms, there was no 'honeymoon' in the first months of the Biden administration. ""The network put out a steady mix of anti-US content, for example cheering US 'defeat' ahead of its withdrawal from Afghanistan and painting the US as a poor ally whose aid to India was inadequate during some of its worst months battling Covid."" The CIR mapped hashtags favoured by previously identified networks, unearthing more accounts that showed signs of being part of an influence operation. Tell-tale signs included high levels of activity pushing propaganda narratives and repeated use of the same hashtags. Newly created accounts, accounts with usernames that appeared to be randomly generated, and accounts with very few followers also raised red flags. The foreigners in China's disinformation drive Inside the pro-China network targeting the US, Hong Kong and an exiled tycoon Going undercover to infiltrate Chinese-American far-right networks Some profiles were created to post original content, while others only shared, liked and commented on those original posts, to help them reach a wider audience. This kind of activity is often referred to as ""astroturfing"" because it is designed to create the appearance of a grass-roots campaign. The study visualises how different accounts amplify each other - each small node represents a Twitter account Many of the fake profiles used AI generated photos - a relatively new phenomenon that allows computers to create realistic looking images of people who don't exist. Unlike stolen profile images of real people, the AI generated images, which are created by a type of machine learning framework called StyleGAN, cannot be traced using a reverse image search. The use of fake profile pictures in disinformation campaigns is becoming more common as users and platforms become more wary of suspicious accounts. The CIR used various techniques to identify fake profile pictures in the network. The synthetic images always put the eyes in the same location, so lining them all up can help identify a collection of fake profile pictures. Normally, a random collection of profile pictures would display much more variety in the cropping and the alignment of the eyes. The network uses images of people who do not exist Other signs include blurred edges around the hair, teeth at strange angles, and blurred objects around the face. Many of the Facebook accounts believed to be part of the network appeared to have Turkish names. These accounts may once have belonged to real people but were later hijacked or sold and given new profile pictures. Hijacked accounts also spread the network's pro-China narratives on YouTube. Accounts that had previously posted in English or German and then lain dormant for years suddenly started posting Chinese language content from official Chinese state broadcasters. The report found spam Tweets using the same text, tags and images all uploaded on the same day The CIR shared its research with the social media platforms involved. Facebook has removed the accounts on its platform highlighted in the study. A Facebook spokesman said: ""In September 2019, we removed a network of spam activity that posted lifestyle and political clickbait, primarily in Chinese. This network had almost no engagement on our platform, and we continue to work with researchers and our industry peers to detect and block their attempts to come back, like those accounts mentioned in this report."" YouTube also terminated accounts in the network for violating YouTube's community guidelines. Twitter said it had also now removed almost all of the accounts identified by CIR, as well as a number of others engaged in similar behaviour. It said its investigations are still ongoing. ""When we identify information operation campaigns that we can reliably attribute to state-linked activity - either domestic or foreign-led - we disclose them to ourpublic archive,external."" Over the past decade, billions of dollars have gone into funding the growth of China's presence on international platforms. But with Facebook, Twitter and YouTube blocked in the mainland, and only accessible via a VPN, the country has struggled to get such platforms recognised as viable competitors to Western juggernauts. It has needed not only Chinese voices, but foreign voices, to show that the country has ""arrived"". ""Wolf warrior diplomacy"" has emerged, with officials using Twitter accounts to fly the flag for Communist Party rhetoric. China wants to portray itself as a friend to the world - and not a repressive, authoritarian state, as it perceives Western nations make it out to be. With more than one billion internet users, China certainly has the capability to orchestrate large-scale social media campaigns, and target what it sees as anti-China voices with a wealth of opposing opinions. But with English-language skills limited in China, there are often clumsy tell-tale signs that a Chinese troll is behind such accounts. Many rely on automatic translation software to turn Chinese messages into English, meaning such messages are riddled with typos, or contain clumsy grammatical structures. And with many Western outlets inaccessible to them within China, users generally have very little knowledge of who they are meant to be targeting, so they simply piggyback off the replies of others from within the same network.

"Lee Collins' partner told the inquest he had drunk alcohol ""every single day"" for the past 10 years A footballer took his own life and had cocaine in his system when he was found dead in a hotel room, an inquest heard. Yeovil Town captain Lee Collins, 32,was discoveredby the club's assistant manager Terry Skiverton on 31 March after he did not arrive for training. He had been ""struggling with injuries and personal problems"", including the break-up of a relationship, Taunton Coroners' Court was told. Senior Somerset coroner Tony Williams recorded a conclusion of suicide. Mr Collins began his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers and spent time at Port Vale, Barnsley, Northampton Town, Mansfield Town and Forest Green Rovers, before joining Yeovil Town in 2019. He had battled long-term alcohol problems as well as a gambling habit and the recreational use of cocaine before his death, Mr Williams told the hearing. Tributes were left outside Yeovil Town's Huish Park ground after Mr Collins' death was announced Toxicology tests revealed alcohol and cocaine in Mr Collins' system when he was found at the Lanes Hotel, West Coker, Somerset. In a statement to the inquest, his partner Rachel Gibbon said Mr Collins, from Newport, South Wales, was a ""gentle giant, the kindest most generous man you could have met"", but there were two sides to his ""very complex character"". ""I begged him to get help but he would get aggressive, verbally aggressive,"" Ms Gibbon's statement said. ""I could not have physically dragged him to the doctors. He did not want help."" Ms Gibbon said her partner was ""the joker, the class clown"" but he was also ""insecure and anxious"" with an addictive personality. Mr Collins would drink six bottles of cider and two bottles of wine a day, and had begun drinking spirits too, her statement continued. ""For the last 10 years he would drink every single day, strong cider. ""Lee was your captain, your leader. For us he was our safe place, our best friend,"" Ms Gibbon added. Lee Collins began his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers and spent time at Port Vale, Barnsley, Northampton Town, Mansfield Town and Forest Green Rovers His friend Paul Broadhead said Mr Collins had suffered with his mental health in the past few years despite being the ""joker and life and soul of the party"". He said Mr Collins worried about paying bills and what he would do when his football career ended. Yeovil Town assistant manager Mr Skiverton said Mr Collins had been happy during a training session the day before his death but had been struggling with injuries and personal problems. Manager of the National League club, Darren Sarll, said Mr Collins had recently separated with Ms Gibbon and was ""an inconsistent character"" who had not turned up for training in the past. Mr Collins played his last game for the club on 6 February against Stockport.

"This video can not be played 'Fantastic' Sky Brown takes bronze to become youngest GB medallist Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Thirteen-year-old Sky Brown earned a momentous skateboarding bronze to become Great Britain's youngest Olympic medallist as victories in sailing and showjumping on Wednesday took Team GB's gold medal tally to 15. Hannah Mills and Eilidh McIntyre clinched gold in the 470 class, makingMills the most successful female Olympic sailorof all time after her gold in Rio five years ago and silver at London 2012. Ben Maher then won gold inthe individual showjumping eventon board Explosion W after a dramatic six-horse jump-off. Boxer Ben Whittaker secured a men's light-heavyweight silver medal after Frazer Clarke took bronze in the men's super-heavyweight division. With six medals guaranteed in Tokyo this is Britain's most successful Olympics in the boxing ring since 1920, when just 12 nations took part. Meanwhile, Canada's Andre de Grasse won his first gold and fifth Olympic medal overall as he overhauled world champion Noah Lyles in themen's 200m final. Great Britain moved up to fourth in the standings after winning two golds on Wednesday Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table The first of GB's five medals on day 12 came from Brown, born a month before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. She fell on her first two runs in the women's park skateboarding final beforeposting a score of 56.47 to make the podium. The teenager replaces Sarah Hardcastle as Britain's youngest summer Games medal winner - the swimmer was 15 years and 113 days when she won silver and bronze in Los Angeles at the 1984 Olympics. At 13 years and 28 days, Brown also breaks Margery Hinton's 93-year-old record as the country's youngest competitor and claims Team GB's first skateboarding medal. This video can not be played Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson pulls up injured in women's heptathlon 200m But there was a heartbreaking end to world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson's heptathlon medal hopes. The 28-year-old, who was battling to overcome a left Achilles problem before the Games,sat fifth after three eventsbut pulled up with a right calf injury in the 200m and was disqualified from the race for leaving her lane. Meanwhile,Jason Kennystarted the defence of his Olympic sprint title with three victories in the opening rounds, as team-mate Jack Carlin also progressed and Katy Marchant reached the women's keirin quarter-finals. Carlin GB's best chance of sprint medal, says Kenny Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Nielsen Gracenote said: ""Great Britain have closed the gap with the Rio and London Olympics and now have 48 medals after 12 days of competition compared to 49 in 2016 and 48 in 2012. ""However, at both of those Olympics, sailing, taekwondo and triathlon were still going on in the last four days of the Games so expect 2021 to fall behind again on total medals won."" Who are Team GB's medal winners? How are GB athletes performing in Tokyo? Brown beat the previous record of Team GB's youngest Olympic medal winner by more than two years while also becoming the youngest competitor at a summer Games for her country. Hinton was 13 years and 44 days when she swam at the Amsterdam Games in 1928, and that landmark stood for almost a century. Until Wednesday, that is, when Brown - 16 days younger - began her women's park skateboarding campaign at Ariake Urban Sports Park. Had the Games not been postponed by a year, Brown would have lowered that summer record further, though figure skater Cecilia Colledge retains the overall accolade for Britain - she entered the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid aged 11. Brown qualified for the final but fell during her opening two runs to set up a tense final attempt. But the Japan-born teenager - who had a heavy fall in training last year that saw her fracture her skull, break her left arm and wrist, and suffer lacerations to her heart and lungs - delivered a score of 56.47 to climb into the bronze-medal position.

All the girls are ripping it, it was insane, it was a super-sick final."" Japan's Sakura Yosozumi, 19, won gold with a best score of 60.09, while 12-year-old compatriot Kokona Hiraki claimed silver with 59.04. Britain's stellar Olympics continued on the water,with Mills and McIntyre's successtaking the nation's sailing medal tally to five, of which three of those are gold. The GB pair finished fifth in the 470 medal race, but their earlier performances meant it was enough to hold off silver medallists Poland and France in bronze. Their celebrations were put on ice briefly after a protest was lodged by bronze-medallists France. But 33-year-old Mills, one of Team GB's flag bearers at the opening ceremony, did not have to wait long to have her third Olympic medal confirmed. This video can not be played Team GB sailors Mills and McIntyre win 470 gold ""It's absolutely mad,"" said Mills. ""Growing up, like a lot of Olympians, I dreamed of being here one day and standing on top of the podium. ""To do it twice with Saskia [Clark] and with Eilidh this time, I've had two incredible crews to sail with and I feel incredibly lucky."" McIntyre follows in the footsteps of her father, Mike, who won gold in the star class at Seoul in 1988. Earlier, Britain's Chris Grube and Luke Patience finished fifth overall in the men's 470. Maher's showjumping gold gives the British equestrian team a fifth Olympic medal in Tokyo, equalling their record haul achieved in London. It follows gold for the eventing team and Tom McEwen's individual eventing silver, plus team dressage bronze and Charlotte Dujardin's individual dressage bronze. Maher, 38, was thrust into a six-horse jump-off and completed his run in 37.85 to pip Sweden's Peder Fredricson by 17-hundredths of a second, with the Netherlands' Maikel van der Vleuten taking bronze. It is a second Olympic medal for Maher after winning gold in the team jumping event at London 2012.

Whittaker lost the light-heavyweight final on a split decision as Lopez added the title to the middleweight gold he won at Rio 2016. ""You don't win silver, you lose gold,"" said an emotional Whittaker. ""I'm very disappointed with myself, I didn't perform well. Of course, he's a class operator - two-time Olympic gold medallist now but I'm very disappointed. I feel like a failure.

"She was blocked from the app for sharing videos of the Games Olympic gold medallist sprinter Elaine Thompson-Herah was mistakenly blocked on Instagram, its owner Facebook Inc has confirmed. Thompson-Herah, the fastest woman in the world, was blocked on Tuesday for sharing videos from her 100 and 200 metre races on her Instagram account. Her access to the app was reinstated several hours later. There are strict copyright restrictions on sharing content from the Games online. Thompson-Herahsaid on Twitter that she was blocked from accessing her account,externalbecause she posted videos that she ""did not have the right to do so"". A spokesperson for Facebook told Reuters news agency that while the content had been removed, the suspension had been wrongly applied. International Olympic Committee (IOC) guidelines mandate that athletes must not post Olympic Games content containing audio and video of the sporting event or medal ceremony. This is because a set number of broadcasters hold exclusive rights to broadcast the Games. Their rights include distribution on social media. However athletes ""are invited to share the content"" posted by these broadcasters on their accounts, the IOC told Reuters. Any content that breaks these rules is removed immediately. It is not clear where the footage the sprinter posted came from. For the time period that includes the 2018 Pyeongchang winter Olympics and the Tokyo Games, the IOC is set to receive more than $4bn (Â£2.8bn) in broadcasting rights. The majority of the money goes back into the Games and supporting sports and athletes. Thompson-Herah secured an unprecedented 100m - 200m double-double. She recorded 21.53 seconds in the 200m, just 0.19 seconds off Florence Griffith-Joyner's long-standing world record. Thompson-Herah is set to compete on Friday in the 4x100m relay final.

"This video can not be played Children aged 16-17 should be vaccinated ""as fast as practically possible"", Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says All 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK will start being offered a first dose of the Covid jab within weeks, after a recommendation from vaccine experts. They will not need parental consent and will receive the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation said on Wednesday. Advice on when to offer the second dose will come later, the JCVI added. The change in guidance means around 1.4 million teenagers will be eligible. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, said there were plenty of vaccines available, adding: ""We have the supply and I'm expecting this to start in a very short number of weeks indeed."" ""There is no time to waste in getting on with this,"" he said, highlighting that children will start going back to sixth forms and colleges soon. ""I want us to proceed as fast as is practically possible."" How many people have been vaccinated so far? Should all children get a Covid vaccine? The JCVI is a group of independent experts and their advice is a recommendation upon which governments then act. England,Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandhave all confirmed they will follow it. Until now, children over 12 have been able to get a jab if they have certain health conditions, live with others who are at a high risk or are nearing their 18th birthday. The only vaccine currently approved for under-18s in the UK is Pfizer-BioNTech. Some other countries have already been routinely vaccinating children over 12. The US has been doing so from May, as well as some European countries, such as France and Italy, after EU regulators gave them the go-ahead. Other countries that are vaccinating children include Brazil, Japan, Israel and Hong Kong. Last month, the JCVI stopped short of opening up jabs to 16 and 17-year-olds as it wanted time to examine the risks and benefits, as well as reports of rare adverse effects such as inflammation of heart muscles. But on Wednesday it said these events were ""extremely rare"" and usually occurred within a few days of a second dose, typically more in young men. Data from the US suggests that in males aged 12 to 17 years 9.8 cases of myocarditis were reported per million first doses given. This rises to 67 per million after the second dose. Most people recovered quickly. The JCVI said it expected one dose of the vaccine would give the 16 and 17-year-old age group good protection against severe illness and around 80% protection against hospitalisation. This video can not be played 16 and 17-year-olds on Weston-super-Mare seafront say if they would get the vaccine Prof Wei Shen Lim, who chairs the Covid part of the JCVI, said the change in advice was not just for the benefit of wider society, but for teenagers themselves. ""While Covid-19 is typically mild or asymptomatic in most young people, it can be very unpleasant for some,"" he said. On whether to roll out jabs to over-12s, he said the JCVI will review the data but it is a decision they ""prefer not to make at this point"". After the announcement, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to ""listen to the JCVI"" and get the jab. ""They are extremely expert, they're amongst the best, if not the best in the world - they know what's safe and I think we should listen to them and take our lead from them,"" he said. The ambition is still two, but the route to getting there is fuzzy. The advice today is to give 16 and 17-year-olds their first dose and then wait for more details. One reason is the risk of inflamed heart tissue (myocarditis or pericarditis) is higher after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The JCVI says one dose will still give children significant protection against Covid, especially if they have already caught the virus. And that the high uptake in vulnerable older adults means it can afford to go more slowly, and wait for more evidence on the risks, in the young. A longer gap between the two doses would lead to more protection in the end. However, it looks unlikely they will be fully immunised before the return to school in September. Almost all children and young people are at a very low risk of being seriously ill with Covid.New research suggestsmost children who become ill with coronavirus recover within less than a week. But they can act as a reservoir of virus and pass it on to their friends, classmates, families and other vulnerable adults. The move to vaccinate children is likely to have its critics, as much of the world is far behind in their vaccine rollouts, with millions of adults still at risk of serious illness or death. Some argue that the doses given to children would save more lives if they were given to health workers and vulnerable adults in poorer countries. The World Health Organization has urged wealthy countries to share more of its vaccines, and sooner. The UK has pledged to donate more than 100 million leftover doses via the Covax scheme and through direct country-to-country donations. It sent a first batch of nine million doses last week. ""Vaccination of teenagers may have a major effect on the return of Covid next winter, assuming that the rates will drop this summer. Full vaccination takes time, so the sooner we start the sooner this age group will be protected."" -Prof Peter Openshaw, Imperial College London Dr Peter English, former chair of the BMA public health medicine committee, queried why they had not gone further, sooner: ""Why they did not recommend vaccinating 12 plus-year-olds outside risk groups in mid-July, and why it seems they will restrict their recommendation to people aged 16 plus today, are questions that remain unanswered to my satisfaction."" ""This step is particularly useful now as high vaccination levels are concentrating infection amongst the unvaccinated children and teenagers."" -Prof Russell Viner, University College London ""The moral failure... is to allow people to die around the world, whilst we vaccinate people who are at extremely low risk of of serious disease or death or even zero risk."" -Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who says teenagers should not be a priority when there are ""plenty of other people who are at serious risk of death"". A further 29,312 cases of people testing positive for coronavirus were recorded in the UK on Wednesday and 119 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. So far, 73% of adults in the UK have received two jabs, and more than 88% have had a first dose. All over-18s have now been offered the vaccine.

"This video can not be played Children aged 16-17 should be vaccinated ""as fast as practically possible"", Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says All 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK will start being offered a first dose of the Covid jab within weeks, after a recommendation from vaccine experts. They will not need parental consent and will receive the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation said on Wednesday. Advice on when to offer the second dose will come later, the JCVI added. The change in guidance means around 1.4 million teenagers will be eligible. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, said there were plenty of vaccines available, adding: ""We have the supply and I'm expecting this to start in a very short number of weeks indeed."" ""There is no time to waste in getting on with this,"" he said, highlighting that children will start going back to sixth forms and colleges soon. ""I want us to proceed as fast as is practically possible."" How many people have been vaccinated so far? Should all children get a Covid vaccine? The JCVI is a group of independent experts and their advice is a recommendation upon which governments then act. England,Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandhave all confirmed they will follow it. Until now, children over 12 have been able to get a jab if they have certain health conditions, live with others who are at a high risk or are nearing their 18th birthday. The only vaccine currently approved for under-18s in the UK is Pfizer-BioNTech. Some other countries have already been routinely vaccinating children over 12. The US has been doing so from May, as well as some European countries, such as France and Italy, after EU regulators gave them the go-ahead. Other countries that are vaccinating children include Brazil, Japan, Israel and Hong Kong. Last month, the JCVI stopped short of opening up jabs to 16 and 17-year-olds as it wanted time to examine the risks and benefits, as well as reports of rare adverse effects such as inflammation of heart muscles. But on Wednesday it said these events were ""extremely rare"" and usually occurred within a few days of a second dose, typically more in young men. Data from the US suggests that in males aged 12 to 17 years 9.8 cases of myocarditis were reported per million first doses given. This rises to 67 per million after the second dose. Most people recovered quickly. The JCVI said it expected one dose of the vaccine would give the 16 and 17-year-old age group good protection against severe illness and around 80% protection against hospitalisation.

"Adrian Underwood died when the ship was hit on Thursday A British security guard killed in a drone attack on a ship off the coast of Oman has been named. Adrian Underwood and the merchant tanker's Romanian captain died when the MV Mercer Street was hit on Thursday. The UK, US and Israel have blamed Iran, which denies responsibility. Mr Underwood served in the British Army and was working for a Hereford-based security company, Ambrey, when he was killed. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the incident on behalf of a coroner. MT Mercer Street is managed by the London-based company Zodiac Maritime. The private maritime security guard's name was revealed by a newspaper in Fiji, the country of his birth, and later confirmed by sources in Britain. Ambrey said the former soldier had a distinguished record of service in the British Army. It said his qualities were quickly recognised and he had been promoted to team leader. The explosive-laden drone blew up close to the bridge. The Mercer Street was attacked off the coast of Oman Britain, the US, Israel and Romania have blamed Iran, promising a co-ordinated response. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Chief of Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter said Iran had made a big mistake with the incident and that it needed to be deterred from attacking shipping. He said: ""Convoys may not necessarily be the right method, we've used other methods, and ultimately we've got to keep reviewing this. ""But ultimately, we have got to restore deterrence because it is behaviour like that which leads to escalation, and that could very easily lead to miscalculation and would be very disastrous for all the peoples of the Gulf and the international community."" Latest news from the West Midlands The UK's Maritime Trade Operations unit, which monitors security in the Gulf region, has warned ship operators to be extra vigilant in the Gulf of Oman. A second tanker was attacked on Tuesday, but the two events appeared to be unrelated, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said. Up to nine armed men are reported to have boarded a medium-sized tanker in the Gulf of Oman. But less than 24 hours later they had left the ship to go on its way. Maritime sources believe this event may have been related to criminal networks and smuggling. Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Customers of doorstep lender Provident Financial can claim compensation for mis-sold loans after the High Court backed a partial repayment scheme. The company has set aside Â£50m to meet claims from borrowers who were sold unaffordable loans. Customers will still not get all their money back. However, the Court agreed to the scheme after the firm warned full payments would force it to go bust leaving many victims with nothing. ""We believed from the outset that the scheme was fair and that it offered the best outcomes for customers,"" said Malcolm Le May, chief executive officer of Provident. He said the Court approval  was ""a positive outcome for customers with valid claims under the scheme, as it provides access to a redress payment which would not have been possible had the scheme not been approved."" The scheme will go live later in August with a deadline of the end of February 2022, giving borrowers just six months to claim their cash. ""Customers won't get a full refund but it is worth claiming compensation if you were sold an unaffordable loan as you may still get hundreds of pounds,"" said debt adviser Sara Williams, who runs the Debt Camel blog. Provident had been lending and collecting repayments on the doorstep since the 1880s butwithdrew from the business earlier this yearblaming ""changing industry and regulatory dynamics"" as well as ""shifting customer preferences"". Its lending was legal and approved by the City regulator, but proved controversial, with some campaigners calling them ""legal loan sharks"". One 52-year-old, who borrowed with Provident for 30 years, said he had taken loans totalling Â£60,000 but it was a ""vicious circle"". ""It was for basic spending, and Christmas, but was too convenient,"" he said. Last year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said prolonged relending could be harmful to borrowers and the company faced a flood of complaints that affordability checks were not carried out when doorstep loans and payday loans were granted. It said the second half of last year had seen a 200% rise in complaints compared with the first half. That led to theHigh Court approved scheme,externalbecause Provident said it could not afford to carry on paying full refunds to customers who were winning affordability complaints. The Financial Ombudsman had been upholding about 75% of complaints. The FCA said it did not approve of the scheme but as Provident has stopped providing doorstep loans, it did not object to it in court. The scheme covers customers who had unaffordable loans between 6 April 2007 and 17 December 2020 from one of Provident's personal credit brands. They are doorstep lender Provident, Satsuma payday loans, Greenwood - a doorstep lender defunct since 2014 - and Glo, a guarantor loan brand. Some 4.2 million people borrowed from the different brands during the period but not all are expected to have a valid claim, with the court estimating that up to 30% of them could apply for redress. ""A loan is only affordable if you could repay it on time and still be able to pay your other debts, bills and living expenses,"" said Sara Williams. ""You may have paid the loan on time, but it may still have been unaffordable. If paying Provident left you so short of money you had to borrow more or you got behind with bills then it was unaffordable.""

"Some 2,000 containers are being unloaded from the Ever Given at Felixstowe The huge container ship that blocked the Suez Canal is being unloaded after it arrived in the UK. The Ever Given docked at Felixstowe, Suffolk, at 16:30 BST on Tuesday, its first UK visitsince causing disruption to global shipping. The Port of Felixstowe said 2,000 containers were being unloaded by crane and the process would take about 24 hours. It said the 400m-long (1,300ft) vessel was due to leave at 02:00 on Thursday. This video can not be played Ever Given: Time-lapse video captures Felixstowe arrival The ship, operated by Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine, was originally due to arrive at Felixstowe in early April. It blocked the major shipping lane in Egypt for almost a week in March. Cargo ship that blocked Suez Canal arrives in UK 'I want to see how big this ship is and it's huge' Owner of cargo ship blocking Suez Canal apologises Hundreds of ships were delayed as they waited for the canal to be unblocked and some vessels were forced to take the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa. When the ship, which carries cargo between Asia and Europe, was finally freed it was held up again until an agreement between Japanese owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd, and canal authorities was reached over compensation. Keen shipping enthusiasts and families watched from Landguard Point as the ship arrived at Felixstowe on Tuesday Dozens of ship-spotters lined the beachto watch it arrive at Felixstowe. Goods in the Ever Given's 18,000 total containers have an estimated value of $775m, but many of them will hold fruit and vegetables which will have to be destroyed, having passed their use-by date. The bulk of the containerswere offloaded at Rotterdam,externalprior to its journey to Felixstowe. Jake Slinn, owner of JS Global Cargo & Freight Disposal in Ipswich, said his business was expecting 20 to 30 containers from the ship. In the coming weeks his business will be hired either to destroy unwanted cargo - such as out-of-date food items - or manage abandoned cargo. ""At the moment we've not taken any items from the ship,"" he said. The T. rex will be one of 12 dinosaurs at the park and will be situated near the 17th and 18th holes Meanwhile, Kingsway Golf Centre in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, is looking forward to finally adding two new dinosaur models to its Jurassic Links crazy golf course. It said it had already cleared space around the 17th and 18th holes for the giant Tyrannosaurus rex model, nicknamed Dino,before it became stuck on the Ever Given. The course is also waiting for the arrival of Dino's 4m (13ft) wide pterodactyl friend. ""The forced isolation for these two spectacular dinosaurs is over,"" said marketing manager Fred Dell.

"This video can not be played 'Fantastic' Sky Brown takes bronze to become youngest GB medallist Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Thirteen-year-old Sky Brown earned a momentous skateboarding bronze to become Great Britain's youngest Olympic medallist as victories in sailing and showjumping on Wednesday took Team GB's gold medal tally to 15. Hannah Mills and Eilidh McIntyre clinched gold in the 470 class, makingMills the most successful female Olympic sailorof all time after her gold in Rio five years ago and silver at London 2012. Ben Maher then won gold inthe individual showjumping eventon board Explosion W after a dramatic six-horse jump-off. Boxer Ben Whittaker secured a men's light-heavyweight silver medal after Frazer Clarke took bronze in the men's super-heavyweight division. With six medals guaranteed in Tokyo this is Britain's most successful Olympics in the boxing ring since 1920, when just 12 nations took part. Meanwhile, Canada's Andre de Grasse won his first gold and fifth Olympic medal overall as he overhauled world champion Noah Lyles in themen's 200m final. Great Britain moved up to fourth in the standings after winning two golds on Wednesday Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table The first of GB's five medals on day 12 came from Brown, born a month before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. She fell on her first two runs in the women's park skateboarding final beforeposting a score of 56.47 to make the podium. The teenager replaces Sarah Hardcastle as Britain's youngest summer Games medal winner - the swimmer was 15 years and 113 days when she won silver and bronze in Los Angeles at the 1984 Olympics. At 13 years and 28 days, Brown also breaks Margery Hinton's 93-year-old record as the country's youngest competitor and claims Team GB's first skateboarding medal. This video can not be played Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson pulls up injured in women's heptathlon 200m But there was a heartbreaking end to world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson's heptathlon medal hopes. The 28-year-old, who was battling to overcome a left Achilles problem before the Games,sat fifth after three eventsbut pulled up with a right calf injury in the 200m and was disqualified from the race for leaving her lane. Meanwhile,Jason Kennystarted the defence of his Olympic sprint title with three victories in the opening rounds, as team-mate Jack Carlin also progressed and Katy Marchant reached the women's keirin quarter-finals. Carlin GB's best chance of sprint medal, says Kenny Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Nielsen Gracenote said: ""Great Britain have closed the gap with the Rio and London Olympics and now have 48 medals after 12 days of competition compared to 49 in 2016 and 48 in 2012. ""However, at both of those Olympics, sailing, taekwondo and triathlon were still going on in the last four days of the Games so expect 2021 to fall behind again on total medals won."" Who are Team GB's medal winners? How are GB athletes performing in Tokyo? Brown beat the previous record of Team GB's youngest Olympic medal winner by more than two years while also becoming the youngest competitor at a summer Games for her country. Hinton was 13 years and 44 days when she swam at the Amsterdam Games in 1928, and that landmark stood for almost a century. Until Wednesday, that is, when Brown - 16 days younger - began her women's park skateboarding campaign at Ariake Urban Sports Park. Had the Games not been postponed by a year, Brown would have lowered that summer record further, though figure skater Cecilia Colledge retains the overall accolade for Britain - she entered the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid aged 11. Brown qualified for the final but fell during her opening two runs to set up a tense final attempt. But the Japan-born teenager - who had a heavy fall in training last year that saw her fracture her skull, break her left arm and wrist, and suffer lacerations to her heart and lungs - delivered a score of 56.47 to climb into the bronze-medal position.

"This video can not be played 'Fantastic' Sky Brown takes bronze to become youngest GB medallist Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Thirteen-year-old Sky Brown earned a momentous skateboarding bronze to become Great Britain's youngest Olympic medallist as victories in sailing and showjumping on Wednesday took Team GB's gold medal tally to 15. Hannah Mills and Eilidh McIntyre clinched gold in the 470 class, makingMills the most successful female Olympic sailorof all time after her gold in Rio five years ago and silver at London 2012. Ben Maher then won gold inthe individual showjumping eventon board Explosion W after a dramatic six-horse jump-off. Boxer Ben Whittaker secured a men's light-heavyweight silver medal after Frazer Clarke took bronze in the men's super-heavyweight division. With six medals guaranteed in Tokyo this is Britain's most successful Olympics in the boxing ring since 1920, when just 12 nations took part. Meanwhile, Canada's Andre de Grasse won his first gold and fifth Olympic medal overall as he overhauled world champion Noah Lyles in themen's 200m final. Great Britain moved up to fourth in the standings after winning two golds on Wednesday Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table The first of GB's five medals on day 12 came from Brown, born a month before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. She fell on her first two runs in the women's park skateboarding final beforeposting a score of 56.47 to make the podium. The teenager replaces Sarah Hardcastle as Britain's youngest summer Games medal winner - the swimmer was 15 years and 113 days when she won silver and bronze in Los Angeles at the 1984 Olympics. At 13 years and 28 days, Brown also breaks Margery Hinton's 93-year-old record as the country's youngest competitor and claims Team GB's first skateboarding medal.

The 28-year-old, who was battling to overcome a left Achilles problem before the Games,sat fifth after three eventsbut pulled up with a right calf injury in the 200m and was disqualified from the race for leaving her lane. Meanwhile,Jason Kennystarted the defence of his Olympic sprint title with three victories in the opening rounds, as team-mate Jack Carlin also progressed and Katy Marchant reached the women's keirin quarter-finals. Carlin GB's best chance of sprint medal, says Kenny Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Nielsen Gracenote said: ""Great Britain have closed the gap with the Rio and London Olympics and now have 48 medals after 12 days of competition compared to 49 in 2016 and 48 in 2012. ""However, at both of those Olympics, sailing, taekwondo and triathlon were still going on in the last four days of the Games so expect 2021 to fall behind again on total medals won."" Who are Team GB's medal winners? How are GB athletes performing in Tokyo? Brown beat the previous record of Team GB's youngest Olympic medal winner by more than two years while also becoming the youngest competitor at a summer Games for her country. Hinton was 13 years and 44 days when she swam at the Amsterdam Games in 1928, and that landmark stood for almost a century. Until Wednesday, that is, when Brown - 16 days younger - began her women's park skateboarding campaign at Ariake Urban Sports Park. Had the Games not been postponed by a year, Brown would have lowered that summer record further, though figure skater Cecilia Colledge retains the overall accolade for Britain - she entered the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid aged 11. Brown qualified for the final but fell during her opening two runs to set up a tense final attempt. But the Japan-born teenager - who had a heavy fall in training last year that saw her fracture her skull, break her left arm and wrist, and suffer lacerations to her heart and lungs - delivered a score of 56.47 to climb into the bronze-medal position.

"DeepSukebe's website promises a very easy way to instantly nudify clothed pictures of women MP Maria Miller wants a parliamentary debate on whether digitally generated nude images need to be banned. It comes as another service which allows users to undress women in photos, using Artificial intelligence (AI), spreads rapidly on social media. The website in question had more than five million visits in June alone, according to one analyst. Celebrities, including an Olympic athlete, are among those who users claim to have nudified. DeepSukebe's website promises users it can ""reveal the truth hidden under clothes"". Launched in 2020, it is unclear who is behind it. The BBC has contacted the company for comment, but received no reply. According to its Twitter page, it is an ""AI-leveraged nudifier"" whose mission is to ""make all men's dreams come true"". And in a blog post, the developers say that they are working on a more powerful version of the tool. Ms Miller told the BBC it was time to consider a ban of such tools. ""Parliament needs to have the opportunity to debate whether nude and sexually explicit images generated digitally without consent should be outlawed, and I believe if this were to happen the law would change."" She said that it should be an offence to distribute sexual images online without consent to reflect ""the severity of the impact on people's lives"". ""If software providers develop this technology, they are complicit in a very serious crime and should be required to design their products to stop this happening."" She has been campaigning about so-called revenge porn - when nude or sexually explicit images are distributed without consent - for the last six years. ""At the moment, making, taking or distributing without consent intimate sexual images online or through digital technology falls mostly outside of the law. ""It should be a sexual offence to distribute sexual images online without consent, reflecting the severity of the impact on people's lives."" She wants the issue to be included in the forthcoming Online Safety Bill. Campaign group Cease (Centre To End All Sexual Exploitation) told the BBC it also believed nudification tools needed to be tackled in the Bill. ""The law is not adequate in this area,"" said chief executive Vanessa Morse. ""Technology which is designed to objectify and humiliate women should be shut down, and porn sites which profit from mass distribution of these images must be forced to proactively block their upload,"" she said. She added the fact that the onus is currently on victims ""often traumatised and humiliated"" to have such images removed from the internet was simply not fair. Nudifier tools, as they are known, are not new. DeepNude was launched in 2019, but the creators quickly withdrew the service and offered refunds, following a backlash. Currently nudification tools only work for creating naked women - something one developer acknowledged was sexist They acknowledged the probability people would misuse it was ""very high"", adding that the world was not ready for such a controversial tool. But similar services remain on the market, many using the DeepNude source code, which was made publicly available by the original developers. While many often produce clumsy, sometimes laughable results, the new website uses a proprietary algorithm which one analyst described as ""putting it years ahead of the competition"". The BBC spoke to a developer behind one of the many nudification tools available online. Ivan Bravo acknowledged that such creations ""are not ethical, mainly in the way it is currently used and the way the original developers started advertising it as 'nude your friends'"". ""However, we don't live in a perfect world and people have always been looking for ways to do this, so it was only a matter of time before such a technology came into existence."" He added that the fact the technology was only currently able to nudify women was sexist. ""Personally I would also like to have a version for nude men and even fictional characters like anime, so that all people can enjoy or experiment with this kind of adult entertainment. ""The goal is to find what kind of uses we can give to this technology within the legal and ethical [framework].""

"Petrol prices have reached an eight-year high after nine straight months of rises, according to the RAC. The group said the average price of a litre of petrol is now 135.13p, a level not seen since September 2013, as rising oil prices push up fuel costs. Diesel now costs an average of 137.06p a litre, its highest price since 2014. ""Prices really are only going one way at the moment - and that's not the way drivers want to see them going,"" warned RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. The latest RAC Fuel Watch figures show that another 3.4p was added to a litre of petrol in July, the largest rise in the price of unleaded since January, while diesel climbed 2.7p a litre. That meant last month was the most expensive July to fill up with petrol since 2013, and for diesel since 2014. A driver filling up a petrol car with a 55-litre tank now pays on average Â£3.08 more than at the start of June, and Â£11.47 more than a year ago. For diesel drivers filling a similarly-sized tank, it now costs Â£2.90 more than at the start of June, and Â£10.46 more than it did at the end of July 2020. ""With a second summer staycation in full swing, it's proving to be a particularly costly one for many families who are using their cars to holiday here in the UK,"" said Mr Williams. It is hard to see prices falling anytime soon, said Mr Williams. Confidence is building that there will be a global economic recovery and as trade picks up that is increasing demand for oil. But as demand outstrips supply, wholesale fuel prices are pushed up, which has a knock-on effect for motorists. ""While we're not past the pandemic by any means, demand for oil is likely to continue to increase as economic activity picks up again, and this is likely to have the effect of pushing up wholesale fuel prices, costs which retailers are bound to pass on at the pumps,"" Mr Williams said. He warned that unless major oil-producing nations decide a new strategy to increase output, forecourt prices could climb even higher towards the end of the summer. Oil producing nations agree deal to control prices The growing rivalry that's pushing up oil prices Despite the recent price increases, petrol prices are yet to reach the highest level we saw in the middle of 2012. In April 2012, prices peaked at 142p a litre for unleaded and 148p for diesel, according to Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association. ""We're still some way off that level and indications are that the oil price has checked and come back a little because of concerns that China may be going into an economic slowdown."" That could help dampen demand and ""if that is the case, we'd expect the wholesale price to come back a little and then pump prices to follow within the month,"" Mr Madderson told the BBC. But he tempered that optimism with a warning that the situation is ""on a knife-edge at the moment"" with ""summer often the time of the year when there is significant maintenance work in the refineries, which restricts output"".

"This video can not be played Children aged 16-17 should be vaccinated ""as fast as practically possible"", Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says All 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK will start being offered a first dose of the Covid jab within weeks, after a recommendation from vaccine experts. They will not need parental consent and will receive the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation said on Wednesday. Advice on when to offer the second dose will come later, the JCVI added. The change in guidance means around 1.4 million teenagers will be eligible. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, England's deputy chief medical officer, said there were plenty of vaccines available, adding: ""We have the supply and I'm expecting this to start in a very short number of weeks indeed."" ""There is no time to waste in getting on with this,"" he said, highlighting that children will start going back to sixth forms and colleges soon. ""I want us to proceed as fast as is practically possible."" How many people have been vaccinated so far? Should all children get a Covid vaccine? The JCVI is a group of independent experts and their advice is a recommendation upon which governments then act. England,Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandhave all confirmed they will follow it. Until now, children over 12 have been able to get a jab if they have certain health conditions, live with others who are at a high risk or are nearing their 18th birthday. The only vaccine currently approved for under-18s in the UK is Pfizer-BioNTech. Some other countries have already been routinely vaccinating children over 12. The US has been doing so from May, as well as some European countries, such as France and Italy, after EU regulators gave them the go-ahead. Other countries that are vaccinating children include Brazil, Japan, Israel and Hong Kong. Last month, the JCVI stopped short of opening up jabs to 16 and 17-year-olds as it wanted time to examine the risks and benefits, as well as reports of rare adverse effects such as inflammation of heart muscles. But on Wednesday it said these events were ""extremely rare"" and usually occurred within a few days of a second dose, typically more in young men. Data from the US suggests that in males aged 12 to 17 years 9.8 cases of myocarditis were reported per million first doses given. This rises to 67 per million after the second dose. Most people recovered quickly. The JCVI said it expected one dose of the vaccine would give the 16 and 17-year-old age group good protection against severe illness and around 80% protection against hospitalisation. This video can not be played 16 and 17-year-olds on Weston-super-Mare seafront say if they would get the vaccine Prof Wei Shen Lim, who chairs the Covid part of the JCVI, said the change in advice was not just for the benefit of wider society, but for teenagers themselves. ""While Covid-19 is typically mild or asymptomatic in most young people, it can be very unpleasant for some,"" he said. On whether to roll out jabs to over-12s, he said the JCVI will review the data but it is a decision they ""prefer not to make at this point"". After the announcement, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to ""listen to the JCVI"" and get the jab. ""They are extremely expert, they're amongst the best, if not the best in the world - they know what's safe and I think we should listen to them and take our lead from them,"" he said. The ambition is still two, but the route to getting there is fuzzy. The advice today is to give 16 and 17-year-olds their first dose and then wait for more details. One reason is the risk of inflamed heart tissue (myocarditis or pericarditis) is higher after the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The JCVI says one dose will still give children significant protection against Covid, especially if they have already caught the virus. And that the high uptake in vulnerable older adults means it can afford to go more slowly, and wait for more evidence on the risks, in the young. A longer gap between the two doses would lead to more protection in the end. However, it looks unlikely they will be fully immunised before the return to school in September. Almost all children and young people are at a very low risk of being seriously ill with Covid.New research suggestsmost children who become ill with coronavirus recover within less than a week. But they can act as a reservoir of virus and pass it on to their friends, classmates, families and other vulnerable adults. The move to vaccinate children is likely to have its critics, as much of the world is far behind in their vaccine rollouts, with millions of adults still at risk of serious illness or death. Some argue that the doses given to children would save more lives if they were given to health workers and vulnerable adults in poorer countries. The World Health Organization has urged wealthy countries to share more of its vaccines, and sooner. The UK has pledged to donate more than 100 million leftover doses via the Covax scheme and through direct country-to-country donations. It sent a first batch of nine million doses last week. ""Vaccination of teenagers may have a major effect on the return of Covid next winter, assuming that the rates will drop this summer. Full vaccination takes time, so the sooner we start the sooner this age group will be protected."" -Prof Peter Openshaw, Imperial College London Dr Peter English, former chair of the BMA public health medicine committee, queried why they had not gone further, sooner: ""Why they did not recommend vaccinating 12 plus-year-olds outside risk groups in mid-July, and why it seems they will restrict their recommendation to people aged 16 plus today, are questions that remain unanswered to my satisfaction."" ""This step is particularly useful now as high vaccination levels are concentrating infection amongst the unvaccinated children and teenagers."" -Prof Russell Viner, University College London ""The moral failure... is to allow people to die around the world, whilst we vaccinate people who are at extremely low risk of of serious disease or death or even zero risk."" -Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, who says teenagers should not be a priority when there are ""plenty of other people who are at serious risk of death"". A further 29,312 cases of people testing positive for coronavirus were recorded in the UK on Wednesday and 119 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. So far, 73% of adults in the UK have received two jabs, and more than 88% have had a first dose. All over-18s have now been offered the vaccine. NHS data for England shows 223,755 under-18s have received a first vaccine dose since the rules were changed last month. Last month, there were suggestions that vaccines could become compulsory for university students moving to halls of residence, but ministershave since shelved that idea. There are alsoplans to offer booster jabsfor those aged 50 and over later this year. SHOULD YOU GET BACK WITH YOUR EX?:Can a relationship with an ex ever really work?

"Some 2,000 containers are being unloaded from the Ever Given at Felixstowe The huge container ship that blocked the Suez Canal is being unloaded after it arrived in the UK. The Ever Given docked at Felixstowe, Suffolk, at 16:30 BST on Tuesday, its first UK visitsince causing disruption to global shipping. The Port of Felixstowe said 2,000 containers were being unloaded by crane and the process would take about 24 hours. It said the 400m-long (1,300ft) vessel was due to leave at 02:00 on Thursday. This video can not be played Ever Given: Time-lapse video captures Felixstowe arrival The ship, operated by Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine, was originally due to arrive at Felixstowe in early April. It blocked the major shipping lane in Egypt for almost a week in March. Cargo ship that blocked Suez Canal arrives in UK 'I want to see how big this ship is and it's huge' Owner of cargo ship blocking Suez Canal apologises Hundreds of ships were delayed as they waited for the canal to be unblocked and some vessels were forced to take the much longer route around the southern tip of Africa. When the ship, which carries cargo between Asia and Europe, was finally freed it was held up again until an agreement between Japanese owner, Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd, and canal authorities was reached over compensation. Keen shipping enthusiasts and families watched from Landguard Point as the ship arrived at Felixstowe on Tuesday Dozens of ship-spotters lined the beachto watch it arrive at Felixstowe. Goods in the Ever Given's 18,000 total containers have an estimated value of $775m, but many of them will hold fruit and vegetables which will have to be destroyed, having passed their use-by date. The bulk of the containerswere offloaded at Rotterdam,externalprior to its journey to Felixstowe. Jake Slinn, owner of JS Global Cargo & Freight Disposal in Ipswich, said his business was expecting 20 to 30 containers from the ship. In the coming weeks his business will be hired either to destroy unwanted cargo - such as out-of-date food items - or manage abandoned cargo. ""At the moment we've not taken any items from the ship,"" he said. The T. rex will be one of 12 dinosaurs at the park and will be situated near the 17th and 18th holes Meanwhile, Kingsway Golf Centre in Melbourn, Cambridgeshire, is looking forward to finally adding two new dinosaur models to its Jurassic Links crazy golf course. It said it had already cleared space around the 17th and 18th holes for the giant Tyrannosaurus rex model, nicknamed Dino,before it became stuck on the Ever Given. The course is also waiting for the arrival of Dino's 4m (13ft) wide pterodactyl friend. ""The forced isolation for these two spectacular dinosaurs is over,"" said marketing manager Fred Dell. He said they expected the two models, plus other ""dino bits and bobs"" to arrive on Monday. The Ever Given's next destination after Felixstowe is Hamburg, Germany.

"Lee Collins' partner told the inquest he had drunk alcohol ""every single day"" for the past 10 years A footballer took his own life and had cocaine in his system when he was found dead in a hotel room, an inquest heard. Yeovil Town captain Lee Collins, 32,was discoveredby the club's assistant manager Terry Skiverton on 31 March after he did not arrive for training. He had been ""struggling with injuries and personal problems"", including the break-up of a relationship, Taunton Coroners' Court was told. Senior Somerset coroner Tony Williams recorded a conclusion of suicide. Mr Collins began his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers and spent time at Port Vale, Barnsley, Northampton Town, Mansfield Town and Forest Green Rovers, before joining Yeovil Town in 2019. He had battled long-term alcohol problems as well as a gambling habit and the recreational use of cocaine before his death, Mr Williams told the hearing. Tributes were left outside Yeovil Town's Huish Park ground after Mr Collins' death was announced Toxicology tests revealed alcohol and cocaine in Mr Collins' system when he was found at the Lanes Hotel, West Coker, Somerset. In a statement to the inquest, his partner Rachel Gibbon said Mr Collins, from Newport, South Wales, was a ""gentle giant, the kindest most generous man you could have met"", but there were two sides to his ""very complex character"". ""I begged him to get help but he would get aggressive, verbally aggressive,"" Ms Gibbon's statement said. ""I could not have physically dragged him to the doctors. He did not want help."" Ms Gibbon said her partner was ""the joker, the class clown"" but he was also ""insecure and anxious"" with an addictive personality. Mr Collins would drink six bottles of cider and two bottles of wine a day, and had begun drinking spirits too, her statement continued. ""For the last 10 years he would drink every single day, strong cider. ""Lee was your captain, your leader. For us he was our safe place, our best friend,"" Ms Gibbon added. Lee Collins began his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers and spent time at Port Vale, Barnsley, Northampton Town, Mansfield Town and Forest Green Rovers His friend Paul Broadhead said Mr Collins had suffered with his mental health in the past few years despite being the ""joker and life and soul of the party"". He said Mr Collins worried about paying bills and what he would do when his football career ended. Yeovil Town assistant manager Mr Skiverton said Mr Collins had been happy during a training session the day before his death but had been struggling with injuries and personal problems. Manager of the National League club, Darren Sarll, said Mr Collins had recently separated with Ms Gibbon and was ""an inconsistent character"" who had not turned up for training in the past. Mr Collins played his last game for the club on 6 February against Stockport.

"This video can not be played 'Fantastic' Sky Brown takes bronze to become youngest GB medallist Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Thirteen-year-old Sky Brown earned a momentous skateboarding bronze to become Great Britain's youngest Olympic medallist as victories in sailing and showjumping on Wednesday took Team GB's gold medal tally to 15. Hannah Mills and Eilidh McIntyre clinched gold in the 470 class, makingMills the most successful female Olympic sailorof all time after her gold in Rio five years ago and silver at London 2012. Ben Maher then won gold inthe individual showjumping eventon board Explosion W after a dramatic six-horse jump-off. Boxer Ben Whittaker secured a men's light-heavyweight silver medal after Frazer Clarke took bronze in the men's super-heavyweight division. With six medals guaranteed in Tokyo this is Britain's most successful Olympics in the boxing ring since 1920, when just 12 nations took part. Meanwhile, Canada's Andre de Grasse won his first gold and fifth Olympic medal overall as he overhauled world champion Noah Lyles in themen's 200m final. Great Britain moved up to fourth in the standings after winning two golds on Wednesday Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table The first of GB's five medals on day 12 came from Brown, born a month before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. She fell on her first two runs in the women's park skateboarding final beforeposting a score of 56.47 to make the podium. The teenager replaces Sarah Hardcastle as Britain's youngest summer Games medal winner - the swimmer was 15 years and 113 days when she won silver and bronze in Los Angeles at the 1984 Olympics. At 13 years and 28 days, Brown also breaks Margery Hinton's 93-year-old record as the country's youngest competitor and claims Team GB's first skateboarding medal. This video can not be played Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson pulls up injured in women's heptathlon 200m But there was a heartbreaking end to world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson's heptathlon medal hopes. The 28-year-old, who was battling to overcome a left Achilles problem before the Games,sat fifth after three eventsbut pulled up with a right calf injury in the 200m and was disqualified from the race for leaving her lane. Meanwhile,Jason Kennystarted the defence of his Olympic sprint title with three victories in the opening rounds, as team-mate Jack Carlin also progressed and Katy Marchant reached the women's keirin quarter-finals. Carlin GB's best chance of sprint medal, says Kenny Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Nielsen Gracenote said: ""Great Britain have closed the gap with the Rio and London Olympics and now have 48 medals after 12 days of competition compared to 49 in 2016 and 48 in 2012. ""However, at both of those Olympics, sailing, taekwondo and triathlon were still going on in the last four days of the Games so expect 2021 to fall behind again on total medals won."" Who are Team GB's medal winners? How are GB athletes performing in Tokyo? Brown beat the previous record of Team GB's youngest Olympic medal winner by more than two years while also becoming the youngest competitor at a summer Games for her country. Hinton was 13 years and 44 days when she swam at the Amsterdam Games in 1928, and that landmark stood for almost a century. Until Wednesday, that is, when Brown - 16 days younger - began her women's park skateboarding campaign at Ariake Urban Sports Park. Had the Games not been postponed by a year, Brown would have lowered that summer record further, though figure skater Cecilia Colledge retains the overall accolade for Britain - she entered the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid aged 11. Brown qualified for the final but fell during her opening two runs to set up a tense final attempt. But the Japan-born teenager - who had a heavy fall in training last year that saw her fracture her skull, break her left arm and wrist, and suffer lacerations to her heart and lungs - delivered a score of 56.47 to climb into the bronze-medal position.

I'm so happy to be here. I'm blessed,"" said Brown, who added she would now ""hang out with friends and party"". ""I was definitely bumped, I fell twice, that made the last run feel even better. All the girls are ripping it, it was insane, it was a super-sick final."" Japan's Sakura Yosozumi, 19, won gold with a best score of 60.09, while 12-year-old compatriot Kokona Hiraki claimed silver with 59.04. Britain's stellar Olympics continued on the water,with Mills and McIntyre's successtaking the nation's sailing medal tally to five, of which three of those are gold. The GB pair finished fifth in the 470 medal race, but their earlier performances meant it was enough to hold off silver medallists Poland and France in bronze. Their celebrations were put on ice briefly after a protest was lodged by bronze-medallists France. But 33-year-old Mills, one of Team GB's flag bearers at the opening ceremony, did not have to wait long to have her third Olympic medal confirmed. This video can not be played Team GB sailors Mills and McIntyre win 470 gold ""It's absolutely mad,"" said Mills. ""Growing up, like a lot of Olympians, I dreamed of being here one day and standing on top of the podium. ""To do it twice with Saskia [Clark] and with Eilidh this time, I've had two incredible crews to sail with and I feel incredibly lucky."" McIntyre follows in the footsteps of her father, Mike, who won gold in the star class at Seoul in 1988. Earlier, Britain's Chris Grube and Luke Patience finished fifth overall in the men's 470. Maher's showjumping gold gives the British equestrian team a fifth Olympic medal in Tokyo, equalling their record haul achieved in London. It follows gold for the eventing team and Tom McEwen's individual eventing silver, plus team dressage bronze and Charlotte Dujardin's individual dressage bronze. Maher, 38, was thrust into a six-horse jump-off and completed his run in 37.85 to pip Sweden's Peder Fredricson by 17-hundredths of a second, with the Netherlands' Maikel van der Vleuten taking bronze. It is a second Olympic medal for Maher after winning gold in the team jumping event at London 2012. ""I'm getting married in a couple of weeks and that makes this all the more special - but my fiancee knows she has to share me with Explosion,"" he said.

Of course, he's a class operator - two-time Olympic gold medallist now but I'm very disappointed. I feel like a failure.

"Customers of doorstep lender Provident Financial can claim compensation for mis-sold loans after the High Court backed a partial repayment scheme. The company has set aside Â£50m to meet claims from borrowers who were sold unaffordable loans. Customers will still not get all their money back. However, the Court agreed to the scheme after the firm warned full payments would force it to go bust leaving many victims with nothing. ""We believed from the outset that the scheme was fair and that it offered the best outcomes for customers,"" said Malcolm Le May, chief executive officer of Provident. He said the Court approval  was ""a positive outcome for customers with valid claims under the scheme, as it provides access to a redress payment which would not have been possible had the scheme not been approved."" The scheme will go live later in August with a deadline of the end of February 2022, giving borrowers just six months to claim their cash. ""Customers won't get a full refund but it is worth claiming compensation if you were sold an unaffordable loan as you may still get hundreds of pounds,"" said debt adviser Sara Williams, who runs the Debt Camel blog. Provident had been lending and collecting repayments on the doorstep since the 1880s butwithdrew from the business earlier this yearblaming ""changing industry and regulatory dynamics"" as well as ""shifting customer preferences"". Its lending was legal and approved by the City regulator, but proved controversial, with some campaigners calling them ""legal loan sharks"". One 52-year-old, who borrowed with Provident for 30 years, said he had taken loans totalling Â£60,000 but it was a ""vicious circle"". ""It was for basic spending, and Christmas, but was too convenient,"" he said. Last year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said prolonged relending could be harmful to borrowers and the company faced a flood of complaints that affordability checks were not carried out when doorstep loans and payday loans were granted. It said the second half of last year had seen a 200% rise in complaints compared with the first half. That led to theHigh Court approved scheme,externalbecause Provident said it could not afford to carry on paying full refunds to customers who were winning affordability complaints. The Financial Ombudsman had been upholding about 75% of complaints. The FCA said it did not approve of the scheme but as Provident has stopped providing doorstep loans, it did not object to it in court. The scheme covers customers who had unaffordable loans between 6 April 2007 and 17 December 2020 from one of Provident's personal credit brands. They are doorstep lender Provident, Satsuma payday loans, Greenwood - a doorstep lender defunct since 2014 - and Glo, a guarantor loan brand. Some 4.2 million people borrowed from the different brands during the period but not all are expected to have a valid claim, with the court estimating that up to 30% of them could apply for redress. ""A loan is only affordable if you could repay it on time and still be able to pay your other debts, bills and living expenses,"" said Sara Williams. ""You may have paid the loan on time, but it may still have been unaffordable. If paying Provident left you so short of money you had to borrow more or you got behind with bills then it was unaffordable.""

"This video can not be played 'Fantastic' Sky Brown takes bronze to become youngest GB medallist Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Thirteen-year-old Sky Brown earned a momentous skateboarding bronze to become Great Britain's youngest Olympic medallist as victories in sailing and showjumping on Wednesday took Team GB's gold medal tally to 15. Hannah Mills and Eilidh McIntyre clinched gold in the 470 class, makingMills the most successful female Olympic sailorof all time after her gold in Rio five years ago and silver at London 2012. Ben Maher then won gold inthe individual showjumping eventon board Explosion W after a dramatic six-horse jump-off. Boxer Ben Whittaker secured a men's light-heavyweight silver medal after Frazer Clarke took bronze in the men's super-heavyweight division. With six medals guaranteed in Tokyo this is Britain's most successful Olympics in the boxing ring since 1920, when just 12 nations took part. Meanwhile, Canada's Andre de Grasse won his first gold and fifth Olympic medal overall as he overhauled world champion Noah Lyles in themen's 200m final. Great Britain moved up to fourth in the standings after winning two golds on Wednesday Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table The first of GB's five medals on day 12 came from Brown, born a month before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. She fell on her first two runs in the women's park skateboarding final beforeposting a score of 56.47 to make the podium. The teenager replaces Sarah Hardcastle as Britain's youngest summer Games medal winner - the swimmer was 15 years and 113 days when she won silver and bronze in Los Angeles at the 1984 Olympics. At 13 years and 28 days, Brown also breaks Margery Hinton's 93-year-old record as the country's youngest competitor and claims Team GB's first skateboarding medal. This video can not be played Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson pulls up injured in women's heptathlon 200m But there was a heartbreaking end to world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson's heptathlon medal hopes. The 28-year-old, who was battling to overcome a left Achilles problem before the Games,sat fifth after three eventsbut pulled up with a right calf injury in the 200m and was disqualified from the race for leaving her lane. Meanwhile,Jason Kennystarted the defence of his Olympic sprint title with three victories in the opening rounds, as team-mate Jack Carlin also progressed and Katy Marchant reached the women's keirin quarter-finals. Carlin GB's best chance of sprint medal, says Kenny Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Nielsen Gracenote said: ""Great Britain have closed the gap with the Rio and London Olympics and now have 48 medals after 12 days of competition compared to 49 in 2016 and 48 in 2012. ""However, at both of those Olympics, sailing, taekwondo and triathlon were still going on in the last four days of the Games so expect 2021 to fall behind again on total medals won."" Who are Team GB's medal winners? How are GB athletes performing in Tokyo? Brown beat the previous record of Team GB's youngest Olympic medal winner by more than two years while also becoming the youngest competitor at a summer Games for her country. Hinton was 13 years and 44 days when she swam at the Amsterdam Games in 1928, and that landmark stood for almost a century. Until Wednesday, that is, when Brown - 16 days younger - began her women's park skateboarding campaign at Ariake Urban Sports Park. Had the Games not been postponed by a year, Brown would have lowered that summer record further, though figure skater Cecilia Colledge retains the overall accolade for Britain - she entered the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid aged 11. Brown qualified for the final but fell during her opening two runs to set up a tense final attempt. But the Japan-born teenager - who had a heavy fall in training last year that saw her fracture her skull, break her left arm and wrist, and suffer lacerations to her heart and lungs - delivered a score of 56.47 to climb into the bronze-medal position.

All the girls are ripping it, it was insane, it was a super-sick final."" Japan's Sakura Yosozumi, 19, won gold with a best score of 60.09, while 12-year-old compatriot Kokona Hiraki claimed silver with 59.04. Britain's stellar Olympics continued on the water,with Mills and McIntyre's successtaking the nation's sailing medal tally to five, of which three of those are gold. The GB pair finished fifth in the 470 medal race, but their earlier performances meant it was enough to hold off silver medallists Poland and France in bronze. Their celebrations were put on ice briefly after a protest was lodged by bronze-medallists France. But 33-year-old Mills, one of Team GB's flag bearers at the opening ceremony, did not have to wait long to have her third Olympic medal confirmed.

""Growing up, like a lot of Olympians, I dreamed of being here one day and standing on top of the podium. ""To do it twice with Saskia [Clark] and with Eilidh this time, I've had two incredible crews to sail with and I feel incredibly lucky."" McIntyre follows in the footsteps of her father, Mike, who won gold in the star class at Seoul in 1988. Earlier, Britain's Chris Grube and Luke Patience finished fifth overall in the men's 470. Maher's showjumping gold gives the British equestrian team a fifth Olympic medal in Tokyo, equalling their record haul achieved in London. It follows gold for the eventing team and Tom McEwen's individual eventing silver, plus team dressage bronze and Charlotte Dujardin's individual dressage bronze. Maher, 38, was thrust into a six-horse jump-off and completed his run in 37.85 to pip Sweden's Peder Fredricson by 17-hundredths of a second, with the Netherlands' Maikel van der Vleuten taking bronze. It is a second Olympic medal for Maher after winning gold in the team jumping event at London 2012.

"DeepSukebe's website promises a very easy way to instantly nudify clothed pictures of women MP Maria Miller wants a parliamentary debate on whether digitally generated nude images need to be banned. It comes as another service which allows users to undress women in photos, using Artificial intelligence (AI), spreads rapidly on social media. The website in question had more than five million visits in June alone, according to one analyst. Celebrities, including an Olympic athlete, are among those who users claim to have nudified. DeepSukebe's website promises users it can ""reveal the truth hidden under clothes"". Launched in 2020, it is unclear who is behind it. The BBC has contacted the company for comment, but received no reply. According to its Twitter page, it is an ""AI-leveraged nudifier"" whose mission is to ""make all men's dreams come true"". And in a blog post, the developers say that they are working on a more powerful version of the tool. Ms Miller told the BBC it was time to consider a ban of such tools. ""Parliament needs to have the opportunity to debate whether nude and sexually explicit images generated digitally without consent should be outlawed, and I believe if this were to happen the law would change."" She said that it should be an offence to distribute sexual images online without consent to reflect ""the severity of the impact on people's lives"". ""If software providers develop this technology, they are complicit in a very serious crime and should be required to design their products to stop this happening."" She has been campaigning about so-called revenge porn - when nude or sexually explicit images are distributed without consent - for the last six years. ""At the moment, making, taking or distributing without consent intimate sexual images online or through digital technology falls mostly outside of the law. ""It should be a sexual offence to distribute sexual images online without consent, reflecting the severity of the impact on people's lives."" She wants the issue to be included in the forthcoming Online Safety Bill. Campaign group Cease (Centre To End All Sexual Exploitation) told the BBC it also believed nudification tools needed to be tackled in the Bill. ""The law is not adequate in this area,"" said chief executive Vanessa Morse. ""Technology which is designed to objectify and humiliate women should be shut down, and porn sites which profit from mass distribution of these images must be forced to proactively block their upload,"" she said. She added the fact that the onus is currently on victims ""often traumatised and humiliated"" to have such images removed from the internet was simply not fair. Nudifier tools, as they are known, are not new. DeepNude was launched in 2019, but the creators quickly withdrew the service and offered refunds, following a backlash. Currently nudification tools only work for creating naked women - something one developer acknowledged was sexist They acknowledged the probability people would misuse it was ""very high"", adding that the world was not ready for such a controversial tool. But similar services remain on the market, many using the DeepNude source code, which was made publicly available by the original developers. While many often produce clumsy, sometimes laughable results, the new website uses a proprietary algorithm which one analyst described as ""putting it years ahead of the competition"". The BBC spoke to a developer behind one of the many nudification tools available online. Ivan Bravo acknowledged that such creations ""are not ethical, mainly in the way it is currently used and the way the original developers started advertising it as 'nude your friends'"". ""However, we don't live in a perfect world and people have always been looking for ways to do this, so it was only a matter of time before such a technology came into existence."" He added that the fact the technology was only currently able to nudify women was sexist. ""Personally I would also like to have a version for nude men and even fictional characters like anime, so that all people can enjoy or experiment with this kind of adult entertainment. ""The goal is to find what kind of uses we can give to this technology within the legal and ethical [framework].""

"The MV Asphalt Princess was reportedly boarded by up to nine armed men Men who boarded and seized a ship in the Gulf of Oman have left the vessel and all those remaining on board are safe, officials say. A UK maritime security agency said the potential hijacking of the Panama-flagged MV Asphalt Princess had ended but gave no further details. The bitumen tanker was seized on Tuesday heading into the congested approach to the Strait of Hormuz. It is not clear who seized the ship, but analysts suspected Iranian forces. Iran's Revolutionary Guards dismissed reports of possible involvement as a pretext for ""hostile action"" against Tehran. The men who boarded the MV Asphalt Princess were reportedly armed and are said to have ordered it to sail to Iran. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) had initially warned ships of an incident before declaring a ""potential hijack"" hours later. On Wednesday, the UKMTO tweeted that those who boarded the vessel had left, adding: ""Vessel is safe. Incident complete."" The incident occurred less than a week after an oil tanker operated by an Israeli-owned company was attacked by a drone off Oman, killing two security guards - one British and the other Romanian. The US, UK and Israel blamed Iran for the attack - a claim it strongly denies. BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner says the MV Asphalt Princess is owned by a Dubai-based company that had one of its ships hijacked two years ago by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. He says that, according to reports, up to nine armed men boarded the vessel as it neared the entrance to the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world's maritime oil supplies passes. The UKMTO had earlier advised shipping services near Fujairah in the Gulf of Oman to exercise extreme caution. Earlier in the day, four oil tankers reported that they were ""not under command"", which usually means that a vessel has lost power and cannot steer. One of the ships later began moving, the Associated Press news agency reports. Iran's foreign ministry said reports involving several ships on Tuesday were ""suspicious"" and warned against any effort to ""create a false atmosphere"" against Tehran.

"Barbie maker Mattel has created a doll of the scientist who designed the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert. Dame Sarah said she found the creation ""very strange"" at first - but she hoped it would inspire children. ""My wish is that my doll will show children careers they may not be aware of, like a vaccinologist,"" she said. Her Barbie is one of six to honour women working in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem). The others include an Australian medic who helped create a reusable gown for health workers, and a Brazilian biomedical researcher. Who is the woman who designed the Oxford vaccine? Vaccinologist Dame Sarah - who was recognised with a damehood in the Queen's Birthday Honours - began designing a coronavirus vaccine in early 2020 when Covid first emerged in China. Her vaccine - the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab - is now the most widely used around the world, with doses sent to more than 170 countries. ""I am passionate about inspiring the next generation of girls into Stem careers and hope that children who see my Barbie will realise how vital careers in science are to help the world around us,"" said Dame Sarah. In recent years, toymaker Mattel has responded to criticism that its Barbie doll sets an unrealistic image of womanhood. It now offers dolls themed around careers such as a firefighter, doctor and astronaut - and in a range of skin tones beyond its original white, blonde doll that first launched in 1959. Sales of Barbie dollsrose to a six-year high last year,as the pandemic saw parents stock up on toys for their children.

"Boris Johnson met Nicola Sturgeon at Bute House in July 2019 Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""strange"" the PM would not meet her during his two-day visit to Scotland. The first minister said ""I don't feel snubbed"" but ""most people will think it's a bit odd"" that Mr Johnson declined an invitation. Instead, he has met police officers and visited a renewable energy project. Mr Johnson has suggested he have a meeting with first ministers at a later date. Nicola Sturgeon had invited the PM to her official residence to discuss Covid recovery. She said it was a ""missed opportunity"" that Mr Johnson did not meet her at Bute House, her official residence in Edinburgh. What happened to Indyref2? Gove 'can't see' Scottish referendum before 2024 In a letter to Ms Sturgeon seen by the BBC, Mr Johnson said he was ""keen to arrange an in-person meeting"" with her. He said that, at a previous meeting between them, it was agreed they should set up a ""structured forum for ongoing engagement"" - and officials had made good progress on this. ""There is much for us to discuss as all parts of the UK work together on our shared priority of recovering from the pandemic,"" he said. ""The UK government is working closely with the devolved Scottish government on a variety of different issues."" And he added: ""I look forward to meeting with you soon and working together in the interests of people in all parts of our country."" Ms Sturgeontweeted on Monday,externalthat she had invited the PM to Bute House. She said the prime minister's trip would be the first chance for the pair to meet in person for a while. The first minister said she believed people would find it ""a bit odd and a bit strange"" that Mr Johnson had chosen not to meet her. Speaking to broadcasters, she said she did not feel ""snubbed"", but that it would have been the first opportunity to sit down and have a ""face to face chat"", describing the move as  a ""missed opportunity - but that's on him"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is also on a visit to Scotland, said he thought the prime minister should meet Ms Sturgeon. He said the two should be working together on ""the two most important things facing us"" - the pandemic and the climate emergency. He added: ""We shouldn't have an argument about when they're going to meet or where - they need to work together on this."" They may not be meeting in person, but that doesn't mean Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon can't engage in some political games. The first minister threw down a gauntlet very publicly when she posted her invitation to Mr Johnson on Twitter. It was a win-win proposition for Ms Sturgeon, presenting the prime minister with the choice of looking like a visiting dignitary from a foreign power - or a scaredy cat swerving the jeering crowds which turned out for his last visit to Bute House. Ultimately Mr Johnson has refused to take the bait, preferring to suggest a summit of leaders from around the UK - presumably where he can take the role of magnanimous host. For all the talk of grown-up dialogue there is plainly no love lost between the pair, who will no doubt trade rhetoric via the media rather than face-to-face. And with the constitutional question of Scottish independence still looming between them, the political power-plays are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. The trip is Mr Johnson's first visit to Scotland since January - and his first since a pro-independence majority was returned at the Holyrood election in May. There is no prospect of the pair seeing eye-to-eye on another referendum, but Ms Sturgeon had said she wanted to discuss how the governments could work together on ""Covid recovery"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the SNP leader had put out her invitation to the prime minister via Twitter, adding: ""I'm not sure if he got it before everyone else got it on Twitter"". Mr Ross said: ""His response was quite right. Nicola Sturgeon had agreed with the prime minister that governments across the UK would meet together. That is the right approach to take and that was the agreement made recently. ""There's constant dialogue between the Scottish and UK governments."" On the prime minister's last trip to Scotland in January, Ms Sturgeonquestioned whether the trip was essentialduring lockdown restrictions. Downing Street said it was important for the prime minister to be ""visible and accessible"" during the pandemic.

"Architecture student Mersei Mongaba works on a modular house made from sustainable Finnish larch, which has doubled in cost The price of timber has risen sharply with builders struggling to get supplies, as post-lockdown construction and DIY projects create huge demand. The Timber Trade Federation (TTF) said suppliers were ""working around the clock"" but are ""struggling to keep up"". Climate change is also increasing the pressure on supply with more wildfires and pests that kill trees. The UK imports around 80% of its timber and many are calling for the UK's forestry industry to be nurtured. The government said it was ""committed to trebling tree planting rates by the end of this Parliament"" and creating many more woodlands to boost the supply and demand for UK-grown timber. Sweden, which supplies almost half of the structural wood used in the UK, has recorded its lowest stock levels for 20 years. DIY and building projects hit by materials shortage Building's hard problem - making concrete green David Hopkins, chief executive of the TTF, said: ""The pandemic has been the biggest factor causing the problems between supply and demandâ¦ but there are other factors at play. We've got these huge forest fires raging across North America that will take lots of timber out of production. ""The fires, and now the bugs, are taking out a significant volume from the market."" Parts of the west coast of the US saw record-breaking wildfires in 2020, and there are early signs this season could be severe These ash trees in Hereford are felled after being infected by ash dieback. Climate change makes trees more vulnerable to pests and infection Graham Taylor, managing director of Pryor and Rickett Silviculture, manages around 50,000 acres of forestry across the UK. He said there was ""no doubt"" the world's natural forests were suffering with climate change, and that yields were dropping. ""Canada is reducing its annual cut because its own natural forests are under threat from fire, pest and disease. Because it is such a big producer, when it pulls back, the rest of the world catches a cold."" One of those affected is Wilf Meynell, an architect and project manager at Studio Bark, which has created a sustainable, modular, all-timber system used in many self-build projects called U-Build. He said: ""Everyone's taking a hit. Our entire business is focused around timber. The price of birch ply has doubled, and the cost of our standard work has risen by 25%."" Mr Meynell's ""giant Lego with bolts"" is made from sustainably managed Finnish spruce - so for every tree cut down, six more are planted. In contrast, concrete is carbon-intensive and hugelydamaging to the environment,external. As cities grow, architects and designers are recognising the need to decarbonise the built environment. The World Bank haspredicted demand is going to rise for wood products,externalby 4% a year for the next 30-40 years. In the UK, forest covers only around 13% of the land. According to the National Farmers Union, in 2019, less than 60% of England's existing woodlands were in ""active management"". These architects of the future believe sustainability must be at the heart of building - and wood has a key role to play Mr Hopkins, from the TTF, said this had to change. ""Why is it that the UK has the lowest forest cover in Europe, when we're actually one of the biggest importers and users of timber in the world? ""Now, particularly as we're hosting the climate change talks, we need to be talking to our own politicians in this country asking what are we going to do about it."" Mr Meynell had been forced to find a local supplier for some of his timber on a site in Ross-on-Wye. He said it worked well, reducing emissions and supporting the local economy. ""It's about educating people within the construction sector that UK timber does have great qualities and is affordable and can be sourced easilyâ¦ if we've got the forestry to back it up, we could start solving some of these problems."" Architecture student Mersei Mongaba, who has been volunteering on his site, said that it was important not to be ""greedy"" with resources. ""When we talk about this subject, we put trees in one whole category, but there are so many different types. There are some types - like spruce - where you're OK to cut a certain amount, but with others - such as oak - we have to be a lot more careful and control how we are cutting them down."" The monoculture commercial conifer planting of the 1980s caused severe habitat decline. However, forest manager Mr Taylor said ""the wrong trees were planted in the wrong place"". Oak saplings take around a hundred years to become mature trees ""There needs to be a blend - a large amount of commercial forest because this is about wood production, but there also needs to be extensive semi-natural planting for biodiversity."" He said decisions needed to be made now. ""It's a long old businessâ¦ it's 30-40 years for conifers. At the moment we are in the phase of producing mature oak, from trees that were planted in the Victorian period."" The TTF predict the disruption to supplies will continue for much of the rest of the year.

She made mistakes in the first two of her three runs in the final and was fourth going into her last effort. However, she showed great maturity to nail her final run, landing a kickflip indy - the trick that caused her to fall in her first two attempts - to score 56.47. She threw her arms in the air and sunk to her knees after completing a clean run and her father Stu was overcome with emotion, but they still faced a nervous wait to find out if she'd done enough to take home a historic medal with one athlete still to go. And when Japan's world number one and pre-competition favourite Misugu Okamoto fell, confirming bronze for Brown, she couldn't hold back the tears as she hugged her rivals before being lifted in the air by her father. The finalists showed solidarity and rushed to support Japan's world number one Misugu Okamoto after she fell on her final run Even Brown's face mask could not hide her huge smile as she received her bronze medal on the podium at the Ariake Sports Park. When asked what she would be doing next, Brown replied: ""Hang out with some friends, and party!"" The result is even more impressive given Brown is""lucky to be alive""after suffering a serious injury in May last year that would have kept her out of the Olympics had they taken place as scheduled in 2020. She crashed between two ramps while attempting a jump in training, fracturing her skull, breaking her left arm and wrist and suffering lacerations to her heart and lungs. Brown also tumbled before her Olympic qualifier, breaking her arm, but came first while wearing a protective cast. 13 thing to know about 13-year-old Olympic skateboarding medallist Sky Brown Meet the Browns Sky Brown celebrated her bronze medal with her father Stu Brown's dad Stu is English, but moved to the United States in his teens. He and Sky's mum Mieko met in Japan, where both Mieko and Sky were born and the family - which also includes Sky's brother Ocean - are now based.

Skateboarding runs in the family. Stu first introduced his daughter to the sport while competing as an amateur, balancing his work in marketing. Sky has never had a skateboarding coach and learns her tricks from YouTube. Her first Olympic qualifier was in Long Beach when she was 10. Tim Warwood, BBC skateboarding commentator ""Look how good that was. That was amazing. Sakura Yosozumi - what a run. What a standard of skateboarding. It was nothing short of brilliant. Kokokna Hiraki is 12 years old. She can't even legally buy a lottery ticket. ""Then you've got Sky Brown coming out at 13, showing the pressure and composure of a 50-year-old. Having that mental resilience to fall not once, but twice, and then to go in on your third run and try it again. The fact she's 13 and has been able to do that is nothing short of incredible. It's unbelievable, it's so brilliant and just incredible stories across the board. ""I hate to say this but I'm going to say it anyway. Skateboarding has won. It has come to these Olympics and both the street and park disciplines have been brilliant."" 'In my eyes, anyone can be an influencer':Is social media a viable full-time career at 16?

"This video can not be played 'Fantastic' Sky Brown takes bronze to become youngest GB medallist Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Thirteen-year-old Sky Brown earned a momentous skateboarding bronze to become Great Britain's youngest Olympic medallist as victories in sailing and showjumping on Wednesday took Team GB's gold medal tally to 15. Hannah Mills and Eilidh McIntyre clinched gold in the 470 class, makingMills the most successful female Olympic sailorof all time after her gold in Rio five years ago and silver at London 2012. Ben Maher then won gold inthe individual showjumping eventon board Explosion W after a dramatic six-horse jump-off. Boxer Ben Whittaker secured a men's light-heavyweight silver medal after Frazer Clarke took bronze in the men's super-heavyweight division. With six medals guaranteed in Tokyo this is Britain's most successful Olympics in the boxing ring since 1920, when just 12 nations took part. Meanwhile, Canada's Andre de Grasse won his first gold and fifth Olympic medal overall as he overhauled world champion Noah Lyles in themen's 200m final. Great Britain moved up to fourth in the standings after winning two golds on Wednesday Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table The first of GB's five medals on day 12 came from Brown, born a month before the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. She fell on her first two runs in the women's park skateboarding final beforeposting a score of 56.47 to make the podium. The teenager replaces Sarah Hardcastle as Britain's youngest summer Games medal winner - the swimmer was 15 years and 113 days when she won silver and bronze in Los Angeles at the 1984 Olympics. At 13 years and 28 days, Brown also breaks Margery Hinton's 93-year-old record as the country's youngest competitor and claims Team GB's first skateboarding medal. This video can not be played Great Britain's Katarina Johnson-Thompson pulls up injured in women's heptathlon 200m But there was a heartbreaking end to world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson's heptathlon medal hopes. The 28-year-old, who was battling to overcome a left Achilles problem before the Games,sat fifth after three eventsbut pulled up with a right calf injury in the 200m and was disqualified from the race for leaving her lane. Meanwhile,Jason Kennystarted the defence of his Olympic sprint title with three victories in the opening rounds, as team-mate Jack Carlin also progressed and Katy Marchant reached the women's keirin quarter-finals. Carlin GB's best chance of sprint medal, says Kenny Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis, Nielsen Gracenote said: ""Great Britain have closed the gap with the Rio and London Olympics and now have 48 medals after 12 days of competition compared to 49 in 2016 and 48 in 2012. ""However, at both of those Olympics, sailing, taekwondo and triathlon were still going on in the last four days of the Games so expect 2021 to fall behind again on total medals won."" Who are Team GB's medal winners? How are GB athletes performing in Tokyo? Brown beat the previous record of Team GB's youngest Olympic medal winner by more than two years while also becoming the youngest competitor at a summer Games for her country. Hinton was 13 years and 44 days when she swam at the Amsterdam Games in 1928, and that landmark stood for almost a century. Until Wednesday, that is, when Brown - 16 days younger - began her women's park skateboarding campaign at Ariake Urban Sports Park. Had the Games not been postponed by a year, Brown would have lowered that summer record further, though figure skater Cecilia Colledge retains the overall accolade for Britain - she entered the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid aged 11. Brown qualified for the final but fell during her opening two runs to set up a tense final attempt. But the Japan-born teenager - who had a heavy fall in training last year that saw her fracture her skull, break her left arm and wrist, and suffer lacerations to her heart and lungs - delivered a score of 56.47 to climb into the bronze-medal position.

All the girls are ripping it, it was insane, it was a super-sick final."" Japan's Sakura Yosozumi, 19, won gold with a best score of 60.09, while 12-year-old compatriot Kokona Hiraki claimed silver with 59.04. Britain's stellar Olympics continued on the water,with Mills and McIntyre's successtaking the nation's sailing medal tally to five, of which three of those are gold. The GB pair finished fifth in the 470 medal race, but their earlier performances meant it was enough to hold off silver medallists Poland and France in bronze. Their celebrations were put on ice briefly after a protest was lodged by bronze-medallists France. But 33-year-old Mills, one of Team GB's flag bearers at the opening ceremony, did not have to wait long to have her third Olympic medal confirmed. This video can not be played Team GB sailors Mills and McIntyre win 470 gold ""It's absolutely mad,"" said Mills. ""Growing up, like a lot of Olympians, I dreamed of being here one day and standing on top of the podium. ""To do it twice with Saskia [Clark] and with Eilidh this time, I've had two incredible crews to sail with and I feel incredibly lucky."" McIntyre follows in the footsteps of her father, Mike, who won gold in the star class at Seoul in 1988. Earlier, Britain's Chris Grube and Luke Patience finished fifth overall in the men's 470. Maher's showjumping gold gives the British equestrian team a fifth Olympic medal in Tokyo, equalling their record haul achieved in London. It follows gold for the eventing team and Tom McEwen's individual eventing silver, plus team dressage bronze and Charlotte Dujardin's individual dressage bronze. Maher, 38, was thrust into a six-horse jump-off and completed his run in 37.85 to pip Sweden's Peder Fredricson by 17-hundredths of a second, with the Netherlands' Maikel van der Vleuten taking bronze. It is a second Olympic medal for Maher after winning gold in the team jumping event at London 2012. ""I'm getting married in a couple of weeks and that makes this all the more special - but my fiancee knows she has to share me with Explosion,"" he said.

Whittaker lost the light-heavyweight final on a split decision as Lopez added the title to the middleweight gold he won at Rio 2016. ""You don't win silver, you lose gold,"" said an emotional Whittaker. ""I'm very disappointed with myself, I didn't perform well. Of course, he's a class operator - two-time Olympic gold medallist now but I'm very disappointed. I feel like a failure.

"This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: GB skateboarder Sky Brown is ready to take on the world Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. For skateboarder Sky Brown, life will never be the same again after she became Britain's youngest-ever Olympic medallist. The limelight is nothing new for the 13-year-old, who has grown up with media attention and is a future superstar for the digital age in a sport which could become a mainstay of the Olympic scene. On Wednesday, she won bronze in the women's park skateboarding at Tokyo 2020. Here are 13 things to know about the British skateboarding star. This video can not be played Watch the best tricks from the women's park debut in Tokyo as GB's Brown wins bronze Brown made history when she stepped out at the Ariake Urban Sports Park, as theyoungest athlete to represent Team GB,breaking Margery Hinton's 93-year-old record. Hinton was 13 years and 44 days when she swam at the Amsterdam Games of 1928, while Brown competed aged 13 years and 28 days. Brown then made history again as she won bronze - replacing Sarah Hardcastle as Britain's youngest summer Games medallist. The swimmer was aged 15 years and 113 days when she won silver and bronze in Los Angeles in 1984. Brown won skateboarding bronze at the World Championships, but also surfs, sings and dances Brown's dad Stu is English, but moved to the United States in his teens. He and Sky's mum Mieko met in Japan, where both Mieko and Sky were born and the family - which also includes Sky's brother Ocean - are now based. Skateboarding runs in the family; Stu first introduced his daughter to the sport while competing as an amateur, balancing his work in marketing. Brown's skateboarding commitments - her first Olympic qualifier was in Long Beach when she was 10 - mean she splits her time between California and Miyazaki. Her American residence is Oceanside, about 35 miles away from San Diego, but her first language is Japanese. Brown is one of the beneficiaries of the Tokyo Games being postponed by a year because her place would have been in doubt had they gone ahead in 2020. In May last year, Brown fell from a ramp in training, fracturing her skull, breaking her left arm and wrist and suffering lacerations to her heart and lungs. ""Sky had the gnarliest fall she's ever had and is lucky to be alive,"" Stu said at the time. ""Sky remains positive and strong. The whole medical team is shocked to see her positivity."" Brown also tumbled before her Olympic qualifier, breaking her arm, but came first while wearing a protective cast. Brown has a YouTube channel with her younger brother Ocean Brown first went viral aged four, when Stu posted a clip of her on Facebook, but she has never had a professional coach. She spent hours watching and recreating clips from YouTube and has worked with the legendary Tony Hawk, but not in an official capacity. This video can not be played I want to show sometimes you're going to fall - skateboarder Sky Brown Brown is incredibly popular on social media. After her fall,she used Instagram,externalto update her followers - a group which has since grown to almost one million. She also shares a YouTube channel with her brother, which documents their lives and her journey towards the Olympics. Ocean's Instagram account, which is managed by his mum, has 168,000 followers. Brown holds a number of sponsorship contracts, and was snapped up by Nike after turning professional in 2018. She has since appeared in adverts with global icons Simone Biles and Serena Williams. ""I hope I can inspire other young girls by being the smallest skater at the Olympics,""she told the Guardian,externalearlier this year. Brown has worked with Tony Hawk Because her sporting career is so hectic and requires so much travel, Brown only attends school - in Orange County - twice a week and tops up her learning online. Her typical day also includes three hours' skating at various parks in Oceanside. Since winning bronze in the 2019 World Championships in Brazil, Brown has cemented her position as one of the world's best skaters, and is currently ranked in the top three. Before her Olympic bronze, Brown left her mark at the X Games - an annual extreme sports event. In 2019, she became the first female to successfully land a frontside 540 in the competition, rotating one and a half times on her board in mid-air. Taking advantage of the Californian climate, Brown loves to surf with her dad and brother, and will often be up at 5am to enjoy the waves. Brown also loves dancing and singing, and in 2018 turned down a place at the X Games to focus on the the junior edition of Dancing with the Stars - the US version of Strictly Come Dancing. Victory with JT Church sparked interest in her story, and she was invited to appear on the Ellen DeGeneres show. While recovering from her accident last year, Brown released a song titled Girl, and has also brought out a book called Sky's the Limit. The book's tagline is 'words of wisdom from a young champion'.

"The US Department of Justice has found that FBI agents used photographs of female office staff as bait for sexual predators. A watchdog report said the support staff members were not certified to work undercover in this manner. It noted that the photos could potentially put staff in danger. In response, the FBI has said it accepted the findings. The agency will change its policies and implement new guidelines.Â The report did not specify how widespread the practice was found to be, and it did not accuse the agents of using the photographs without telling their colleagues. The support staff were clothed and had their faces blurred in the images.Â But the watchdog report noted that the photos could still potentially be copied or shared, putting staff ""in danger of becoming the victims of sexual offenses.""Â The findings were triggered by an investigation into whether a male agent had an inappropriate relationship with a co-worker. According to the justice department's report, that agent had requested ""provocative"" pictures of the support staff employee to be used in online undercover operations. During the course of that inquiry, the Office of the Inspector General ""learned that SAs [special agents] sometimes used photographs of young female support staff employees to pose as minor children or sex workers to entice predators"" the report said.Â The report noted that support staff are not certified for such roles. FBI policy says support staff should only be used in undercover operations when it is ""absolutely necessary"" and the useÂ must be authorised by the special agent in charge. On its website, the FBI notes that agents often use fake personas on social media in which they impersonate a child and arrest suspects before or after they offend. In the 2020 fiscal year alone, a Justice Department-led task force aimed at combatting internet crimes against children conducted more than 109,000 investigations that led to the arrest of over 9,200 suspects.

Canada's Andre De Grasse succeeds Usain Bolt in becoming the new 200m Olympic champion! But there was a heartbreaking end to world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson's heptathlon medal hopes. The 28-year-old, who was battling to overcome a left Achilles problem before the Games,sat fifth after three eventsbut pulled up with a right calf injury in the 200m and was disqualified from the race for leaving her lane. Elegance... Hannah Mills and Hannah Mills and Eilidh McIntyre won gold after a protest from France was rejected. GB's boxers won silver and bronze in the ring thanks to Benjamin Whittaker and Frazer Clarke. Sydney McLaughlin setting a new world record in 400m hurdles was quite a moment.

Individual jumping GB showjumping gold medallist Ben Maher talking about his winning partner, Explosion W:""The horse is like lightning, the second and third jump weren't as fast as I wanted them to be and then I took a big risk across the middle and normally Explosion and I we read each others mind, we're very in sync and he did question me in the middle, I felt a slight hesitation but he can do that, he grew wings, that's what sets him apart from the other horses. Little bit of luck is always involved but it was incredible.

"The Starliner stands ready atop its United Launch Alliance Atlas rocket Boeing says it is checking the propulsion system valves on its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, after Tuesday's planned launch was postponed. The CST-100 Starliner will launch from Florida at some point to showcase how it can ferry crews to and from the International Space Station (ISS). It will be the second test flight, and conducted with no people aboard. The previous demonstration in 2019 encountered software problems that very nearly caused the loss of the capsule. The Starliner will ride to orbit on an Atlas-5 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Controllers had been targeting Tuesday for the launch but scrubbed the countdown with two-and-a-half hours left on the clock, to allow for investigation of technical issues related to the capsule's propulsion system. Now Boeing says a rescheduled launch on Wednesday will not happen either,external, because it needs more time to discover the reason for ""unexpected valve position indications in the propulsion system"". Boeing's Starliner spacecraft: A guide Astronauts begin historic mission on private craft Astronaut capsule lands after incomplete mission Augustine panel supports commercial space,external Fortunately, the 2019 test Starliner still managed to land safely It's just over 10 years since Boeing first presented its design for the CST-100 Starlinerat the Farnborough Air Showin the UK. It was a response to the call for commercial companies to take over the responsibility for low-Earth orbit crew transportation, post the soon-to-retire space shuttles. The US space agency (Nasa) gave technical and financial support to both Boeing and the SpaceX company, to help them develop new capsules. The idea was that the vehicles would then be engaged on a commercial basis whenever Nasa needed astronauts sent up to the ISS. But while SpaceX is now two crewed operational flights into this privatised era, Boeing has yet to run a single crewed mission in a Starliner. And that's because Boeing's first unpiloted ""Orbital Flight Test"" in December 2019 went seriously awry. The problems started with a clock error on the capsule just after launch that made the vehicle think it was in a different flight phase than was really the case. This prompted the onboard computer system to over-fire Starliner's thrusters and burn so much fuel it became impossible to reach the intended destination of a docking with the space station. Controllers on the ground could see the problem playing out but had difficulty communicating with the spacecraft. After the truncated mission, it also emerged that poorly designed software could have resulted in the capsule colliding with its aft service section when the two were commanded to separate just prior to re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Fortunately, this issue was caught and prevented, andthe capsule landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The post-mission review initiated a series of re-designs and upgrades that have enabled Boeing to attempt an Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2). The only ""individual"" aboard will be ""Rosie the Rocketeer"" Chris Ferguson, a former Nasa astronaut and Boeing's director of Starliner mission operations, said the company had run full-mission duration simulations of the new software on the capsule. The new code, he added, had implemented every correction recommended by the review. ""We fixed every one, we addressed every one. We want this next flight to be as clean as it could possibly be,"" he told reporters. ""We have thoroughly dug into, tested and verified hundreds of times the software code, to ensure that it performs exactly the way we intend on OFT-2."" The SpaceX Dragon capsule is already flying crews to the ISS The re-run will follow the same profile: an uncrewed mission to the ISS. That said, an anthropomorphic test device, more commonly known as a flight dummy, dubbed ""Rosie the Rocketeer"", will once again strap in for the ride. Rosie and ""her"" capsule will stay attached to the station for five days, before departing for a parachute-assisted descent and landing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. If Boeing can put the flaws of OFT-1 behind it, Nasa could clear Starliner to start carrying people before the end of the year. This would finally give the agency the two new crew-transportation systemsit sought when the shuttles were retired,externalto museums exactly 10 years ago. ""This is a huge component to returning this launch capability from the United States and having redundancy between SpaceX and Boeing, so that we're not reliant on just one company to get astronauts to the International Space Station,"" said Nicole Mann, a Nasa astronaut who has been selected to fly on the first crewed Starliner mission. And this capability would also open up space to wider participation, she believed: ""You're going to see more folks in low-Earth orbit who are not Nasa astronauts. That's great. I think for the younger generation, they're going to see scientists, engineers and maybe journalists in space, and they're going to be able to capture the amazement of space and share the experience.""

"This video can not be played 'Fantastic' Sky Brown takes bronze to become youngest GB medallist An emotional Sky Brown broke down in tears after becoming Great Britain's youngest Olympic medal winner of all time. Aged 13 years and 28 days, Brown produced a composed final run to finish third in the women's park skateboarding final and claim bronze at the Tokyo Games. ""It was a super sick final,"" she told BBC Sport. ""All the girls were ripping it, it was insane. ""This is incredible - it feels unreal! I'm so happy to be here - I'm blessed. ""I was definitely bumped. I fell twice, that made the last run feel even better."" Brown replaces Sarah Hardcastle as Britain's youngest summer Games medallist - the swimmer was aged 15 years and 113 days when she won silver and bronze in Los Angeles at the 1984 Olympics. Japan's Sakura Yosozumi, 19,won gold with a best score of 60.09 points,while 12-year-old compatriot Kokona Hiraki claimed silver with 59.04 as the sport made its Olympic debut with athletes performing tricks in a huge concrete bowl. The eight skateboarders in the final, who had an average age of 17, showed incredible camaraderie, cheering every trick and consoling each other after each fall. This video can not be played Watch the best tricks from the women's park debut as GB's Brown wins bronze Brown, who has also broken Margery Hinton's 93-year-old record to become the youngest athlete to represent Team GB at a summer Games, finished second in qualifying. She made mistakes in the first two of her three runs in the final and was fourth going into her last effort. However, she showed great maturity to nail her final run, landing a kickflip indy - the trick that caused her to fall in her first two attempts - to score 56.47. She threw her arms in the air and sunk to her knees after completing a clean run and her father Stu was overcome with emotion, but they still faced a nervous wait to find out if she'd done enough to take home a historic medal with one athlete still to go. And when Japan's world number one and pre-competition favourite Misugu Okamoto fell, confirming bronze for Brown, she couldn't hold back the tears as she hugged her rivals before being lifted in the air by her father. The finalists showed solidarity and rushed to support Japan's world number one Misugu Okamoto after she fell on her final run Even Brown's face mask could not hide her huge smile as she received her bronze medal on the podium at the Ariake Sports Park. When asked what she would be doing next, Brown replied: ""Hang out with some friends, and party!"" The result is even more impressive given Brown is""lucky to be alive""after suffering a serious injury in May last year that would have kept her out of the Olympics had they taken place as scheduled in 2020. She crashed between two ramps while attempting a jump in training, fracturing her skull, breaking her left arm and wrist and suffering lacerations to her heart and lungs. Brown also tumbled before her Olympic qualifier, breaking her arm, but came first while wearing a protective cast. 13 thing to know about 13-year-old Olympic skateboarding medallist Sky Brown Meet the Browns Sky Brown celebrated her bronze medal with her father Stu Brown's dad Stu is English, but moved to the United States in his teens. He and Sky's mum Mieko met in Japan, where both Mieko and Sky were born and the family - which also includes Sky's brother Ocean - are now based. The Browns split their time between California and Miyazaki.Their American residence is Oceanside, about 35 miles away from San Diego, but Sky's first language is Japanese. Skateboarding runs in the family. Stu first introduced his daughter to the sport while competing as an amateur, balancing his work in marketing. Sky has never had a skateboarding coach and learns her tricks from YouTube. Her first Olympic qualifier was in Long Beach when she was 10. Tim Warwood, BBC skateboarding commentator ""Look how good that was. That was amazing. Sakura Yosozumi - what a run. What a standard of skateboarding. It was nothing short of brilliant.

"A lengthy legal battle over the extradition of Huawei's chief financial officer reaches a crucial stage in Canada on Wednesday. Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of the founder of the Chinese telecoms company, was arrested at Vancouver airport in December 2018. She will appear in court as a judge begins hearing the final arguments over whether to send her to the US. Her case was also raised in high-level discussions between senior US and Chinese diplomats in recent weeks. The court hearings, which are expected to last up to three weeks, mark the culmination of two-and-a-half years of legal battles. The US alleges Ms Meng misled the bank HSBC over the true nature of Huawei's relationship with a company called Skycom and this, in turn, put the bank at risk of violating sanctions against Iran. Until now, lawyers have been arguing over what evidence can be presented in this extradition hearing and what arguments can be introduced to challenge the US request. Ms Meng's lawyers have been challenging the extradition on a number of grounds. One is that the US misled the Canadian court over the evidence. Huawei lawyers have fought to include material that they say shows Ms Meng did not mislead HSBC about the business relationship with Skycom, including the full details a Powerpoint presentation used during a 2013 meeting as well as internal Huawei emails. Her lawyers also sued HSBC first in London and then in Hong Kong to gain access to its internal material to support their position. However, the Canadian judge declined to allow this to be used. Ms Meng's lawyers argue the case is fundamentally a political prosecution with the Huawei executive a pawn in the battle between the US and China. They argue that it was further politicised by former President Donald Trump who at one point seemed to offer her release in return for a better trade deal with China. They are claiming her rights were violated when she was questioned at Vancouver airport without a lawyer and will say the case, about conversations in Hong Kong, does not relate to activity over which the US has jurisdiction. Finally, they will argue that even if the evidence was true, it would not justify a charge of fraud against her. A judgement is expected later in the year. If Ms Meng loses, the extradition request goes to Canadian government ministers for their decision. Her lawyers can then launch an appeal. This means the case could potentially drag on for another five years or more. But in parallel with the legal process, diplomatic contacts and back-channel discussions are understood to be ongoing over the case, involving US and Chinese officials as well as Huawei, a sign of how much is at stake with this case. The arrest of such a senior business executive from a prominent company led to anger in China and become one of a number of stumbling blocks in relations with the US. The Trump administration took a hard line on Huawei, imposing sanctions on the company, but so far the Biden approach has yet to shift significantly.  The arrest also led to a serious diplomatic crisis with Canada amid allegations that two Canadians have been arrested in China on national security charges as a bargaining chip over Ms Meng's detention. The issue was discussed in July when US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Xie Feng. Halting the extradition, along with the lifting of sanctions and visa restrictions against Chinese officials was raised by the Chinese side with US officials raising the two Canadians held in China. Despite both sides making demands, the meeting was said to be an improvement on a difficult first meeting between the Biden team and Chinese officials in Alaska a few months earlier. This video can not be played Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou as politically motivated Executives from Huawei have also been in touch with the US government to try to secure Ms Meng's release. Dropping the extradition request may require some kind of admission of wrongdoing from Ms Meng and some kind of tacit agreement over the fate of the Canadians, both of which may not be straightforward. But a deal may also be a signal that both Washington and Beijing are looking for ways to improve their fractious relationship and lower the temperature. The new US weapon against Russia?

And if you can't wait that long, then BBC One will be back on air from 23:05 BST with all the latest news from Tokyo. First up will be the men's marathon and action from the swimming pool. Until then... Total British golds:15 Medal table:4th I think we can call it Winning Wednesday for Great Britain. If you're just tuning in, here's a little package to keep you updated with the big stories from day 12... There's a new man on the track... Canada's Andre De Grasse succeeds Usain Bolt in becoming the new 200m Olympic champion! But there was a heartbreaking end to world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson's heptathlon medal hopes. The 28-year-old, who was battling to overcome a left Achilles problem before the Games,sat fifth after three eventsbut pulled up with a right calf injury in the 200m and was disqualified from the race for leaving her lane. Elegance... Hannah Mills and Hannah Mills and Eilidh McIntyre won gold after a protest from France was rejected. GB's boxers won silver and bronze in the ring thanks to Benjamin Whittaker and Frazer Clarke. Sydney McLaughlin setting a new world record in 400m hurdles was quite a moment. After that disappointment for Shauna Coxsey, let's refresh our memories with some earlier British glory... If you haven't seen it yet, this is well worth four minutes of your time. Sit back and enjoy watching Sky Brown become the youngest GB medallist in Olympic history. Individual jumping GB showjumping gold medallist Ben Maher talking about his winning partner, Explosion W:""The horse is like lightning, the second and third jump weren't as fast as I wanted them to be and then I took a big risk across the middle and normally Explosion and I we read each others mind, we're very in sync and he did question me in the middle, I felt a slight hesitation but he can do that, he grew wings, that's what sets him apart from the other horses. Little bit of luck is always involved but it was incredible. ""I'm getting married in a couple of weeks and that makes this all the more special - but my fiance knows she has to share me with Explosion."" Women's combined qualification It's disaster for Shauna Coxsey! She falls off the wall as she enters the green section and it won't be enough for a place in the final. The 28-year-old is set to retire after these Games, so that will be the last time we see her on this stage. Women's combined qualification And she's off. Britain's Shauna Coxsey has just began her attempt to climb to the top of the wall in six minutes. She will be scored on how far she is able to climb. The placement of each limb has to be so accurate... Canada's Andre de Grasse after winning 200m gold: ""I've been through so much these last five years on and off the track. In 2016 I was a kid and inexperienced but now I have so many expectations to come away with medals and I wanted to show the world all my injuries are behind me and I can bring home a gold medal."" Women's combined qualification Ed LeighCommentator on BBC TV Lead is a little bit like driving an electric car and having route-anxiety. It's all about conserving the power! Women's combined qualification Shauna Coxsey was 16th after the speed discipline, but a solid fourth-place finish on the boulders moved her up to eighth overall in the leaderboard. The top eight athletes qualify for the final, so she's quite literally, hanging on by her fingernails. All eyes on the lead for the last discipline... Thanks Katie! The sun set a little while ago in Tokyo, but the action is still very much alive. Our main focus is going to be on Britain's Shauna Coxsey, and her pursuit of a place in the final of the women's combined climbing event. Right, it's lunch time for me. I'm going to leave you in the very safe hands of Mantej Mann. I think he has some climbing on the agenda for you. Enjoy! Men's 800m A little earlier on, Emmanuel Korir of Kenya won 800m gold.
