"Radiologists say they are ""very concerned"" patients may not be cured of serious illnesses when demand for services increases, due to a lack of imaging equipment in the UK. The president of the Royal College of Radiologists has warned the service had been ""woefully underfunded"". She said cleaning requirements because of coronavirus would reduce capacity. The Department of Health and Social Care in England said it was investing Â£200m on imaging equipment. ""Radiology is one of those services that people use all the time, but don't really often think about, it's not sexy like surgery"", said Dr Jeanette Dickson, president of the Royal College of Radiologists. ""Imaging touches on virtually every patient who comes into a hospital. ""If you look at us on a European-wide average, we are certainly one of the countries that have the fewest number of scanners a head of the population."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? A comparison by the OECD, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in 2014 - the last set of comparable figures - showed there were just 9.5 scanners per million head of the population, far below figures for Spain, Germany, France and Italy. The BBC has been told some trusts just had a single CT scanner in operation in the UK. Dr Dickson said normal service before the outbreak was ""woefully underfunded and under-resourced"" and that they were ""coping but barely"". She said the whole of imaging was very much understaffed prior to the Covid-19 crisis. The latest figures form the Royal College of Radiologists show 11% of funded posts for radiologists across the UK were vacant. In April, Cancer Research said a drop-off in screening and referrals meantroughly 2,700 fewer people were being diagnosed every week. Sara Hiom, Cancer Research UK's director of early diagnosis said CT scanners for diagnosing cancer ""were already at breaking point before the pandemic"". The BBC understands that more than 30 CT scanners have been obtained from the independent sector during the coronavirus crisis, with at least 35 more ordered. ""Capacity will be much, much less than demand"" even with the equipment that has been ordered, Dr Dickson said. She warned even when all imaging resumes, and the NHS gets back to operating fully, it would take ""at least  30-45 minutes"" to deep clean scanners after Covid-19 patients and ""more attention"" was being paid to cleaning equipment between all patients. Patients have to socially distance in the waiting room. ""I am very concerned that we may find that patients are suffering unnecessary treatments or unnecessarily damaging treatments and losing the opportunity for a cure of cancer or another serious illness, because of the lack of imaging,"" Dr Dickson said. Sara Hiom added: ""The government needs to invest in the necessary equipment, employing and training more staff to enable the NHS to cope with the backlog of patients waiting for cancer care. ""Prompt diagnosis and treatment remain crucial to give patients the greatest chances of survival."" The Department of Health and Social Care in England said in a statement it is ""committed to increasing our capacity for earlier cancer diagnosis and have provided Â£200m for new state of the art diagnostic machines to improve the quality and speed of diagnosis and replace any outdated machines"". It added that cancer services would be ""among the first of many NHS services to be returning to normal"" during the coronavirus outbreak. A spokesperson for NHS England said: ""Increased cleaning of CT scanners and additional infection control measures are in place throughout the pandemic to protect staff and patients. ""The NHS is making full use of the additional scanning capacity in the independent sector as well as buying additional scanners so that tests can go ahead as normal."" The Welsh government said it was ""increasing diagnostic capacity in radiology, including a new National Imaging Academy, and doubling the radiology training programme"". Meanwhile, the Scottish government said it expected all health boards to ""continue to prioritise radiology capacity for those patients referred with an urgent suspicion of cancer throughout and beyond the Covid-19 outbreak"". ""The majority of cancer radiology diagnostics and treatments have continued, however some patient's treatment plans will change to minimise their individual risk,"" it added.

"Dortmund players observed social distancing protocol as they celebrated Haaland's goal Erling Braut Haaland scored for Borussia Dortmund as they marked the return of the Bundesliga during the coronavirus outbreak with a convincing derby win over Schalke. The game will mostly be remembered for the surreal circumstances in which it was played, as Germany became the first major league in Europe to resume action behind closed doors. There was an eerie atmosphere at Dortmund's iconic Signal Iduna Park stadium, with every shout by players or coaches audible, and social distancing protocol followed by substitutes and during goal celebrations. Haaland opened the scoring with a trademark cool finish, flicking home Thorgen Hazard's cross to continue his sensational season, albeit after an enforced break of almost 10 weeks. Raphael Guerreiro added two more goals and Hazard also found the net as Dortmund went on to claim a comfortable win over their near neighbours and move within a point of leaders Bayern Munich, who play on Sunday. Relive Germany's return to football as Dortmund hit four The Schalke substitutes were all separated by two metres Elite-level football might be back in Europe, but it certainly has a different feel about it than it did two months ago. Strict hygiene protocols saw the Dortmund and Schalke players arrive on multiple buses, use several changing rooms and then enter the pitch by different routes. Warm-ups were staggered and the coaching staff and substitutes wore masks and were all separated by two metres as they took their place on the sidelines. Once the balls had been disinfected by the ball-boys, the game began in total silence, only pierced by the referee's whistle for kick-off, before being played out to the sound of echoed applause or yelled instructions from the dug-outs. Fans were completely absent from the 80,000-capacity stadium but that did not stop the Dortmund players performing their trademark salute to the empty stands at the final whistle - standing apart rather than holding hands of course. Dortmund's players applauded their absent fans at the final whistle The backdrop to the game made for a strange spectacle, but it did nothing to disrupt Haaland's fine form even if it was 70 days on from his last Bundesliga appearance. With the rest of Europe watching on, Dortmund's 19-year-old Norwegian wonderkid reminded everyone of his precocious talent as he scored one goal, and helped make another. Haaland's goal means he now has a total of 37 in club competition for the season - before joining Dortmund he scored 14 goals in Austra's top division for Red Bull Salzburg, and eight more in the Champions League Haaland now has hit 10 goals in his first nine Bundesliga appearances - and 13 in 12  games in all competitions - since his January move from Red Bull Salzburg and his prolific scoring rate shows no sign of slowing up. Another of Dortmund's highly-rated young talents, England forward Jadon Sancho, was restricted to an 11-minute cameo off the bench, because of a calf injury. On-loan Everton full-back Jonjoe Kenny started for Schalke, who brought on Wales winger Rabbi Matondo as one of their five substitutes - two more than usual are permitted under the new regulations for the Bundesliga's restart. There were 30 match balls placed around the stadium, each of them disinfected by ball-boys who placed them on special spots rather than giving them directly to the players The South Stand at Signal Iduna Park holds 25,000 fans and is the biggest free-standing grandstand in Europe. It is famed for its 'Yellow Wall' of Dortmund supporters, but was completely empty on Saturday Some journalists were permitted to attend, but counting players, staff and officials, there were only about 300 people in and around the stadium Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Everton need stability' - how chaotic day unfolded Lakers and Kings postpone games amid Los Angeles wildfires Ryan Giggs - what happened?

"Sir James Dyson has topped the Sunday Times Rich List for the first time Inventor Sir James Dyson has topped theSunday Times Rich List,externalfor the first time after increasing his net worth by Â£3.6bn in a year. The Brexit-backing entrepreneur made his fortune with the invention of the bag-less vacuum cleaner which went on sale in 1993. He replaced Indian-born businessmen Sri and Gopi Hinduja at the summit. The coronavirus pandemic is being blamed for a fall in the overall wealth of the UK's richest people. A self-made man, Sir James, 72, grew up in Norfolk in the 1950s and studied art before his art college principal suggested he go into design. After inventing a wheelbarrow in 1974 which used a spherical wheel - designed to be easier to manoeuvre - he then set about creating the product for which he is best known after seeing an industrial extractor and imagining how it could be downsized for home use. It was more than 10 years before it made it to the market, and at one stage Sir James owed his bank nearly Â£1m. But it was a success and soon became Britain's best-selling vacuum cleaner, making its inventor very wealthy. More recently he backed Brexit,arguing that the UK would be better off outside the European Union, andhas relocated his business headquarters to Singapore, having previously moved production from Wiltshire to Malaysia. Most Dyson products are designed in the UK but manufactured in Asia. In Marchthe government ordered 10,000 ventilators from the companyto help with the coronavirus crisis, although Sir James latertold employees these were no longer needed. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Sir James told the paper his recent bid to build an electric car had been scrapped despite costing Â£500m of his own money. ""Ours is a life of risk and of failure,"" he said. ""We try things and they fail. Life isn't easy."" How is the Sunday Times Rich List compiled? The list is based on estimates of the minimum wealth of the 1,000 richest people or families in the UK. The valuations for this year's list were carried out up to the end of April to take into account the early impact of the coronavirus pandemic, with valuations adjusted where there have been significant movements in the value of listed companies. Identifiable wealth and significant shares in publicly quoted companies are included but bank accounts and small shareholdings in a private equity portfolio are excluded. The Sunday Times team is cautious about liabilities and any owners or large shareholders of companies which have been involved in talks with banks over debt levels have been removed from the list. The list includes people who are not British citizens but live and work in Britain. Family shareholdings are grouped together where it is obvious the family acts together to defend the company's interests. The full methodology can be foundhere,external. The wealth of the top 1,000 richest people in Britain fell for the first time since the financial crash, down by 3.7% overall. The Hinduja brothers, who are co-chairmen of the India-based conglomerate the Hinduja Group, saw their wealth drop by Â£6bn in a year while Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who topped the Rich List in 2018, saw his net worth drop the same amount. Sir Jim Ratcliffe topped the list in 2018 but came in fifth this year List compiler Robert Watts said: ""Ever since the financial crisis of 2008-9, Britain's wealthiest people have become richer and richer. ""Covid-19 has called time on their golden period. This year's rich list paints a picture of Britain on the brink of calamity - two months after lockdown and already billions of pounds have been wiped out. ""You may not like the super-rich, but it is hard to deny that our economy will need the jobs they create and the taxes they and their companies pay if we are to escape a prolonged recession that causes further misery to millions."" The list also noted a number of billionaires have sought to use the government's emergency furlough scheme, under which staff are paid 80% of their salary by the state, up to Â£2,500 a month. The wealthiest woman on the list is Kirsten Rausing, who owns a third of the holding company which has the rights to Tetra Pak cartons. Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken, the daughter of brewing magnate Freddy Heineken, also makes it into the top 10. Actress Salma Hayek and her husband, French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, are also on the list. The Queen comes in at 372 with an estimated worth of Â£350m. The highest placed new entry is fashion mogul Anders Povlsen, who is Scotland's largest landowner and owns stakes in online retailer Asos and Danish clothing firm Bestseller. Sir Paul McCartney is the highest-placed musician with Â£800m, while singer Rihanna is a new entry with an estimated Â£468m. Sir Elton John, Sir Mick Jagger and Keith Richards make up the rest of the musical top five, with Sir Ringo Starr missing out by Â£10m. The Duke of Westminster, whose fortune derives from his family's property empire, continues to top the list of the 50 richest people under 30. Lady Charlotte Wellesley comes in second. She is married to Alejandro Santo Domingo who made his fortune in brewing. Jack Sullivan, son of West Ham co-owner David, comes in third, while musician Ed Sheeran comes in fifth off the back of his record 255-concert tour completed last year. Anthony Joshua regained his world titles in a lucrative bout Boxer Anthony Joshua moved into the top 10 having regained his world titles in December while Lewis Hamilton is placed at 545th with a net-worth of Â£224m, making him the richest active sportsman. Former England football captain David Beckham, along with his wife Victoria, was the highest placed sportsperson at 354th - although several Premier League owners came in much higher. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns cycling's Team Ineos as well as French football club OGC Nice, topped the sports club-owners list. Ex-Arsenal shareholder Alisher Uzmanov and Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich were also in the top three. The Sunday Times Rich List Top 10 Sir James Dyson and family, household goods and technology, Â£16.2bn. Sri and Gopi Hinduja and family, industry and finance, Â£16bn. David and Simon Reuben, property and internet, Â£16bn. Sir Leonard Blavatnik, investment, music and media, Â£15.78bn. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Ineos chemical giant, Â£12.15bn. Kirsten and Jorn Rausing, inheritance and investment, Â£12.1bn. Alisher Usmanov, mining and investment, Â£11.68bn. Guy, George and Galen Jr Weston and family, retail, Â£10.53bn.

BBC One has begun broadcasting a series of programmes celebrating Eurovison, on the night this year's song contest was due to take place. The 2020 event wascancelled in Marchamid the coronavirus pandemic. Graham Norton and Rylan Clark-Neal are instead hosting programmes which celebrate Eurovision's 64-year history. Right now, the Irishman is looking back at some of the best-ever songs, including a winning effort from a famous foursome (no, not them yet). Bucks Fizz won it for the UK in 1981 with Making Your Mind Up, and some pretty high-waisted outfits to boot. See if you can name the other four UK winners, before they appear on the telly. Later the BBC will join with other European broadcasters to honour all the 41 songs which would have competed this year. Read more Testing will be extended to all care home residents and staff in Wales Coronavirus testing will be extended to all care home residents and staff in Wales,the Welsh government has announced. The Welsh government had faced criticism for not testing everyone in care homes. Initially, it had opted only to test individuals with symptoms, and then increased testing to larger homes with no signs of the virus on 6 May. Testing in care homes in Wales had been more restrictive than in England, where all residents and staff have been eligible for testing regardless of symptoms sincethe end of April. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Some schools are expected to reopen on 1 June Will some children returning to school in England lead to an increase in infections? This is being debated by
politicians, teachers and unions. Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, said seven different ""return to school"" scenarios had been modelled by the
government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). She said the government had
adopted the one scientists estimate will give the smallest increase in the ""R"" number - the measure of how fast the disease is spreading. In England, Reception, Year 1
and Year 6 children will return to school from 1 June. In the rest of the UK,
there are currently no plans to return any more children to school. Some of the reasons given for
picking these age groups were to do with preventing spread of disease, for
example because older children are more likely to have higher numbers of
contacts outside school so pose a greater transmission risk. Some were about balancing up
children's needs, including the fact that younger age groups may find
self-directed learning more challenging. Dr Harries also said daily
testing had reached its highest level yet, with 136,486 tests provided
yesterday. Earlier we told you that Piers Corbyn, brother of the former Labour leader, was among the people arrested during a protest against the coronavirus lockdown. Dozens of people defied social distancing to gather at Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park. The protesters said they objected to their rights of free speech
and movement being curtailed by the regulations introduced to control
coronavirus. One group chanted ""no 5G"" and ""no vaccines"". There is no evidence to link 5G and Covid-19. A flyer advertising the protest called for ""no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal, and no to the unlawful lockdown"". David Samson, 50, told the PA news agency: ""I never thought I'd see, in my generation, the suppressing of civil rights"" over a ""fake virus"". Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said it was ""disappointing"" that the group gathered ""in clear breach of the guidance, putting themselves and others at risk of infection"". He said officers urged the group to disperse but ""they clearly had no intention of doing so"", leading to 19 arrests. A further 10 were issued with a fixed-penalty notice. The protest was one of a number around the UK, including Southampton and Belfast. The Canadian government has approved the first clinical trials in the country of a potential vaccine for the virus, according to Prime Minister Trudeau Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government has approved the first clinical trials in the country of a potential vaccine for corornavirus. He told reporters the trials would be held at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University, in Nova Scotia. Trudeau did not reveal who was developing the vaccine, but said that if trials were successful, the National Research Council of Canada would assist production and distribution. Canada has reported over 75,000 cases of coronavirus, along with 5,595 virus-related deaths. Horse racing tracks in New York state can reopen without fans from 1 June, Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced. New York Racing Association's Belmont Park and Saratoga have been listed among racetracks that can run with empty stands, similar to other circuits around the country. ""There'll be guidelines for the actual participants - no crowd, no fans,"" said Cuomo. ""For the industry itself, for the televised viewers, that can still work."" The state reported 157 new deaths on Saturday. In England, Newcastle racecourse will host the first fixture under plans for horse racing's returnbehind closed doors next month.If a return to action is approved by the government, the first meeting would also be held on 1 June. Aparna AlluriBBC News, Delhi The Koyambedu market is one of the largest in Asia India is nearing two months of a countrywide lockdown and is grappling with 50,000 active coronavirus cases. But in all that time, grocery stores and food markets have been allowed to stay open, classed as essential services. The centre of India's biggest cluster is now focused on Koyambedu, a vegetable market in Chennai with a far-reaching trail that's as tangled as the country's food supply chain. Unsurprisingly, it has sparked a public row over who is to blame. But it has also revealed the challenge of regulating India's bustling, crowded food markets, where space is a luxury and social distancing a fantasy. Spread over 65 acres in the heart of Chennai, the Koyambedu market is one of the largest in Asia. Wholesale and retail shops selling grains, fruits, vegetables and flowers draw tens of thousands of buyers every day. Add to that the shop owners, truck drivers and daily-wage labourers and it amounts to around 100,000 people, on average. Reality Check Education Secretary Gavin
Williamson said there were 136,486 tests for
coronavirus in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Saturday - that's the highest daily total so far. The government set a target of
100,000 tests per day by the end of April. It announced on 1 May that it had
exceeded the target by some way but there was controversy as the total included
40,000 ""delivery"" tests sent out but not yet returned or processed. It has failed to hit its target
10 times in May, but the past three days have seen figures well over
100,000. And the figure for people tested
- as opposed to the number of tests done - has risen to 78,537. That's the
highest it has been so far. But one category of tests has
started to be done in much greater numbers. These ""pillar 4"" tests are done as
part of survey work to research the spread of the virus, rather than of people
who are worried they might have the virus. Just over 30,000 of this category
of test was reported for Friday, massively up from the 6,000 reported for 12
May. UK officials are encouraging social distancing to help protect the public. They also say people should self-isolate at home for at least seven days if they develop a fever of above 37.8C or a persistent cough. Under the new rules, if you live with others, everyone should stay at home for at least 14 days. People self-isolating should limit contact with family members or flatmates as much as possible: staying at least two metres (six feet) away at all times and sleeping alone. Cleaning surfaces, eating separately and regular hand washing will also help protect others you live with. You should also avoid sharing towels, toiletries or other household items with someone in isolation and, where possible, avoid sharing a bathroom at all. We have more on self-isolationas well asspecific advice if you live with others,including your family. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Gavin Williamson went out of his way to stress the benefits of going back to school on 1 June but mindful of the fact they need to get teachers on board if that is to work. He stressed the benefits of letting children mix with their peers, particularly the benefits on their mental health. The education secretary said they had been listening to the unions, which oppose the measure, adding that the longer schools were closed, the more children would miss out. He didn't want to say anything confrontational, and it doesn't seem the row has escalated. But there was no shift in the government's position. There are mixed messages from government, governors and unions - so teachers and parents will be wondering who to listen to. Watford manager Nigel Pearson has warned against the Premier League returning too soon. On the day that the German football season reopened for business, Pearson told the Times that players' lives could
be in danger if matches were restarted too quickly during the coronavirus pandemic . ""God forbid we have a fatality,"" he told the Times. ""People are closing their eyes to the threat."" People in England have been urged to stay local and avoid travelling to beauty spots this weekend,despite the easing of lockdown rules. This is the first weekend since the rules were relaxed in England, allowing people to spend as much time outside as they want ""for leisure purposes"". Many took the opportunity to head outdoors as the sun came out in parts of the country. Sunbathers relaxed on the beach in Brighton However, South Bay sea front in Scarborough was quiet, with attractions remaining closed An ice cream van served walkers at The Roaches in the Peak District People in Barbican, east London enjoyed a game of tennis, after restrictions on outdoor sports were eased Gavin Williamson says the best way of giving kids the best life opportunities is to return them to school.

Today's government briefing has come to an end, with an emphasis from Education Secretary Gavin Williamson that the government remains committed to a phased reopening of schools in early June - providing the five tests are met and transmission rates remain low. It means many pupils will remain at home until September, with only a limited return for certain school years being considered. Nonetheless, Mr Williamson said there are currently no plans to start the new school year in early August. He said: ""We are looking at different initiatives that we could maybe look at rolling out during the summer period"", but added he would not divulge more information on those initiatives yet, as there was ""a little bit more work to do on them"".

Mr Williamson said he knew some parents were ""very anxious"" about reopening schools, but said it would be a ""cautious, phased return"". It follows a row over the government's plan to begin a phased reopening of schools in England from 1 June. Teachers' unions have said the date is too soon to be safe. Speaking at the government's daily Downing Street briefing on Saturday, Mr Williamson said: ""There are some who would like to delay the wider opening of schools but there is a consequence to this. ""The longer that schools are closed the more children miss out. Teachers know this. Teachers know that there are children out there that have not spoken or played with another child of their own age for two months. ""They know there are children from difficult or very unhappy homes for whom school is the happiest moment in their week and it's also the safest place for them to be."" England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to reopen. Schools in Waleswill not reopen on 1 June,whilethose in ScotlandandNorthern Irelandmay not restart before the summer holidays. Meanwhile, the number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK has increased by 468,the government said on Saturday.,externalIt takes the total number of UK deaths, in all settings following a positive coronavirus test, to 34,466. Do I have to send my children back to school? How England is following Denmark's school safety model How much do children spread it? Schools in England closed for most pupils on 20 March, staying open only for the children of key workers and vulnerable children. The phased reopening will begin with children in nursery and pre-school, Reception and Years 1 and 6 returning to primary school first on 1 June. At secondary school and college, Years 10 and 12 would return first. Butteaching unions have saidplans to reopen primary schools do not have adequate safety measures and need to be halted. Some councils have said their schools will not open. Education is ""one of the most important and precious gifts"" for a child, Mr Williamson said Mr Williamson said the government's approach was based on the ""best scientific advice with children at the very heart of everything we do"" - and the impact of it would be carefully monitored. ""We have been quite clear all along that we'd only start inviting more children when ourfive key testshave been met,"" he said. ""That position has not changed nor will it."" The education secretary also said students in Years 10 and 12 who were studying for their GCSEs and A-levels ""stand to lose more by staying away from school"". But there were no plans to bring forward the start of the next school year to August, he said - although he was looking at ""different initiatives"" which could be rolled out during the summer. This video can not be played Teenagers in limbo as coronavirus halts exams Reassuring people what safety measures were being taken, Mr Williamson said school staff could already be tested for the virus and, from 1 June, children and their families would also be able to get tests if they developed symptoms. Pupils will also be kept in groups of no more than 15 and there will be regular cleaning, Mr Williamson added. ""Together these measures will create an inherently safer system where the risk of transmission is substantially reduced for children, their teachers and also their families,"" he said. There were 136,486 tests in the UK on Friday - the highest daily figure so far in the UK. Boris Johnson has set a target of 200,000 tests a day by the end of May. Dr Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, told the briefing that evidence suggests children ""probably have [the] same level of infections"" but do not get as ill with the virus. Parents and teachers ""should not be thinking that every school is swarming with cases,"" she said. By BBC health reporter Rachel Schraer Will some children in England returning to school lead to an increase in infections? This is being debated by politicians, teachers and unions. Dr Jenny Harries said that seven different ""return to school"" scenarios had been modelled by the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). She said the government had adopted one scientists estimate will give the smallest increase inthe R number- the measure of how fast the disease the is spreading. In England, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children will return to school from 1 June. Some of the reasons given for picking these age groups were to do with preventing spread of disease, for example because older children are more likely to have higher numbers of contacts outside school so pose a greater transmission risk. Some were about balancing up children's needs, including the fact that younger age groups may find self-directed learning more challenging. Some councils - such as Liverpool and Hartlepool - have said their schools will not reopen at the start of next month. Asked what school governors should do if the council's stance differs from the government's, Mr Williamson said: ""What we would ask them to do is look at the guidance very, very carefully. ""The best way of protecting children, the best way of giving them the best opportunities in life is actually to have them coming back into school - and this is a very small, tentative step in what I believe is the right direction if we pass those five tests."" Thegovernment's guidance,externalsays schools should: Reduce class sizes and keep children in small groups of 15 and under without mixing with others Stagger break and lunch times, and school arrival and departure times Clean more frequently, and reduce the use of shared items and outdoor space Mr Williamson said he was ""always keen to listen and talk to"" union leaders - who met the government's scientific advisers on Friday - saying: ""My door is always open."" Patrick Roach, the head the NASUWT teachers' union, welcomed Mr Williamson's promise to talk, adding that schools wanted ""clear and unequivocal guidance on the health and safety measures they will need to have in place prior to reopening"". ""The bottom line is that no teacher or child should be expected to go into schools until it can be demonstrated that it is safe for them to do so,"" Mr Roach added. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? On Saturday,the children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, saidthe government and unions should ""stop squabbling and agree a plan"" to reopen schools safely ""as quickly as possible"". She said many disadvantaged children were losing out because of schools being closed for so long. Some parents and teachers have said they are worried about the emotional distress returning to the classroom could have on staff and pupils - and questioned how they will follow social distancing rules.

"The coronavirus pandemic has changed how we live. What was ordinary just a couple of months ago seems almost unrecognisable. We asked you for the last ""normal"" photo you had on your phone, and hundreds of you replied. Here are 13 pictures from before we had to come to terms with lockdowns and social distancing. You can tag your own photos online using the hashtag #lastnormalphoto We spent two years planning our wedding in Austria. I drove out through France and Germany in a campervan, with the world closing down around me, not knowing if we could go ahead with it. On the Friday night as our guests arrived, Austria announced they would be shutting down from Sunday. On Saturday 14 March we married, and on the Sunday we were escorted from the resort back to the airport. We had two or three guests who didn't make it to the wedding, but it was an absolutely amazing day. Looking at the pictures now is totally mind-boggling. Two of my mates were taking the campervan back. They got as far as Germany, and then Germany locked the borders. They left it there and flew home. So the campervan with the wedding cake inside is still in a Munich car park. This was the last photo I took of my boyfriend before we went into lockdown separately. We both live with our parents so we aren't together and I haven't seen him in weeks. It was the Saturday before the lockdown was announced. We knew what was about to happen so we had a few drinks and played air hockey together at his house in Hampshire before we parted ways. We have a tradition of playing air hockey all the time - it's what we do on our Saturday nights. I genuinely didn't anticipate having to be away from him for so long. I've never spent more than a few days without him so this is very hard, but we know it's for ours and everyone else's safety. We send a picture of ourselves to each other every day as a little reminder, so we don't forget what each other looks like. I can't wait to see him again. It was Friday 13 March at Cheltenham Festival. On the Thursday night I got a text from a friend saying he had a handful of spare hospitality tickets for the races after clients dropped out because of Covid-19. With no work the next day I jumped at the chance. It was a lovely day. I took this snap because it looked nice with the sun and things. I wasn't really thinking about coronavirus at the time, but looking back it's an awful lot of people. I wasn't especially concerned about coronavirus then. There were quite a lot of hand sanitiser dispensers, and we were doing the no handshake thing with everyone we met, but back then it felt like a bit of a novelty. I left slightly in profit and very drunk on a nearly empty train with more staff than customers (apparently also coronavirus related). I do wonder how many cases can be traced back to Cheltenham. I walk my kids to and from school every day and it's something I enjoy, a time to chat about their days and mine. I took this photo on 20 March, the last day of school before it closed because of coronavirus. I was with my daughter, my son and my daughter's friend. I'd just left the playground where I said goodbye to my school mum friends, not knowing when we'd see each other again. On the way home, I was asking the kids how they felt about schools closing. They were really happy - it was like breaking up for the summer holidays. I was sad. Since this photo, the novelty has worn off a bit for the kids. Mummy school isn't as good as normal school - I'm not Ofsted rated. I cannot wait until I walk them to school again. It was a friend's 50th birthday celebration in Ascot on Saturday 14 March. It was a fantastic evening celebrating with special friends. We had an Amy Winehouse impersonator and we danced until the early hours. What is so weird is we were all discussing coronavirus throughout the night, but partying still without a care in the world. At that time, nobody really knew anyone who'd had it and we hadn't heard of anything in the area. About five to seven days later, 17 of us from the party became bed-ridden and severely poorly with all the classic Covid-19 symptoms. All 17 of us fell ill within days of each other and have taken six weeks to get back to good health. Not one of us knew that we had been in contact with anyone with symptoms prior to the party. None of us has had a test to prove we had it. I wanted to visit my dad on that day in particular because I knew it was the last day I was going to be allowed to before his care home locked down to outside visitors. It was Sunday 22 March. I wanted to be sure to visit him because he's 93, he's got dementia and he can't actually walk anymore -  I knew that if he got ill with Covid-19, the chances are he'd probably succumb. We had a nice talk and I made sure to take some photos of him so that if worst comes to worst I'd have a nice memory of visiting him. We talked about coronavirus and my little grandchild who my dad absolutely loves. I normally tell him if I've seen any interesting birds, because he's a bird watcher and I am too. He's still fine, so far. We were celebrating my wife's birthday at home on 8 March, back when we were allowed to be surrounded by family. I guess it was at a time when we were taking things for granted. We were doing what we'd normally do on someone's birthday. I don't remember talking about coronavirus. We were talking about what we'd done that weekend and a family wedding planned for later this year. Some of us watched the Rugby Six Nations game when Scotland beat France - the last game before the tournament got postponed. One of the last birthday cards my wife received was from her aunt Barbara who, with no underlying health conditions, suddenly passed away from Covid-19 in April. The next birthday celebrations we have as a family will now be appreciated even more. We flew home from Disney World in Florida on 8 March - my son's birthday. Here he is heading to the cockpit to meet the pilot. It was an amazing family holiday. We were following the news quite closely whilst we were away, but it was all so uncertain. It felt like we were truly in a Disney bubble. On the flight back my husband was ill (with hindsight probably Covid-19) and as an NHS manager, I was about to head home to a whole new world of household isolation, working from home, preschool education and plate spinning. This photo feels like it was taken in another lifetime. We had just rented a perfect property in Voe, Shetland, where we were going to move. This was the last photo taken of our first visit to the house and the start of moving in. We left in the happy anticipation of this being our new home before long. Our next visit (less than two weeks later) was to remove our things and hand back the keys. A dream, which was so close you could feel it, stopped by Covid-19. This is a photograph taken at Anfield before the kick off of the Champions League tie between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid on 11 March. My friend and I travelled down from Edinburgh to go to the game. At that point in March, the virus was already a real issue but nowhere near as advanced, and at that point we couldn't have envisioned the devastation it would go on to cause. We discussed it on the train down with no real seriousness. After the game we went to a local pub where Liverpool fans and Atletico fans mixed and discussed the game with respect and with humour, allowing for the language barrier. Again, no-one considered the possibility of an issue with the virus. Being well fortified with beer I gave my scarf to an Atletico supporter from Madrid. He was very grateful. I can't remember his name. I hope he still has it and with all that has happened in Madrid, I hope he is well. My nan Mavis and I went on our usual trip to the supermarket for a coffee and a catch-up on 10 March. Little did either of us know it would be the last time she would leave her house for months and that she was soon to become an expert at FaceTime. We were talking a lot about my plans for the rest of the year. I don't remember speaking much about coronavirus. I was meant to be going on holiday to a yoga retreat so I was looking for bits to wear. That's what the day was about. She lives on her own. Knowing she is alone during all of this has been the hardest thing for me but she is famous for her never-ending optimism. She recently got stuck on her chairlift and had to have three firemen come and sort her out. I think she was quite grateful for a bit of a chat with them and an interlude to her isolation. I can't wait to race her wheelchair into the supermarket again - she always loves that. This photo was taken on 14 March at a restaurant in Norfolk, where I went out for dinner for a friend's 21st birthday. I'd also secured a post-grad job a couple of days beforehand so I was keen to celebrate. My university, UEA, had announced that on-campus teaching was being cancelled so I spent the weekend preparing to travel back to my family home and was conscious that this dinner was likely to be my last social event for a long time, which it was. It's the last time I wore makeup and the last time I got dressed up. It's also the last time I saw that friend before we both graduate or finish our degrees, because we don't know when we'll have an official graduation. I'm glad to have enjoyed that occasion just before spending weeks inside. It was 8 March, I'd only moved to California a couple of months earlier. I was heading to the gym and the LA Marathon was being run near me in Santa Monica. I took the photo to send to my mum to show her that I was adjusting to life well here. I didn't know it would be the last time I'd see crowds out in public spaces. The virus seemed like one of those things that happens to ""other people"". Then I lost my job in independent film production when foreign investment from China fell through. I took to dog walking, but got furloughed when the shut-down dried up demand. I'm now headed home to Hawaii - I'll have to quarantine in place for two weeks when I get there.

Right now, the Irishman is looking back at some of the best-ever songs, including a winning effort from a famous foursome (no, not them yet). Bucks Fizz won it for the UK in 1981 with Making Your Mind Up, and some pretty high-waisted outfits to boot. See if you can name the other four UK winners, before they appear on the telly. Later the BBC will join with other European broadcasters to honour all the 41 songs which would have competed this year. Read more Testing will be extended to all care home residents and staff in Wales Coronavirus testing will be extended to all care home residents and staff in Wales,the Welsh government has announced. The Welsh government had faced criticism for not testing everyone in care homes. Initially, it had opted only to test individuals with symptoms, and then increased testing to larger homes with no signs of the virus on 6 May. Testing in care homes in Wales had been more restrictive than in England, where all residents and staff have been eligible for testing regardless of symptoms sincethe end of April. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Some schools are expected to reopen on 1 June Will some children returning to school in England lead to an increase in infections? This is being debated by
politicians, teachers and unions. Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, said seven different ""return to school"" scenarios had been modelled by the
government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). She said the government had
adopted the one scientists estimate will give the smallest increase in the ""R"" number - the measure of how fast the disease is spreading. In England, Reception, Year 1
and Year 6 children will return to school from 1 June. In the rest of the UK,
there are currently no plans to return any more children to school. Some of the reasons given for
picking these age groups were to do with preventing spread of disease, for
example because older children are more likely to have higher numbers of
contacts outside school so pose a greater transmission risk. Some were about balancing up
children's needs, including the fact that younger age groups may find
self-directed learning more challenging. Dr Harries also said daily
testing had reached its highest level yet, with 136,486 tests provided
yesterday. Earlier we told you that Piers Corbyn, brother of the former Labour leader, was among the people arrested during a protest against the coronavirus lockdown. Dozens of people defied social distancing to gather at Speakers' Corner in London's Hyde Park. The protesters said they objected to their rights of free speech
and movement being curtailed by the regulations introduced to control
coronavirus. One group chanted ""no 5G"" and ""no vaccines"". There is no evidence to link 5G and Covid-19. A flyer advertising the protest called for ""no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal, and no to the unlawful lockdown"". David Samson, 50, told the PA news agency: ""I never thought I'd see, in my generation, the suppressing of civil rights"" over a ""fake virus"". Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said it was ""disappointing"" that the group gathered ""in clear breach of the guidance, putting themselves and others at risk of infection"". He said officers urged the group to disperse but ""they clearly had no intention of doing so"", leading to 19 arrests. A further 10 were issued with a fixed-penalty notice. The protest was one of a number around the UK, including Southampton and Belfast. The Canadian government has approved the first clinical trials in the country of a potential vaccine for the virus, according to Prime Minister Trudeau Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says his government has approved the first clinical trials in the country of a potential vaccine for corornavirus. He told reporters the trials would be held at the Canadian Centre for Vaccinology at Dalhousie University, in Nova Scotia. Trudeau did not reveal who was developing the vaccine, but said that if trials were successful, the National Research Council of Canada would assist production and distribution. Canada has reported over 75,000 cases of coronavirus, along with 5,595 virus-related deaths. Horse racing tracks in New York state can reopen without fans from 1 June, Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced. New York Racing Association's Belmont Park and Saratoga have been listed among racetracks that can run with empty stands, similar to other circuits around the country. ""There'll be guidelines for the actual participants - no crowd, no fans,"" said Cuomo. ""For the industry itself, for the televised viewers, that can still work."" The state reported 157 new deaths on Saturday. In England, Newcastle racecourse will host the first fixture under plans for horse racing's returnbehind closed doors next month.If a return to action is approved by the government, the first meeting would also be held on 1 June. Aparna AlluriBBC News, Delhi The Koyambedu market is one of the largest in Asia India is nearing two months of a countrywide lockdown and is grappling with 50,000 active coronavirus cases. But in all that time, grocery stores and food markets have been allowed to stay open, classed as essential services. The centre of India's biggest cluster is now focused on Koyambedu, a vegetable market in Chennai with a far-reaching trail that's as tangled as the country's food supply chain. Unsurprisingly, it has sparked a public row over who is to blame. But it has also revealed the challenge of regulating India's bustling, crowded food markets, where space is a luxury and social distancing a fantasy. Spread over 65 acres in the heart of Chennai, the Koyambedu market is one of the largest in Asia. Wholesale and retail shops selling grains, fruits, vegetables and flowers draw tens of thousands of buyers every day. Add to that the shop owners, truck drivers and daily-wage labourers and it amounts to around 100,000 people, on average. Reality Check Education Secretary Gavin
Williamson said there were 136,486 tests for
coronavirus in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST on Saturday - that's the highest daily total so far. The government set a target of
100,000 tests per day by the end of April. It announced on 1 May that it had
exceeded the target by some way but there was controversy as the total included
40,000 ""delivery"" tests sent out but not yet returned or processed. It has failed to hit its target
10 times in May, but the past three days have seen figures well over
100,000. And the figure for people tested
- as opposed to the number of tests done - has risen to 78,537. That's the
highest it has been so far. But one category of tests has
started to be done in much greater numbers. These ""pillar 4"" tests are done as
part of survey work to research the spread of the virus, rather than of people
who are worried they might have the virus. Just over 30,000 of this category
of test was reported for Friday, massively up from the 6,000 reported for 12
May. UK officials are encouraging social distancing to help protect the public. They also say people should self-isolate at home for at least seven days if they develop a fever of above 37.8C or a persistent cough. Under the new rules, if you live with others, everyone should stay at home for at least 14 days. People self-isolating should limit contact with family members or flatmates as much as possible: staying at least two metres (six feet) away at all times and sleeping alone. Cleaning surfaces, eating separately and regular hand washing will also help protect others you live with. You should also avoid sharing towels, toiletries or other household items with someone in isolation and, where possible, avoid sharing a bathroom at all. We have more on self-isolationas well asspecific advice if you live with others,including your family. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Gavin Williamson went out of his way to stress the benefits of going back to school on 1 June but mindful of the fact they need to get teachers on board if that is to work. He stressed the benefits of letting children mix with their peers, particularly the benefits on their mental health. The education secretary said they had been listening to the unions, which oppose the measure, adding that the longer schools were closed, the more children would miss out. He didn't want to say anything confrontational, and it doesn't seem the row has escalated. But there was no shift in the government's position. There are mixed messages from government, governors and unions - so teachers and parents will be wondering who to listen to. Watford manager Nigel Pearson has warned against the Premier League returning too soon. On the day that the German football season reopened for business, Pearson told the Times that players' lives could
be in danger if matches were restarted too quickly during the coronavirus pandemic . ""God forbid we have a fatality,"" he told the Times. ""People are closing their eyes to the threat."" People in England have been urged to stay local and avoid travelling to beauty spots this weekend,despite the easing of lockdown rules. This is the first weekend since the rules were relaxed in England, allowing people to spend as much time outside as they want ""for leisure purposes"".

Today's government briefing has come to an end, with an emphasis from Education Secretary Gavin Williamson that the government remains committed to a phased reopening of schools in early June - providing the five tests are met and transmission rates remain low. It means many pupils will remain at home until September, with only a limited return for certain school years being considered. Nonetheless, Mr Williamson said there are currently no plans to start the new school year in early August. He said: ""We are looking at different initiatives that we could maybe look at rolling out during the summer period"", but added he would not divulge more information on those initiatives yet, as there was ""a little bit more work to do on them"".

"Last month, the town council of Glastonbury in Somerset published a report calling for a government inquiry into the safety of 5G. It promised to oppose the rollout of the next-generation mobile networks in the town. Now, three members of the group that produced the report have told the BBC they resigned because it was taken over by anti-5G activists and ""spiritual healers"". They fear it could lend credibility to conspiracy theories, such as 5G being linked to the spread of coronavirus. ""The whole thing was completely biased from the beginning,"" says Mark Swann, one of those who resigned. ""Genuine scientific expertise has been scorned in favour of conspiracy and hearsay,"" wrote David Swain in his letter of resignation. 5G is the next generation of mobile phone technology. It promises faster downloads and increased capacity. The radio waves involved in 5G  - and the previous generation networks - sit on the low frequency end of the electromagnetic spectrum. Less powerful than visible light, they are not energetic enough to damage cells - unlike radiation at the higher frequency end of the spectrum, which includes the sun's rays and medical x-rays. Get the facts:BBC Reality Check The report, published after a six-month inquiry, saidthe council would oppose the rollout of 5G,external, while accepting it had no power to halt it. Glastonbury's 5G Advisory Committee was made up of nine councillors, and nine local residents who responded to adverts calling for people with relevant experience to help decide whether 5G was safe. Among the volunteers were: Derek Cooper, a retired electronics engineer who had worked in the defence and aerospace industries Carol Roberts, a molecular biologist working in the pharmaceuticals industry Mark Swann, who has a physics degree David Swain, a businessman and Conservative councillor in a neighbouring town All four ended up resigning before the report was completed. ""I joined the working group in good faith, expecting to take part in a sensible discussion about 5G,"" says Mr Swann. ""Sadly the whole thing turned out to be a clueless pantomime driven by conspiracy theorists and sceptics."" Mr Cooper reached the same conclusion: ""I worked out there were only four of us who were neutral. And the others were all absolutely against 5G, either strongly or weakly."" Most of the evidence the committee heard was from witnesses who had stated their support for a moratorium on the rollout of 5G. They included retired American professor Martin Pall, who in 2019 claimed that wireless networks would make all human beings sterile if they were not switched off within two years. Another witness was Dr Andrew Tresidder, a former GP whose website offers flower remedies and emotional healing. His presentation focused on people claiming to suffer from ""electromagnetic stress"", which he said was often not taken seriously by mainstream doctors. Committee member Roy Procter, a spiritual healer who claims dowsing can heal ""sick houses"", also gave a presentation. In the report, he speculates about a link between the coronavirus and 5G, and recommends that the council eliminate all wi-fi connections. The committee's chairman, Councillor Jon Cousins, told the BBC he strongly disagrees with the suggestion that the meetings were biased towards pseudo-science. ""Equal weight was given to all contributions,"" he says, adding that councillors ""were able to take into account the prejudice, predetermination and bias displayed on all sides of the argument"". In the report, Mr Cousins said Glastonbury had punched above its weight, and other councils had been in touch about its recommendations. But both Mr Swann and Mr Cooper were particularly concerned about the role of an external member of the committee. Christopher Baker was instrumental in choosing witnesses to appear before the committee. He also gave his own presentation in which he attacked the credibility of ICNIRP, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, the body which sets the safety standards for mobile network emissions. Mr Baker has campaigned against 5G across the south-west. Before the committee was formed, he had been lobbying Glastonbury councillors to ban the technology. In a Facebook post in May 2019, he outlined his campaigning activities and bemoaned the lack of support from residents. ""The only thing that is missing is the support from the community! I can't do this for you on my own, this is about you and for you,"" he said. But in aYouTube video posted in July,external, he tells another anti-5G activist how he helped convince Glastonbury Town Council to get the investigation underway. He encouraged others to organise local petitions. He has also appeared in videos alongside Mark Steele, another anti-5G conspiracy theorist. Mr Steele claims the coronavirus is a hoax, and has posted videos of himself harassing telecoms engineers. Mr Cooper says the committee was supposed to be made up of people who lived in the area or had a business there. He complained that Christopher Baker did not meet those requirements because he lived in Hampshire, which does not even border Somerset. One contributor asked the council to switch off its wi-fi He resigned after the complaint was ignored, describing Mr Baker as a ""semi-professional anti-5G activist"". He highlighted a video in which Mr Baker admitted some of his fuel costs were paid by a benefactor. Mr Baker told the BBC it was true that he lived in Hampshire, but said he had long-term connections to Glastonbury, and in any case other members of the committee were from outside the town. He admitted that he did receive some funding from a benefactor he refused to name. ""I don't have a lot of money, and if I travel half-way up the country to give a presentation, the least I expect is someone to contribute something towards my fuel bill."" He said those who resigned from the committee were dismissive of the evidence, rude to witnesses such as Prof Pall, and a disruptive force at the meetings. Committee chair Jon Cousins agreed: ""Some of the behaviours displayed by non-councillor members when they could not debate by 'reason' broke Glastonbury Town Council's code of conduct."" This is strongly denied by Mark Swann and his colleagues. The committee did hear evidence from Mobile UK, the mobile operators' trade body. Its presentation was criticised by one member for being ""glossy"", and others alleged there was no attempt to answer questions. Gareth Elliott of Mobile UK denied that: ""We answered everything that was asked of us."" However, he said it was a cordial meeting and his organisation respected the views of the committee. He recounts an incident where one committee member arrived late to a meeting. She said that although she was hyper-sensitive to electromagnetic emissions, she deemed the meeting room to be safe. ""It was then noted that a wi-fi router was operating and was in the room,"" he says. Those who resigned from the committee say they are concerned about the reputation of Glastonbury. Last month, Piers Corbyn - the brother of the former Labour leader - led an anti-lockdown protest in the town, where slogans against 5G were shouted. Piers Corbyn (pictured in 2019) has shared 5G conspiracy theories on Twitter Mr Swann says the atmosphere in the town has been tense lately and he is worried about the impact of the 5G report. ""This fallacious report severely damages Glastonbury's credibility,"" he says. ""It undermines years of good work by well-meaning councillors and leaves a dark shadow over the town's  reputation."" But Councillor Jon Cousins rejects the idea that the report may have served to encourage the conspiracy theorists. ""Glastonbury Town Council's position and resolutions around 5G do not - and have never - suggested a link between 5G and Covid-19 or indeed that coronavirus is a hoax."" He says the council worked closely with Avon and Somerset Police to deal with last month's demonstration and breaches of social distancing legislation.
