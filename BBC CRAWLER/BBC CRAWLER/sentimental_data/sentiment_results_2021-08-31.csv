"An expensive but ""game-changing"" anti-cholesterol drug could soon be offered to hundreds of thousands of people in England and Wales on the NHS. NHS England says inclisiran, given as a twice-a-year injection, could save about 30,000 lives within a decade. It normally costs nearly Â£2,000 per dose but Novartis, which makes it, has agreed an undisclosed discount. It can lower bad fat in the blood when other cheaper drugs, like statins, have not done enough, saysdraft advice,external. The health watchdog NICE is recommending it as an option for people who have already had a stroke or heart attack and are not responding to other cholesterol-lowering treatments. Experts hope it will help to cut their risk of further life-threatening cardiovascular events. Although there is no long-term proof of this yet from studies, they believe it is worth recommending based on existing evidence. It will bring England and Wales in line withguidance for Scotland,external. More than two in five people in England are thought to have high cholesterol and around 6.5 million adults are taking medicines, called statins, to help lower it. Zena Forster has now tried several different kinds of statins to control her high cholesterol Zena Forster, 65, from Newcastle, has had a stroke and a heart attack and been diagnosed with an inherited condition that means her cholesterol levels are always high, despite taking statins. ""I'm on my fourth statin now,"" she told the BBC One's Breakfast programme. ""Heart disease is relentless and there is no cure - and I just aim to slow the progress."" The new drug was ""good news"" for people like herself, Ms Forster said, and offered hope as another treatment option. And taking it twice a year would be no burden compared with remembering to take a daily pill. Cholesterol is a fatty substance - a lipid - found in some foods and also produced in the liver There are different types, but too much ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol can clog the arteries, increasing the risk of heart problems and stroke It's mainly caused by eating fatty food, not exercising enough, being overweight, smoking and drinking alcohol. It can also run in families You might need medication to lower your cholesterol if it has not gone down after changing your diet and lifestyle While statins - which are taken daily - slow down the production of cholesterol in the liver, inclisiran works in a different way. It uses gene-silencing to help the liver remove harmful cholesterol. Listen:The Silence of the Genes It turns off, or silences, a gene called PCSK9, which results in the liver absorbing more ""bad"" LDL cholesterol from the blood and breaking it down. It can be used on its own or alongside statins. Meindert Boysen, NICE deputy chief executive and director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said: ""Inclisiran represents a potential game-changer in preventing thousands of people from dying prematurely from heart attacks and strokes. ""We're therefore pleased to be able to recommend it as a cost effective option on the NHS."" Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of the NHS, said heart disease was still ""one of the major killer conditions"". ""It is fantastic that we now have such an effective and convenient treatment for those living with dangerously high cholesterol levels."" She said the rollout of inclisiran would save lives and benefit hundreds of thousands of people.

"Half of all magnolia species are threatened with extinction in the wild At least 30% of the world's tree species face extinction in the wild, according to a new assessment. They range from well-known oaks and magnolias to tropical timber trees. Experts say 17,500 tree species are at risk - twice the number of threatened mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles combined. Conservation groups are calling for urgent protection efforts amid threats such as deforestation, logging and climate change. ""We have nearly 60,000 tree species on the planet, and for the first time we now know which of these species are in need of conservation action, what are the greatest threats to them and where they are,"" said Dr Malin Rivers of the charity Botanic Gardens Conservation International in Kew, London. Half of Amazon trees 'face extinction' Madagascar palms 'are dying out' Ash tree set for extinction in Europe The Global Tree Assessment, by 500 tree experts and 61 institutions, brings together data on the conservation status of all trees For a healthy world, we need tree species diversity, added Sara Oldfield, co-chair of the Global Tree Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. ""Each tree species has a unique ecological role to play,"" she said. ""With 30% of the world's tree species threatened with extinction, we need to urgently scale-up conservation action."" The report, State of the World's Trees, found that at least 30% of the 60,000 known tree species face extinction. Some 142 species have already vanished from the wild, while 442 are on the very edge of extinction, with fewer than 50 individual trees remaining. The biggest threats to trees globally are forest clearance for crops (impacting 29% of species), logging (27%), clearance for livestock grazing or farming (14%), clearance for development (13%) and fire (13%). One-in-five tree species are used by humans for food, fuel, timber, medicines and more Climate change, extreme weather and sea level rise are growing threats to trees. But the authors say with conservation action, there is hope for the future. ""The report gives us that road map to mobilise the wider conservation community and other key players to ensure that tree conservation is at the forefront of the conservation agenda,"" said Dr Rivers. The experts are calling for a number of actions, including: Preserving existing forests and expanding protected areas (currently at least 64% of all tree species can be found in at least one protected area) Keeping threatened species in botanic gardens or seed banks in the hope they can one day be returned to the wild (currently about 30% of all trees are backed up in this way) Providing education to ensure reforestation and tree planting schemes are carried out scientifically, with the right tree in the right place, including rare and threatened species Increasing funding for tree conservation. Tropical forests are facing threats from climate change and extreme weather Scientists estimate that one million animals and plant species are threatened with extinction. Over the past 300 years, global forest area has decreased by about 40% and 29 countries have lost more than 90% of their forest cover. Research shows that seven main commodities drive more than half of deforestation worldwide. Trees at particular risk of extinction include: Large tropical trees known as dipterocarps that are being lost due to the expansion of palm oil plantations Oak trees lost to farming and development in parts of Mexico, Chile and Argentina Ebony and rosewood trees being felled for timber in Madagascar Magnolia trees at threat from unsustainable plant collecting Trees such as ash that are dying from pests and diseases in the UK and North America Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"People returning to Wales are currently required to use NHS PCR tests at Â£68 each A ban on travellers using private Covid tests when returning from abroad could be scrapped by the Welsh government. Rules say travellers from Wales should use NHS tests, costing Â£68 each, when going abroad or face a Â£1,000 fine. First Minister Mark Drakeford had said in July he had""no plans"" to changeWales' preferred approach of using NHS tests as theWelsh government was advising against foreign travel. But a Welsh government spokesman has said the policy is now being reviewed. The statement followed a BBC Wales investigation that found Welsh travellers had been able to use private PCR tests without facing any repercussions. What are the holiday rules for travel? How do I get my free Covid tests? Watchdog will look at Covid test cost immediately Wales is now the only UK nation requiring those who have been abroad to use NHS PCR tests on day two of their return - and day eight if unvaccinated - at a cost of Â£68 each. The Scottish government announced last Friday that it would follow England and Northern Ireland in allowing travellers to use PCR tests provided by private companies on their return from international travel. Mr Drakeford said in July thatthere were ""good reasons""why the more expensive NHS test is preferable and guarantees variants from abroad can be ""spotted quickly"". ""I don't intend to divert the activities of my officials into making it easier for people to do something that the Welsh government so clearly thinks is unadvisable,"" he said. Conservative MP David TC Davies last week called for Wales' Labour government to change the rules so thattravellers could ""shop around"" for PCR testsoffered by private companies, which can be cheaper, but says that this should not happen by the back door. Mr Davies, a UK government Wales Office minister, said: ""No-one is allowed to break the rules. Although I'm not happy with the situation in Wales, people have to follow Welsh rules."" In July Mark Drakeford said there were ""no plans"" to change the policy Earlier this month, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced areview into the Covid testing system for travellersafter complaints about pricing and performance among some private providers in England. A number of Welsh travellers have told BBC Wales they have used private PCR tests without any issues. The Welsh government has said anyone who arrives in Wales and has booked tests with a private test provider could still face a fine of Â£1,000. The cost of an NHS test is set by the UK government. Ithas been reducedfrom Â£88 for a single test to Â£68, but in England people can choose between private providers and could pay less than Â£50 per test. Anyone over the age of 11 must have proof of a negative coronavirus test before they travel to Wales from overseas,with some exemptions,external. All travellers aged five and over must have a post-arrival testing package booked before they return to Wales. Those travelling to Wales from green-list countries need to take a PCR test on day two after arrival, even if their flight or ferry arrived in England, and do not need to isolate. People who are fully vaccinated and have travelled from an amber country to Wales, also need to take a PCR test on day two of quarantine and do not need to isolate. People travelling from an amber country who are not fully vaccinated will need to take another test on day eight and must isolate for 10 days. If you have visited or passed through a red-list country you will only be able to enter Wales via a designated port of entry in England or Scotland. You will need to take a PCR on days two and eight of isolation and quarantine for 10 days in a managed quarantine hotel. One of the private companies identified by users, Randox, has four drop off points across south Wales where people can return their tests. There have been complaints about some private providers in England One of Randox's boxes is based outside the Vivo Clinic in Cardiff whose web page, before being contacted by BBC Wales, offered customers the option to ""book your day two and day eight PCR tests at our Cardiff clinic"", adding it was a ""government listed PCR test provider in partnership with Randox"". The Vivo Clinic said it is a ""national company offering testing services in a sector where guidance is continually changing. Cost of travellers' PCR tests in Wales criticised People 'snapping up' post-Covid bucket list trips Holiday let firms 'blown away' by surge in demand ""However, the accusation of not following Welsh rules is unfair and unjust,"" said a spokesperson. ""Many of our clients cross the English/Welsh border on a daily basis and for some clients they may be based in England but their nearest clinic is in Wales. ""Due to such a high demand for PCR testing services along the English/Welsh border, we offer all services in Bristol, Cardiff and Swansea to give customers more choice of where to go for their pre/post travel tests.

A Randox drop off box outside the Vivo Clinic in Cardiff ""Nevertheless, at this current stage we have removed day 2/8 testing from our Welsh clinics until we receive further guidance on policy and protocol."" Welsh Conservatives health spokesman Russell George said ""Labour's monopoly system"" on tests had meant ""only the wealthiest in Wales can afford to go away this summer, which isn't right or fair"". ""I'm pleased that the minister will be working with the British government to see what can be learnt and gained from having more than one supplier of PCR tests available, as their job is to make it easier, not harder, for people to enjoy a holiday."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We continue to review the position with regard to private testing in Wales and are working with the UK government to ensure that only those companies who achieve mutually agreed standards are allowed to provide tests.

On Tuesday,the Irish Cabinet agreed on a plan that would effectively end most Covid-19 restrictions by 22 October. The cabinet said the easing of rules is dependent on 90% of adults being vaccinated and Covid-19 cases remaining manageable. Easing of rules in the Republic of Ireland is dependent on 90% of adults being vaccinated Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan previously said he wanted allregulations lifted by the end of September. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has said he ""absolutely"" supports that view. ""Although we have a steady number of cases, we have had a massive reduction in the number of hospitalisations compared to January and February,"" he said. This video can not be played Economy minister calls for plan to end restrictions Mr Givan's DUP colleague said the Stormont executive must now ""set out a path"" for ending Covid-19 restrictions. Hospitality businesses have been calling on ministers to agree to remove restrictions such as social distancing and table service requirements, which they say have damaged trade. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland also remain closed, unlike in the rest of the UK. Ms O'Neill previously said the executive needed to remain ""cautious"", while the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it was ""naÃ¯ve"" to set a date to end restrictions.

The family, from North Tyneside, said it is taking too long to be seen at Newcastle's Freeman hospital. The hospital said the wait had been ""due to the clinics being booked and annual leave issues"". Charlie is non-verbal as a result of an undiagnosed condition she was born with and uses an eye-gazing machine to communicate, but her dad Brian said her head needs to be upright for her to use it. Mr Burridge said he had spent three years battling to get her the correct wheelchair. He described how his daughter was able to keep her head upright at the start of the day but by lunchtime it would fall to the side. ""Her head starts to go off the side of the chair and we lift it up and her head falls back down and we're doing this all day,"" he said. Mr Burridge is worried Charlie's back could be permanently damaged as a result. Her last appointment was on 6 May and their next one is on Thursday, but her father believes 118 days between appointments is too long. ""I just feel like I've always got my begging bowl out. I work full time and when I get home she's still hanging out of her chair, it just feels like I can't do it anymore."" Charlie sitting upright in her wheelchair in 2018 Mr Burridge said while he is critical of the wait to get his daughter a new chair, he was not finding fault with front-line NHS workers. ""[During lockdown] I was standing on the step and clapping. ""I appreciate the NHS so much so I almost feel guilty having a go at the organisation for Charlie hanging out of her chair, because they've done so much. ""But then Charlie can't speak for herself and I'm her dad and if it's not right I've got to say something."" In a statement, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We are sorry this is causing distress and are currently looking into this as a formal complaint. ""While we can't comment on Charlotte's individual circumstances, an appointment has been arranged where we will discuss the concerns the family has raised.""

"The race began in 2015 as a legacy event after the county hosted the Tour de France's Grand DÃ©part in 2014 The Tour de Yorkshire cycle race has been cancelled for a third year in a row, its organisers have announced. The 2020 and 2021 legs of the four-day event, which draws thousands of visitors to the county, were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Welcome to Yorkshire said staging the race in 2022 ""would be unviable"" due to ""escalating financial challenges and uncertainties"". British Cycling's chief said the latest cancellation was ""very disappointing"". Tourism board Welcome to Yorkshire said the decision was made after ""lengthy discussions"" over many months with the race co-organiser Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO). Chief executive James Mason said: ""The race is a much-loved international sports event which showcases Yorkshire across the globe. ""So many people involved in the decision-making process understand just how popular the race is. ""We had every intention for the race to go ahead but unfortunately some of the circumstances were out of our control and sometimes you have to make big calls for the right reasons.""

"Maisy Evans is being treated for Covid-19 at a hospital in south Wales A teenager in hospital with Covid has warned: ""This virus is not a joke for young people."" Maisy Evans, 17, from south Wales, is struggling to speak and breathe as she recovers from the virus. She urged others not to listen to anti-vaxxers, as a top doctor warned young people were being targeted by misinformation on social media. ""This virus is not a joke for young people,"" Maisy wrote on social media. ""Those eligible must get vaccinated."" Why Covid has made it harder for young women to get jobs Middle-aged women 'worst affected by long Covid' Covid has 'devastating' impact on gender equality After sharing her story on Twitter, Maisy has had hundreds of comments, with some suggesting her illness was triggered by the vaccine. However, the student from Newport, said doctors had confirmed a clot on her lung was not related to the one dose of the Pfizer vaccine she has received. ""Reading comments from those who are against the vaccines frustrates me deeply,"" she said. ""I shared my story to encourage my peers to protect themselves."" All 16 and 17-year-olds in Wales to get jab offer Covid: Under 25s drive rise in positive cases New Wales school guidance flabby, says trade union Maisy, who is due to return to sixth form at Ysgol Gyfun Gwynllyw in Pontypool next Monday,, said CT scans had confirmed her illness was triggered by her infection. She has suffered headaches, breathlessness, sickness, achy muscles, dizziness and a loss of taste and smell. Covid had been an ""awful experience"", she said, but added she was recovering slowly at the Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran. She said she had been given antibiotics, steroids, morphine and blood thinners and expected to stay in hospital for a few more days. ""I haven't got any underlying health conditions, so the severe symptoms are unexplained,"" she said. ""I've simply had a bad experience of Covid-19."" BBC Wales spoke to Maisy via text message as she is so short of breath she can barely talk. Her doctor has warned it could take a while for the breathlessness to go. Dr Bnar Talabani, a scientist and doctor specialising in kidney and transplant medicine, has been talking to young people on social media trying to dispel myths about vaccines. This video can not be played The doctor busting Covid vaccine myths on social media The Cardiff-based doctor, who has been trying to encourage young people to get jabbed over TikTok, said there was a lot of misinformation aimed at young people, and stories, like Maisy's showed how important it was to get the vaccine. ""The key is to focus on the science and the evidence, ignore opinion, nobody's opinion matters,"" she said. ""If you have the science and the evidence in front of you, and you base your decision purely on that, then no one would hesitate to get the vaccine."" She urged young people to ""reach out"" to experts on social media . ""I've had lots of conversations with young people who have now had the vaccine, because all they had prior to that was misinformation...once they have access to that accurate information I think it is very reassuring,"" she added. Maisy Evans is urging people to get vaccinated from her hospital bed Maisy said she had her first Pfizer jab on 11 August and, at first, she thought her mild headache and achy arm were symptoms of the vaccine. By 13 August, she was feeling unwell and tested positive within 12 hours of being tested. She was admitted to hospital on 25 August and doctors initially thought she also had meningitis or sepsis. But after blood tests, X-Rays and scans, it was confirmed she had a Covid-related clot on her right lung. ""I've been in hospital since then,"" Maisy said. ""I'm unsure of when I'll be discharged. I guess that depends on my progress."" Maisy's mother, who has had both jabs, tested positive for Covid too but has only suffered mild symptoms. Speaking about the comments she had received about her blood clot being vaccine-related, Maisy said: ""People with no medical qualifications are trying to tell me that the vaccine has caused the blood clot. ""It's upsetting to see that people just aren't willing to accept that Covid itself can cause these complications. ""They just want to scare people away from the vaccine."" Offering jabs to 16 and 17-year-olds dominated the Covid-19 vaccine programme in Wales last week. According to Public Health Wales, 47,538 have received a first dose and 8,347 have had a second jab as well. That means uptake of the first jab stands at 58.4% and 10.3% for the second jab. Walk-in clinics are open throughout Walesso people can receive a dose at their convenience. She said she hoped her story would remind people of the threat Covid-19 still poses. ""My message to others is simple: be careful,"" Maisy said. ""Do not underestimate how much of an impact the virus may have on you. ""I've been awfully unlucky with how it's affected me, and I hate the thought of it affecting others in this way."" She said the care she had received had been ""incredible"". ""The staff at the Grange have gone above and beyond at every opportunity and for that, I'll be forever grateful. ""I'll almost miss the nurses on the ward. I thank them for saving my life.""

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Fighting has been going on for 40 years - most Afghans can't remember a time of peace After 20 years of war, the Taliban has swept to victory in Afghanistan. The group completedtheir shockingly rapid advance across the countryby capturing Kabul on 15 August. It came after foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan following a deal between the US and the Taliban, two decades after US forces removed the militants from power in 2001. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions. Taliban forces have pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West. But questions are already being asked about how the group will govern the country, and what their rule means for women, human rights, and political freedoms. Back in 2001, the US was responding tothe 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed. Officials identified Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, and its leader Osama Bin Laden, as responsible. Bin Laden was in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamists who had been in power since 1996. When they refused to hand him over, the US intervened militarily, quickly removing the Taliban and vowing to support democracy and eliminate the terrorist threat. The Afghan conflict became America's longest war The militants slipped away and later regrouped. Nato allies had joined the US and a new Afghan government took over in 2004 but deadly Taliban attacks continued. President Barack Obama's ""troop surge"" in 2009 helped push back the Taliban but it was not long term. In 2014, at the end of what was the bloodiest year since 2001, Nato's international forces ended their combat mission, leaving responsibility for security to the Afghan army. That gave the Taliban momentum and they seized more territory. Peace talks between the US and the Taliban started tentatively, with the Afghan government pretty much uninvolved, and the agreement on a withdrawal came in February 2020 in Qatar. The US-Taliban deal did not stop the Taliban attacks - they switched their focus instead to Afghan security forces and civilians, and targeted assassinations. Their areas of control grew. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. They emerged in the civil war that followed the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, predominantly in the south-west and the Pakistan border areas. This video can not be played Full interview: Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen speaks to the BBC's Yalda Hakim They vowed to fight corruption and improve security, but also followed an austere form of Islam. By 1998, they had taken control of almost all of the country. What has the conflict cost the US? In numbers: Life in Afghanistan as US leaves Who's who in the Taliban leadership When the BBC visited the Taliban They enforced their own hardline version of Sharia, or Islamic law, and introduced brutal punishments. Men were made to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka. TV, music and cinema were banned. After their overthrow they regrouped in Pakistani border areas. In terms of lives lost, it is obviously not easy to say exactly. The number of coalition casualties is much better recorded than Taliban and Afghan civilians. Research by Brown University estimates losses in the Afghan security forces at 69,000. It puts the number of civilians and militants killed at about 51,000 each. More than 3,500 coalition soldiers have died since 2001 - about two-thirds of them Americans. More than 20,000 US soldiers have been injured. According to the UN, Afghanistan has the third-largest displaced population in the world. Since 2012, some five million people have fled and not been able to return home, either displaced within Afghanistan or taking refuge in neighbouring countries. Brown University research also puts the US spending on the conflict - including military and reconstruction funds in both Afghanistan and Pakistan - at $978bn (Â£706bn) up to 2020. How the Taliban plan to govern Afghanistan remains unclear. Women face an uncertain future. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen says the group will respect the rights of women and minorities ""as per Afghan norms and Islamic values"". The militants had declared an amnesty across Afghanistan and said it wanted women to join its government. But there are fears over women's freedom to work, to dress as they choose, or even to leave home alone under Taliban rule. During the 1990s the Taliban forced women to dress in certain ways and denied them equal rights Another major fear is that the country will once again become a training ground for terrorism. Taliban officials insist that they will fully adhere to the US deal and prevent any group from using Afghan soil as a base for attacks against the US and its allies. They say they aim only to implement an ""Islamic government"" and will not pose a threat to any other country. But many analysts say the Taliban and al-Qaeda are inseparable, with the latter's fighters heavily embedded and engaged in training activity. It is also important to remember that the Taliban are not a centralised and unified force. Some leaders may want to keep the West muted by not stirring up trouble but hardliners may be reluctant to break links with al-Qaeda. Just how powerful al-Qaeda is and whether it could now rebuild its global network is also unclear. Then there is the regional branch of the Islamic State group - ISKP (Khorasan Province) - which the Taliban oppose. Like al-Qaeda, ISKP has been degraded by the US and Nato but could use the post-withdrawal period to regroup. Its fighter numbers could be only between a few hundred and 2,000 but it may try to gain footholds in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and parts of Tajikistan, which could be a serious regional concern.

"Fighting has been going on for 40 years - most Afghans can't remember a time of peace After 20 years of war, the Taliban has swept to victory in Afghanistan. The group completedtheir shockingly rapid advance across the countryby capturing Kabul on 15 August. It came after foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan following a deal between the US and the Taliban, two decades after US forces removed the militants from power in 2001. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions. Taliban forces have pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West. But questions are already being asked about how the group will govern the country, and what their rule means for women, human rights, and political freedoms. Back in 2001, the US was responding tothe 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed. Officials identified Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, and its leader Osama Bin Laden, as responsible. Bin Laden was in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamists who had been in power since 1996. When they refused to hand him over, the US intervened militarily, quickly removing the Taliban and vowing to support democracy and eliminate the terrorist threat. The Afghan conflict became America's longest war The militants slipped away and later regrouped. Nato allies had joined the US and a new Afghan government took over in 2004 but deadly Taliban attacks continued.

"Women and children look exhausted as they wait in the heat With the Taliban taking control of Afghanistan, thousands have fled their homes in fear. While much of the attention has focused on the crowds thronging Kabul airport, thousands of others have fled to neighbouring Pakistan over the Chaman border. Shumaila Jaffery speaks to some of them. The Chaman Spin Boldak border is one of the busiest crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan with thousands of traders and travellers passing through this dusty town every day. But these days, the traffic from the Afghan side is particularly high as thousands flee possible persecution by the Taliban. From dawn till dusk they pour in - hundreds of men with luggage on their shoulders, burqa-clad women walking briskly behind their men, children clinging to their mothers, exhausted in the scorching heat, and even patients pushed on wheelbarrows. Zirqoon Bibi*, a 57-year-old woman belonging to the minority Hazara community, has only just arrived in Pakistan when I meet her. The Hazara group has been persecuted by the Taliban in the past, witha recent brutal attack on some men of the communityreigniting fears of what Taliban rule would look like for them. ""My heart is burning (with pain)"" she repeatedly sobs when I ask how she is. ""I ask myself what will become of my son, my only son"". Taliban 'tortured and massacred' Afghan men Her son, who works for a British company, has been trying to leave the country without success. She says she already lost her daughter-in-law to a bomb blast by the Taliban targeting the Hazara community a few years ago. ""I felt so lost (after her death) that I couldn't sleep for a long time. The Taliban are terrible people, I am scared of them"". Before arriving in Pakistan, Zirqoon Bibi was housed in a small makeshift camp on the border with around 24 other Hazara women and children from different parts of Afghanistan. She left her home in the capital Kabul along with her two daughters and granddaughter. As she speaks, her granddaughter sits on her lap, completely oblivious to the fact that she has no home now. ""I don't care about my house or our belongings, I am only worried for my son and his daughter,"" Zirqoon Bibi says while gently massaging the child's shoulders. ""Where can I go? what can I do? I have put this girl's mother in the grave with my own hands. It takes a lot of effort and love to raise children, I can't lose another one"". A country abandoned: John Simpson on Afghanistan Black Hawks and Humvees: Taliban's military gains Zarmeeney Begum*, a 60-year-old Afghan who is a Shia Muslim, has also just arrived with a group of other women. Shia Muslims in Afghanistan have been targeted by the Taliban in the past. She says when her community received news of the Taliban takeover, they felt they had no option but to leave Afghanistan. Elderly people and patients were transported in wheelbarrows ""We fear the Taliban will resume their acts of terrorism again. They will conduct raids on our houses. They are already looking for government officials. We feel that bombings may start any day,"" she says. Many of the new arrivals are young Afghan men and women who feel that their futures have now become uncertain. Among them is Muhammad Ahmer* who was studying and working as an English language instructor in Kabul. He is still in disbelief over how quickly Kabul fell. ""It was so unbelievable. To be honest, we didn't know they would take all of Kabul in just one night. But I was only scared about my school and my education,"" he said. He said he currently doesn't know what to do next, but is certain that his future doesn't belong to Afghanistan under the current rule. ""I want to make my own choices in life, I want freedom, so I am not going back."" Business is bad and unemployment rates are through the roof, said some who are migrating to find work in Pakistan Jamal Khan*, also a student in Kabul, has similar sentiments. ""Everybody wants to live in their homes, but we were forced to leave Afghanistan. We are not feeling good about migrating to Pakistan or other countries, all people are worried, but they don't have any hope,"" he says. Others say there is no hope of survival under the Taliban. Obaidullah*, a labourer from Kandahar says he decided to flee to Pakistan because ""businesses are destroyed, there is no government and the economy is in complete shambles"". ""The situation in Kandahar is normal, but there is no work, I have come here so I can find some work, I will probably drive a rickshaw,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Taliban has been trying to portray a more restrained image since its takeover. This is reflected in the stance of one foot soldier who stops to talk to us at the border. He insists the situation is completely peaceful now and says the ""trauma of the Afghan people will end as soon as foreign occupation forces leave the country"". ""It's only a trust issue, people will soon know that we mean what we have promised,"" he adds. Thousands cross the Chaman Spin Boldak every day, but the influx from Afghanistan has been exceptionally high since the Taliban took over But even as people pour in, they say these words mean little. ""The Taliban may act differently this time, but people who have suffered from their hands in the past are not ready to trust them yet,"" says Mr Ahmer. They flee even though they know their futures are uncertain. The desperate scramble to escape Afghanistan Pakistan is already hosting millions of Afghans and says it cannot deal with another influx. Many believe it's only a matter of time before Islamabad completely halts their entry. The Pakistan government has already said that unlike the 1980s, when millions of Afghans came over following the Soviet invasion, this time refugee camps would be set up on the borders and Afghans would not be allowed into the heartland. So far however, people are free to enter the country through the Chaman Spin Boldak border. But they understand the window is small, so they are willing to take any risk to get out. Where they can go after that remains to be seen. *Names have been changed to protect identities A country abandoned: John Simpson on Afghanistan Taliban 'tortured and massacred' Afghan men Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg on COP26, travel plans and Cambo oil field proposals Campaigner Greta Thunberg says she doesn't regard Scotland as a world leader on climate change. The Swedish activist told BBC Scotland she recognised that some countries ""do a bit more than others"" but that none were coming close to what was needed. Onthe Scottish Greens' deal to enter government, she said some politicians were ""less worse"" than others. But she said tackling climate change was not as easy as voting for a green party. The 18-year-old said: ""Of course there might be some politicians that are slightly less worse than others. That was very mean but you get the point. ""It's a hopeful sign that people want something that's more 'green' - whatever green means - but in order to solve this we need to tackle this at a more systemic approach."" The Scottish government has previously described its climate change legislation as ""world leading."" It includes a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2045. The legislation was praised as ""inspiring"" by the UN's climate chief Patricia Espinosa. Ministers say they recognise that every country needs to do more while the Scottish Greens say they agree that systemic change is necessary. Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? What is COP26? Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? Sturgeon urges UK government to reassess Cambo oil field plan In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Scotland exactly two months ahead of the UN climate change conference being held in Glasgow, Ms Thunberg spoke about COP26 and plans for a new oil field off Shetland. She said she was ""not 100% sure"" that she would attend the COP26 talks in November and that her decision would be based on whether the event was ""safe and democratic"". For her, that means ensuring participants from poorer countries are fully vaccinated and able to travel. Ms Thunberg is not sure if she will be attending the COP26 climate talks in November Organisers are offering vaccines to all delegates as part of the accreditation process. Ms Thunberg still believes the conference will not lead to anything ""if we don't treat this crisis like a crisis."" She explained: ""It should be all about climate justice and we can't achieve climate justice if everyone is not contributing on the same terms. ""I've spoken to many people who say that they are trying to at least vaccinate all the delegates and making it more accessible. And if that is the case it's left to see, I guess."" After returning to school from a year off, the teenager said she would not be skipping lessons to attend because the conference falls during Sweden's school holidays. If she does decide to come, her plan is to travel from Stockholm by train. Earlier this month, the former UN climate change chief Christiana Figueres said she thought the conference should be ""hybrid"" with some talks happening in Glasgow while others are moved online. But Ms Thunberg says that should be avoided if a face-to-face meeting is safe. She said: ""I'm not an expert but we get much more results when we meet in person. It's hard to argue against that. But, of course, if it's not considered safe then we have to go for the safest option. ""To be honest, I don't think that either one will lead to much results. A physical meeting will probably bring more results but still nowhere close to what's needed."" Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie will become Scottish government ministers after their party backed a deal to work with the SNP The activist said she was aware of the controversy about the Cambo oil field west of Shetland. The UK government is still to make a decision about whether to give the go-ahead to the new development with pressure growing from climate change campaigners for it to be refused. Sir Ian Wood, former chairman of the oil services firm Wood Group,said last week that Cambo needed to be given the green lightso an energy transition could be carried out in an orderly way. But Ms Thunberg, who used her speech at the UN climate summit in New York in 2019 to angrily tell world leaders and governments they were not doing enough to tackle climate change, said: ""I think that maybe summarises the whole situation that we are in, the fact that these kinds of countries that are actually hosting COP are planning to actually expand fossil fuel infrastructure, to actually open up new oil fields and so on. ""But also, it's a bit strange that we are talking about single individual oil fields when the UK is already producing so much oil as it is. It's not just that we need to stop future expansions, we also need to scale down the existing ones if we are to have a chance of avoiding the worst consequences."" The teenager has also previously criticised the UK for holding a climate conferencewhen the opening of a new coal mine is being considered. Asked whether a quicker energy transition can be achieved without costing tens of thousands of jobs in a place like Aberdeen, she said: ""I sure hope so. ""I think we need to envision that. We can't just say that it's not possible, let's just give up. We have to at least try.  I don't see that as a reason for not trying."" Ms Thunberg added that she did not think she had been to Scotland before and looked forward to seeing the landscapes and meeting people.

"Becton Dickinson (BD) - which makes blood test vials for the NHS - is ramping up imports to try to alleviate serious shortages of test tubes. The firm told the BBC it has received ""exceptional use authorisation"" from UK authorities to import blood tubes that are already approved for use in other countries, such as the US. BD said it has increased production capacity in the UK by 20%. The firm will deliver 9 million blood tubes to the NHS this week. Doctors have been told to stop most blood tests until 17 September, while hospitals have had to cut the total number of blood tests by a quarter. NHS blood test tube shortage set to worsen GPs warn of hard choices amid blood test shortage A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We have secured tens of millions of additional blood tubes, including importing additional supplies from the EU and the US, which will be available to the NHS soon and there continues to be stock in place to ensure clinically urgent testing continues. ""Patient safety is always the top priority and we continue to work closely with NHS England, the devolved administrations, and the NHS to minimise any impact on patient care."" The NHS in England and Wales said it has temporarily stopped all non-urgent testing, due to the shortages and supply chain problems BD is facing. The tests put on hold include those given to patients to diagnose fertility, allergies and pre-diabetes. The NHS undertakes around 1.1 billion diagnostic tests in England per year, according to the Royal College of Pathologists. Medical manufacturer BD employs over 65,000 people in more than 50 countries. The shortage will likely worsen over the next few weeks and last until mid-September,NHS England has warned. Doctors have warned that they are in a ""perilous"" situation and are having to make difficult choices about which patients get blood tests because of the ongoing shortage of test tube supply problems. On Saturday, Dr David Wrigley, the deputy chair of the doctors' union British Medical Association (BMA) stressed that the crisis had put doctors and their patients in a terrible, unenviable position. ""No doctor knowingly undertakes unnecessary blood tests and to now have to ration all those we are doing, as well as cancel hundreds more, goes against everything we stand for as clinicians,"" he said. BD said on Monday that it is doing everything it can to help the NHS care for patients in the UK, by maximising production at all of its global manufacturing facilities that make blood tube products. It said it is expediting shipments and ""importing millions of units"" from other regions of the world to the UK. Like many other industries, the firm previously said that it was experiencing ""continued transportation challenges"" in addition to increased demand, which included port and transport capacity, air freight capacity and UK border challenges. ""Both healthcare systems and manufacturers are balancing demand and production,"" BD said. A text message sent by the NHS informing patients about the ongoing blood test tube shortage Mark Roscrow MBE, chairman of the Health Care Supply Association, which represents health procurement professionals, said that BD are the ""dominant force"" in this area, which makes it difficult to bring on other suppliers. ""It's a problem of their own creation, anyone who is shutting their factory down should do something to plug the gap,"" he told the BBC. ""We had a lot of these procurement problems during the pandemic and we, the NHS, need to consider storing more of these products in the UK so we can be more resilient."" He added that typically the NHS stores are able to hold four weeks' supply of each product, but the way to deal with the issue would be to have more supply that is directly under NHS control. The Institute of Biomedical Science's chief executive David Wells agreed. He said the ""just in time model"" used by the NHS and its reliance upon a limited number of suppliers means that disruption to the supply chain can have a significant impact. ""Such supply issues emphasise the need for pathology services to work in a co-ordinated way, such as within networks with clear leadership structures, to ensure that the supplier base is wide and so that pooled and shared resources can be brought into play to prevent significant disruption and mitigate the risk,"" he added. While the steps being taken by the NHS will ""ensure"" that patients in need of blood tests will still be able to access them in a ""timely way"", Mr Wells stressed his concern that having to stop non-emergency medical testing will have a severe impact on the wider recovery of the NHS.

When Barcelona signed Antoine Griezmann in 2019, there were doubts about how he would gel with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. I wonder what odds you'd have got on none of them playing for Barcelona by 1 September 2021. Griezmann and Suarez link up again at Atleti... #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only - standard message rates apply) Clubs have weeks, or months, to sort out transfers - yet most are left to the last minute. Can I offer my services to do a bit of organisational skills training for them? A one day course should do it. As they all seem pretty flush I will bump up my rate though. Kenny, Edinburgh Barcelona say Atletico Madrid will pay all of Antoine Griezmann's wages. That will presumably help Barca register their new players. They add that there is a ""compulsory permanent transfer clause"" too. Griezmann is the 11th player to leave financially-struggling Barcelona this summer, including Lionel Messi - and the third today. Right-back Emerson Royal joined Tottenham for Â£25.8m and teenage midfielder Ilaix Moriba moved to RB Leipzig for Â£13.7m. Atletico Madrid say the Antoine Griezmann signing from Barcelona is a loan for one season with the option of another. Two years ago the France international made the move the other way after Barca paid his Â£107m buyout clause. But the 30-year-old's time at the Nou Camp has been a disappointment as he scored 35 goals in 102 games and only won the Copa del Rey. He has never won La Liga, joining Atletico Madrid in 2014, Barcelona in 2019 and Atleti now - every time just after his new side had won the league. Atletico Madrid re-sign forward Antoine Griezmann from Barcelona The biggest move of the day and a shock one. France World Cup winner Antoine Griezmann has rejoined Atletico Madrid from Barcelona on a season-long loan deal. As that guy says 'here we go'... Interesting.La Liga's transfers page,externalalready has Antoine Griezmann to Atletico. Done deal? The big one we're still waiting on is Atletico Madrid signing Antoine Griezmann from Barcelona. There is also some talk Barca might sign Sevilla striker Luuk de Jong as a replacement. De Jong and Martin Braithwaite up front. What a dream. We told you earlier that Swansea were trying to sign Brentford winger Tariqe Fosu on a season-long loan. Well that has fallen through so the Ghana international, 25, is likely to stay with the Premier League side. Good news for people who inexplicably named their fantasy football team after Fosu. Not naming any names. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.999974

Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has said he ""absolutely"" supports that view. ""Although we have a steady number of cases, we have had a massive reduction in the number of hospitalisations compared to January and February,"" he said.

We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. Weâll shortly be bringing the live page to a close, hereâs a
round up of the dayâs main headlines: People queue for a coronavirus vaccine in New Delhi, India, earlier today Earlier, we reported that Slovakia has formally ended using Russia's Sputnik V vaccine today, due to a lack of interest. However, Sputnik's manufacturer, Russian Direct Investment Fund, has denied that Slovakia returned some of the doses. The company says Slovakia had used up all the Sputnik V vaccines ""from the batch delivered to the country early this year"" and no additional deliveries were planned as part of the contract. A statement says: ""In Slovakia, Sputnik
V faced a disinformation campaign connected to political struggle between different
groups within the government, even though the efficacy and safety of the Russian
vaccine have been confirmed during clinical trials and real-world use around
the globe. ""It is also worth noting that in Hungary, where over a million
people got vaccinated with Sputnik V during mass vaccination campaign, the
demand for the Russian vaccine exceeded the amount of actual deliveries to the
country."" Health Minister Stephen Donnelly leaves the cabinet meeting at Dublin Castle The Irish Cabinet has agreed on a plan that will effectively end most Covid-19 restrictions by 22 October. The government says the easing of rules is dependent on 90% of adults being vaccinated and Covid-19 cases remaining manageable. From 6 September - next Monday - large crowds will be allowed to gather in the Republic of Ireland for religious ceremonies. Places of worship and outdoor sporting venues will also be allowed to hold 50% capacity from that date. Indoor venues will be allowed to have 60% capacity for events for people who are vaccinated, while outdoor venues can hold 75% capacity for vaccinated people. You can read more about the announcement here. Some 66,648 people received a second dose of a Covid vaccine in the UK on Monday â the lowest number since 21 June. Around 42.8 million people have now had a second dose â thatâs
78.7% of people aged 16 and over. The UK also reported another 19,643 people have had a first
dose of a vaccine â the first time it's dropped below 20,000 since 18 July. The UK has reported another 32,181 daily coronavirus cases,
and a further 50 deaths within 28 deaths of a positive test. The latest government statistics,externalalso show the number of Covid
patients in hospital has passed 7,000 for the first time since 15 March, with
7,015 reported to be in hospital according to the most recent figure. Members of the British Press Photographers' Association are showing off their best work, at the Bargehouse gallery, central London, in an exhibition delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the images from the exhibition, which features the best 100 photographs, capture how the pandemic has affected people's lives.

The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The PM's official spokesman says: ""We are still awaiting the final advice from JCVI on boosters. ""It is still very much our intention to roll out the booster programme during September."" Earlier, we reported comments from Prof Paul Hunter, who called for boosters to be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. The PM's spokesman also says it is still the plan to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September. ""We set out broadly our intention to require our vaccination for nightclubs and some other settings and we'll be coming forward in the coming weeks with details for that,"" he adds. The monitors can give a warning when classrooms are not ventilated enough As the Welsh government announces Â£6m to provide CO2 monitors and ozone disinfecting machines in schools,doctors are welcoming the move. The monitors detect the build-up of carbon dioxide, which comes from people exhaling, offering a measure of how much fresh air is in the room. Dr Rhys Thomas, a consultant at Glangwili Hospital, says they are the ""canaries in the coal mine"" that give advanced warning of the risk of spreading Covid-19. ""It's the air that infects you, not surfaces. It's breathing in somebody else's air that'll do it,"" he says. ""Delta is far more infectious and dangerous, and transfers more readily in the air."" Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP from Nefyn, Gwynedd, and a member of the Fresh Air campaign, says he is ""really pleased"" the Welsh government is taking the importance of ventilation seriously. Scotland has already deployed CO2 monitors and England is also providing 300,000 of them for the autumn term. The Welsh government cautioned that its ozone machines, designed by Swansea University, are only intended to disinfect empty spaces after an outbreak, not to continuously filter the air in occupied classrooms. This Post Office branch in Neston, Cheshire, has been forced to close More than 250 Post Office branches that closed due to Covid-19 in the UK had not reopened by the time lockdown restrictions were lifted in June, it has been revealed. Figures seen by the BBC show 1,183 UK branches had been shut for a month or more since March 2020, but 260 had not reopened by 30 June this year. The Post Office says the pandemic had ""impacted our ability"" to open. Post Offices were permitted to remain open throughout coronavirus lockdowns in all four UK nations, but wider restrictions forced surrounding businesses to close and bans on most foreign travel impacted the viability of many branches. Brian and Joanne Young ran a branch in Neston, Cheshire, until they announced in June they could no longer afford to keep it open. Brian says the branch had ""lost a lot of footfall during the pandemic"" due to businesses that needed banking services closing, while losing transactions ""like travel money and travel insurance, which give us a form of income on commission"", also had an impact. ""All our overheads stayed the same and unfortunately, we suffered a big loss on the shop and we couldn't afford to sustain it any more,"" he adds. Read the full storyhere. Kieffer Moore has scored six goals in 21 appearances for Wales, including one at Euro 2020 A positive Covid-19 test for reserve goalkeeper Adam Daviesmeans he and striker Kieffer Moore will miss Wales's three upcoming games. Moore was identified as a close contact of Davies after he tested positive and the Football Association of Wales said both players would be self-isolating for 10 days. It means they will be unable to play in the friendly against Finland on Wednesday, or the two World Cup qualifiers against Belarus and Estonia. A further five players are out of action due to injury. The Stormont executive must now ""set out a path"" for ending Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons says. ""We need to start moving on these issues, we have to take into account the impact on the economy, the health service and society more generally,"" he tells BBC News NI. First Minister Paul Givan previously said he wantedall regulations lifted by the end of September. The five-party executive will meet tomorrow to discuss the remaining restrictions. Hospitality businesses have been calling on ministers to agree to remove restrictions such as social distancing and table service requirements, which they say have damaged trade. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland also remain closed, unlike in the rest of the UK. Other parties have not stated yet if they support ending restrictions by the end of next month. Sinn Fein's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who has just revealed she's tested positive - previously said the executive needed to remain ""cautious"", while the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it was ""naÃ¯ve"" to set a date in place.

People in poorer areas of Scotland are likely to have 20 fewer healthy years than those in wealthy areas The pandemic may havewidened the gap in mortality rates between the wealthy and the poor in Scotland, a report by the National Records of Scotland suggests. Last year, death rates in deprived areas were almost double those in rich areas, with the poorest also expected to have 20 fewer years of good health than the most affluent. While the general mortality rate was 1.9 times higher in deprived areas, for Covid-19 deaths, the rate was 2.4 times higher among poor communities. ""Mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas,"" the report says, adding that ""Covid-19 appears to be increasing this effect"". The health service in England is experiencing ""winter-like pressures"", the Society of Acute Medicine is warning. Medics from the organisation, which represents doctors working in the field of acute medicine, say doctors are treating ""vast numbers"" of people with non-Covid illnesses as well as many attending hospital with severe coronavirus symptoms. Dr Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, says many patients are suffering from illnesses typically seen in winter such as respiratory infections - particularly in children. ""I think it is fair to say we are currently facing an unprecedented summer workload that feels more like the worst winter pressures most of us can recall,"" says Dr Scriven. ""We are seeing vast numbers of patients with non-Covid illness alongside the steady admission rates of those still very poorly with Covid. ""We are also noticing frailer people who have deconditioned over lockdowns so that any illness that previously might have been fairly minor now need an extended stay in hospital with periods of rehabilitation."" Acute medicine deals with the immediate and early treatment of adult patients with a variety of medical conditions who present to hospital as emergencies. The NHS is facing a huge backlog of care which has been exacerbated by the pandemic.A record 5.45 million people are waiting for carein England alone. Fully vaccinated UK travellers going to Italy no longer have to quarantine for five days on arrival. A new rule has come into force in Italy, ending the five-day quarantine - as long as travellers have a negative coronavirus test and they received their second jab at least 14 days prior to arriving. Rome had re-imposed the quarantine from 21 June as the Delta variant spread rapidly across the UK. Since early August, Italy has required proof of vaccination, recent recovery from coronavirus or a negative test for people wanting to dine indoors or enter museums and sports events. Italy is currently on the UK's amber travel list, which means those coming back to the UK must take a test three days before travelling and a PCR test two days after arriving.

Misinformation has led to growing numbers of young, unvaccinated Covid patients in Wales' hospitals, a critical care consultant says.. Dr Ami Jones says Aneurin Bevan health board staff felt ""demoralised"" to see the virus filling wards and intensive care units again. She says acute hospitals, emergency departments and respiratory medicine have experienced a ""much busier weekend this weekend than we've seen for months in terms of Covid"". ""It's predominantly unvaccinated people we're seeing and a number of these are people in their 20s and 30s, with a small number of under-16s requiring hospital care for Covid,"" Dr Jones says. Vaccination has made a huge difference in numbers requiring hospital treatment, she says, adding ""we have people in our ITU who are very poorly right now who didn't get vaccinated but now wish for nothing more than to be able to turn back the clock and get their vaccine"". ""The staff are feeling pretty demoralised that Covid is once again filling their wards and their ITUs, especially when so many hospital cases could've been prevented by vaccination. ""It's always heart-breaking to treat patients with avoidable conditions but this time feels different asthere's been so much misinformation out thereit's made it very tough for people to know who to believe and who to trust. ""But ask any front-line worker and they will tell you that vaccination is what's making a difference to the patients we are treating at the moment."" Read the full storyhere. Older people should be prioritised for booster jabs, one expert said The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Immunisation and Vaccination, are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The NHS is poised to deliver a third jab to 30 million over-50s and people with conditions that make them clinically vulnerable, if it gets the green light. Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia says a widespread booster campaign may not be needed as the vaccines are still effective at preventing serious disease in many people. But he's told the PA news agency the boosters should be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. âThe evidence is that these people wonât have responded that well to vaccine,"" says Prof Hunter. âAs far as Iâm concerned there is no debate whatsoever about that group, they should be boosted and they should be boosted pretty soon."" Although protection for other groups will be waning, he says the vaccines will ""hopefully"" prevent serious illness for several years. He also says Covid-19 is approaching the ""endemic equilibrium"", the number of cases we should expect to see per day forever. In other coronaviruses that have been circulating for many years in humans, this is about 45,000 cases a day, Prof Hunter says. But he says because of widespread immunity, the serious illness of Covid-19 will be ""consigned to history"", except for occasional cases. In most pandemics, the professor says this takes about three years. Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Monica Kerwin says governments have failed Aboriginal people ""I am angry. The government did nothing to protect us. They sit in their ivory towers and make decisions on Aboriginal issues."" Monica Kerwin is a Barkindji (First Nation) mother-of-six who lives in Wilcannia, in outback New South Wales, Australia. Her remote town of about 750 people is at the centre of a growing Covid outbreak that has brought to the fore how vulnerable Australia's indigenous people are to the virus. For most of the pandemic, outbreaks in Australia have mainly hit cities and spared remote areas. But as the Delta variant has spread from Sydney to western New South Wales and elsewhere, Aboriginal communities are seeing Covid infections for the first time. ""We're on edge. The [indigenous] population is just not prepared for this pandemic,"" says Dr Chaitanya Kada, a doctor based in Lightning Ridge, another outback town. Infections have surged in the remote town of Wilcannia The town's outbreak started at a funeral on 13 August that was attended by more than 100 people, some from other regional areas. It did not breach any public health orders because Wilcannia was not in lockdown at the time. Health authorities remain worried, however, that those mourners could have unintentionally infected people in other communities. The situation has infuriated locals. Monica says she and others had previously asked authorities to seal off Wilcannia to keep it safe. ""We were watching what was happening in other communities. We were watching it [the virus] getting closer,"" she says. ""We've been crying out for prevention. No one listened to us."" Read the full storyhere. Manufacturer Becton Dickinson has announced it will deliver nine million additional blood test tubes to the NHS this week for immediate distribution. Manufacturers have seen record demand for the vials in recent months,caused in part by the need for tests for Covid patients. The NHS in England and Wales has temporarily stopped all non-urgent testing. In a statement, Becton Dickinson says it has received exceptional use authorisation to import BD blood tubes into the UK that are approved for use in other regions of the world, such as the US. Becton Dickinson says it has increased production capacity in the UK by 20% to ""help alleviate the backlog of orders"".  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Charlie Burridge is non verbal and relies on an assisted technology machine to communicate A severely disabled 10-year-old girl is facing unacceptable delays in securing the right wheelchair for her needs, her family has said. Charlie Burridge has an NHS chair but it does not support her head, which she needs to be able to communicate. The family, from North Tyneside, said it is taking too long to be seen at Newcastle's Freeman hospital. The hospital said the wait had been ""due to the clinics being booked and annual leave issues"". Charlie is non-verbal as a result of an undiagnosed condition she was born with and uses an eye-gazing machine to communicate, but her dad Brian said her head needs to be upright for her to use it. Mr Burridge said he had spent three years battling to get her the correct wheelchair. He described how his daughter was able to keep her head upright at the start of the day but by lunchtime it would fall to the side. ""Her head starts to go off the side of the chair and we lift it up and her head falls back down and we're doing this all day,"" he said. Mr Burridge is worried Charlie's back could be permanently damaged as a result. Her last appointment was on 6 May and their next one is on Thursday, but her father believes 118 days between appointments is too long. ""I just feel like I've always got my begging bowl out. I work full time and when I get home she's still hanging out of her chair, it just feels like I can't do it anymore."" Charlie sitting upright in her wheelchair in 2018 Mr Burridge said while he is critical of the wait to get his daughter a new chair, he was not finding fault with front-line NHS workers. ""[During lockdown] I was standing on the step and clapping. ""I appreciate the NHS so much so I almost feel guilty having a go at the organisation for Charlie hanging out of her chair, because they've done so much. ""But then Charlie can't speak for herself and I'm her dad and if it's not right I've got to say something."" In a statement, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We are sorry this is causing distress and are currently looking into this as a formal complaint. ""While we can't comment on Charlotte's individual circumstances, an appointment has been arranged where we will discuss the concerns the family has raised.""

round up of the dayâs main headlines: People queue for a coronavirus vaccine in New Delhi, India, earlier today Earlier, we reported that Slovakia has formally ended using Russia's Sputnik V vaccine today, due to a lack of interest. However, Sputnik's manufacturer, Russian Direct Investment Fund, has denied that Slovakia returned some of the doses. The company says Slovakia had used up all the Sputnik V vaccines ""from the batch delivered to the country early this year"" and no additional deliveries were planned as part of the contract. A statement says: ""In Slovakia, Sputnik
V faced a disinformation campaign connected to political struggle between different
groups within the government, even though the efficacy and safety of the Russian
vaccine have been confirmed during clinical trials and real-world use around
the globe. ""It is also worth noting that in Hungary, where over a million
people got vaccinated with Sputnik V during mass vaccination campaign, the
demand for the Russian vaccine exceeded the amount of actual deliveries to the
country."" Health Minister Stephen Donnelly leaves the cabinet meeting at Dublin Castle The Irish Cabinet has agreed on a plan that will effectively end most Covid-19 restrictions by 22 October. The government says the easing of rules is dependent on 90% of adults being vaccinated and Covid-19 cases remaining manageable. From 6 September - next Monday - large crowds will be allowed to gather in the Republic of Ireland for religious ceremonies. Places of worship and outdoor sporting venues will also be allowed to hold 50% capacity from that date. Indoor venues will be allowed to have 60% capacity for events for people who are vaccinated, while outdoor venues can hold 75% capacity for vaccinated people.

The government did nothing to protect us. They sit in their ivory towers and make decisions on Aboriginal issues."" Monica Kerwin is a Barkindji (First Nation) mother-of-six who lives in Wilcannia, in outback New South Wales, Australia. Her remote town of about 750 people is at the centre of a growing Covid outbreak that has brought to the fore how vulnerable Australia's indigenous people are to the virus. For most of the pandemic, outbreaks in Australia have mainly hit cities and spared remote areas. But as the Delta variant has spread from Sydney to western New South Wales and elsewhere, Aboriginal communities are seeing Covid infections for the first time. ""We're on edge. The [indigenous] population is just not prepared for this pandemic,"" says Dr Chaitanya Kada, a doctor based in Lightning Ridge, another outback town. Infections have surged in the remote town of Wilcannia The town's outbreak started at a funeral on 13 August that was attended by more than 100 people, some from other regional areas. It did not breach any public health orders because Wilcannia was not in lockdown at the time. Health authorities remain worried, however, that those mourners could have unintentionally infected people in other communities. The situation has infuriated locals. Monica says she and others had previously asked authorities to seal off Wilcannia to keep it safe. ""We were watching what was happening in other communities. We were watching it [the virus] getting closer,"" she says. ""We've been crying out for prevention. No one listened to us."" Read the full storyhere. Manufacturer Becton Dickinson has announced it will deliver nine million additional blood test tubes to the NHS this week for immediate distribution. Manufacturers have seen record demand for the vials in recent months,caused in part by the need for tests for Covid patients.

In a statement, Becton Dickinson says it has received exceptional use authorisation to import BD blood tubes into the UK that are approved for use in other regions of the world, such as the US.

When Barcelona signed Antoine Griezmann in 2019, there were doubts about how he would gel with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. I wonder what odds you'd have got on none of them playing for Barcelona by 1 September 2021. Griezmann and Suarez link up again at Atleti... #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only - standard message rates apply) Clubs have weeks, or months, to sort out transfers - yet most are left to the last minute. Can I offer my services to do a bit of organisational skills training for them? A one day course should do it. As they all seem pretty flush I will bump up my rate though. Kenny, Edinburgh Barcelona say Atletico Madrid will pay all of Antoine Griezmann's wages. That will presumably help Barca register their new players. They add that there is a ""compulsory permanent transfer clause"" too. Griezmann is the 11th player to leave financially-struggling Barcelona this summer, including Lionel Messi - and the third today. Right-back Emerson Royal joined Tottenham for Â£25.8m and teenage midfielder Ilaix Moriba moved to RB Leipzig for Â£13.7m. Atletico Madrid say the Antoine Griezmann signing from Barcelona is a loan for one season with the option of another. Two years ago the France international made the move the other way after Barca paid his Â£107m buyout clause. But the 30-year-old's time at the Nou Camp has been a disappointment as he scored 35 goals in 102 games and only won the Copa del Rey. He has never won La Liga, joining Atletico Madrid in 2014, Barcelona in 2019 and Atleti now - every time just after his new side had won the league. Atletico Madrid re-sign forward Antoine Griezmann from Barcelona The biggest move of the day and a shock one. France World Cup winner Antoine Griezmann has rejoined Atletico Madrid from Barcelona on a season-long loan deal. As that guy says 'here we go'... Interesting.La Liga's transfers page,externalalready has Antoine Griezmann to Atletico. Done deal? The big one we're still waiting on is Atletico Madrid signing Antoine Griezmann from Barcelona. There is also some talk Barca might sign Sevilla striker Luuk de Jong as a replacement. De Jong and Martin Braithwaite up front. What a dream. We told you earlier that Swansea were trying to sign Brentford winger Tariqe Fosu on a season-long loan. Well that has fallen through so the Ghana international, 25, is likely to stay with the Premier League side. Good news for people who inexplicably named their fantasy football team after Fosu.

"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg on COP26, travel plans and Cambo oil field proposals Campaigner Greta Thunberg says she doesn't regard Scotland as a world leader on climate change. The Swedish activist told BBC Scotland she recognised that some countries ""do a bit more than others"" but that none were coming close to what was needed. Onthe Scottish Greens' deal to enter government, she said some politicians were ""less worse"" than others. But she said tackling climate change was not as easy as voting for a green party. The 18-year-old said: ""Of course there might be some politicians that are slightly less worse than others. That was very mean but you get the point. ""It's a hopeful sign that people want something that's more 'green' - whatever green means - but in order to solve this we need to tackle this at a more systemic approach."" The Scottish government has previously described its climate change legislation as ""world leading."" It includes a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2045. The legislation was praised as ""inspiring"" by the UN's climate chief Patricia Espinosa. Ministers say they recognise that every country needs to do more while the Scottish Greens say they agree that systemic change is necessary. Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? What is COP26? Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? Sturgeon urges UK government to reassess Cambo oil field plan In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Scotland exactly two months ahead of the UN climate change conference being held in Glasgow, Ms Thunberg spoke about COP26 and plans for a new oil field off Shetland. She said she was ""not 100% sure"" that she would attend the COP26 talks in November and that her decision would be based on whether the event was ""safe and democratic"". For her, that means ensuring participants from poorer countries are fully vaccinated and able to travel. Ms Thunberg is not sure if she will be attending the COP26 climate talks in November Organisers are offering vaccines to all delegates as part of the accreditation process. Ms Thunberg still believes the conference will not lead to anything ""if we don't treat this crisis like a crisis."" She explained: ""It should be all about climate justice and we can't achieve climate justice if everyone is not contributing on the same terms. ""I've spoken to many people who say that they are trying to at least vaccinate all the delegates and making it more accessible. And if that is the case it's left to see, I guess."" After returning to school from a year off, the teenager said she would not be skipping lessons to attend because the conference falls during Sweden's school holidays. If she does decide to come, her plan is to travel from Stockholm by train. Earlier this month, the former UN climate change chief Christiana Figueres said she thought the conference should be ""hybrid"" with some talks happening in Glasgow while others are moved online. But Ms Thunberg says that should be avoided if a face-to-face meeting is safe. She said: ""I'm not an expert but we get much more results when we meet in person. It's hard to argue against that. But, of course, if it's not considered safe then we have to go for the safest option. ""To be honest, I don't think that either one will lead to much results. A physical meeting will probably bring more results but still nowhere close to what's needed."" Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie will become Scottish government ministers after their party backed a deal to work with the SNP The activist said she was aware of the controversy about the Cambo oil field west of Shetland. The UK government is still to make a decision about whether to give the go-ahead to the new development with pressure growing from climate change campaigners for it to be refused. Sir Ian Wood, former chairman of the oil services firm Wood Group,said last week that Cambo needed to be given the green lightso an energy transition could be carried out in an orderly way. But Ms Thunberg, who used her speech at the UN climate summit in New York in 2019 to angrily tell world leaders and governments they were not doing enough to tackle climate change, said: ""I think that maybe summarises the whole situation that we are in, the fact that these kinds of countries that are actually hosting COP are planning to actually expand fossil fuel infrastructure, to actually open up new oil fields and so on. ""But also, it's a bit strange that we are talking about single individual oil fields when the UK is already producing so much oil as it is. It's not just that we need to stop future expansions, we also need to scale down the existing ones if we are to have a chance of avoiding the worst consequences."" The teenager has also previously criticised the UK for holding a climate conferencewhen the opening of a new coal mine is being considered. Asked whether a quicker energy transition can be achieved without costing tens of thousands of jobs in a place like Aberdeen, she said: ""I sure hope so. ""I think we need to envision that. We can't just say that it's not possible, let's just give up. We have to at least try.  I don't see that as a reason for not trying."" Ms Thunberg added that she did not think she had been to Scotland before and looked forward to seeing the landscapes and meeting people.

We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. Weâll shortly be bringing the live page to a close, hereâs a
round up of the dayâs main headlines: People queue for a coronavirus vaccine in New Delhi, India, earlier today Earlier, we reported that Slovakia has formally ended using Russia's Sputnik V vaccine today, due to a lack of interest. However, Sputnik's manufacturer, Russian Direct Investment Fund, has denied that Slovakia returned some of the doses. The company says Slovakia had used up all the Sputnik V vaccines ""from the batch delivered to the country early this year"" and no additional deliveries were planned as part of the contract. A statement says: ""In Slovakia, Sputnik
V faced a disinformation campaign connected to political struggle between different
groups within the government, even though the efficacy and safety of the Russian
vaccine have been confirmed during clinical trials and real-world use around
the globe. ""It is also worth noting that in Hungary, where over a million
people got vaccinated with Sputnik V during mass vaccination campaign, the
demand for the Russian vaccine exceeded the amount of actual deliveries to the
country."" Health Minister Stephen Donnelly leaves the cabinet meeting at Dublin Castle The Irish Cabinet has agreed on a plan that will effectively end most Covid-19 restrictions by 22 October. The government says the easing of rules is dependent on 90% of adults being vaccinated and Covid-19 cases remaining manageable. From 6 September - next Monday - large crowds will be allowed to gather in the Republic of Ireland for religious ceremonies. Places of worship and outdoor sporting venues will also be allowed to hold 50% capacity from that date. Indoor venues will be allowed to have 60% capacity for events for people who are vaccinated, while outdoor venues can hold 75% capacity for vaccinated people. You can read more about the announcement here. Some 66,648 people received a second dose of a Covid vaccine in the UK on Monday â the lowest number since 21 June. Around 42.8 million people have now had a second dose â thatâs
78.7% of people aged 16 and over. The UK also reported another 19,643 people have had a first
dose of a vaccine â the first time it's dropped below 20,000 since 18 July. The UK has reported another 32,181 daily coronavirus cases,
and a further 50 deaths within 28 deaths of a positive test. The latest government statistics,externalalso show the number of Covid
patients in hospital has passed 7,000 for the first time since 15 March, with
7,015 reported to be in hospital according to the most recent figure. Members of the British Press Photographers' Association are showing off their best work, at the Bargehouse gallery, central London, in an exhibition delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The PM's official spokesman says: ""We are still awaiting the final advice from JCVI on boosters. ""It is still very much our intention to roll out the booster programme during September."" Earlier, we reported comments from Prof Paul Hunter, who called for boosters to be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. The PM's spokesman also says it is still the plan to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September. ""We set out broadly our intention to require our vaccination for nightclubs and some other settings and we'll be coming forward in the coming weeks with details for that,"" he adds. The monitors can give a warning when classrooms are not ventilated enough As the Welsh government announces Â£6m to provide CO2 monitors and ozone disinfecting machines in schools,doctors are welcoming the move. The monitors detect the build-up of carbon dioxide, which comes from people exhaling, offering a measure of how much fresh air is in the room. Dr Rhys Thomas, a consultant at Glangwili Hospital, says they are the ""canaries in the coal mine"" that give advanced warning of the risk of spreading Covid-19. ""It's the air that infects you, not surfaces. It's breathing in somebody else's air that'll do it,"" he says. ""Delta is far more infectious and dangerous, and transfers more readily in the air."" Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP from Nefyn, Gwynedd, and a member of the Fresh Air campaign, says he is ""really pleased"" the Welsh government is taking the importance of ventilation seriously. Scotland has already deployed CO2 monitors and England is also providing 300,000 of them for the autumn term. The Welsh government cautioned that its ozone machines, designed by Swansea University, are only intended to disinfect empty spaces after an outbreak, not to continuously filter the air in occupied classrooms. This Post Office branch in Neston, Cheshire, has been forced to close More than 250 Post Office branches that closed due to Covid-19 in the UK had not reopened by the time lockdown restrictions were lifted in June, it has been revealed. Figures seen by the BBC show 1,183 UK branches had been shut for a month or more since March 2020, but 260 had not reopened by 30 June this year. The Post Office says the pandemic had ""impacted our ability"" to open. Post Offices were permitted to remain open throughout coronavirus lockdowns in all four UK nations, but wider restrictions forced surrounding businesses to close and bans on most foreign travel impacted the viability of many branches. Brian and Joanne Young ran a branch in Neston, Cheshire, until they announced in June they could no longer afford to keep it open. Brian says the branch had ""lost a lot of footfall during the pandemic"" due to businesses that needed banking services closing, while losing transactions ""like travel money and travel insurance, which give us a form of income on commission"", also had an impact. ""All our overheads stayed the same and unfortunately, we suffered a big loss on the shop and we couldn't afford to sustain it any more,"" he adds. Read the full storyhere. Kieffer Moore has scored six goals in 21 appearances for Wales, including one at Euro 2020 A positive Covid-19 test for reserve goalkeeper Adam Daviesmeans he and striker Kieffer Moore will miss Wales's three upcoming games. Moore was identified as a close contact of Davies after he tested positive and the Football Association of Wales said both players would be self-isolating for 10 days.

First Minister Paul Givan previously said he wantedall regulations lifted by the end of September. The five-party executive will meet tomorrow to discuss the remaining restrictions. Hospitality businesses have been calling on ministers to agree to remove restrictions such as social distancing and table service requirements, which they say have damaged trade. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland also remain closed, unlike in the rest of the UK. Other parties have not stated yet if they support ending restrictions by the end of next month. Sinn Fein's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who has just revealed she's tested positive - previously said the executive needed to remain ""cautious"", while the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it was ""naÃ¯ve"" to set a date in place.

People in poorer areas of Scotland are likely to have 20 fewer healthy years than those in wealthy areas The pandemic may havewidened the gap in mortality rates between the wealthy and the poor in Scotland, a report by the National Records of Scotland suggests. Last year, death rates in deprived areas were almost double those in rich areas, with the poorest also expected to have 20 fewer years of good health than the most affluent. While the general mortality rate was 1.9 times higher in deprived areas, for Covid-19 deaths, the rate was 2.4 times higher among poor communities. ""Mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas,"" the report says, adding that ""Covid-19 appears to be increasing this effect"". The health service in England is experiencing ""winter-like pressures"", the Society of Acute Medicine is warning. Medics from the organisation, which represents doctors working in the field of acute medicine, say doctors are treating ""vast numbers"" of people with non-Covid illnesses as well as many attending hospital with severe coronavirus symptoms. Dr Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, says many patients are suffering from illnesses typically seen in winter such as respiratory infections - particularly in children. ""I think it is fair to say we are currently facing an unprecedented summer workload that feels more like the worst winter pressures most of us can recall,"" says Dr Scriven. ""We are seeing vast numbers of patients with non-Covid illness alongside the steady admission rates of those still very poorly with Covid. ""We are also noticing frailer people who have deconditioned over lockdowns so that any illness that previously might have been fairly minor now need an extended stay in hospital with periods of rehabilitation."" Acute medicine deals with the immediate and early treatment of adult patients with a variety of medical conditions who present to hospital as emergencies. The NHS is facing a huge backlog of care which has been exacerbated by the pandemic.A record 5.45 million people are waiting for carein England alone. Fully vaccinated UK travellers going to Italy no longer have to quarantine for five days on arrival. A new rule has come into force in Italy, ending the five-day quarantine - as long as travellers have a negative coronavirus test and they received their second jab at least 14 days prior to arriving. Rome had re-imposed the quarantine from 21 June as the Delta variant spread rapidly across the UK. Since early August, Italy has required proof of vaccination, recent recovery from coronavirus or a negative test for people wanting to dine indoors or enter museums and sports events. Italy is currently on the UK's amber travel list, which means those coming back to the UK must take a test three days before travelling and a PCR test two days after arriving.

Misinformation has led to growing numbers of young, unvaccinated Covid patients in Wales' hospitals, a critical care consultant says.. Dr Ami Jones says Aneurin Bevan health board staff felt ""demoralised"" to see the virus filling wards and intensive care units again. She says acute hospitals, emergency departments and respiratory medicine have experienced a ""much busier weekend this weekend than we've seen for months in terms of Covid"". ""It's predominantly unvaccinated people we're seeing and a number of these are people in their 20s and 30s, with a small number of under-16s requiring hospital care for Covid,"" Dr Jones says. Vaccination has made a huge difference in numbers requiring hospital treatment, she says, adding ""we have people in our ITU who are very poorly right now who didn't get vaccinated but now wish for nothing more than to be able to turn back the clock and get their vaccine"". ""The staff are feeling pretty demoralised that Covid is once again filling their wards and their ITUs, especially when so many hospital cases could've been prevented by vaccination. ""It's always heart-breaking to treat patients with avoidable conditions but this time feels different asthere's been so much misinformation out thereit's made it very tough for people to know who to believe and who to trust. ""But ask any front-line worker and they will tell you that vaccination is what's making a difference to the patients we are treating at the moment."" Read the full storyhere. Older people should be prioritised for booster jabs, one expert said The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Immunisation and Vaccination, are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The NHS is poised to deliver a third jab to 30 million over-50s and people with conditions that make them clinically vulnerable, if it gets the green light. Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia says a widespread booster campaign may not be needed as the vaccines are still effective at preventing serious disease in many people. But he's told the PA news agency the boosters should be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. âThe evidence is that these people wonât have responded that well to vaccine,"" says Prof Hunter. âAs far as Iâm concerned there is no debate whatsoever about that group, they should be boosted and they should be boosted pretty soon."" Although protection for other groups will be waning, he says the vaccines will ""hopefully"" prevent serious illness for several years. He also says Covid-19 is approaching the ""endemic equilibrium"", the number of cases we should expect to see per day forever. In other coronaviruses that have been circulating for many years in humans, this is about 45,000 cases a day, Prof Hunter says. But he says because of widespread immunity, the serious illness of Covid-19 will be ""consigned to history"", except for occasional cases. In most pandemics, the professor says this takes about three years. Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Monica Kerwin says governments have failed Aboriginal people ""I am angry. The government did nothing to protect us. They sit in their ivory towers and make decisions on Aboriginal issues."" Monica Kerwin is a Barkindji (First Nation) mother-of-six who lives in Wilcannia, in outback New South Wales, Australia. Her remote town of about 750 people is at the centre of a growing Covid outbreak that has brought to the fore how vulnerable Australia's indigenous people are to the virus. For most of the pandemic, outbreaks in Australia have mainly hit cities and spared remote areas. But as the Delta variant has spread from Sydney to western New South Wales and elsewhere, Aboriginal communities are seeing Covid infections for the first time. ""We're on edge. The [indigenous] population is just not prepared for this pandemic,"" says Dr Chaitanya Kada, a doctor based in Lightning Ridge, another outback town. Infections have surged in the remote town of Wilcannia The town's outbreak started at a funeral on 13 August that was attended by more than 100 people, some from other regional areas. It did not breach any public health orders because Wilcannia was not in lockdown at the time. Health authorities remain worried, however, that those mourners could have unintentionally infected people in other communities. The situation has infuriated locals. Monica says she and others had previously asked authorities to seal off Wilcannia to keep it safe. ""We were watching what was happening in other communities. We were watching it [the virus] getting closer,"" she says. ""We've been crying out for prevention. No one listened to us."" Read the full storyhere.

However, Sputnik's manufacturer, Russian Direct Investment Fund, has denied that Slovakia returned some of the doses. The company says Slovakia had used up all the Sputnik V vaccines ""from the batch delivered to the country early this year"" and no additional deliveries were planned as part of the contract. A statement says: ""In Slovakia, Sputnik
V faced a disinformation campaign connected to political struggle between different
groups within the government, even though the efficacy and safety of the Russian
vaccine have been confirmed during clinical trials and real-world use around
the globe. ""It is also worth noting that in Hungary, where over a million
people got vaccinated with Sputnik V during mass vaccination campaign, the
demand for the Russian vaccine exceeded the amount of actual deliveries to the
country."" Health Minister Stephen Donnelly leaves the cabinet meeting at Dublin Castle The Irish Cabinet has agreed on a plan that will effectively end most Covid-19 restrictions by 22 October. The government says the easing of rules is dependent on 90% of adults being vaccinated and Covid-19 cases remaining manageable. From 6 September - next Monday - large crowds will be allowed to gather in the Republic of Ireland for religious ceremonies. Places of worship and outdoor sporting venues will also be allowed to hold 50% capacity from that date. Indoor venues will be allowed to have 60% capacity for events for people who are vaccinated, while outdoor venues can hold 75% capacity for vaccinated people. You can read more about the announcement here. Some 66,648 people received a second dose of a Covid vaccine in the UK on Monday â the lowest number since 21 June. Around 42.8 million people have now had a second dose â thatâs
78.7% of people aged 16 and over. The UK also reported another 19,643 people have had a first
dose of a vaccine â the first time it's dropped below 20,000 since 18 July. The UK has reported another 32,181 daily coronavirus cases,
and a further 50 deaths within 28 deaths of a positive test. The latest government statistics,externalalso show the number of Covid
patients in hospital has passed 7,000 for the first time since 15 March, with
7,015 reported to be in hospital according to the most recent figure. Members of the British Press Photographers' Association are showing off their best work, at the Bargehouse gallery, central London, in an exhibition delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the images from the exhibition, which features the best 100 photographs, capture how the pandemic has affected people's lives. A cyclist stops in the middle of an almost deserted Westminster Bridge to take a photograph, at 13:15, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson had announced the UK would lock down to fight Covid-19, on 24 March 2020 With swimming pools closed because of the pandemic, triathlete Lloyd Bebbington trains in his garden, in April 2020 Queen Elizabeth II takes her seat in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, for the socially-distanced funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh, who died aged 99, in April A funeral is held outside the London home of a 40-year old man who died suddenly from suspected Covid-19, in June 2020 The government still intends to roll out a Covid-19 booster programme in England from September, the prime minister's official spokesman has said. The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The PM's official spokesman says: ""We are still awaiting the final advice from JCVI on boosters. ""It is still very much our intention to roll out the booster programme during September."" Earlier, we reported comments from Prof Paul Hunter, who called for boosters to be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. The PM's spokesman also says it is still the plan to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September. ""We set out broadly our intention to require our vaccination for nightclubs and some other settings and we'll be coming forward in the coming weeks with details for that,"" he adds. The monitors can give a warning when classrooms are not ventilated enough As the Welsh government announces Â£6m to provide CO2 monitors and ozone disinfecting machines in schools,doctors are welcoming the move. The monitors detect the build-up of carbon dioxide, which comes from people exhaling, offering a measure of how much fresh air is in the room. Dr Rhys Thomas, a consultant at Glangwili Hospital, says they are the ""canaries in the coal mine"" that give advanced warning of the risk of spreading Covid-19. ""It's the air that infects you, not surfaces. It's breathing in somebody else's air that'll do it,"" he says. ""Delta is far more infectious and dangerous, and transfers more readily in the air."" Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP from Nefyn, Gwynedd, and a member of the Fresh Air campaign, says he is ""really pleased"" the Welsh government is taking the importance of ventilation seriously. Scotland has already deployed CO2 monitors and England is also providing 300,000 of them for the autumn term. The Welsh government cautioned that its ozone machines, designed by Swansea University, are only intended to disinfect empty spaces after an outbreak, not to continuously filter the air in occupied classrooms. This Post Office branch in Neston, Cheshire, has been forced to close More than 250 Post Office branches that closed due to Covid-19 in the UK had not reopened by the time lockdown restrictions were lifted in June, it has been revealed. Figures seen by the BBC show 1,183 UK branches had been shut for a month or more since March 2020, but 260 had not reopened by 30 June this year. The Post Office says the pandemic had ""impacted our ability"" to open. Post Offices were permitted to remain open throughout coronavirus lockdowns in all four UK nations, but wider restrictions forced surrounding businesses to close and bans on most foreign travel impacted the viability of many branches. Brian and Joanne Young ran a branch in Neston, Cheshire, until they announced in June they could no longer afford to keep it open. Brian says the branch had ""lost a lot of footfall during the pandemic"" due to businesses that needed banking services closing, while losing transactions ""like travel money and travel insurance, which give us a form of income on commission"", also had an impact. ""All our overheads stayed the same and unfortunately, we suffered a big loss on the shop and we couldn't afford to sustain it any more,"" he adds. Read the full storyhere. Kieffer Moore has scored six goals in 21 appearances for Wales, including one at Euro 2020 A positive Covid-19 test for reserve goalkeeper Adam Daviesmeans he and striker Kieffer Moore will miss Wales's three upcoming games. Moore was identified as a close contact of Davies after he tested positive and the Football Association of Wales said both players would be self-isolating for 10 days. It means they will be unable to play in the friendly against Finland on Wednesday, or the two World Cup qualifiers against Belarus and Estonia. A further five players are out of action due to injury. The Stormont executive must now ""set out a path"" for ending Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons says. ""We need to start moving on these issues, we have to take into account the impact on the economy, the health service and society more generally,"" he tells BBC News NI. First Minister Paul Givan previously said he wantedall regulations lifted by the end of September. The five-party executive will meet tomorrow to discuss the remaining restrictions. Hospitality businesses have been calling on ministers to agree to remove restrictions such as social distancing and table service requirements, which they say have damaged trade. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland also remain closed, unlike in the rest of the UK. Other parties have not stated yet if they support ending restrictions by the end of next month. Sinn Fein's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who has just revealed she's tested positive - previously said the executive needed to remain ""cautious"", while the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it was ""naÃ¯ve"" to set a date in place.

People in poorer areas of Scotland are likely to have 20 fewer healthy years than those in wealthy areas The pandemic may havewidened the gap in mortality rates between the wealthy and the poor in Scotland, a report by the National Records of Scotland suggests. Last year, death rates in deprived areas were almost double those in rich areas, with the poorest also expected to have 20 fewer years of good health than the most affluent. While the general mortality rate was 1.9 times higher in deprived areas, for Covid-19 deaths, the rate was 2.4 times higher among poor communities. ""Mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas,"" the report says, adding that ""Covid-19 appears to be increasing this effect"". The health service in England is experiencing ""winter-like pressures"", the Society of Acute Medicine is warning. Medics from the organisation, which represents doctors working in the field of acute medicine, say doctors are treating ""vast numbers"" of people with non-Covid illnesses as well as many attending hospital with severe coronavirus symptoms. Dr Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, says many patients are suffering from illnesses typically seen in winter such as respiratory infections - particularly in children. ""I think it is fair to say we are currently facing an unprecedented summer workload that feels more like the worst winter pressures most of us can recall,"" says Dr Scriven. ""We are seeing vast numbers of patients with non-Covid illness alongside the steady admission rates of those still very poorly with Covid. ""We are also noticing frailer people who have deconditioned over lockdowns so that any illness that previously might have been fairly minor now need an extended stay in hospital with periods of rehabilitation."" Acute medicine deals with the immediate and early treatment of adult patients with a variety of medical conditions who present to hospital as emergencies. The NHS is facing a huge backlog of care which has been exacerbated by the pandemic.A record 5.45 million people are waiting for carein England alone. Fully vaccinated UK travellers going to Italy no longer have to quarantine for five days on arrival. A new rule has come into force in Italy, ending the five-day quarantine - as long as travellers have a negative coronavirus test and they received their second jab at least 14 days prior to arriving. Rome had re-imposed the quarantine from 21 June as the Delta variant spread rapidly across the UK. Since early August, Italy has required proof of vaccination, recent recovery from coronavirus or a negative test for people wanting to dine indoors or enter museums and sports events. Italy is currently on the UK's amber travel list, which means those coming back to the UK must take a test three days before travelling and a PCR test two days after arriving. Read more about the UK's travel ruleshere. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says she has has contracted Covid-19. The Sinn Fein politician says on Twitter she is self-isolating but hopes to return to public duties next week. âI have contracted Covid-19. I am thankful to have had two doses of the vaccine,""she says.,external Read more here. Misinformation has led to growing numbers of young, unvaccinated Covid patients in Wales' hospitals, a critical care consultant says.. Dr Ami Jones says Aneurin Bevan health board staff felt ""demoralised"" to see the virus filling wards and intensive care units again. She says acute hospitals, emergency departments and respiratory medicine have experienced a ""much busier weekend this weekend than we've seen for months in terms of Covid"". ""It's predominantly unvaccinated people we're seeing and a number of these are people in their 20s and 30s, with a small number of under-16s requiring hospital care for Covid,"" Dr Jones says. Vaccination has made a huge difference in numbers requiring hospital treatment, she says, adding ""we have people in our ITU who are very poorly right now who didn't get vaccinated but now wish for nothing more than to be able to turn back the clock and get their vaccine"". ""The staff are feeling pretty demoralised that Covid is once again filling their wards and their ITUs, especially when so many hospital cases could've been prevented by vaccination. ""It's always heart-breaking to treat patients with avoidable conditions but this time feels different asthere's been so much misinformation out thereit's made it very tough for people to know who to believe and who to trust. ""But ask any front-line worker and they will tell you that vaccination is what's making a difference to the patients we are treating at the moment."" Read the full storyhere. Older people should be prioritised for booster jabs, one expert said The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Immunisation and Vaccination, are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The NHS is poised to deliver a third jab to 30 million over-50s and people with conditions that make them clinically vulnerable, if it gets the green light. Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia says a widespread booster campaign may not be needed as the vaccines are still effective at preventing serious disease in many people. But he's told the PA news agency the boosters should be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. âThe evidence is that these people wonât have responded that well to vaccine,"" says Prof Hunter. âAs far as Iâm concerned there is no debate whatsoever about that group, they should be boosted and they should be boosted pretty soon."" Although protection for other groups will be waning, he says the vaccines will ""hopefully"" prevent serious illness for several years. He also says Covid-19 is approaching the ""endemic equilibrium"", the number of cases we should expect to see per day forever. In other coronaviruses that have been circulating for many years in humans, this is about 45,000 cases a day, Prof Hunter says. But he says because of widespread immunity, the serious illness of Covid-19 will be ""consigned to history"", except for occasional cases. In most pandemics, the professor says this takes about three years. Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Monica Kerwin says governments have failed Aboriginal people ""I am angry. The government did nothing to protect us. They sit in their ivory towers and make decisions on Aboriginal issues."" Monica Kerwin is a Barkindji (First Nation) mother-of-six who lives in Wilcannia, in outback New South Wales, Australia. Her remote town of about 750 people is at the centre of a growing Covid outbreak that has brought to the fore how vulnerable Australia's indigenous people are to the virus. For most of the pandemic, outbreaks in Australia have mainly hit cities and spared remote areas. But as the Delta variant has spread from Sydney to western New South Wales and elsewhere, Aboriginal communities are seeing Covid infections for the first time. ""We're on edge. The [indigenous] population is just not prepared for this pandemic,"" says Dr Chaitanya Kada, a doctor based in Lightning Ridge, another outback town. Infections have surged in the remote town of Wilcannia The town's outbreak started at a funeral on 13 August that was attended by more than 100 people, some from other regional areas. It did not breach any public health orders because Wilcannia was not in lockdown at the time. Health authorities remain worried, however, that those mourners could have unintentionally infected people in other communities. The situation has infuriated locals. Monica says she and others had previously asked authorities to seal off Wilcannia to keep it safe. ""We were watching what was happening in other communities. We were watching it [the virus] getting closer,"" she says. ""We've been crying out for prevention. No one listened to us."" Read the full storyhere. Manufacturer Becton Dickinson has announced it will deliver nine million additional blood test tubes to the NHS this week for immediate distribution. Manufacturers have seen record demand for the vials in recent months,caused in part by the need for tests for Covid patients. The NHS in England and Wales has temporarily stopped all non-urgent testing. In a statement, Becton Dickinson says it has received exceptional use authorisation to import BD blood tubes into the UK that are approved for use in other regions of the world, such as the US. Becton Dickinson says it has increased production capacity in the UK by 20% to ""help alleviate the backlog of orders"".  Â© 2025 BBC.

"The NHS in England is experiencing ""winter-like pressures"" and an unprecedented summer workload, the Society of Acute Medicine warns Doctors are treating ""vast numbers"" of people with non-Covid illnesses and many in hospital with severe coronavirus symptoms, it says Many patients have illnesses typically seen in winter such as respiratory infections, Dr Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the society says Booster vaccines should be given soon to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable, Prof Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia says ""It is still very much our intention to roll out the booster programme during September,"" says the prime minister's spokesman Head teachers tell the BBC many pupils want to be vaccinated and ""sensible"" Covid safety measures are being kept in place British business confidence is at its highest since April 2017 amid hopes of a strong recovery, a survey suggests Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has contracted coronavirus Edited by James Clarke That's all from us for today - the updates have been brought to you by Joseph Lee, Katie Wright, Emma Owen and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. Weâll shortly be bringing the live page to a close, hereâs a
round up of the dayâs main headlines: People queue for a coronavirus vaccine in New Delhi, India, earlier today Earlier, we reported that Slovakia has formally ended using Russia's Sputnik V vaccine today, due to a lack of interest. However, Sputnik's manufacturer, Russian Direct Investment Fund, has denied that Slovakia returned some of the doses. The company says Slovakia had used up all the Sputnik V vaccines ""from the batch delivered to the country early this year"" and no additional deliveries were planned as part of the contract. A statement says: ""In Slovakia, Sputnik
V faced a disinformation campaign connected to political struggle between different
groups within the government, even though the efficacy and safety of the Russian
vaccine have been confirmed during clinical trials and real-world use around
the globe. ""It is also worth noting that in Hungary, where over a million
people got vaccinated with Sputnik V during mass vaccination campaign, the
demand for the Russian vaccine exceeded the amount of actual deliveries to the
country."" Health Minister Stephen Donnelly leaves the cabinet meeting at Dublin Castle The Irish Cabinet has agreed on a plan that will effectively end most Covid-19 restrictions by 22 October. The government says the easing of rules is dependent on 90% of adults being vaccinated and Covid-19 cases remaining manageable. From 6 September - next Monday - large crowds will be allowed to gather in the Republic of Ireland for religious ceremonies. Places of worship and outdoor sporting venues will also be allowed to hold 50% capacity from that date. Indoor venues will be allowed to have 60% capacity for events for people who are vaccinated, while outdoor venues can hold 75% capacity for vaccinated people. You can read more about the announcement here. Some 66,648 people received a second dose of a Covid vaccine in the UK on Monday â the lowest number since 21 June. Around 42.8 million people have now had a second dose â thatâs
78.7% of people aged 16 and over. The UK also reported another 19,643 people have had a first
dose of a vaccine â the first time it's dropped below 20,000 since 18 July. The UK has reported another 32,181 daily coronavirus cases,
and a further 50 deaths within 28 deaths of a positive test. The latest government statistics,externalalso show the number of Covid
patients in hospital has passed 7,000 for the first time since 15 March, with
7,015 reported to be in hospital according to the most recent figure. Members of the British Press Photographers' Association are showing off their best work, at the Bargehouse gallery, central London, in an exhibition delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the images from the exhibition, which features the best 100 photographs, capture how the pandemic has affected people's lives. A cyclist stops in the middle of an almost deserted Westminster Bridge to take a photograph, at 13:15, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson had announced the UK would lock down to fight Covid-19, on 24 March 2020 With swimming pools closed because of the pandemic, triathlete Lloyd Bebbington trains in his garden, in April 2020 Queen Elizabeth II takes her seat in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, for the socially-distanced funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh, who died aged 99, in April A funeral is held outside the London home of a 40-year old man who died suddenly from suspected Covid-19, in June 2020 The government still intends to roll out a Covid-19 booster programme in England from September, the prime minister's official spokesman has said. The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The PM's official spokesman says: ""We are still awaiting the final advice from JCVI on boosters. ""It is still very much our intention to roll out the booster programme during September."" Earlier, we reported comments from Prof Paul Hunter, who called for boosters to be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. The PM's spokesman also says it is still the plan to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September. ""We set out broadly our intention to require our vaccination for nightclubs and some other settings and we'll be coming forward in the coming weeks with details for that,"" he adds. The monitors can give a warning when classrooms are not ventilated enough As the Welsh government announces Â£6m to provide CO2 monitors and ozone disinfecting machines in schools,doctors are welcoming the move. The monitors detect the build-up of carbon dioxide, which comes from people exhaling, offering a measure of how much fresh air is in the room. Dr Rhys Thomas, a consultant at Glangwili Hospital, says they are the ""canaries in the coal mine"" that give advanced warning of the risk of spreading Covid-19. ""It's the air that infects you, not surfaces. It's breathing in somebody else's air that'll do it,"" he says. ""Delta is far more infectious and dangerous, and transfers more readily in the air."" Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP from Nefyn, Gwynedd, and a member of the Fresh Air campaign, says he is ""really pleased"" the Welsh government is taking the importance of ventilation seriously. Scotland has already deployed CO2 monitors and England is also providing 300,000 of them for the autumn term. The Welsh government cautioned that its ozone machines, designed by Swansea University, are only intended to disinfect empty spaces after an outbreak, not to continuously filter the air in occupied classrooms. This Post Office branch in Neston, Cheshire, has been forced to close More than 250 Post Office branches that closed due to Covid-19 in the UK had not reopened by the time lockdown restrictions were lifted in June, it has been revealed. Figures seen by the BBC show 1,183 UK branches had been shut for a month or more since March 2020, but 260 had not reopened by 30 June this year. The Post Office says the pandemic had ""impacted our ability"" to open. Post Offices were permitted to remain open throughout coronavirus lockdowns in all four UK nations, but wider restrictions forced surrounding businesses to close and bans on most foreign travel impacted the viability of many branches. Brian and Joanne Young ran a branch in Neston, Cheshire, until they announced in June they could no longer afford to keep it open. Brian says the branch had ""lost a lot of footfall during the pandemic"" due to businesses that needed banking services closing, while losing transactions ""like travel money and travel insurance, which give us a form of income on commission"", also had an impact. ""All our overheads stayed the same and unfortunately, we suffered a big loss on the shop and we couldn't afford to sustain it any more,"" he adds. Read the full storyhere. Kieffer Moore has scored six goals in 21 appearances for Wales, including one at Euro 2020 A positive Covid-19 test for reserve goalkeeper Adam Daviesmeans he and striker Kieffer Moore will miss Wales's three upcoming games. Moore was identified as a close contact of Davies after he tested positive and the Football Association of Wales said both players would be self-isolating for 10 days. It means they will be unable to play in the friendly against Finland on Wednesday, or the two World Cup qualifiers against Belarus and Estonia. A further five players are out of action due to injury. The Stormont executive must now ""set out a path"" for ending Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons says. ""We need to start moving on these issues, we have to take into account the impact on the economy, the health service and society more generally,"" he tells BBC News NI. First Minister Paul Givan previously said he wantedall regulations lifted by the end of September. The five-party executive will meet tomorrow to discuss the remaining restrictions. Hospitality businesses have been calling on ministers to agree to remove restrictions such as social distancing and table service requirements, which they say have damaged trade. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland also remain closed, unlike in the rest of the UK. Other parties have not stated yet if they support ending restrictions by the end of next month. Sinn Fein's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who has just revealed she's tested positive - previously said the executive needed to remain ""cautious"", while the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it was ""naÃ¯ve"" to set a date in place.

People in poorer areas of Scotland are likely to have 20 fewer healthy years than those in wealthy areas The pandemic may havewidened the gap in mortality rates between the wealthy and the poor in Scotland, a report by the National Records of Scotland suggests. Last year, death rates in deprived areas were almost double those in rich areas, with the poorest also expected to have 20 fewer years of good health than the most affluent. While the general mortality rate was 1.9 times higher in deprived areas, for Covid-19 deaths, the rate was 2.4 times higher among poor communities. ""Mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas,"" the report says, adding that ""Covid-19 appears to be increasing this effect"". The health service in England is experiencing ""winter-like pressures"", the Society of Acute Medicine is warning. Medics from the organisation, which represents doctors working in the field of acute medicine, say doctors are treating ""vast numbers"" of people with non-Covid illnesses as well as many attending hospital with severe coronavirus symptoms. Dr Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, says many patients are suffering from illnesses typically seen in winter such as respiratory infections - particularly in children. ""I think it is fair to say we are currently facing an unprecedented summer workload that feels more like the worst winter pressures most of us can recall,"" says Dr Scriven. ""We are seeing vast numbers of patients with non-Covid illness alongside the steady admission rates of those still very poorly with Covid. ""We are also noticing frailer people who have deconditioned over lockdowns so that any illness that previously might have been fairly minor now need an extended stay in hospital with periods of rehabilitation."" Acute medicine deals with the immediate and early treatment of adult patients with a variety of medical conditions who present to hospital as emergencies. The NHS is facing a huge backlog of care which has been exacerbated by the pandemic.A record 5.45 million people are waiting for carein England alone. Fully vaccinated UK travellers going to Italy no longer have to quarantine for five days on arrival. A new rule has come into force in Italy, ending the five-day quarantine - as long as travellers have a negative coronavirus test and they received their second jab at least 14 days prior to arriving. Rome had re-imposed the quarantine from 21 June as the Delta variant spread rapidly across the UK. Since early August, Italy has required proof of vaccination, recent recovery from coronavirus or a negative test for people wanting to dine indoors or enter museums and sports events. Italy is currently on the UK's amber travel list, which means those coming back to the UK must take a test three days before travelling and a PCR test two days after arriving. Read more about the UK's travel ruleshere. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says she has has contracted Covid-19. The Sinn Fein politician says on Twitter she is self-isolating but hopes to return to public duties next week. âI have contracted Covid-19. I am thankful to have had two doses of the vaccine,""she says.,external Read more here. Misinformation has led to growing numbers of young, unvaccinated Covid patients in Wales' hospitals, a critical care consultant says.. Dr Ami Jones says Aneurin Bevan health board staff felt ""demoralised"" to see the virus filling wards and intensive care units again. She says acute hospitals, emergency departments and respiratory medicine have experienced a ""much busier weekend this weekend than we've seen for months in terms of Covid"". ""It's predominantly unvaccinated people we're seeing and a number of these are people in their 20s and 30s, with a small number of under-16s requiring hospital care for Covid,"" Dr Jones says. Vaccination has made a huge difference in numbers requiring hospital treatment, she says, adding ""we have people in our ITU who are very poorly right now who didn't get vaccinated but now wish for nothing more than to be able to turn back the clock and get their vaccine"". ""The staff are feeling pretty demoralised that Covid is once again filling their wards and their ITUs, especially when so many hospital cases could've been prevented by vaccination. ""It's always heart-breaking to treat patients with avoidable conditions but this time feels different asthere's been so much misinformation out thereit's made it very tough for people to know who to believe and who to trust. ""But ask any front-line worker and they will tell you that vaccination is what's making a difference to the patients we are treating at the moment."" Read the full storyhere. Older people should be prioritised for booster jabs, one expert said The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Immunisation and Vaccination, are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The NHS is poised to deliver a third jab to 30 million over-50s and people with conditions that make them clinically vulnerable, if it gets the green light. Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia says a widespread booster campaign may not be needed as the vaccines are still effective at preventing serious disease in many people. But he's told the PA news agency the boosters should be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. âThe evidence is that these people wonât have responded that well to vaccine,"" says Prof Hunter. âAs far as Iâm concerned there is no debate whatsoever about that group, they should be boosted and they should be boosted pretty soon."" Although protection for other groups will be waning, he says the vaccines will ""hopefully"" prevent serious illness for several years. He also says Covid-19 is approaching the ""endemic equilibrium"", the number of cases we should expect to see per day forever. In other coronaviruses that have been circulating for many years in humans, this is about 45,000 cases a day, Prof Hunter says. But he says because of widespread immunity, the serious illness of Covid-19 will be ""consigned to history"", except for occasional cases. In most pandemics, the professor says this takes about three years. Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Monica Kerwin says governments have failed Aboriginal people ""I am angry. The government did nothing to protect us. They sit in their ivory towers and make decisions on Aboriginal issues."" Monica Kerwin is a Barkindji (First Nation) mother-of-six who lives in Wilcannia, in outback New South Wales, Australia. Her remote town of about 750 people is at the centre of a growing Covid outbreak that has brought to the fore how vulnerable Australia's indigenous people are to the virus. For most of the pandemic, outbreaks in Australia have mainly hit cities and spared remote areas. But as the Delta variant has spread from Sydney to western New South Wales and elsewhere, Aboriginal communities are seeing Covid infections for the first time. ""We're on edge. The [indigenous] population is just not prepared for this pandemic,"" says Dr Chaitanya Kada, a doctor based in Lightning Ridge, another outback town. Infections have surged in the remote town of Wilcannia The town's outbreak started at a funeral on 13 August that was attended by more than 100 people, some from other regional areas. It did not breach any public health orders because Wilcannia was not in lockdown at the time. Health authorities remain worried, however, that those mourners could have unintentionally infected people in other communities. The situation has infuriated locals. Monica says she and others had previously asked authorities to seal off Wilcannia to keep it safe. ""We were watching what was happening in other communities. We were watching it [the virus] getting closer,"" she says. ""We've been crying out for prevention. No one listened to us."" Read the full storyhere. Manufacturer Becton Dickinson has announced it will deliver nine million additional blood test tubes to the NHS this week for immediate distribution. Manufacturers have seen record demand for the vials in recent months,caused in part by the need for tests for Covid patients. The NHS in England and Wales has temporarily stopped all non-urgent testing. In a statement, Becton Dickinson says it has received exceptional use authorisation to import BD blood tubes into the UK that are approved for use in other regions of the world, such as the US.

"Wales' all-time leading try-scorer Shane Williams made a BBC documentary exploring concussion in 2020 After just one season of rugby players at a professional team saw a decline in both blood flow to the brain and cognitive function, a new study claims The University of South Wales research followed a professional rugby team over the course of a season, testing players pre-season, mid-season and post season. It will be published in Wednesday's September edition of the Journal of Experimental Physiology. Researchers followed a team which plays in the United Rugby Championship. They say more research is needed on the long-term effects. Their study, seen exclusively by the BBC, has found that over just one season a team of professional rugby players saw a decline in blood flow to the brain and cognitive function - the ability to reason, remember, formulate ideas and perform mental gymnastics. The paper also suggests that rather than only concussions, repetitive contacts, or sub concussions, sustained through rugby have caused the declines seen in the players. Steve Thompson in group of ex-rugby union internationals to sue for brain damage World Rugby 'stands with' former players in new welfare plan Rugby 'should follow NFL' to reduce brain injury risk Concussion in sport: Saliva test is 94% accurate in rugby union trial Former Lions and Wales player Shane Williams suffered head injuries himself while playing, and says the risk of a player getting injured increases when they are tired. He has joined calls for a limit on replacements, because fresher players coming on to the pitch could cause more damage. This new study comes as 200 former players - Welsh and English, male and female, professional and amateur - havebegun legal actionin tandem with Rylands Law firm, against the game's governing bodies World Rugby, the Welsh Rugby Union and Rugby Football Union. Some of those former players have been diagnosed with early onset dementia, and they claim the authorities failed to protect them from the risk caused by concussions and head impacts. World Rugby says it welcomes new research, adding: ""World Rugby recently committed to double our investment in player welfare and new concussion research and initiatives."" Former Wales international Shane Williams Former Wales winger Williams took some big hits and head impacts that affected him in his career, none more so than in a thumping but legal tackle by South Africa's Bakkies Botha in 2004. ""It wasn't until I got back to the hotel several hours later that I realised I wasn't very well,"" he told the BBC. ""That was one of the biggest hits I've ever taken really, I think. ""It was a blur getting changed afterwards - seeing the players, seeing family members in the stadium afterwards, I don't remember - it was almost like I'd blacked out for a couple of hours and the next thing I'm in the hotel again sat in the reception thinking: 'Gosh what happened there?'"" When considering the impacts he's taken over the years, Williams has questioned whether his brain has been affected by the game. ""I'm always questioning: Has my memory deteriorated because of my age? I'm forever writing things down anyway - is that because of my age? Or is it because I've taken hits over the years?"" he said. Head Injury Assessments, or HIA protocols, which now are commonplace on the field of play and are there to help decipher whether a player has had a concussion, did not come into force until 2015. Williams feels if the same incident in 2004 happened now - and knowing what he now knows - he would have taken himself off the field. ""I think a big part of it is education - if I'd have been hit like that today I'd have known straight away that something wasn't right,"" he said. ""People still ask 'would I have changed the way I played, would I have not played?' I wouldn't have, because I played a game that I absolutely loved."" Professor Damian Bailey is one of the report's authors Some studies suggest professional rugby players may be exposed to 11,000 contact events per season, and more research is beginning to show evidence that it may not be concussions alone that could impact the brain, but the cumulative effect and volume of contact events too. The peer reviewed University of South Wales study, which is funded by the Royal Society Wolfson Research Fellowship, recorded six concussion incidents among all the players that took part over the course of the year. However, all of those involved in the study saw a decline in blood flow to the brain and cognitive function between pre and post-season results. The team involved plays in the United Rugby Championship - formerly the Pro14 - and has not been named to maintain confidentiality in accordance with research governance guidelines. Professor Damian Bailey, one of the authors of the study, said: ""Even over a short period we're seeing from the rugby players a greater rate of decline in brain function. ""And we're assuming our baseline is a normal healthy baseline but many of these players have already had many years playing the game, so that baseline is probably still impaired."" Further findings include a correlation between an increase in contact amount, playing position and rate of decline on the main measures tested. ""Because the forwards are involved in more contact, as one would expect, we're seeing a greater degree of impairment relative to the backs,"" Prof Bailey explained. This paper focuses on one squad of professional players over the course of one season, so can any comparisons be drawn between the professional level and at grassroots? Prof Bailey says professional players have less opportunity to recover and repair, much bigger physiques, and potentially bigger impacts as a result of contact, but amateurs may have arguably poorer technique and be putting themselves at risk because of that. ""The bigger question and what's really motivating this research is to then look into the future, to have a snapshot of what are the long-term consequences of this reoccurring contact,"" he said. ""We have every reason to believe that the damaging effects could be cumulative over time."" The university team are also working on a similar study, comparing current players and retired players against a control group to determine whether there is a faster rate of decline in brain function in rugby players. They say more research is needed on the long term effects of such a decline. According to the RFU, 20% of all concussions at a professional level occur in training. In American football's NFL in the United States, measures have been put into place to limit the amount of contact during training and between training sessions, something that has been called for by a number of former rugby players. However, others such as Williams say it is difficult to put a cap on contact in training as practising good technique also reduces injuries. Recently a group of former players called for replacements to only be used if players are injured, something Williams also believes could be of benefit, along with education. ""I do believe the game has changed when it comes to the 'finishers' [replacements],"" he said. ""You've got 21-stone players coming on to the field when players are tired and you get injured more when you're tired. ""But another main thing for me is educating the players so that they know when they do have these injuries."" The sport's governing body, World Rugby, says research is ongoing looking at the specific issue of replacements and injury. Players are given Head Injury Assessments to check for concussion In a statement responding to the University of South Wales research, the sport's governing body World Rugby said: ""World Rugby welcomes all research that can inform and support ourrecently launched strategy,externalto cement rugby as the most progressive sport on player welfare. ""It is at the heart of everything that we say and do as a sport. ""World Rugby recently committed to double our investment in player welfare and new concussion research and initiatives. ""We are currently undertaking a wide-ranging evaluation of contact training volume across the game and look forward to the results of the ongoing Otago Rugby Community Head Impact Detection study using instrumented mouthguards, which is the largest study of playing and training head impacts in men's and women's community rugby."" The body added that the Otago study is due for completion imminently.

Players are given Head Injury Assessments to check for concussion In a statement responding to the University of South Wales research, the sport's governing body World Rugby said: ""World Rugby welcomes all research that can inform and support ourrecently launched strategy,externalto cement rugby as the most progressive sport on player welfare. ""It is at the heart of everything that we say and do as a sport. ""World Rugby recently committed to double our investment in player welfare and new concussion research and initiatives. ""We are currently undertaking a wide-ranging evaluation of contact training volume across the game and look forward to the results of the ongoing Otago Rugby Community Head Impact Detection study using instrumented mouthguards, which is the largest study of playing and training head impacts in men's and women's community rugby."" The body added that the Otago study is due for completion imminently.

"The NHS in England is experiencing ""winter-like pressures"" and an unprecedented summer workload, the Society of Acute Medicine warns Doctors are treating ""vast numbers"" of people with non-Covid illnesses and many in hospital with severe coronavirus symptoms, it says Many patients have illnesses typically seen in winter such as respiratory infections, Dr Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the society says Booster vaccines should be given soon to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable, Prof Paul Hunter of the University of East Anglia says ""It is still very much our intention to roll out the booster programme during September,"" says the prime minister's spokesman Head teachers tell the BBC many pupils want to be vaccinated and ""sensible"" Covid safety measures are being kept in place British business confidence is at its highest since April 2017 amid hopes of a strong recovery, a survey suggests Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has contracted coronavirus Edited by James Clarke That's all from us for today - the updates have been brought to you by Joseph Lee, Katie Wright, Emma Owen and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. Weâll shortly be bringing the live page to a close, hereâs a
round up of the dayâs main headlines: People queue for a coronavirus vaccine in New Delhi, India, earlier today Earlier, we reported that Slovakia has formally ended using Russia's Sputnik V vaccine today, due to a lack of interest. However, Sputnik's manufacturer, Russian Direct Investment Fund, has denied that Slovakia returned some of the doses. The company says Slovakia had used up all the Sputnik V vaccines ""from the batch delivered to the country early this year"" and no additional deliveries were planned as part of the contract. A statement says: ""In Slovakia, Sputnik
V faced a disinformation campaign connected to political struggle between different
groups within the government, even though the efficacy and safety of the Russian
vaccine have been confirmed during clinical trials and real-world use around
the globe. ""It is also worth noting that in Hungary, where over a million
people got vaccinated with Sputnik V during mass vaccination campaign, the
demand for the Russian vaccine exceeded the amount of actual deliveries to the
country."" Health Minister Stephen Donnelly leaves the cabinet meeting at Dublin Castle The Irish Cabinet has agreed on a plan that will effectively end most Covid-19 restrictions by 22 October. The government says the easing of rules is dependent on 90% of adults being vaccinated and Covid-19 cases remaining manageable. From 6 September - next Monday - large crowds will be allowed to gather in the Republic of Ireland for religious ceremonies. Places of worship and outdoor sporting venues will also be allowed to hold 50% capacity from that date. Indoor venues will be allowed to have 60% capacity for events for people who are vaccinated, while outdoor venues can hold 75% capacity for vaccinated people. You can read more about the announcement here. Some 66,648 people received a second dose of a Covid vaccine in the UK on Monday â the lowest number since 21 June. Around 42.8 million people have now had a second dose â thatâs
78.7% of people aged 16 and over. The UK also reported another 19,643 people have had a first
dose of a vaccine â the first time it's dropped below 20,000 since 18 July. The UK has reported another 32,181 daily coronavirus cases,
and a further 50 deaths within 28 deaths of a positive test. The latest government statistics,externalalso show the number of Covid
patients in hospital has passed 7,000 for the first time since 15 March, with
7,015 reported to be in hospital according to the most recent figure. Members of the British Press Photographers' Association are showing off their best work, at the Bargehouse gallery, central London, in an exhibition delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the images from the exhibition, which features the best 100 photographs, capture how the pandemic has affected people's lives. A cyclist stops in the middle of an almost deserted Westminster Bridge to take a photograph, at 13:15, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson had announced the UK would lock down to fight Covid-19, on 24 March 2020 With swimming pools closed because of the pandemic, triathlete Lloyd Bebbington trains in his garden, in April 2020 Queen Elizabeth II takes her seat in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, for the socially-distanced funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh, who died aged 99, in April A funeral is held outside the London home of a 40-year old man who died suddenly from suspected Covid-19, in June 2020 The government still intends to roll out a Covid-19 booster programme in England from September, the prime minister's official spokesman has said. The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The PM's official spokesman says: ""We are still awaiting the final advice from JCVI on boosters. ""It is still very much our intention to roll out the booster programme during September."" Earlier, we reported comments from Prof Paul Hunter, who called for boosters to be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. The PM's spokesman also says it is still the plan to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September. ""We set out broadly our intention to require our vaccination for nightclubs and some other settings and we'll be coming forward in the coming weeks with details for that,"" he adds. The monitors can give a warning when classrooms are not ventilated enough As the Welsh government announces Â£6m to provide CO2 monitors and ozone disinfecting machines in schools,doctors are welcoming the move. The monitors detect the build-up of carbon dioxide, which comes from people exhaling, offering a measure of how much fresh air is in the room. Dr Rhys Thomas, a consultant at Glangwili Hospital, says they are the ""canaries in the coal mine"" that give advanced warning of the risk of spreading Covid-19. ""It's the air that infects you, not surfaces. It's breathing in somebody else's air that'll do it,"" he says. ""Delta is far more infectious and dangerous, and transfers more readily in the air."" Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP from Nefyn, Gwynedd, and a member of the Fresh Air campaign, says he is ""really pleased"" the Welsh government is taking the importance of ventilation seriously. Scotland has already deployed CO2 monitors and England is also providing 300,000 of them for the autumn term. The Welsh government cautioned that its ozone machines, designed by Swansea University, are only intended to disinfect empty spaces after an outbreak, not to continuously filter the air in occupied classrooms. This Post Office branch in Neston, Cheshire, has been forced to close More than 250 Post Office branches that closed due to Covid-19 in the UK had not reopened by the time lockdown restrictions were lifted in June, it has been revealed. Figures seen by the BBC show 1,183 UK branches had been shut for a month or more since March 2020, but 260 had not reopened by 30 June this year. The Post Office says the pandemic had ""impacted our ability"" to open. Post Offices were permitted to remain open throughout coronavirus lockdowns in all four UK nations, but wider restrictions forced surrounding businesses to close and bans on most foreign travel impacted the viability of many branches. Brian and Joanne Young ran a branch in Neston, Cheshire, until they announced in June they could no longer afford to keep it open. Brian says the branch had ""lost a lot of footfall during the pandemic"" due to businesses that needed banking services closing, while losing transactions ""like travel money and travel insurance, which give us a form of income on commission"", also had an impact. ""All our overheads stayed the same and unfortunately, we suffered a big loss on the shop and we couldn't afford to sustain it any more,"" he adds. Read the full storyhere. Kieffer Moore has scored six goals in 21 appearances for Wales, including one at Euro 2020 A positive Covid-19 test for reserve goalkeeper Adam Daviesmeans he and striker Kieffer Moore will miss Wales's three upcoming games. Moore was identified as a close contact of Davies after he tested positive and the Football Association of Wales said both players would be self-isolating for 10 days. It means they will be unable to play in the friendly against Finland on Wednesday, or the two World Cup qualifiers against Belarus and Estonia. A further five players are out of action due to injury. The Stormont executive must now ""set out a path"" for ending Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons says. ""We need to start moving on these issues, we have to take into account the impact on the economy, the health service and society more generally,"" he tells BBC News NI. First Minister Paul Givan previously said he wantedall regulations lifted by the end of September. The five-party executive will meet tomorrow to discuss the remaining restrictions. Hospitality businesses have been calling on ministers to agree to remove restrictions such as social distancing and table service requirements, which they say have damaged trade. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland also remain closed, unlike in the rest of the UK. Other parties have not stated yet if they support ending restrictions by the end of next month. Sinn Fein's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who has just revealed she's tested positive - previously said the executive needed to remain ""cautious"", while the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it was ""naÃ¯ve"" to set a date in place.

People in poorer areas of Scotland are likely to have 20 fewer healthy years than those in wealthy areas The pandemic may havewidened the gap in mortality rates between the wealthy and the poor in Scotland, a report by the National Records of Scotland suggests. Last year, death rates in deprived areas were almost double those in rich areas, with the poorest also expected to have 20 fewer years of good health than the most affluent. While the general mortality rate was 1.9 times higher in deprived areas, for Covid-19 deaths, the rate was 2.4 times higher among poor communities. ""Mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas,"" the report says, adding that ""Covid-19 appears to be increasing this effect"". The health service in England is experiencing ""winter-like pressures"", the Society of Acute Medicine is warning. Medics from the organisation, which represents doctors working in the field of acute medicine, say doctors are treating ""vast numbers"" of people with non-Covid illnesses as well as many attending hospital with severe coronavirus symptoms. Dr Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, says many patients are suffering from illnesses typically seen in winter such as respiratory infections - particularly in children. ""I think it is fair to say we are currently facing an unprecedented summer workload that feels more like the worst winter pressures most of us can recall,"" says Dr Scriven. ""We are seeing vast numbers of patients with non-Covid illness alongside the steady admission rates of those still very poorly with Covid. ""We are also noticing frailer people who have deconditioned over lockdowns so that any illness that previously might have been fairly minor now need an extended stay in hospital with periods of rehabilitation."" Acute medicine deals with the immediate and early treatment of adult patients with a variety of medical conditions who present to hospital as emergencies. The NHS is facing a huge backlog of care which has been exacerbated by the pandemic.A record 5.45 million people are waiting for carein England alone. Fully vaccinated UK travellers going to Italy no longer have to quarantine for five days on arrival. A new rule has come into force in Italy, ending the five-day quarantine - as long as travellers have a negative coronavirus test and they received their second jab at least 14 days prior to arriving. Rome had re-imposed the quarantine from 21 June as the Delta variant spread rapidly across the UK. Since early August, Italy has required proof of vaccination, recent recovery from coronavirus or a negative test for people wanting to dine indoors or enter museums and sports events. Italy is currently on the UK's amber travel list, which means those coming back to the UK must take a test three days before travelling and a PCR test two days after arriving. Read more about the UK's travel ruleshere. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says she has has contracted Covid-19. The Sinn Fein politician says on Twitter she is self-isolating but hopes to return to public duties next week. âI have contracted Covid-19. I am thankful to have had two doses of the vaccine,""she says.,external Read more here. Misinformation has led to growing numbers of young, unvaccinated Covid patients in Wales' hospitals, a critical care consultant says.. Dr Ami Jones says Aneurin Bevan health board staff felt ""demoralised"" to see the virus filling wards and intensive care units again. She says acute hospitals, emergency departments and respiratory medicine have experienced a ""much busier weekend this weekend than we've seen for months in terms of Covid"". ""It's predominantly unvaccinated people we're seeing and a number of these are people in their 20s and 30s, with a small number of under-16s requiring hospital care for Covid,"" Dr Jones says. Vaccination has made a huge difference in numbers requiring hospital treatment, she says, adding ""we have people in our ITU who are very poorly right now who didn't get vaccinated but now wish for nothing more than to be able to turn back the clock and get their vaccine"". ""The staff are feeling pretty demoralised that Covid is once again filling their wards and their ITUs, especially when so many hospital cases could've been prevented by vaccination. ""It's always heart-breaking to treat patients with avoidable conditions but this time feels different asthere's been so much misinformation out thereit's made it very tough for people to know who to believe and who to trust. ""But ask any front-line worker and they will tell you that vaccination is what's making a difference to the patients we are treating at the moment."" Read the full storyhere. Older people should be prioritised for booster jabs, one expert said The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Immunisation and Vaccination, are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The NHS is poised to deliver a third jab to 30 million over-50s and people with conditions that make them clinically vulnerable, if it gets the green light. Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia says a widespread booster campaign may not be needed as the vaccines are still effective at preventing serious disease in many people. But he's told the PA news agency the boosters should be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. âThe evidence is that these people wonât have responded that well to vaccine,"" says Prof Hunter. âAs far as Iâm concerned there is no debate whatsoever about that group, they should be boosted and they should be boosted pretty soon."" Although protection for other groups will be waning, he says the vaccines will ""hopefully"" prevent serious illness for several years. He also says Covid-19 is approaching the ""endemic equilibrium"", the number of cases we should expect to see per day forever. In other coronaviruses that have been circulating for many years in humans, this is about 45,000 cases a day, Prof Hunter says. But he says because of widespread immunity, the serious illness of Covid-19 will be ""consigned to history"", except for occasional cases. In most pandemics, the professor says this takes about three years. Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Monica Kerwin says governments have failed Aboriginal people ""I am angry. The government did nothing to protect us. They sit in their ivory towers and make decisions on Aboriginal issues."" Monica Kerwin is a Barkindji (First Nation) mother-of-six who lives in Wilcannia, in outback New South Wales, Australia. Her remote town of about 750 people is at the centre of a growing Covid outbreak that has brought to the fore how vulnerable Australia's indigenous people are to the virus. For most of the pandemic, outbreaks in Australia have mainly hit cities and spared remote areas. But as the Delta variant has spread from Sydney to western New South Wales and elsewhere, Aboriginal communities are seeing Covid infections for the first time. ""We're on edge. The [indigenous] population is just not prepared for this pandemic,"" says Dr Chaitanya Kada, a doctor based in Lightning Ridge, another outback town. Infections have surged in the remote town of Wilcannia The town's outbreak started at a funeral on 13 August that was attended by more than 100 people, some from other regional areas. It did not breach any public health orders because Wilcannia was not in lockdown at the time. Health authorities remain worried, however, that those mourners could have unintentionally infected people in other communities. The situation has infuriated locals. Monica says she and others had previously asked authorities to seal off Wilcannia to keep it safe. ""We were watching what was happening in other communities. We were watching it [the virus] getting closer,"" she says. ""We've been crying out for prevention. No one listened to us."" Read the full storyhere. Manufacturer Becton Dickinson has announced it will deliver nine million additional blood test tubes to the NHS this week for immediate distribution. Manufacturers have seen record demand for the vials in recent months,caused in part by the need for tests for Covid patients. The NHS in England and Wales has temporarily stopped all non-urgent testing. In a statement, Becton Dickinson says it has received exceptional use authorisation to import BD blood tubes into the UK that are approved for use in other regions of the world, such as the US. Becton Dickinson says it has increased production capacity in the UK by 20% to ""help alleviate the backlog of orders"".  Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg on COP26, travel plans and Cambo oil field proposals Campaigner Greta Thunberg says she doesn't regard Scotland as a world leader on climate change. The Swedish activist told BBC Scotland she recognised that some countries ""do a bit more than others"" but that none were coming close to what was needed. Onthe Scottish Greens' deal to enter government, she said some politicians were ""less worse"" than others. But she said tackling climate change was not as easy as voting for a green party. The 18-year-old said: ""Of course there might be some politicians that are slightly less worse than others. That was very mean but you get the point. ""It's a hopeful sign that people want something that's more 'green' - whatever green means - but in order to solve this we need to tackle this at a more systemic approach."" The Scottish government has previously described its climate change legislation as ""world leading."" It includes a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2045. The legislation was praised as ""inspiring"" by the UN's climate chief Patricia Espinosa. Ministers say they recognise that every country needs to do more while the Scottish Greens say they agree that systemic change is necessary. Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? What is COP26? Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? Sturgeon urges UK government to reassess Cambo oil field plan In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Scotland exactly two months ahead of the UN climate change conference being held in Glasgow, Ms Thunberg spoke about COP26 and plans for a new oil field off Shetland. She said she was ""not 100% sure"" that she would attend the COP26 talks in November and that her decision would be based on whether the event was ""safe and democratic"". For her, that means ensuring participants from poorer countries are fully vaccinated and able to travel. Ms Thunberg is not sure if she will be attending the COP26 climate talks in November Organisers are offering vaccines to all delegates as part of the accreditation process. Ms Thunberg still believes the conference will not lead to anything ""if we don't treat this crisis like a crisis."" She explained: ""It should be all about climate justice and we can't achieve climate justice if everyone is not contributing on the same terms. ""I've spoken to many people who say that they are trying to at least vaccinate all the delegates and making it more accessible. And if that is the case it's left to see, I guess."" After returning to school from a year off, the teenager said she would not be skipping lessons to attend because the conference falls during Sweden's school holidays. If she does decide to come, her plan is to travel from Stockholm by train. Earlier this month, the former UN climate change chief Christiana Figueres said she thought the conference should be ""hybrid"" with some talks happening in Glasgow while others are moved online. But Ms Thunberg says that should be avoided if a face-to-face meeting is safe. She said: ""I'm not an expert but we get much more results when we meet in person. It's hard to argue against that. But, of course, if it's not considered safe then we have to go for the safest option. ""To be honest, I don't think that either one will lead to much results. A physical meeting will probably bring more results but still nowhere close to what's needed."" Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie will become Scottish government ministers after their party backed a deal to work with the SNP The activist said she was aware of the controversy about the Cambo oil field west of Shetland. The UK government is still to make a decision about whether to give the go-ahead to the new development with pressure growing from climate change campaigners for it to be refused. Sir Ian Wood, former chairman of the oil services firm Wood Group,said last week that Cambo needed to be given the green lightso an energy transition could be carried out in an orderly way. But Ms Thunberg, who used her speech at the UN climate summit in New York in 2019 to angrily tell world leaders and governments they were not doing enough to tackle climate change, said: ""I think that maybe summarises the whole situation that we are in, the fact that these kinds of countries that are actually hosting COP are planning to actually expand fossil fuel infrastructure, to actually open up new oil fields and so on. ""But also, it's a bit strange that we are talking about single individual oil fields when the UK is already producing so much oil as it is. It's not just that we need to stop future expansions, we also need to scale down the existing ones if we are to have a chance of avoiding the worst consequences."" The teenager has also previously criticised the UK for holding a climate conferencewhen the opening of a new coal mine is being considered. Asked whether a quicker energy transition can be achieved without costing tens of thousands of jobs in a place like Aberdeen, she said: ""I sure hope so. ""I think we need to envision that. We can't just say that it's not possible, let's just give up. We have to at least try.  I don't see that as a reason for not trying."" Ms Thunberg added that she did not think she had been to Scotland before and looked forward to seeing the landscapes and meeting people.

"Pictured here in 1999, the report recommends the closure and disposal of Crossmaglen police station Northern Ireland's most fortified police station at Crossmaglen in south Armagh should close, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said. It is part of a policing outlook which is seen in the surrounding community as ""militaristic"". Areview containing 50 recommendations,externalalso said assault rifles should no longer be carried as routine by officers on patrol duties. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said it was a ""politically naÃ¯ve document"". ""The recommendations in this report would make Patten blush,"" he said in a statement. He said the end goal of the report was the ""creation of all-Ireland policing structures"" which was ""politically unacceptable"". The report said consideration should be given to using Irish in messages and signs. The report also recommended ""exploring"" the relocation of memorials to murdered police officers in south Armagh stations. ""Memorials commemorating the past have a profound impact on the police culture of today,"" it stated. ""This is particularly relevant in south Armagh where the level of police loss was great. ""The review suggests the station working environment in south Armagh has a negative impact on the mindset of police officers who work there, extending to those who have no lived experience of conflict."" Chief Constable Simon Byrne told BBC News NI the station was ""an emblem of the past"" and had ""no place in modern policing"". ""Anyone that has had the chance to go inside [Crossmaglen] stationâ¦ will probably be quite horrified about the conditions we're asking officers to work in and for members of the public to come and see us,"" he added. This video can not be played PSNI's Crossmaglen station is an ""emblem of the past"" ""Significant trust and confidence issues"" between the local community and the police were identified by the report. The review was launched after a social media post by the chief constable sparked anger in December 2019. It showed him posing for a photo outside Crossmaglen Station with officers holding rifles. Some nationalist politicians criticised him, saying the image was offensive to the local community. The review into the style and tone of policing in south Armagh has resulted in a 170-page report published by the PSNI on Tuesday. News of the recommended closure of Crossmaglen Station had been leaked weeks ago, following a briefing involving the Policing Board. PSNI chief sorry for Crossmaglen 'rifle pic' Heavily-armed police 'reality in some parts of NI' NI police chief's tenure marked by setbacks During the Troubles, south Armagh was one of the most dangerous areas to police due to IRA attacks - in 1975 then Secretary of State Merlin Rees labelled it ""bandit country"". It led to heavily-fortified security installations and watchtowers being built, many of them by the Army. An estimated 2,400 bombings and shootings took place in south Armagh between 1970 and 1993. But today the threat level is lower than other areas. Of 53 security-related incidents in Northern Ireland last year, none were in south Armagh and the last terrorist incident recorded was in 2015. The greatest risk to officer safety is ""presented by criminality and roads"", the report stated. The report found the PSNI lacks credibility in the area - but there is no evidence of ""a rejection of policing"". Officers generally regard the community with suspicion and it is a barrier to building a relationship built on respect and trust. One of the main recommendations is the closure of Crossmaglen Police Station and disposing of the site within the next five years. The base ""does not provide a positive or effective policing presence"", the report stated. A new station on an out-of-town site would signal ""a separation from the past"", but is not achievable in the current financial climate. Despite Crossmaglen being arguably the better location, the area's policing will in future be provided solely from a redeveloped station 10 miles away in Newtownhamilton, the report added. It would be renamed South Armagh Police Station. ""One potential consideration may be the use of Irish language messaging on signage outside South Armagh Police Station in line with commitments under the Fresh Start Agreement,"" the report stated. It also recommended that G36 assault rifles, which appeared in the photograph Mr Byrne shared on social media, should no longer be carried by patrols as standard. Instead they should require the authorisation of an inspector. Crossmaglen Police Station is staffed by 11 officers who live on site during shifts of three-to-four days at a time. The station has limited opening hours to the public at three days per week. On average it gets one call a day for assistance, compared to 15 a day at Newtownhamilton Station. The chief constable said the ""style and tone"" of policing in south Armagh ""hasn't kept pace with the modernisation of policing that we've seen in other parts of the country"". ""It gives us that wakeup call to reset the dial and invest in a more modern style of policing that's based on neighbourhood police teams,"" he added. Mr Byrne said the PSNI has committed to closing the station and the next step is to work with the policing board, which owns the building, but ""more importantly the community to see where's the right place to put a new, purpose built facility to provide a visible presence in that part of the country"". Discussing the proposal to relocate memorials to murdered police officers Mr Byrne said: ""It's not about disrespecting their past, their sacrifices and the holes that's left in people's lives. ""The actual issue of memorials won't be one we will take forward immediately. ""We want to move carefully with people that are affected by any change, which is serving officers, the federation, people that have worked with us previously and their families and the associations which represent them to see how best we address these issues."" In a statement the Police Federation for Northern Ireland said it was ""accepted that the current Crossmaglen station is not fit for purpose"" but that a new station should be built on the same site. ""That would be the most sensible solution if everyone was being serious about bringing effective community policing to the area,"" it added. ""We have been consulted at local level about all of this but, frankly, this report in its totality was delivered as a fait accompli without full consultation where our corporate views could have been taken on board."" However, Sir Jeffrey said the chief constable was in real danger of ""completely undermining confidence in the impartiality of police, not only in south Armagh but across Northern Ireland"". ""This would take two-tier policing to a whole new level,"" he added. ""All law-abiding citizens want to see better policing in south Armagh and will support steps to achieve such but that does not include sending officers, as per recommendation 43 [in the report] for ""local external training"" so they have a better narrative of south Armagh,"" he said. Sir Jeffrey said he would meet the chief constable on Thursday to discuss the report. Newry and Armagh MLA, Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy, welcomed the report which, he said, could lead to a ""new beginning"" to policing if properly implemented. He said it was ""a huge development for the people of the area"". ""All of these recommendations can begin to change the image of policing in South Armagh by removing the negative, militaristic style of the past which has damaged community relations,"" he said. Policing Board member Dolores Kelly of the SDLP welcomed the recommendations. ""People here have been living with the vestiges of an ingrained militaristic policing operation for far too long,""she said. ""The reality for people in places like Crossmaglen is that they haven't had a real chance to experience a new beginning to policing because of the attitude and the practice of the PSNI,"" she added.Â Ulster Unionist assembly member Mike Nesbitt said Crossmaglen police station is not fit for purpose and the party supports a new station for south Armagh. However, he added: ""What is clear is that the proposal with regard to memorials is totally unacceptable. ""We will not support anything that suggests disrespect for the sacrifice of those who laid down their lives for the community."" DUP MP Gregory Campbell said there should be caution about the potential for precedents to be set by the implementation of the report. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, he said there had been an outcry about the moving of a memorial in Londonderry five years ago remembering RUC and PSNI officers injured or killed in the city. ""Thankfully the police not only saw sense, but the wider community saw the sensitivities of that. If they are going to repeat the same mistake in south Armagh they can hardly expect a different outcome,"" he said.

We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. Weâll shortly be bringing the live page to a close, hereâs a
round up of the dayâs main headlines: People queue for a coronavirus vaccine in New Delhi, India, earlier today Earlier, we reported that Slovakia has formally ended using Russia's Sputnik V vaccine today, due to a lack of interest. However, Sputnik's manufacturer, Russian Direct Investment Fund, has denied that Slovakia returned some of the doses. The company says Slovakia had used up all the Sputnik V vaccines ""from the batch delivered to the country early this year"" and no additional deliveries were planned as part of the contract. A statement says: ""In Slovakia, Sputnik
V faced a disinformation campaign connected to political struggle between different
groups within the government, even though the efficacy and safety of the Russian
vaccine have been confirmed during clinical trials and real-world use around
the globe. ""It is also worth noting that in Hungary, where over a million
people got vaccinated with Sputnik V during mass vaccination campaign, the
demand for the Russian vaccine exceeded the amount of actual deliveries to the
country."" Health Minister Stephen Donnelly leaves the cabinet meeting at Dublin Castle The Irish Cabinet has agreed on a plan that will effectively end most Covid-19 restrictions by 22 October. The government says the easing of rules is dependent on 90% of adults being vaccinated and Covid-19 cases remaining manageable. From 6 September - next Monday - large crowds will be allowed to gather in the Republic of Ireland for religious ceremonies. Places of worship and outdoor sporting venues will also be allowed to hold 50% capacity from that date. Indoor venues will be allowed to have 60% capacity for events for people who are vaccinated, while outdoor venues can hold 75% capacity for vaccinated people. You can read more about the announcement here. Some 66,648 people received a second dose of a Covid vaccine in the UK on Monday â the lowest number since 21 June. Around 42.8 million people have now had a second dose â thatâs
78.7% of people aged 16 and over. The UK also reported another 19,643 people have had a first
dose of a vaccine â the first time it's dropped below 20,000 since 18 July. The UK has reported another 32,181 daily coronavirus cases,
and a further 50 deaths within 28 deaths of a positive test. The latest government statistics,externalalso show the number of Covid
patients in hospital has passed 7,000 for the first time since 15 March, with
7,015 reported to be in hospital according to the most recent figure. Members of the British Press Photographers' Association are showing off their best work, at the Bargehouse gallery, central London, in an exhibition delayed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the images from the exhibition, which features the best 100 photographs, capture how the pandemic has affected people's lives. A cyclist stops in the middle of an almost deserted Westminster Bridge to take a photograph, at 13:15, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson had announced the UK would lock down to fight Covid-19, on 24 March 2020 With swimming pools closed because of the pandemic, triathlete Lloyd Bebbington trains in his garden, in April 2020 Queen Elizabeth II takes her seat in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, for the socially-distanced funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh, who died aged 99, in April A funeral is held outside the London home of a 40-year old man who died suddenly from suspected Covid-19, in June 2020 The government still intends to roll out a Covid-19 booster programme in England from September, the prime minister's official spokesman has said. The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The PM's official spokesman says: ""We are still awaiting the final advice from JCVI on boosters. ""It is still very much our intention to roll out the booster programme during September."" Earlier, we reported comments from Prof Paul Hunter, who called for boosters to be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. The PM's spokesman also says it is still the plan to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September. ""We set out broadly our intention to require our vaccination for nightclubs and some other settings and we'll be coming forward in the coming weeks with details for that,"" he adds. The monitors can give a warning when classrooms are not ventilated enough As the Welsh government announces Â£6m to provide CO2 monitors and ozone disinfecting machines in schools,doctors are welcoming the move. The monitors detect the build-up of carbon dioxide, which comes from people exhaling, offering a measure of how much fresh air is in the room. Dr Rhys Thomas, a consultant at Glangwili Hospital, says they are the ""canaries in the coal mine"" that give advanced warning of the risk of spreading Covid-19. ""It's the air that infects you, not surfaces. It's breathing in somebody else's air that'll do it,"" he says. ""Delta is far more infectious and dangerous, and transfers more readily in the air."" Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP from Nefyn, Gwynedd, and a member of the Fresh Air campaign, says he is ""really pleased"" the Welsh government is taking the importance of ventilation seriously. Scotland has already deployed CO2 monitors and England is also providing 300,000 of them for the autumn term. The Welsh government cautioned that its ozone machines, designed by Swansea University, are only intended to disinfect empty spaces after an outbreak, not to continuously filter the air in occupied classrooms. This Post Office branch in Neston, Cheshire, has been forced to close More than 250 Post Office branches that closed due to Covid-19 in the UK had not reopened by the time lockdown restrictions were lifted in June, it has been revealed. Figures seen by the BBC show 1,183 UK branches had been shut for a month or more since March 2020, but 260 had not reopened by 30 June this year. The Post Office says the pandemic had ""impacted our ability"" to open. Post Offices were permitted to remain open throughout coronavirus lockdowns in all four UK nations, but wider restrictions forced surrounding businesses to close and bans on most foreign travel impacted the viability of many branches. Brian and Joanne Young ran a branch in Neston, Cheshire, until they announced in June they could no longer afford to keep it open. Brian says the branch had ""lost a lot of footfall during the pandemic"" due to businesses that needed banking services closing, while losing transactions ""like travel money and travel insurance, which give us a form of income on commission"", also had an impact. ""All our overheads stayed the same and unfortunately, we suffered a big loss on the shop and we couldn't afford to sustain it any more,"" he adds. Read the full storyhere. Kieffer Moore has scored six goals in 21 appearances for Wales, including one at Euro 2020 A positive Covid-19 test for reserve goalkeeper Adam Daviesmeans he and striker Kieffer Moore will miss Wales's three upcoming games. Moore was identified as a close contact of Davies after he tested positive and the Football Association of Wales said both players would be self-isolating for 10 days. It means they will be unable to play in the friendly against Finland on Wednesday, or the two World Cup qualifiers against Belarus and Estonia. A further five players are out of action due to injury. The Stormont executive must now ""set out a path"" for ending Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons says. ""We need to start moving on these issues, we have to take into account the impact on the economy, the health service and society more generally,"" he tells BBC News NI. First Minister Paul Givan previously said he wantedall regulations lifted by the end of September. The five-party executive will meet tomorrow to discuss the remaining restrictions. Hospitality businesses have been calling on ministers to agree to remove restrictions such as social distancing and table service requirements, which they say have damaged trade. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland also remain closed, unlike in the rest of the UK. Other parties have not stated yet if they support ending restrictions by the end of next month. Sinn Fein's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who has just revealed she's tested positive - previously said the executive needed to remain ""cautious"", while the SDLP's Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said it was ""naÃ¯ve"" to set a date in place.

People in poorer areas of Scotland are likely to have 20 fewer healthy years than those in wealthy areas The pandemic may havewidened the gap in mortality rates between the wealthy and the poor in Scotland, a report by the National Records of Scotland suggests. Last year, death rates in deprived areas were almost double those in rich areas, with the poorest also expected to have 20 fewer years of good health than the most affluent. While the general mortality rate was 1.9 times higher in deprived areas, for Covid-19 deaths, the rate was 2.4 times higher among poor communities. ""Mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas,"" the report says, adding that ""Covid-19 appears to be increasing this effect"". The health service in England is experiencing ""winter-like pressures"", the Society of Acute Medicine is warning. Medics from the organisation, which represents doctors working in the field of acute medicine, say doctors are treating ""vast numbers"" of people with non-Covid illnesses as well as many attending hospital with severe coronavirus symptoms. Dr Nick Scriven, immediate past president of the Society for Acute Medicine, says many patients are suffering from illnesses typically seen in winter such as respiratory infections - particularly in children. ""I think it is fair to say we are currently facing an unprecedented summer workload that feels more like the worst winter pressures most of us can recall,"" says Dr Scriven. ""We are seeing vast numbers of patients with non-Covid illness alongside the steady admission rates of those still very poorly with Covid. ""We are also noticing frailer people who have deconditioned over lockdowns so that any illness that previously might have been fairly minor now need an extended stay in hospital with periods of rehabilitation."" Acute medicine deals with the immediate and early treatment of adult patients with a variety of medical conditions who present to hospital as emergencies. The NHS is facing a huge backlog of care which has been exacerbated by the pandemic.A record 5.45 million people are waiting for carein England alone. Fully vaccinated UK travellers going to Italy no longer have to quarantine for five days on arrival. A new rule has come into force in Italy, ending the five-day quarantine - as long as travellers have a negative coronavirus test and they received their second jab at least 14 days prior to arriving. Rome had re-imposed the quarantine from 21 June as the Delta variant spread rapidly across the UK. Since early August, Italy has required proof of vaccination, recent recovery from coronavirus or a negative test for people wanting to dine indoors or enter museums and sports events. Italy is currently on the UK's amber travel list, which means those coming back to the UK must take a test three days before travelling and a PCR test two days after arriving. Read more about the UK's travel ruleshere. Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says she has has contracted Covid-19. The Sinn Fein politician says on Twitter she is self-isolating but hopes to return to public duties next week. âI have contracted Covid-19. I am thankful to have had two doses of the vaccine,""she says.,external Read more here. Misinformation has led to growing numbers of young, unvaccinated Covid patients in Wales' hospitals, a critical care consultant says.. Dr Ami Jones says Aneurin Bevan health board staff felt ""demoralised"" to see the virus filling wards and intensive care units again. She says acute hospitals, emergency departments and respiratory medicine have experienced a ""much busier weekend this weekend than we've seen for months in terms of Covid"". ""It's predominantly unvaccinated people we're seeing and a number of these are people in their 20s and 30s, with a small number of under-16s requiring hospital care for Covid,"" Dr Jones says. Vaccination has made a huge difference in numbers requiring hospital treatment, she says, adding ""we have people in our ITU who are very poorly right now who didn't get vaccinated but now wish for nothing more than to be able to turn back the clock and get their vaccine"". ""The staff are feeling pretty demoralised that Covid is once again filling their wards and their ITUs, especially when so many hospital cases could've been prevented by vaccination. ""It's always heart-breaking to treat patients with avoidable conditions but this time feels different asthere's been so much misinformation out thereit's made it very tough for people to know who to believe and who to trust. ""But ask any front-line worker and they will tell you that vaccination is what's making a difference to the patients we are treating at the moment."" Read the full storyhere. Older people should be prioritised for booster jabs, one expert said The UK's vaccine experts, the Joint Committee on Immunisation and Vaccination, are due to make a decision about a campaign of booster jabs for vulnerable groups shortly. The NHS is poised to deliver a third jab to 30 million over-50s and people with conditions that make them clinically vulnerable, if it gets the green light. Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia says a widespread booster campaign may not be needed as the vaccines are still effective at preventing serious disease in many people. But he's told the PA news agency the boosters should be given quickly to over-80s and the clinically vulnerable. âThe evidence is that these people wonât have responded that well to vaccine,"" says Prof Hunter. âAs far as Iâm concerned there is no debate whatsoever about that group, they should be boosted and they should be boosted pretty soon."" Although protection for other groups will be waning, he says the vaccines will ""hopefully"" prevent serious illness for several years. He also says Covid-19 is approaching the ""endemic equilibrium"", the number of cases we should expect to see per day forever. In other coronaviruses that have been circulating for many years in humans, this is about 45,000 cases a day, Prof Hunter says. But he says because of widespread immunity, the serious illness of Covid-19 will be ""consigned to history"", except for occasional cases. In most pandemics, the professor says this takes about three years. Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Monica Kerwin says governments have failed Aboriginal people ""I am angry. The government did nothing to protect us. They sit in their ivory towers and make decisions on Aboriginal issues."" Monica Kerwin is a Barkindji (First Nation) mother-of-six who lives in Wilcannia, in outback New South Wales, Australia. Her remote town of about 750 people is at the centre of a growing Covid outbreak that has brought to the fore how vulnerable Australia's indigenous people are to the virus. For most of the pandemic, outbreaks in Australia have mainly hit cities and spared remote areas. But as the Delta variant has spread from Sydney to western New South Wales and elsewhere, Aboriginal communities are seeing Covid infections for the first time. ""We're on edge. The [indigenous] population is just not prepared for this pandemic,"" says Dr Chaitanya Kada, a doctor based in Lightning Ridge, another outback town. Infections have surged in the remote town of Wilcannia The town's outbreak started at a funeral on 13 August that was attended by more than 100 people, some from other regional areas. It did not breach any public health orders because Wilcannia was not in lockdown at the time. Health authorities remain worried, however, that those mourners could have unintentionally infected people in other communities. The situation has infuriated locals. Monica says she and others had previously asked authorities to seal off Wilcannia to keep it safe. ""We were watching what was happening in other communities. We were watching it [the virus] getting closer,"" she says. ""We've been crying out for prevention. No one listened to us."" Read the full storyhere. Manufacturer Becton Dickinson has announced it will deliver nine million additional blood test tubes to the NHS this week for immediate distribution. Manufacturers have seen record demand for the vials in recent months,caused in part by the need for tests for Covid patients. The NHS in England and Wales has temporarily stopped all non-urgent testing. In a statement, Becton Dickinson says it has received exceptional use authorisation to import BD blood tubes into the UK that are approved for use in other regions of the world, such as the US. Becton Dickinson says it has increased production capacity in the UK by 20% to ""help alleviate the backlog of orders"".  Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played In separate IRA bomb attacks Jennifer McNern lost both her legs and Margaret Yeaman was blinded A pension scheme for people who were badly injured during the Troubles has opened for applications. The start of the Troubles Permanent Disablement Payment Scheme is more than a year behind schedule, having been the subject of political rows. To qualify, a person must have suffered a severe and permanent physical or psychological injury caused through no fault of their own during the Troubles. Recipients will receive annual payments of between Â£2,000 and Â£10,000. The UK government and the Northern Ireland Executive havelong been at odds about how the scheme will be funded, with the overall costs potentially topping Â£1.2bn over the next 20 to 30 years. The Troubles claimed more than 3,500 lives and it has been estimated that another 40,000 were injured Last year a judge ruled Stormont's Executive Office wasacting unlawfully in delaying the introduction of the scheme. He said the start of the scheme was being deliberately stymied in order to pressurise the government into funding it. He also determined there was an attempt by Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill to have the scheme's eligibility criteria changed, with her party, Sinn FÃ©in, having said the rules potentially discriminated against some republicans with Troubles-era convictions. Funding for the scheme has been agreed for this year, but Stormont ministers still want the government to provide extra cash to help cover future expenditure. Margaret Yeaman, who was blinded in an IRA bomb in Banbridge, County Down, in 1982, said it had been a ""long, bumpy road"" for her and others injured during the Troubles who have been waiting for the payments. ""I'll not even say that we're getting it until I have it in my hand,"" she said. The level of payment through the scheme will depend on the severity of a victim's injuries Jennifer McNern described the payments as ""recognition"" of what she had been through since she lost both of her legs after an IRA bomb explosion in Belfast in 1972. ""This is really an acknowledgement of the harm caused physically, psychologically and financially,"" she said. Executive must fund Troubles pension, court rules The victims' group, the Wave Trauma Centre, said the opening of the scheme was a ""triumph for the courageous and determined campaigners who have fought for over a decade"" for the payments. ""At times it was desperately frustrating but they never lost their focus on gaining tangible recognition for all those like themselves who had been severely and permanently injured through no fault of their own,"" said the group's co-ordinator Alan McBride. ""We'll also remember those who campaigned but didn't live long enough to see this day."" The group Relatives For Justice said the qualification criteria for the pension should be extended. AndrÃ©e Murphy, its deputy director, welcomed the initiative but insisted modifications need to be considered. ""It is very possible that a paramedic or a police officer or an eye-witness at a scene will be eligible for a payment and a loved-one who has suffered the deep psychological distress and trauma since then will not be eligible for this,"" she said. ""That is going to feel unfair and we have to resolve it,"" she added. This video can not be played The roots of Northern Irelandâs Troubles lie deep in Irish history After a series of delays, the scheme was to have opened in June but Mr Justice McAlinden, who chairs the panel overseeing the awarding of the payments,pushed it back until the end of August. That final delay, he said, was to allow applicants to ""familiarise themselves"" with ""complex"" medical assessment guidance before making their submissions. He said he hopes that money will start being distributed to victims before the end of this year. In an interview with BBC News NI, he said he was confident that enough funding would be available for everyone entitled to payments, and he hoped the process would begin soon. The judge said: ""I would hope that there would be a speedy turnaround for non-complex, relatively straight-forward cases. ""We'll just have to see how we measure up to our goals but I would hope that, let's say, it will be within months as opposed to years for the vast majority of applicants to receive determinations from the board."" Asked if this meant that the money would start being paid before the end of this year, he said: ""Yes. I would hope so."" ""I'm not worried about the issue of funding,"" Mr Justice McAlinden told the BBC Asked about the provision of funding, Mr Justice McAlinden said there was still political ""debate, discussion, disagreement as to where the funding will ultimately come from."" But he added: ""I have an undertaking, given in court, to the Court of Appeal that in terms of the role of the board, the payments that the board allocate and award, those payments will be met."" The scheme covers violence related to the Troubles between 1966 and 2010, including incidents in Great Britain and Europe. Non-UK residents injured outside the UK cannot apply, such as victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings carried out by loyalists in 1974. After the death of a recipient, their spouse or carer will get the payments for a further 10 years. Welcoming the opening of the scheme, First Minister Paul Givan said the scheme would give people who had suffered as a result of the Troubles ""the practical support and recognition that they deserve"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it had been ""a difficult and painful road for victims and survivors"", and encouraged anyone who had suffered permanent physical or psychological disablement as a result of the conflict to make an application. Justice Minister Naomi Long said it was an important day for all victims and survivors, ""but particularly for those who campaigned for this scheme with dignity and commitment for so long"".

"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg on COP26, travel plans and Cambo oil field proposals Campaigner Greta Thunberg says she doesn't regard Scotland as a world leader on climate change. The Swedish activist told BBC Scotland she recognised that some countries ""do a bit more than others"" but that none were coming close to what was needed. Onthe Scottish Greens' deal to enter government, she said some politicians were ""less worse"" than others. But she said tackling climate change was not as easy as voting for a green party. The 18-year-old said: ""Of course there might be some politicians that are slightly less worse than others. That was very mean but you get the point. ""It's a hopeful sign that people want something that's more 'green' - whatever green means - but in order to solve this we need to tackle this at a more systemic approach."" The Scottish government has previously described its climate change legislation as ""world leading."" It includes a target to reach net-zero emissions by 2045.

Sturgeon urges UK government to reassess Cambo oil field plan In a wide-ranging interview with BBC Scotland exactly two months ahead of the UN climate change conference being held in Glasgow, Ms Thunberg spoke about COP26 and plans for a new oil field off Shetland. She said she was ""not 100% sure"" that she would attend the COP26 talks in November and that her decision would be based on whether the event was ""safe and democratic"". For her, that means ensuring participants from poorer countries are fully vaccinated and able to travel. Ms Thunberg is not sure if she will be attending the COP26 climate talks in November Organisers are offering vaccines to all delegates as part of the accreditation process. Ms Thunberg still believes the conference will not lead to anything ""if we don't treat this crisis like a crisis."" She explained: ""It should be all about climate justice and we can't achieve climate justice if everyone is not contributing on the same terms. ""I've spoken to many people who say that they are trying to at least vaccinate all the delegates and making it more accessible. And if that is the case it's left to see, I guess."" After returning to school from a year off, the teenager said she would not be skipping lessons to attend because the conference falls during Sweden's school holidays. If she does decide to come, her plan is to travel from Stockholm by train. Earlier this month, the former UN climate change chief Christiana Figueres said she thought the conference should be ""hybrid"" with some talks happening in Glasgow while others are moved online. But Ms Thunberg says that should be avoided if a face-to-face meeting is safe. She said: ""I'm not an expert but we get much more results when we meet in person. It's hard to argue against that. But, of course, if it's not considered safe then we have to go for the safest option. ""To be honest, I don't think that either one will lead to much results. A physical meeting will probably bring more results but still nowhere close to what's needed."" Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie will become Scottish government ministers after their party backed a deal to work with the SNP The activist said she was aware of the controversy about the Cambo oil field west of Shetland. The UK government is still to make a decision about whether to give the go-ahead to the new development with pressure growing from climate change campaigners for it to be refused. Sir Ian Wood, former chairman of the oil services firm Wood Group,said last week that Cambo needed to be given the green lightso an energy transition could be carried out in an orderly way. But Ms Thunberg, who used her speech at the UN climate summit in New York in 2019 to angrily tell world leaders and governments they were not doing enough to tackle climate change, said: ""I think that maybe summarises the whole situation that we are in, the fact that these kinds of countries that are actually hosting COP are planning to actually expand fossil fuel infrastructure, to actually open up new oil fields and so on. ""But also, it's a bit strange that we are talking about single individual oil fields when the UK is already producing so much oil as it is. It's not just that we need to stop future expansions, we also need to scale down the existing ones if we are to have a chance of avoiding the worst consequences."" The teenager has also previously criticised the UK for holding a climate conferencewhen the opening of a new coal mine is being considered. Asked whether a quicker energy transition can be achieved without costing tens of thousands of jobs in a place like Aberdeen, she said: ""I sure hope so. ""I think we need to envision that.

"Cafe owner Carol Deeney says 50% of sales are now via delivery app If any of Carol Deeney's customers fancy a bacon roll or a haggis toastie, they can pop down to her Scottish Street Food cafÃ© in east London. But she says half of them, these days, turn to delivery apps instead. ""We have loyal customers now that haven't even graced our doors,"" she says. During lockdown there was surge in demand for takeaways and home deliveries as people discovered that, as well as the traditional pizza or curry, it was easy to have other favourite dishes delivered, from brunches to late night snacks. Food outlets pivoted on the spot to keep up with these sudden new demands. Food-delivery apps up to 44% more expensive, survey finds The takeaways switching to reusable containers But perhaps more surprisingly, even as the chance to dine out has returned, demand for home deliveries and takeaways has continued to grow. Nearly a quarter of people are spending more on takeaways and food deliveries now than before the pandemic, according to market research group Mintel. Prior to Covid, Britons were spending around Â£38 per month each on takeaways, home deliveries and meal kits, according to accountancy firm KPMG, a trend that was already growing. But between spring 2020 and spring 2021 average monthly spend per person reached Â£53. ""The change that would have happened in three to five years in the sector has happened in months when businesses reacted as the pandemic started,"" Will Hawkley, KPMG's global head of leisure and hospitality. It doesn't matter to Carol Deeney if some days her waiting staff are seeing more delivery riders than customers. She's accepted that consumer habits have changed, and she's planning to put more resources into the delivery part of the business. Big fast food chains, including Burger King and McDonalds, also say they are expecting home delivery to expand. ""We believe the increased demand for delivery is a trend that is here to stay,"" Neil Manhas, general manager of Pizza Hut UK, said. ""Sales have been consistently higher than pre-lockdown and we're actively recruiting for delivery drivers and managers."" Pizza Hut is launching 125 new locations over the next three years to serve home delivery. A spokesperson for Burger King said: ""Increasing consumer demand towards digital services is showing no sign of slowing and therefore is an area we will continue to focus on."" But while the growth in home deliveries is an opportunity, restaurants are also wary of it. For pan-Asian restaurant chain Tampopo, a third of its business is now takeaway or ordered via online platforms, according to the company's co-founder David Fox. And while he's keen for that part of the business to keep growing, he says there can be a ""tension"" between providing for customers on-site and for those ordering online. David Fox is co-founder of Tampopo and East Street restaurants ""We are, at our heart, a dine-in restaurant not a delivery restaurant,"" says Mr Fox. ""We'll always prioritise dine-in customers. In extreme circumstances, say we're two chefs down, we drop off the [online] platform."" He says delivery riders and dine-in customers will often find themselves sharing the same entrance or staircase in a restaurant, and that businesses now need to think about delivery and take-out when fitting new restaurants. ""Five years ago, you wouldn't really think about delivery,"" says Mr Fox. ""Now, you'd be thinking: on a Saturday night, how many delivery orders would you be having, and where are you going to put them, and how can it be done in a way that it doesn't interfere with the customer flow and customer experience.""

"British business confidence hit highs not seen since April 2017 on hopes the economy is recovering strongly to pre-pandemic levels, according to a survey. Employers in England's North West and East registered the biggest jump in confidence, the latest Lloyds Bank Business Barometer found. There was caution among companies about inflation and staff shortages. But firms in manufacturing, services and construction all posted greater optimism that recovery would continue. The monthly survey of 1,200 firms, conducted between 2 and 16 August, also saw business confidence in Northern Ireland turn positive after a negative response in July's poll. The barometer found that overall business confidence among UK firms rose by six points to +36% in August, driven by improvements in companies' trading prospects and expectations of stronger growth in the year ahead. Said Hann-Ju Ho, senior economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said: ""Business confidence reaching its highest level in over four years tells a positive story about the country's economic recovery. ""This confidence is driven by the continued success of the vaccine rollout, the removal of lockdown restrictions and adjustments to self-isolation rules. ""Staff shortages remain a challenge, but as the economy moves back towards pre-pandemic levels we can be optimistic that the momentum for business confidence and economic optimism can be sustained in the months ahead."" Confidence increased in nine out of the 12 UK regions and nations in August with particularly strong rises in the North West, up 26 points to 64% and the East of England, showing a rise of 14 points to 39%. Smaller rises were seen in the North East, up 6 points to 46% and London, up 4 points to 41%. For the North West, East of England and North East, confidence was at its highest since the survey sample was expanded in 2018. UK recovery slows as staff shortages plague firms Government borrowing shrinks in July UK job vacancies at record high as wages pick up Increases in confidence were also recorded for Scotland (34%), the South East (32%), the South West (37%) and Wales (19%). In Northern Ireland, confidence rose significantly to 18% (from 6% in July), but it remains the region of the UK with the lowest level of confidence. The remaining three regions saw slight confidence declines, with the West Midlands at 27%, Yorkshire & the Humber at 26%, while there was a larger 10-point fall in the East Midlands to 28%. The improved mood echoes recent official statistics. Earlier this month,jobs data from the Office for National Statistics suggested that the labour market continues to ""rebound robustly"". Government borrowing has also fallen as furlough support ends and tax receipts rise. But like other survey data, the Lloyds barometer suggested that inflation - which saw a surprise slowdown in the year to July, down to 2% from 2.5% in June - remains a worry.

"Nike's headquarters in Beaverton Oregon Staff at Nike's corporate headquarters in Oregon have been given a week off to support their mental health, ahead of the return to the office in September. From today until Friday, the US firm will ""power down"" to give employees a rest after a tough year. ""Take the time to unwind, destress and spend time with your loved ones,"" the firm's head of insights Matt Marrazzo said in a message to staff. It follows similar moves from dating app Bumble and Linkedin. A growing number of employees have reported feeling burnt out as the pandemic drags on and many continue to work from home. Big US firms such as Apple, Uber and bank Wells Fargo have also delayed plans for staff to return to the office as infections surge across the US. Making the announcementon Linkedin,externallast week, Mr Marrazzo told Nike staff: ""Do not work"" - adding that the past year had been ""rough"" and they were ""living through a traumatic event"". All Bumble staff given week off to de-stress Citigroup urges staff to go Zoom-free on Fridays ""In a year (or two) unlike any other, taking time for rest and recovery is key to performing well and staying sane. ""It's not just a 'week off' for the team... it's an acknowledgment that we can prioritize mental health and still get work done."" According to reports, it also reflects the fact Nike has had a successful year, with sales up and its stock gaining 20%. Bumble, the dating app where women are in charge of making the first move, told its 700 staff worldwide to switch off and focus on themselves back in June. One senior executive revealed on Twitter that founder Whitney Wolfe Herd had made the move ""having correctly intuited our collective burnout"".

When Barcelona signed Antoine Griezmann in 2019, there were doubts about how he would gel with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. I wonder what odds you'd have got on none of them playing for Barcelona by 1 September 2021. Griezmann and Suarez link up again at Atleti... #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only - standard message rates apply) Clubs have weeks, or months, to sort out transfers - yet most are left to the last minute. Can I offer my services to do a bit of organisational skills training for them? A one day course should do it. As they all seem pretty flush I will bump up my rate though. Kenny, Edinburgh Barcelona say Atletico Madrid will pay all of Antoine Griezmann's wages. That will presumably help Barca register their new players. They add that there is a ""compulsory permanent transfer clause"" too. Griezmann is the 11th player to leave financially-struggling Barcelona this summer, including Lionel Messi - and the third today. Right-back Emerson Royal joined Tottenham for Â£25.8m and teenage midfielder Ilaix Moriba moved to RB Leipzig for Â£13.7m. Atletico Madrid say the Antoine Griezmann signing from Barcelona is a loan for one season with the option of another. Two years ago the France international made the move the other way after Barca paid his Â£107m buyout clause. But the 30-year-old's time at the Nou Camp has been a disappointment as he scored 35 goals in 102 games and only won the Copa del Rey. He has never won La Liga, joining Atletico Madrid in 2014, Barcelona in 2019 and Atleti now - every time just after his new side had won the league. Atletico Madrid re-sign forward Antoine Griezmann from Barcelona The biggest move of the day and a shock one. France World Cup winner Antoine Griezmann has rejoined Atletico Madrid from Barcelona on a season-long loan deal. As that guy says 'here we go'... Interesting.La Liga's transfers page,externalalready has Antoine Griezmann to Atletico. Done deal? The big one we're still waiting on is Atletico Madrid signing Antoine Griezmann from Barcelona. There is also some talk Barca might sign Sevilla striker Luuk de Jong as a replacement. De Jong and Martin Braithwaite up front. What a dream. We told you earlier that Swansea were trying to sign Brentford winger Tariqe Fosu on a season-long loan. Well that has fallen through so the Ghana international, 25, is likely to stay with the Premier League side. Good news for people who inexplicably named their fantasy football team after Fosu. Not naming any names. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,5.2436567e-06
"Jimmy Carr is set to play the first capacity indoor audience in Wales since the Covid pandemic began The first capacity indoor audience in Wales since the beginning of the Covid pandemic is set to watch comedian Jimmy Carr perform on Tuesday. Formal social distancing rules have ended in Wales underAlert Level Zero. It means theatres, which have been closed for 18 months, can now sell out for shows and performances. However, the performing arts sector admits it faces a difficult challenge balancing the need for ticket sales with audience confidence. Jimmy Carr, the host of TV show, 8 out of 10 Cats, will perform at St David's Hall in Cardiff later after the original show was postponed last November. Poldark star took Deliveroo job in Covid lockdown Getting back on stage will 'feel like Christmas' 'We've lost count of the performances postponed' Arts given Â£53m support amid 'massive challenges' More than 1,600 people are expected at the first full capacity show at the theatre, with the manager saying the venue had done everything it could to make people feel ""as safe as possible"". While those working in the industry, which has been on hold since the first coronavirus measures were introduced in March 2020, have welcomed the return, Welsh theatres have warned many may not be able to reopen. While recouping huge losses from the last 18 months is critical, Creu Cymru, which represents most of Wales' professionally run theatres, arts centres and producing companies, said ""building audience confidence is imperative"" for the sector to survive. This video can not be played Jimmy Carr to be theatre's first capacity post-Covid crowd Director Louise Miles-Payne said many shows had bypassed Wales to go to English venues due to rules being relaxed earlier there. ""They know they can get full capacity there because English venues have been open for a lot longer, and so there's a lot more confidence within English audiences and venues there,"" she said. She said with most shows being booked months or years in advance and audiences not being comfortable sitting next to strangers after months of social distancing, many theatres were facing huge challenges.""Just because theatres can open, it doesn't mean that they can, either because of financial pressures or for safety of audiences, staff, and the performers on stage,"" she added. ""So, were seeing full capacity tonight, but many theatres are taking a cautious approach,"" Theatres are allowed to sell out performances... but will audiences feel comfortable? However, this can put venues in a difficult position with promotors of shows that had previously sold out. ""Trying to reschedule previously cancelled shows that had sold out at full capacity is difficult as many venues may still feel a way off fully reopening their spaces,"" said Angela Gould, programmer and audience development manager at RCT Theatres. ""They need to honour contractual agreements while doing what they feel is best for their audiences, while still making the show financially viable."" Marketing and promoting has also become problematic with dates regularly changing, sometimes with little time to get the word out to ensure enough tickets are sold to make a show financially viable. ""Managing perceptions of both promoters and the public will be unchartered territory for many venues,"" said Ms Miles-Payne. ""Some people will have an expectation that everything is resuming and working to normal, and [others] may be shocked when performances are not going ahead and can't understand why things get rescheduled."" National Dance Company Wales has offered outdoor performances to venues National Dance Company Wales has offered outdoor performances to venues, as well as increasing the number of shows later in the year to allow for some social distancing. ""It's clear we need to continue to be agile in this period,"" said chief executive Paul Kaynes.

He added trying to put a show on while social distancing laws applied would have cut audience numbers to less than 200, meaning it would not have been financially viable for producers. ""[Producers have] been waiting for us to be able to have full houses, so that it makes it financially viable to be able to go on the road with their tours,"" he said.

"Online gamers under the age of 18 will only be allowed to play for an hour on Fridays, weekends and holidays, China's video game regulator has said. The National Press and Publication Administration told state-run news agency Xinhua that game-playing would be only allowed between 8pm to 9pm. It also instructed gaming companies to prevent children playing outside these times. Earlier this month a state media outlet branded online games ""spiritual opium"". Inspections of online gaming companies will also increase, to check that the time limits are being enforced the regulator said. Earlier rules had limited children's online game-playing to 90 minutes per day, rising to three hours on holidays. The move reflects a long running concern about the impact of excessive gaming on the young. A month prior to the latest restrictions, an article published by the state-run Economic Information Daily claimed many teenagers had become addicted to online gaming and it was having a negative impact on them. The article prompted significant falls in the value of shares in some of China's biggest online gaming firms. In July, Chinese gaming giant Tencent announced it was rolling out facial recognition to stop children playing between 22:00 and 08:00. The move followed fears that children were using adult ID's to circumvent rules. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News It's probably a disappointing end of summer for China's tens of millions of young gamers. The Chinese authorities have long been concerned about gaming addiction and other harmful online activities among youth. Beijing appears to show a growing scepticism over the expansion of capital and technology, as well as its potentially adverse impact on the well-being of the country's young generation. The new rule came amid a sweeping crackdown on China's tech giants, such as Alibaba, Didi and Tencent, as well as a series of reforms over activities considered by Beijing as harmful to the young generation, including celebrity fan culture and private tutoring. By imposing these new rules, the Chinese government is hoping to create ""positive energy"" among young people and to educate them with what Beijing considers ""correct values"". While many Chinese parents may applaud the gaming restriction, some on China's social media Weibo criticise the government interference as being ""unreasonable"" and ""arbitrary"". ""Why don't you plan when I go to the toilet, eat meals and go to bed,"" one sarcastic comment read.

"Catherine Sayer and Kevin Bourne are among a new breed of independent councillors A quiet revolution has been going on in town halls across England and Wales, as voters turn their back on the big Westminster parties in favour of local, independent candidates and residents' groups. What's behind the surge in support for them? Catherine Sayer never expected to run her local council. A successful thriller writer with a background in media, local politics was the last thing on her mind. But in 2008, talk spread through her Surrey town about plans to build thousands more homes. Fearful for their green belt, members of the local community teamed up to form the Oxted and Limpsfield Residents' Group, and Catherine's decision to join set her on a whole new path. ""I think it started for us with concerns about over development, and I think that's true of many places in the South East,"" she said. ""Then it just spiralled."" The Conservatives and Labour are being elbowed aside in places like Oxted Catherine is part of a growing movement - local citizens passionate about their area, who get together to challenge the big Westminster parties at the ballot box. Independents oust Conservatives Independents celebrate council gains Alliance takes control at ex-Tory council Independents and Lib Dems to run council It can be a daunting process if you are new to the world of electioneering, but with the low turnout at many local elections, enthusiasm and good local connections can go a long way. Within a decade of forming a residents' association, Catherine and a handful of her colleagues had won seats on the local district council, hoping to give their group more profile and clout. At the elections in May this year, independent candidates and members of residents' groups won more seats than any other party and took over the leadership of Tandridge District Council from the Tories - with Catherine at the helm. ""I think what I've found canvassing is that people don't want party politics at a local level. They find all the fighting, infighting, sniping is a real turn off,"" says Catherine. ""We've found we've had a lot of support among younger people, who almost embrace it immediately because I don't think people see the point of party politics locally."" Deputy leader Cllr Kevin Bourne added: ""The squabbling doesn't get anyone anywhere and it doesn't get anything done, so coming away from that is a massive part of the appeal as far as I'm concerned. ""It's choice. Independents and residents' groups give people choices."" In the mid-1970s 20% of local councillors were categorised as independents Their numbers have been in decline for years but recently took off again In 2019, independents had a massive breakthrough, making over 650 gains They now make up about 13% of all local councillors in England and Wales 32 local councils are led by an Independent, according to the Local Government Association A further 34 further councils have Independents or smaller parties playing roles in the administration In some places, like Ashfield, in Nottinghamshire, where 30 out of the 35 seats on the District Council in 2019 were won by the Ashfield Independents just four years after forming a group, the breakthrough has been dramatic. But the vast majority of local authorities in England and Wales are still controlled by the national parties - Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, with an increasingly buoyant Green Party snapping at their heels. And not everyone is convinced by the rise of the independents. On Oxted high street there was support for them from those who are clearly disillusioned with the party system, but there was scepticism too. One shopper, Valerie Greet, told us: ""With independent people you're not quite sure of what the policies might be, so from that point of view I would prefer to see a respected well-known party, whichever one it is."" Another added: ""I much prefer either Conservative or Labour. Although independents have local interests at heart, they're really not focused enough to get an overall consensus to make things happen."" Ashfield Independents won 30 out of 35 seats at Ashfield District Council Support for independents tends to go up when voters are disillusioned with the ""mainstream"" parties, says Alistair Clark, an expert in local democracy from Newcastle University. The spike in 2019 came seven months before the general election prompted by the UK Parliament's paralysis over Brexit. Although that breakthrough was ""remarkable"", says Dr Clark, he believes the big parties will eventually regain ground, even if it means pilfering the policies of their independent rivals. ""It is a cyclical thing,"" he says. But Independents are no longer operating in isolation - the Local Government Association runs training courses for them and a networking group to identify and groom potential candidates. Some are well-organised groups with regional ambitions, such as The Yorkshire Party or the North-East Party. In a post-Brexit world, where local pride and identity are increasingly powerful political forces, standing under the name of your area can be an advantage, says Alistair Clark. Independents are also making waves at Westminster elections, even if the prize of a Commons seat remains a distant dream for most, thanks to the campaigning power and name recognition of the big parties. At May's by-election in Hartlepool, the Conservatives' victory over Labour grabbed all the headlines, but Samantha Lee, a local businesswoman with no previous political experience, came third with 2,904 votes, a 9.7% share, after promising to ""show politicians that we are sick of their party games and empty promises"". A few weeks later at the Batley and Spen by-election, which Labour won by a whisker, the decision of Paul Halloran, of the Heavy Woollen District Independents, not to stand was seen by some as pivotal. Mr Halloran came third in the constituency at the 2019 election, with 12% of the vote. But the rise of independents at the grassroots level might be halted by the latest changes to local government structures. Durham is no longer a Labour-controlled county A recent report for the LGA's independent group warned that a move to fewer, bigger councils with more powers - a model the government recently approved for North Yorkshire, Somerset and Cumbria - would make it harder for independents or members of residents' groups to get elected. Marianne Overton, leader of the Local Government Association's independent group and member of North Kesteven District Council and Lincolnshire County Council, said: ""The bigger the area, the far more difficult just to be known. And there's the practicalities - you've got a lot more doors to knock on."" The government is looking at the way local government works, but says areas won't necessarily have to abolish smaller councils in favour of larger ones to get more powers, and any reform is best achieved through locally-led proposals. In Durham, the size of the council has not stopped independent councillors gaining traction. In May, they won enough seats on the county council to team up with other opposition parties and deprive Labour of control for the first time in decades. Cllr Alan Shield, leader of the Durham Group, which is made up of independents, said specific local issues had contributed to their success, but the national picture played a part. ""Particularly about Brexit,"" he says. ""A lot of the population believed they weren't being listened to by mainstream politicians, and that independents spoke specifically for the people they were elected to represent."" His colleague, Cllr Chris Lines, believes independents can go further, although he says it will not be easy, given the financial and organisational muscle deployed by the major parties. ""But (with) what's happened in Durham County Council, given 25% of the councillors are independents, I think there's a chance.""

"Murray, now the world number 112, was aiming to become the lowest-ranked man to beat a top-three opponent in US Open history US Open 2021 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDate:30 August-12 September Coverage:Daily radio commentaries on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra/BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app Andy Murray produced his finest display in four injury-disrupted years but fell agonisingly short of beating Greek world number three Stefanos Tsitsipas in a thrilling start to the US Open. The British former world number one played in a manner reminiscent of his best as he led by two sets to one. But Tsitsipas fought back to win 2-6 7-6 (9-7) 3-6 6-3 6-4 in New York. Dan Evans is the only Briton through after defeats for Heather Watson, Harriet Dart and Cameron Norrie. Johanna Kontawithdrew from her first-round matchbecause of a thigh injury, meaning teenager Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter - who play on Tuesday - are the nation's last remaining hopes in the women's singles. Murray, like so often in the past, was the British player who stole most of the attention on the opening day of the final Grand Slam of the 2021 season - even in defeat. Now ranked 112th in the world, the Scot was aiming for his biggest win by ranking since his career was derailed by a serious hip injury that left him facing retirement. Fired up throughout and relishing the magnitude of the occasion, 34-year-old Murray moved freely and hurt Tsitsipas with his quality from all over the court. A seismic shock beckoned before 23-year-old Tsitsipas - one of the favourites for the title - maintained his focus and bided his time to win in four hours 49 minutes. ""It did not come easy to turn the match around. I had to make a lot of sacrifices,"" Tsitsipas said. After being irritated by Tsitsipas' eight-minute bathroom break before the deciding set, Murray exchanged a terse handshake with his opponent before continuing to loudly chunter ""it's a joke"" while he gathered his belongings. Even the affectionate and rousing reception which accompanied the 2012 champion off the court could not hide his annoyance. Relive Murray's epic against Tsitsipas at the US Open Murray 'lost respect' for Tsitsipas over 'nonsense' `bathroom breaks This video can not be played I think it's nonsense and Tsitsipas knows it - Murray Defying the odds is something Murray has managed to do on several occasions in recent years, but beating an opponent of Tsitsipas' standing over five sets at a Grand Slam would have been a new benchmark. Niggling injuries since major hip surgery have continued to hamper his progress and, having played only 12 matches this year before the US Open, doubts remained about his chances of ever competing again with the world's best. While Murray arrived in New York speaking positively about his physical state, he said it was his game that needed to be ""in a better place"". Against Tsitsipas, it certainly was. And at a level where it has rarely been - if at all - since Murray first developed the hip problem at the 2017 French Open. Playing with freedom of movement and plenty of power, Murray's quality drew numerous errors from Tsitsipas as he dominated the opening set and threatened to take a two-set lead. Murray's unhappiness with Tsitsipas was evident in their post-match handshake A deft lob from Murray - a trademark backhand flick reminiscent of the one with which he clinched victory for Britain in the 2015 Davis Cup final - put him 5-3 ahead in the second-set tie-break, before a slip on a patch of his own sweat may have bizarrely prevented him from going two sets in front. Soaked from head to toe in the humid conditions, Murray became irritated by his sodden footwear and, after seeing two set points slip away, produced a double fault that helped Tsitsipas level. Strangely, Murray did not have another pair of trainers with him - meaning he even tried to dry his drenched ones with the air conditioning unit next to his chair. Murray's level dropped at the start of the fourth as Tsitsipas raced 5-0 ahead before ensuring the match would go into a decider. More drama came when Tsitsipas spent almost eight minutes off the court before the fifth set, leaving Murray furious and immediately a break down - from which he could not recover. ""It's never taken me that long to go to the bathroom ever,"" Murray said to US Open match supervisor Gerry Armstrong. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Evans, seeded 24th, appeared to struggle physically before winning 6-3 6-7 (6-8) 6-4 6-1 against Brazil's Thiago Monteiro. After missing the Olympics because he contracted Covid-19, 31-year-old Evans had lost four of his five matches since Wimbledon and looked to be waning as Monteiro levelled at one set all. Evans needed ice packs during the second set and had treatment on a foot after winning the third, but raced to 4-0 up in the fourth set before completing victory. Former British number one Tim Henman, working as a television commentator, described playing in the heat and humidity as ""brutal"". Evans will play American world number 64 Marcos Giron in the second round. Watson, 29, was beaten 6-1 6-4 by Slovenia's Kaja Juvan, while qualifier Dart lost 6-7 (6-8) 6-4 6-2 to France's former world number four Caroline Garcia. Watson, set to become Britain's top-ranked women's player following Konta's withdrawal, has now lost all 10 of her first-round matches in New York. Dart, 25, played excellently in the first set but trailed by a break in the second when she had to go off court for lengthy treatment on what appeared to be a left leg injury. Norrie, the 26th seed, had reached the third round in the past four Grand Slams, but was beaten 6-4 6-4 6-3 by highly rated Spanish 18-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, the youngest player in the men's top 100.
