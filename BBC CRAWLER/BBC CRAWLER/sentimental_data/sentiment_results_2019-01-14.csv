"Forget what might happen when the tellers read out the numbers on Tuesday night, let's think about what's at stake. With Brexit, it's nearly always subjective, but according to MPs and ministers of different flavours, these are some of the factors that matter and that the result might influence. Disagree at will of course - you may read these and scoff, or you may even have your own. But the meaningful vote may well end up having multiple meanings... Don't let British people down, May tells MPs Possible amendments to PM's Brexit deal Labour MP delays birth to vote on Brexit 1)Let's start with the least likely outcome. A miracle could take place overnight and scores of MPs might suddenly find themselves swinging behind the prime minister's plan. The vote goes through, she shouts hurray, and the process moves on smoothly. We leave the EU as planned in less than three months, and Theresa May's place in history is secure (no laughing at the back). 2)The defeat is disastrous and a combination of pressure from some ministers and MPs forces the PM to reach across the aisle. Depending on the scale of the defeat, and the reaction of Labour front and backbenchers, Westminster might be ushered into a different phase of bargaining across the benches. One Labour MP told me today: ""At some stage I will vote for the deal, but I will need something specific to show for it. We are about to enter an era of transactional politics."" Cross-party working may not be some kind of high-minded pursuit. 3)The scale of the likely loss might prompt the kind of parliamentary takeover that's been much discussed in the last couple of days. Arguably this might be one of the most long-lasting impacts. Rewriting the parliamentary rulebook may inevitably be largely of interest to nerds like me, but the kind of suggestions these extraordinary times are prompting might reshape the relationship between the government and MPs for years to come - and that matters. 4)Given that the balance in Parliament is definitely for a softer Brexit with closer ties to the EU, (arguably) the defeat on Tuesday might lead to a less dramatic break with the EU than the deal on the table promises. One member of the cabinet tonight told me: ""The longer this goes on, the softer Brexit gets."" Before you scream, I know that is not a view that is shared universally. But it is sincerely held by plenty of people around the place who point rather frustratedly to the irony. As another member of cabinet said: ""The hardline Brexiteers will push us toward a softer Brexit by digging in their resistance."" 5)Technically speaking, if you don't assume (and assumptions are dangerous) that Parliament can and would block no deal, the rejection of the plan would move us closer to leaving without a deal. That's not just because Eurosceptics are showing very little sign of budging, but remember the process is on a clock. Article 50 has to come to a conclusion by the end of March and, as the law currently stands, we are leaving with or without an agreement. Some other ministers in the cabinet believe very firmly once the vote is lost the PM has not much choice other than to up no-deal prep again in the hope, not of going that way, but of trying for another EU concession. One told me it is the ""only logical conclusion"" to keep going steadily and hope the EU will break - a continuation of the high-stakes poker game. 6)Jeremy Corbyn will either delight or disappoint his ranks by having the bottle to force a confidence vote, or delaying again, waiting for a magic moment. But he seems unlikely to take the bold step many of his members want and to move to offering another referendum. 7)For those campaigning for another European referendum, too, the scale of the defeat, and Tuesday night's front bench responses to it, are vital. The outcome of the vote will affect whether we leave the EU on time, and less likely, whether we could be given another say on whether we leave at all. And when those truths eventually reveal themselves, they in turn could have an impact on the fabric of the UK itself. What happens in Northern Ireland, or to the case for Scottish independence, are part of what is at stake in the long term. 8)Lastly, after more than two years of endless discussions, as and when the vote goes down on this hard-fought compromise, Westminster's factions and rival camps might finally have to do more than talk amongst themselves, and actually bend or break. The divisions are so intense in both the main political parties that it could also be the moment some of the divisions turn into real splits. That really would be history happening in front of our eyes.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison Iranian interrogators attempted to get a British-Iranian mother detained in Tehran to spy on the UK in exchange for her freedom, her husband has said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe wasjailed for five years in 2016after being convicted of spying, which she denies. Her husband said Iran's decision to use the tactic on her in late December meant they were in a ""scary place"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 40, has begun a three-day hunger strike in protest at being denied specialist medical care. It comes as Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt summoned the Iranian ambassador to the Foreign Office to discuss the case. Mr Hunt tweeted: ""Her ongoing detention is totally unacceptable and her treatment at the hands of Iranian authorities is a fundamental breach of human rights."" He said it was ""a truly terrible indictment of Iran's approach"" that the aid worker felt the need to go on hunger strike, adding: ""Iran must take action now."" However, the Iranian ambassador criticised the UK's ""interference"" in the case following his meeting with the foreign secretary, according to IRNA news agency. Allow Twitter content?

Richard Ratcliffe, who met Mr Hunt on Monday afternoon, described how his wife was told by members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard that she would be ""safer afterwards"" if she spied on the UK Department for International Development and London-based organisation Small Media. He said this offer, which she refused, ""really pushed her over the edge"". Speaking at a news conference, Mr Ratcliffe said prison officials have refused to let his wife see a doctor to examine lumps in her breast and other health issues. He set out her demands - to be able to see an external doctor and to be given an agreement in writing that she will be allowed access to any medical treatment the doctor recommends. He said his wife also needs neurological care over her neck pains and numbness in her arms and legs, as well as permission to see an outside psychiatrist. Briton jailed in Iran begins hunger strike Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle Nazanin's husband tells of jail anguish Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is going on an initial three-day hunger strike in Iran's Evin prison, alongside prominent Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi, but may strike for longer if her demands are not met. Mr Ratcliffe added that it was hoped the hunger strike would get the Iranians to take his wife ""seriously"". After being summoned to the Foreign Office, the Iranian ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, told IRNA news agency:  ""The Iranian government considers any interference by the British government on this matter unacceptable."" He was quoted as saying he had explained to Mr Hunt that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was considered an Iranian national and was entitled to her rights in prison - including access to medical facilities. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, of Hampstead in north-west London, spent her 40th birthday on Boxing Day in prison, where she has been held for more than 1,000 days. She was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 but has always maintained the visit was to introduce her daughter, Gabriella, to her relatives. The four-year-old has been staying with family in Iran since her mother was detained - although they were briefly reunited during athree-day temporary releaselast August. Her husband has mounted a high-profile campaign for his wife's release, with Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr Hunt and London Mayor Sadiq Khan all calling for her to be freed. Monique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, where Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe works, said it was ""extremely shocking"" to see Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe go on hunger strike.

"The 8.9 carat diamond in its setting A diamond ring worth more than Â£1m has been seized by the National Crime Agency as part of its continuing investigation into a London woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods. The ring was found at a high-class jewellers by investigators looking into the source of Zamira Hajiyeva's vast wealth. She's the first person in the UK to be subject to an Unexplained Wealth Order - a court measure designed to uncover suspected corrupt money hidden in the UK by foreign officials and their families. Mrs Hajiyeva, who denies any wrongdoing, is married to Azerbaijan banker Jahangir Hejiyev, who was convicted and jailed for a massive fraud against a state bank in their home country. Zamira Hajiyeva: Vast wealth under investigation If she cannot prove a legitimate source for her enormous wealth in the UK, the National Crime Agency is expected to apply to seize her Knightsbridge home, situated just behind Harrods, and their Berkshire golf course. During an application on Monday for permission to hold the ring for six months, Westminster Magistrates Court heard that it had been seized last Friday after investigators identified it at a branch of Cartier jewellers. The ring is described as an 8.9 carat ""emerald-cut diamond"". It was bought by Mrs Hajiyeva's husband for Â£1,190,640 and their daughter, Leyla Mahmudova, had taken it to Cartier in July for repair. Mrs Hajiyeva - who is fighting not just to keep her home but also to avoid extradition to Azerbaijan - was not represented at the hearing and the application was granted unopposed. Woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods revealed District Judge Michael Snow said: ""There's a clear evidential link between the ring and Mr Hajiyev and he has been convicted of substantial fraud. ""That satisfies me that there are grounds to suspect that this is recoverable property."" That means the NCA can hold the ring in secure storage while it looks into where the money came from to buy it. Last November, the NCA seized Â£400,000 of jewellery from the world-famous Christies auction house, which had been put up for auction by Mrs Hajiyeva's daughter. Those 49 items can be held by investigators until May.

"This video can not be played Jayme Closs was found alive by a woman walking her dog A Wisconsin man accused of killing a 13-year-old girl's parents so he could kidnap her allegedly made up his mind to snatch her after a chance encounter. Jake Patterson, 21, told investigators he watched Jayme Closs board a school bus that he had stopped behind while driving to work. He was formally charged on Monday with killing Jayme's parents and kidnapping her on 15 October last year. Jayme escaped last Thursday after three months in captivity, say police. On Monday, a criminal complaint outlined how Mr Patterson came up with the idea of targeting Jayme. He allegedly told investigators he was driving to his job at a cheese factory one day near the village of Almena when he spotted Jayme get on a school bus. The charging document quotes Mr Patterson as saying that when he saw Jayme, ""he knew that was the girl he was going to take."" Jayme Closs: What we know so far Mr Patterson told police he only had worked at the factory for two days, and ended up spotting Jayme on one of the two mornings he drove to work. The complaint says the accused twice scouted the Closs home near Barron with the plan of taking Jayme. Jayme Closs, her aunt/godmother Jennifer Smith and Molly the dog posing together after being reunited on January 11 But he abandoned the plot those times because too many people were in the vicinity. Mr Patterson described the measures he took to avoid detection, including shaving his head, stealing a license plate, wiping the shotgun with gloves on and modifying his car boot so it could not be opened from the inside. The charging document says that when Mr Patterson eventually stormed the family home by the front door, Jayme and her mother, Denise Closs, took refuge in the bathroom. The pair heard a gunshot and suspected the home-invader had killed the father, James Closs. Police say the suspect took steps to conceal his identity Mr Patterson allegedly broke down the bathroom door, and forced Denise Closs to help bind Jayme's hands and ankles with tape before shooting her. He then dragged Jayme to his car and threw her in the boot, according to the criminal complaint. Jayme told investigators that Mr Patterson drove 66 miles (105km) to a rural cabin near the small town of Gordon, where she was allegedly held until her escape. Once at the Gordon home, Jayme said that Mr Patterson took all of her clothes, saying he would throw them away. She told police he would sometimes make her hide under his bed when friends or family visited the cabin, making it clear ""that nobody was to know she was there or bad things would happen to her"". Sometimes, Mr Patterson ""would make her stay under the bed for up to twelve hours at a time with no food, water, or bathroom breaks"", according to the complaint. US suspect 'killed family to snatch girl' Aunt tearfully reacts to missing girl found And to ensure she was trapped, Jayme told officials he would stack containers with heavy weights around the bed ""so she could not move them without his being able to detect it"". On 10 January, Jayme said she was able to escape after Mr Patterson left the house, informing her he would be out for five or six hours. She told police she was able to move the weights and crawl out of the room. She took a pair of Mr Patterson's shoes and fled on foot, eventually encountering a neighbour who helped her contact police. According to the local officers who then arrested Mr Patterson, when he stepped out of his vehicle ""he stated 'I know what this is about'"", adding ""I did it"". This video can not be played Missing girl praised for 'courageous' escape After his arrest, Mr Patterson told investigators he assumed he had got away with the murders and kidnapping after two weeks, the complaint states. He added that he only learned of Jayme's name after abducting her and Mr and Mrs Closs' names weeks later after seeing them on television. Mr Patterson told police ""he never would have been caught if he would have planned everything perfectly"". A judge ruled that the suspect must be held on a $5m (Â£3.8m) cash bond pending trial during a court hearing on Monday. The next court hearing is scheduled for 6 February. Authorities have yet to reveal any suspected motive. His father and brother cried during the 10-minute court hearing. As they left the courtroom,his father shook his head,externalwhen asked by a reporter if he know what had been going on in his home. The suspect appeared in court via a video feed from jail While Mr Patterson himself had no criminal record in the state, his older brother, Erik, was convicted of fourth degree sexual assault in 2013 for having sex with a 16-year-old girl when he was 18. Former classmates of Mr Patterson'stold the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,externalhe was voted the quietest student in his grade one year and never made an impression. After 88 days, Jayme is now in the care of her aunt, Jennifer Smith, and has been reunited with other family members. Speaking onCBS This Morning,external, Jayme's aunt Lynn Closs said: ""It's such an overwhelming, amazing happy ending to such a horrible beginning."" Another aunt, Sue Allard, said she finally ""didn't have that pit in the bottom of my stomach anymore"". She said the family has not pressed her for any details of her experience. ""She feels safe. She's doing pretty well. I spent the afternoon there yesterday. We had her smiling, laughing."" ""We have to take little steps. Jayme, when she's ready to talk, she will."" Her aunts say they will attend all of Mr Patterson's court proceedings. ""I want him to know that he messed with us as a unit, and that good wins. And that is not him,"" Ms Closs added.

"Robert Lloyd Schellenberg told the court in Dalian: ""I am not a drug smuggler"" A court in China has sentenced a Canadian to death for drug smuggling in a ruling which will worsen a diplomatic row between the two countries. Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was originally given a 15-year jail term in 2018 but after an appeal the court said the sentence was too lenient. Monday's ruling comes weeks after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, a top official at Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, on a request from the US. Canada condemned the latest ruling. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: ""It is of extreme concern to us as a government, as it should be to all our international friends and allies, that China has chosen to begin to arbitrarily apply the death penalty, as in this case facing a Canadian."" China was angered by the arrest of Ms Meng, 46, the daughter of Huawei's founder, and the case has soured its relations with both Canada and the US. She was granted bail in December. China has since detained two Canadian nationals, accusing them of endangering national security. Life of Huawei's high-flying heiress What's going on with Huawei? Schellenberg, who is believed to be 36, was arrested in 2014 and accused of planning to smuggle almost 500lb (227kg) of methamphetamine from China to Australia. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in November 2018. But following an appeal, a high court in the north-eastern city of Dalian on Monday sentenced the Canadian national to death. The court also ruled that all of his financial assets must be confiscated. ""I am not a drug smuggler. I came to China as a tourist,"" Schellenberg said just before the verdict was announced, the AFP news agency reports. He has 10 days to appeal. ""All I can really say at this moment is, it is our worst case fear confirmed,"" his aunt, Lauri Nelson-Jones, told the BBC via email. ""Our thoughts are with Robert at this time.  It is rather unimaginable what he must be feeling and thinking.  It is a horrific, unfortunate, heartbreaking situation.  We anxiously anticipate any news regarding an appeal."" China has denied that it is using its legal system to take hostages as bargaining chips in the Huawei case. But for whatever reason China has suddenly begun working hard to push Schellenberg's case to international prominence, taking the highly unusual step of inviting foreign journalists into the court, the BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing reports. And despite the Canadian's insistence that he is innocent, his retrial lasted just a day, with his death sentence coming barely an hour after its conclusion, our correspondent says. She was arrested in Vancouver on 1 December, but was granted bail by a Canadian court several days later. A judge in Canada's western city ruled that she would be under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag.

Speaking from Las Vegas and Los Angeles respectively, Matt and Luke were asked how they felt about how the film had been received.

""I'd done 170 shows last year and having to come back into an environment, it was a really difficult thing.

"Paul Dawson was surprised to find the police had taken an interest in his Facebook post The father of a newborn baby was ""shocked"" to be confronted by police after posting on social media that he accidentally fed his son chilli sauce. Paul Dawson, from Stockton, was out with his partner and five-day-old Ben on 5 January when the mishap occurred. Forgetting he had been eating spicy chicken wings, Mr Dawson put his knuckle in Ben's mouth to pacify him. Cleveland Police said officers visited Mr Dawson after a member of the public complained about his Facebook post. Barber Mr Dawson. 39, said the ""upsetting experience"" of two police officers coming to his home had spoiled his first days with his newborn son. Mr Dawson said Ben showed no ill effects from his brush with hot sauce He said he was at a branch of TGI Fridays when he took hold of Ben to allow his partner Laurencia Wood to eat her food. After wiping his hands on a napkin, he then put a knuckle in Ben's mouth to pacify him. The baby made a ""funny face"", but did not scream or cry, he said. Mr Dawson later wrote on Facebook: ""Apparently five-day-old babies don't like it when their dads put their fingers in their mouths after eating hot wings. Unintentionally by the way. Lol."" Three days later police knocked on his door to ask if he had been feeding Ben hot sauce. Mr Dawson said he had not received an apology A Cleveland Police spokesperson said: ""Police received a call from a member of the public regarding concern for the welfare of a baby. ""As a result, two officers were deployed to speak with the parents to understand the circumstances of the report.

"This video can not be played The sound installation is somewhere in the Namib desert, which is 81,000 sq km The world's oldest desert is to be blessed with one of the most listened-to songs - Africa by Toto. Namibian artist Max Siedentopf has set up a sound installation in the coastal Namib Desert to play on loop, in tribute to the soft rock classic. The 1982 track is quadruple platinum, and was one of the most streamed songs in 2017, with over 440m YouTube views. Mr Siedentopf tells the BBC it is set to play forever, with solar batteries ""to keep Toto going for all eternity"". Why the internet loves Africa by Toto The almost five-minute song has remained popular in today's pop culture, and has been subject to memes and even entire Reddit pages. ""[I] wanted to pay the song the ultimate homage and physically exhibit 'Africa' in Africa,"" explains the 27-year-old artist. ""Some [Namibians] love it and some say it's probably the worst sound installation ever. I think that's a great compliment."" He has chosen an undisclosed spot in the 55-million-year-old Namib desert to set up six speakers attached to an MP3 player with the single track on it. Mr Siedentopf says he hopes the song will play for another 55 million years. ""Most parts of the installation were chosen to be as durable as possible, but I'm sure the harsh environment of the desert will devour the installation eventually."" Until then, only the most loyal Toto fans will be able to find this ""treasure"" among the sands, Mr Siedentopf says. Venue plays Toto's Africa all night.

"This video can not be played Courtney says she wants to live with her mother, as they are ""peas in a pod"" A woman awarded Â£500,000 after being left with severe physical and mental disabilities is homeless after her mother was barred from buying them a home with the money. Courtney Boden was attacked by her father as a baby and given compensation in 2007 to support her. But the government's official solicitor has said her mother, Beverley Neal, who cares for her, cannot benefit from it. The Ministry of Justice said it had ""every sympathy"" for Ms Boden. Ms Neal, from Burnley, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she was ""devastated"". ""I have been caring for Courtney from the start,"" she said. ""We just want a house with three bedrooms so I can carry on looking after Courtney for the rest of our lives and there's room for a respite carer to stay sometimes. ""It's just wrong. Courtney shouldn't have to live like this."" Courtney Boden was awarded Â£500,000 compensation in 2007 Ms Boden, now aged 20, is paralysed down her right-hand side, severely brain damaged and needs someone to look after her every day. She was awarded the compensation by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority to safeguard her welfare. But a judge ruled Ms Neal had failed to protect her - because at first she had not believed her ex-partner had been responsible for her daughter's injuries and had tried to hide the fact she had still been in touch with him. Now, the government's official solicitor - who is in charge of deciding what Ms Boden can spend her trust fund on - has said the money cannot be used to buy a home for the mother and daughter to live in together. Ms Neal admits she was initially reluctant to believe her ex-partner had been responsible for her daughter's injuries - which included broken bones in her arms and legs, broken ribs and a fracture of the skull at four months old. But she said she had ""cleared my name since then and they should be recognising it"". She added that action needed to be taken to change the restrictions surrounding the compensation. ""Courtney's already suffered, and now we're being punished again. ""Surely they can see what a life she's already had, and what Courtney wants."" The official solicitor and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority said they would not comment in detail on an individual case. The Ministry of Justice said on their behalf: ""This was an awful case and we have every sympathy for what Courtney has been through. ""The official solicitor can act as a trustee of funds for vulnerable victims - typically where there is no-one suitable to take on responsibility themselves. ""A trustee will allow a carer access to a fund to ensure daily expenses related to the welfare of a victim can be met. ""It is their duty to administer trusts in a lawful manner and in accordance with the terms of the compensation settlement."" Regarding the family's housing situation, Pendle Borough Council said it had ""been trying to find the right accommodation for [them] but it has been very difficult"". ""We will continue to provide support as she [Ms Neal] tries to find suitable rehousing,"" it said. ""We are happy to look at the option of adapting a property to meet her needs through Pendle Council's disabled facilities grant.""

"The 8.9 carat diamond in its setting A diamond ring worth more than Â£1m has been seized by the National Crime Agency as part of its continuing investigation into a London woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods. The ring was found at a high-class jewellers by investigators looking into the source of Zamira Hajiyeva's vast wealth. She's the first person in the UK to be subject to an Unexplained Wealth Order - a court measure designed to uncover suspected corrupt money hidden in the UK by foreign officials and their families. Mrs Hajiyeva, who denies any wrongdoing, is married to Azerbaijan banker Jahangir Hejiyev, who was convicted and jailed for a massive fraud against a state bank in their home country. Zamira Hajiyeva: Vast wealth under investigation If she cannot prove a legitimate source for her enormous wealth in the UK, the National Crime Agency is expected to apply to seize her Knightsbridge home, situated just behind Harrods, and their Berkshire golf course. During an application on Monday for permission to hold the ring for six months, Westminster Magistrates Court heard that it had been seized last Friday after investigators identified it at a branch of Cartier jewellers. The ring is described as an 8.9 carat ""emerald-cut diamond"". It was bought by Mrs Hajiyeva's husband for Â£1,190,640 and their daughter, Leyla Mahmudova, had taken it to Cartier in July for repair. Mrs Hajiyeva - who is fighting not just to keep her home but also to avoid extradition to Azerbaijan - was not represented at the hearing and the application was granted unopposed. Woman who spent Â£16m in Harrods revealed District Judge Michael Snow said: ""There's a clear evidential link between the ring and Mr Hajiyev and he has been convicted of substantial fraud. ""That satisfies me that there are grounds to suspect that this is recoverable property."" That means the NCA can hold the ring in secure storage while it looks into where the money came from to buy it. Last November, the NCA seized Â£400,000 of jewellery from the world-famous Christies auction house, which had been put up for auction by Mrs Hajiyeva's daughter. Those 49 items can be held by investigators until May.

"Tulip Siddiq was told by doctors she should have a caesarean section on Monday or Tuesday A Labour MP has delayed giving birth in order to vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal, reigniting the debate over proxy voting in Parliament. Tulip Siddiq has been advised by doctors to have a caesarean section, but agreed to push the procedure back to Thursday so she can vote on Tuesday. The Hampstead and Kilburn MP plans to go through the lobby in a wheelchair. Fellow Labour MP Harriet Harman said Ms Siddiq ""should not have to choose"" between her caesarean and her vote. Speaker of the Commons John Bercow said that a proxy vote for Ms Siddiq would be his ""preference"", but it was not in his power to grant it. However, he was happy for her to be ""nodded through"". This process normally means an MP's vote can be counted if they are anywhere on the parliamentary estate, rather than going through the voting lobby. It has traditionally been used for unwell MPs, such as during the votes on the Maastricht Treaty in the 1990s,where some were driven onto the estate by ambulance to be ""nodded through"" on crucial votes,external. Proxy voting by MPs 'good for democracy' Maternity leave MP accuses Tories over vote Sick MP's anger after 'undignified' vote Ms Siddiq told the Evening Standard that she had a difficult first pregnancy with her two-year-old daughter,external, and was originally due to give birth to her second child by elective caesarean section on 4 February. But after developing gestational diabetes, her doctors recommended she bring the date forward to a delivery this Monday or Tuesday. She spoke to medical staff at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London, and they agreed to the delay. Ms Siddiq said: ""If my son enters the world even one day later than the doctors advised, but it's a world with a better chance of a strong relationship between Britain and Europe, then that's worth fighting for.""

There is a system in Parliament for MPs who cannot make a vote called ""pairing"" - where an MP on either side of an issue agree to not vote, so cancelling each other out. However, Ms Siddiq said she did not trust the systemafter Tory chairman Brandon Lewis was accused of breaking the system when he voted on a Trade Bill, despite being paired with Lib Dem Jo Swinson, who was on maternity leave. He later apologised for making an ""honest mistake"". ""If the pairing system is not honoured, there's nothing I can do, and it's going to be a very close vote,"" said Ms Siddiq. ""I've had no pressure at all from the whips to come and vote but this is the biggest vote of my lifetime. ""I've sat down with my husband Chris and he said to me this is my choice, but that he would support me."" The issue of proxy voting and parental leave has been debated twice in Parliament, but a system to allow it to happen has yet to be agreed, despite support from all sides of the Commons. Mr Bercow said: ""It is extremely regrettable that almost a year after the first debate and over four months after the second debate this change has not been made. This is frankly lamentable... and very disadvantageous to the reputation of this House. ""It really is time in pursuit of the express will of this House that reactionary forces are overcome. And if people want to express their opposition, let them not do it murkily behind the scenes. Let them have the character up front to say they oppose progressive change.

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"Lloyds Banking Group has been criticised for introducing new overdraft charges on Monday ahead of a proposed crackdown later this year. An MP described the fees - which will equate to an annual interest charge of up to 61% - as ""unacceptable"". The Financial Conduct Authority wants to scrap overdraft fees and replace them with a single interest rate. Lloyds Banking Group said: ""The changes were announced prior to the FCA's latest recommendations."" MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, said: ""While these fees might be legal, they are not within the spirit of the FCA's recommendations."" She said: ""It is unacceptable for financial institutions to try to game the system at the expense of customers, particularly those struggling with their finances."" Ms Reeves added that the new fees would ""increase the charges for the vast majority of customers"". A quarter of current account holders will be hit by the new charges, which come into effect on 14 January  for Bank of Scotland, 28 January for Lloyds Bank and 4 February for Halifax customers. Rather than paying 1p every day for every Â£7 of overdraft used, the cost for the first Â£1,250 borrowed will increase to 1p a day per Â£6. That works out at an annual interest charge of 61%, much higher than widely-criticised guarantor loans or expensive credit cards aimed at people with poor credit records. The cost for borrowing between Â£1,250 and Â£2,500 remains at 1p a day per Â£7, while borrowing more than that will be charged at 1p a day per Â£8. The new tariff means anyone borrowing less than Â£4,100 on their overdraft will pay more. TheFinancial Conduct Authority,externalwants banks to charge a single interest rate for all types of overdraft. Under its proposals, banks would set a single rate for going into the red and customers would be able to compare banks for the best deal. The City watchdog has also proposed a ban on any fixed fees linked to an overdraft. ""The FCA isn't tinkering around the edges, it wants to radically change the UK overdraft market to make it simpler, fairer and easier for consumers to manage and compare,"" said analyst Andrew Hagger of Moneycomms. 'We were one bill away from disaster' 'Admitting problems helped us get debt-free' How much debt do UK households have? The bank maintains that there is nothing wrong with its new fees. It said they were in the spirit of the FCA's views ""in terms of removing costs for unplanned and complexity of charging"". Andrew Hagger disagreed. He said: ""I'm surprised that the increase is going ahead, as it doesn't fit in any way shape or form with what the regulator wants to see for personal overdrafts."" Ms Reeves said: ""We need an end to the excessive fees that continue to harm borrowers, particularly those with persistent money problems."" She added: ""Lloyds should rethink these fees as a matter of urgency."" There are arranged overdrafts, when current account holders borrow up to a limit agreed with, or offered by, the bank. About 19 million people use one each year. Some banks also have unarranged overdrafts, with extra or higher charges for going beyond this limit or going into the red without permission, used by 14 million people a year. Those aged 35 to 44 are most likely to have some form of overdraft, while about 10% of all 18 to 24-year-olds have exceeded their overdraft limit in the past 12 months. For customers, the charges and fees are difficult to compare - with a mix of interest rates, daily fees or monthly fees among banks. Those costs could be high even with a small debt. For example, someone could be charged Â£5 a day for borrowing Â£100 on overdraft. The majority of unarranged overdraft charges are paid by only 1.5% of customers. They pay about Â£450 a year in fees and charges, according to the FCA. On average, consumers in more deprived areas paid twice as much in charges for unarranged overdrafts as did consumers living in less deprived areas,the FCA found,external.

"The plane crashed into a wall separating the airport from a residential area and then hit a house A cargo plane crash near the Iranian capital, Tehran, has killed 15 people, Iran's army says. The Boeing 707 came off the runway and hit a residential area while trying to land at Fath airport in Karaj, 40km (25 miles) west of Tehran, in poor weather. Only a flight engineer of the 16 people on board was found alive, with no-one reportedly killed on the ground. The plane's ""black box"" voice recorder has been found at the crash site, local media reported. Only the plane's flight engineer is known to have survived An army spokesman confirmed to state TV that the plane belonged to Iran, and that all those on board were Iranian citizens. Fath airport belongs to Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps, and is located in the central Iranian province of Alborz. The cargo aircraft was transporting meat from the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek. Its wreckage was found smouldering among houses in a residential area between Fath and another airport, Payam International Airport. Local media report that the houses were empty at the time of the crash. Rescue teams are now at the site of the wreckage This is the latest in a series of Iranian plane crashes in recent years. In February last year, Iran's Aseman Airlines was ordered to ground its fleet of ATR planes afterone of them crashed into the Zagros mountains. All 66 people on board died. And in August 2014, a Sepahan Airlines' Antonov planecrashed shortly after taking off from Tehran, killing 39 of the 40 people on board. It is believed engine failure was the cause Years of tough US sanctions have prevented officials from purchasing new planes and critical spare parts. A landmark 2015 deal between Tehran and Washington brought renewed hope that the situation would change - but this was dashed last May when the US pulled out, reinstating sanctions that had been lifted.

"Theresa May has failed to achieve the most important goal she set herself after delaying the vote on her Brexit deal last month. Assurances from Brussels on the Northern Ireland backstop,laid out in a letter today,,externaldo not go far enough to allay the concerns of the Democratic Unionist Party. Her failure on this front means that, far from being reassured, the DUP is now unsettled. Nigel Dodds, the party leader at Westminster, says: ""Rather than reassure us, the Tusk and Juncker letter bolsters our concerns."" The DUP response represents a blow to the prime minister, who pledged to win back the Unionists after winning the vote of confidence in her leadership last month. Downing St regards the DUP as ""dominos""; with the Unionists on board, Tory Brexiteers would fall into line, her deal would stand a good chance of passing and the prime minister would have a viable way of governing up until the next scheduled election in 2022. Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - DUP May: Back Brexit deal 'for country's sake' Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop The EU's declaration that it will not renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, nor offer clarifications that undermine it, came as little surprise to the DUP. The Unionists had been told by a senior figure in No 10 that the prime minister had not formally tabled their demands on the backstop - the insurance policy against a hard border which would tie Northern Ireland into the EU's orbit if the UK and the EU fail to negotiate a future relationship by the end of the transition period. The DUP wanted one of three demands on the backstop: scrap it, secure an end date or secure a unilateral exit mechanism. In her letter to the EU the prime minister floated the last two of these demands but made clear she had not formally tabled them. Nigel Dodds said: ""Despite a letter of supposed reassurance from the European Union, there are no 'legally binding assurances' as the prime minister talked about in December. In fact, there is nothing new. Nothing has changed."" The DUP was always highly unlikely to support the Northern Ireland backstop for one very simple reason. It would mean that Northern Ireland would be treated differently to the rest of the UK, placing it in the EU customs union and largely within the single market. Assurances from No 10 that there would be one single UK customs territory cut no ice with the DUP. Is the EU about to rescue Theresa May? Grieve: Delay Brexit if deal is rejected PM's Brexit plan is 'dead', says Foster Any hope that the DUP might be persuaded to support the deal was killed off when the legal advice by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, was published last month. The following sentence was the coup de grace: ""The implications of NI remaining in the EU single market for goods, while GB is not, is that for regulatory purposes GB is essentially treated as a third country by NI for goods passing from GB into NI."" In his first objection to today's exchange of letters, Nigel Dodds says that ""everything the attorney general said in his legal advice regarding the backstop, still stands"". So the question is how the prime minister misread a party - with the word Unionist in its title - by assuming that they could support a deal which would treat their part of the Union differently to the rest of the Union. It appears the prime minister may have made one or more of three miscalculations: Misreading internal DUP relations. The prime minister has a good relationship with the DUP leader Arlene Foster, leading some in government to believe she is more reasonable than other DUP figures. While the DUP may not speak with one voice, the party does largely have one view on the backstop. Misunderstanding the DUP's history. Some in No 10 may have assumed that the DUP would behave in the manner of the once mighty UUP, a former sister party of the Conservatives which had a history of siding with the Tories. But the DUP will draw stumps if they think the Union is in jeopardy. Money. Many ministers have suggested the DUP can be bought - dangle a few extra billions and they will fall into line. But the history of the DUP shows that where the Union is concerned the DUP cannot be bought. Theresa May regards herself as a Unionist who, for all her setbacks, may be remembered as the prime minster who saved the Union after the SNP lost so many seats in the 2017 general election. But No 10 may well have misread the DUP, with major consequences for this prime minister. You can watchNewsnighton BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or oniPlayer.

"Drivers from the UK living in the EU have been urged to swap their licence for a local one as soon as possible in case there is a no-deal Brexit. If they do not, they might have to pass a test in the country where they live. The government also said,externalthose living in the UK who want to drive in the EU after 29 March might need an international driving permit (IDP). It warned British licence holders living in the EU they should exchange their licence soon to avoid any delays. The AA estimated,externalas many as half a million ex-pats living in France and Spain would have to take a new test if they had not exchanged their licence, should there be no deal. You are only allowed one EU driving licence,externalat any one time, which is why people currently have to exchange their licence, rather having both one from the UK and one from another EU country. How will Brexit affect my European holiday? What next if deal rejected? The guidance - updated on Monday - told Britons living in the EU that from 29 March, when the UK is set to leave the union, that ""in the event that there is no EU exit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in the EU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there"". It continued: ""You should consider exchanging your UK driving licence for an EU driving licence as soon as possible. ""Increased demand may lead to longer processing times and delays to exchanging driving licences the closer it is to 29 March 2019."" Those affected would be able to have a UK licence again if they return to live in the UK. For drivers living in the UK and travelling to the EU and EEA, the IDP might be needed in some countries in addition to a UK driving licence, but this would not apply in Ireland. The international permits cost Â£5.50 and are available at some post offices. Peers debate private members' bills Don't let British people down, May tells MPs What's next if MPs reject May's deal?

"I know that, right here, I've been writing about, and we've been discussing, our prime minister's and politicians' Brexit choices for more than two-and-a-half years. And, yes indeed, there have been many, many times we have reported it is a crunch moment, a crucial day, or a vital moment. And each mini-drama, each bizarre twist, each day where we have moved further from anything like politics-as-usual, has had meaning. That's true of the prime minister's speech in Florence, the meltingly hot cabinet day out at Chequers, Boris Johnson stalking out of the cabinet, or indeed, the EU saying ""non, non, non"" at Salzburg, or Gina Miller's Supreme Court appeal, where on Parliament's behalf - on behalf of all of us in a sense - she won a bigger say over Brexit for MPs. Ministers battle to save Brexit deal Reality Check: Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? I'm confused... what's happening with Brexit? How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Barring an almost incredible-to-imagine second delay to the vote, Tuesday is when MPs get the chance to express that wish - to say yes or no to the deal that's on the table. The weird thing about it is that unless, again, something almost impossible-to-ponder happens, we know they are, in large numbers, going to say no. There is precious little jeopardy in saying that, althoughbe sceptical of any predictions about the size of the defeat. MPs don't even trust each other on rebellions, let alone always stick to what they may brag about before. If you take a clear ""no"" vote as read then, there is a possibility that moves afoot to stop us leaving without a deal, will be taken by parliamentarians who have been studying the rule books very closely. Gina Miller's court case won MPs the right for a bigger say on Brexit In recent months amid the cacophony, Parliament has steadily been taking more and more control of the Brexit process, if not ownership of the problems. And it's likely this week there will be another attempt, maybe even before the vote, to remove the risk that we can leave without a deal. Of course it would need a majority of MPs' support (always, always, easier said than done). But remember even if they do, the immediate question will be: for what? At the moment there is no majority in Parliament for any plan that has actually been put on the table. And some cabinet ministers believe the attempt to snarl up the process in that way could be blocked in any case. If that's so, well, several cabinet ministers from different parts of the Tory party, have told me they expect the prime minister will have at least another attempt to get her deal, or something rather like it, through Parliament. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. But despite her reputation for secrecy, this week she will have to make something clear. Will she shift to what many in Parliament want, a closer relationship with the EU, perhaps moving across to some kind of customs union? Or will she ramp up preparations for no-deal, trying (which many just don't believe) to show that she really would be willing to walk away with no deal, in the hope that pressure would persuade the EU to crack and make it plain she is not for turning? That is likely to be the call she'll have to make. One cabinet minister told me: ""This week it distils into what people truly think - between those who are really scared of leaving without a deal, and those who are really scared of not leaving."" Even after all this time, the Tories, and this Brexit prime minister, are still faced with the same fundamental choice there always has been - take the risk of going it alone with a dramatic break from the EU, with all the turmoil that might go alongside it. Or cleave to a closer relationship with the EU, some kind of customs union by another name, that could tear the Tory party apart. Lord Hattersley calls for another referendum Blocking Brexit 'may cause far-right surge' Grieve: Delay Brexit if deal is rejected Delay is a tactic that has been used by Theresa May with great effect, arguably keeping her - even if unhappily - in office. Every route that she might choose has risks, perhaps none of the choices are tempting for Number 10. But on Tuesday night votes will actually be counted - the numbers, and decisions after they come, just won't wait much longer.

"Tulip Siddiq was told by doctors she should have a caesarean section on Monday or Tuesday A Labour MP has delayed giving birth in order to vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal, reigniting the debate over proxy voting in Parliament. Tulip Siddiq has been advised by doctors to have a caesarean section, but agreed to push the procedure back to Thursday so she can vote on Tuesday. The Hampstead and Kilburn MP plans to go through the lobby in a wheelchair. Fellow Labour MP Harriet Harman said Ms Siddiq ""should not have to choose"" between her caesarean and her vote. Speaker of the Commons John Bercow said that a proxy vote for Ms Siddiq would be his ""preference"", but it was not in his power to grant it. However, he was happy for her to be ""nodded through"". This process normally means an MP's vote can be counted if they are anywhere on the parliamentary estate, rather than going through the voting lobby. It has traditionally been used for unwell MPs, such as during the votes on the Maastricht Treaty in the 1990s,where some were driven onto the estate by ambulance to be ""nodded through"" on crucial votes,external.

But after developing gestational diabetes, her doctors recommended she bring the date forward to a delivery this Monday or Tuesday. She spoke to medical staff at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London, and they agreed to the delay. Ms Siddiq said: ""If my son enters the world even one day later than the doctors advised, but it's a world with a better chance of a strong relationship between Britain and Europe, then that's worth fighting for.""

"Trips across the Channel won't be the same for Britons and EU citizens Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been keen to stress that the rights of EU citizens living in the UK will be protected in the case of a no-deal Brexit. But the EU cannot give such a guarantee for UK citizens because it would be up to individual member states. The Withdrawal Agreement, negotiated by former UK PM Theresa May, offers temporary guarantees for UK citizens in EU countries, but that has failed to get Parliamentary approval and a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is a very real possibility. Under no deal, a host of things would change overnight - what critics call the ""cliff edge"". But here we will focus on the situation of Britons living in another EU country (in the EU27). About 1.3m UK-born people are resident in the EU27, while the UK hosts about 3.2m EU27 nationals. The withdrawal deal would enable them to keep their current freedom of movement and other EU citizenship rights, until 31 December 2020, when the Brexit transition period ends. The Withdrawal Agreement - what it all means As for no deal, there is huge uncertainty about what it will mean for Britons living in France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere. The priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country. The European Commission, in itscontingency plan for no-deal Brexit,external, urges the EU27 to ""take a generous approach to the rights of UK citizens in the EU, provided that this approach is reciprocated by the UK"". It says the EU27 ""should adopt a pragmatic approach to granting temporary residence status"". Brexit: A really simple guide Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? How many Brits abroad are there? There is uncertainty over how a no deal would affect flights in Europe The Commission - the EU executive - has proposed visa-free travel for British visitors to the EU, provided the UK reciprocates. Under thepolitical declaration agreed alongside the withdrawal deal,externalthe UK says ""the principle of free movement of persons between the Union and the United Kingdom will no longer apply"" after the transition. It speaks of ""non-discrimination"" and ""full reciprocity"" and says both sides ""aim to provide, through their domestic laws, for visa-free travel for short-term visits"". However, that declaration is not legally binding; it spells out ambitions for the future UK-EU relationship, yet to be negotiated. Under no deal, the declaration would be null and void. The UK would immediately be treated by the EU as a ""third country"" like other non-EU states. So the rules for Britons in the EU could well be the same as for Americans or Chinese - it will depend on the rules of the individual member states. Some of them haveannounced interim measures,externalto protect UK citizens in the case of a no-deal Brexit, but they are generally only temporary, for example, Spain will offer transitional measures for 21 months after Brexit, Germany offers protection for nine months and France will put them in place for one year. Brexit and holidays: What do I need to know? British workers are integral to Airbus airliner production in Europe No deal would immediately hit Britons whose work currently takes them to more than one EU country. They would no longer be on a level playing field vis-a-vis EU citizens, who can easily move to another EU country and start a new job there. For Britons, post-Brexit, there will be more bureaucracy. Mobility in Europe is important for many private sector workers, especially in the tech sector,such as computer game designers,external. Specialists involved in pan-European research projects also need to be able to travel easily across the EU, often at short notice. Daniel Tetlow ofcampaign group British in Germany,externalsays ""Brits are now being discriminated against in job applications"". Post-Brexit, he said: ""I have the right only to continue working in Germany - I'm effectively landlocked. ""This has huge career implications for all UK citizens, not just those living in the EU, as is often misunderstood,"" he told the BBC. British in Germany is part of the coalition British in Europe. It is not clear which UK professional qualifications will be recognised in the EU post-Brexit, and vice versa. Those details are yet to be negotiated. Under the withdrawal deal, British students in the EU27 can continue under the current system. But from 2021 they may face much higher tuition fees - those that non-EU students have to pay. Only Germany and Norway (which applies EU rules) offer free tuition for international students. Why some UK citizens face Brexit dilemma No-deal Brexit 'biggest threat' to universities Job search in Berlin: Conditions will change for British jobseekers No deal would mean the current reciprocal healthcare, shared by the UK and the EU27, would no longer apply. It could send health insurance premiums soaring for UK citizens who need sufficient cover for holidays or work in the EU. No deal would most likely delay the registration of some medicines and/or delivery of them. Britons could find their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) - a passport to emergency medical treatment - is no longer valid in some EU countries. What will happen to the EHIC after Brexit? Will Britons living in the EU still get healthcare? The House of Commons Library says,externalthat post-Brexit, if a UK national moves to the EU, access to benefits will depend on the host country's immigration policy and the terms of any bilateral social security agreement it has with the UK. In the EU, social security contributions are co-ordinated. So someone who has worked in more than one member state can make just one application to the relevant agency where they are living when they reach pension age. That agency notifies any other EU state where the individual has worked, and the national insurance contribution that he/she paid there becomes part of the pension. That reciprocity disappears under a no-deal scenario. It is not clear whether any old bilateral UK deals with individual EU states on social security will be revived. The UK tax treatment of overseas pension transfers could change post-Brexit. Transfers from the UK to non-EU countries have been subject to a 25% UK ""overseas tax charge"" since 2017. There is no guarantee that tax-free transfers will continue for UK pensioners living in the EU. What does Brexit mean for UK pensioners living in Europe? BenalmÃ¡dena, Costa del Sol: British pensioners face Brexit uncertainty What about the EU27 countries where most UK citizens live? Of the estimated 310,000 Britons living in Spain, about 65,000 are resident and in permanent work. About one-third of the 310,000 are pensioners. No deal would be much less of a problem for a Briton with dual nationality. But Spain does not allow it - except for veterans of the 1930s left-wing International Brigades and Sephardi Jews who can prove a family connection with Spain. For other Britons, acquiring Spanish citizenship means surrendering a UK passport. ""Third country"" nationals in Spain have to prove annual income of at least â¬26,000 (Â£23,000; $30,000) to remain legally resident - and that could be a problem for some British pensioners, post-Brexit. Spain is offering a 21-month grace period of protection for UK nationals, after which proof of residence will be needed. Why is everyone talking about Gibraltar? Whatever happens, both governments say, the Common Travel Area (CTA) will remain in force. That is a relief for Britons living in Ireland and the people of Northern Ireland. Under the CTA, Irish and British citizens can travel and work freely in both countries. It is also recognised by the EU. The big risk is that no deal could bring back a ""hard"" Northern Ireland border - something the withdrawal deal goes to great lengths to prevent, with the controversial backstop plan. What will Ireland do if thereâs no deal? French MPs have granted the government emergency powers to issue decrees in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The government says it will not impose visas on British visitors, provided the UK government also maintains visa-free travel. Britons living in France will have their rights protected for a one-year transitional period, and will have to apply for a residence permit in the first six months. The French village that fears for its Brits From 31 October - in the event of no deal - Britons will have nine months to register for a new residence permit. The bureaucratic formalities vary from one German state to the next, under the federal system. Berlin has the largest number of Britons - there has been a big influx since the 2016 Brexit referendum.

"Peers looking at the Civil Partnerships Bill Stalking Protection Bill debated as well The week ahead suggests it is the calm between Brexit storms in Parliament: but a quiet agenda can reveal hidden surprises. House of LordsParliament Peers approve second reading of the Parking (Code of Practice) Bill and it moves onto committee stage. With that the Lords adjourn for the day. Peers return on Monday - as do we, for more coverage of Parliament. Thanks for joining us. House of LordsParliament Peers are now debating the Parking (Code of Practice) Bill at second reading. This bill - which was introduced into the Commons by the Conservative MP Sir Greg Knight - regulates the operation and management of private parking facilities. You canread more about the bill on the Parliament website,external. House of LordsParliament Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who introduced the bill in the Commons, told the campagning group, the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, that there was currently a gap in the law, especially for those stalked by strangers. She said the bill aimed to introduce a new Stalking Protection Order to protect victims at the early stages of an investigation. The order would be civil orders, making them easier to impose, breaching their requirements would be a criminal offence with serious consequences. Read more aboutDr Wollaston's aims here,external. House of LordsParliament Peers have moved on to the Stalking Protection Bill. This bill was introduced to the Commons by Sarah Wollaston, the Tory MP and chair of the Health select committee. It's designed to provide protection for those at risk of stalking. Civil Partnership, Marriages and Deaths Bill House of LordsParliament The Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths Bill was introduced to the Commons by Tory MP Tim Laughton. It makes provision for opposite sex couples to enter a civil partnership and it also allows for the mother of each party to a marriage or civil partnership to be a witness on the marriage certificate. Welcome to our coverage of the House of Lords today - peers are going to be discussing three private members' bills. The Stalking Protection Bill and the Parking (Code of Practice) Bill will both be debated at second reading later today. But first, from 10am, it's the Civil Partnerships, Marriages and Deaths (Registration Etc.) Bill. House of LordsParliament There were three debates in the upper chamber today: two on Brexit, the first on steps required for another referendum, the second on its effect on the integrity of the UK. A third debate on the threat to the health of young people by technology had peers wishing for more research in the area. Questions were asked of the government on everything from the UK's nuclear power industry, to teaching art and design in schools. The Lords returns on Monday at 2.30pm. Technology and young people's health debate House of LordsParliament Labour's media spokesperson Lord Griffiths of Burry Port says that there needs to be research on online gambling and how it affects children. He adds that children may well see nine junk food adverts during half an hour's worth of TV. Culture Minister Lord Ashton of Hyde says the internet offers ""opportunities"" but there are concerns over the relationship children can develop with it. ""We do recognise that more research is required"" to better understand new technologies, he adds. He says he himself finds evidence on screen time in the media ""confusing and contradictory"". House of CommonsParliament The debate on children's social care finished. Labour MP Bill Esterson is concluding the parliamentary week with his adjournment debate, which focuses on awareness of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. That's it for our coverage of the Commons today, join us again on Monday from 2.30pm. As Andrea Leadsom confirmed earlier today, that's when the government will table a motion outlining its new plan for breaking the deadlock over Brexit. Children's Social Care House of CommonsParliament Responding for the government, Education Minister Nadhim Zahawi says the importance of children's social care ""too often goes unrecognised"". He notes that the sector only grabs headlines ""when things go wrong"". Mr Zahawi says interventions by the government in children's social services that are underperforming has ""brought results"". He adds that there are ""financial constraints on children's services"", but it is being proven that local authorities can achieve great things. He says the government hopes that by 2022, fewer than 10% of local authorities will be rated as 'inadequate' by Ofsted, and that they ""intervene early and in the right way"". Technology and young people's health debate House of LordsParliament Crossbencher Viscount Colville of Culross says the World Health Organization is considering including gaming addiction in their official diagnostics as a condition. In China and South Korea, gaming addiction is ""widespread amongst young men"", he says. The government is working with schools, and game developers are now including time alert warnings, he warns. Crossbencher and former civil servant Lord Bichard says that ""very few live streaming sites"" have taken steps to stop potential child abusers. Fortnite has upwards of 45m players, he says, and children underneath the age rating of 12 can join and provide their email addresses as age verification is not performed by the game. He says there should be an ""independent regulator"" as ""every"" attempt at self regulation has ""failed"". Children's Social Care Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow families minister Emma Lewell-Buck - who was a children's social worker before becoming an MP - says the system is failing children and parents. ""The scale of this neglect toward our most vulnerable children is colossal"", she says - with an ""unprecedented rate of referrals"" and falling numbers of foster carers. 41% of children's services are now unable to meet their statutory duties, she says, with 140,000 children on the fringe of services and not receiving the care they need. ""Children in desperate need of care are being neglected"", she says, quoting Conservative MPs who are warning of a ""fast approaching Baby P tragedy"". She says the children's minister has ignored her concerns repeatedly, adding: ""it is clear to everybody except this government that their department lacks a cohesive strategy and is consumed by piecemeal, misguided measures."" ""At the moment, the idea that every child matters could not be further from the reality"". Children's Social Care Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Laura Smith says respite care is an important aspect of children's social care: ""everybody needs a break sometimes, and nobody more so than someone who is caring for a loved one with complex needs"". Many children's care services are provided by charities reliant on ever-decreasing government funding, forcing both organisations and parents to ""battle"" for survival, she says. ""I am a warrior, but I just want to be a mum"", she quotes one constituent whose disabled child is supported by children's social care services. She says the government must address the Â£3bn shortfall in social care funding, urging ministers to ""put children at the heart of the upcoming spending review"". Technology and young people's health debate House of LordsParliament The Bishop of St Albans says that children see gambling adverts on the internet and TV. ""Digital natives"" are ""most at risk"" from the ""digital switch that the gambling industry"" is currently undergoing, he says. He warns that young people can follow gambling sites without age verification. Technology and young people's health debate House of LordsParliament The Lords have now moved onto their final debate today, on the use of technology and the health and wellbeing of young people. Crossbencher Baroness Kidron says that it is ""ludicrous"" that 61% of children under the minimum Facebook age of 13 have an account, and that Twitter has ""half a million pornographic images posted to it daily, despite it being a news app"". Labour peer Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall says that all technology has ""good sides and bad sides"". Children's Social Care House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Lyn Brown says 60% cuts to children's services have made it ""so much harder"" for organisations to work with vulnerable children and families ""effectively and early"". It costs more money when you take a child into care than preventing a child from going into care, she says, referring to the cuts as a ""massive mistake"". She adds that 130,000 children were homeless over Christmas, most put up in temporary accommodation and ""torn from schools, families and support networks"". Ms Brown says the government must ""do more"" to help vulnerable children in society, and this should be something all MPs should push towards together. Children's Social Care House of CommonsParliament Opening the debate, Conservative MP Tim Loughton says children's social care is the sort of ""bread and butter"" issue that Parliament ""should be spending more time on"". He says government data shows the number of looked-after children is ""at its highest ever,"" and in early 2018 there were 75,420 children in care in the UK. More children are coming into care with more complex problems, he adds, noting that it is ""an impending crisis"". Mr Loughton says more money needs to be invested in children's social care, as it costs ""about Â£56,000 a year"" to look after a child in care, and at the minute there is ""a significant shortfall of funding"", with poorer areas ""most affected"". ""We are failing to do enough early to prevent babies having to be taken into care because their parents have not had enough support"", he adds. Brexit referendum legislation debate House of LordsParliament Brexit Minister Lord Callanan says the 2016 referendum was ""historic"" because of the high turnout. He says it is the government's ""firm view"" that there can be no second vote, which he adds would ""disrespect"" the result of the first referendum. ""There has been no significant change in public opinion"", he says. Labour's Lord Adonis asks if the Cabinet Office is making secret preparations for a second referendum. Lord Callanan responds: ""it is a matter of firm government policy that we will not be holding another referendum"". Brexit referendum legislation debate House of LordsParliament Opposition spokeswoman Baroness Wheeler says while it may seem ""premature"", it is good that these questions are being raised by members of the Lords today. She says that there is a ""significant letter"" in The Times today from 127 business leaders who are calling for a second referendum. The priority for Labour at the moment, she says, is to try and ""find a way through the impasse"". She says she hopes that the government will not fall back on the ""usual responses"" that a second referendum would be an ""assault to democracy"" in their response this afternoon. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Police have arrested 55 men in connection with historical child sex abuse cases in West Yorkshire. The men are from Dewsbury, Batley and Bradford and the arrests began in November, according to West Yorkshire Police. All the men were interviewed and released under investigation, the force said. The claims made by seven women relate to abuse against them as children between 2002 and 2009. The allegations are connected to offences in the Kirklees area, predominantly in the towns of Dewsbury and Batley. Det Insp Ian Thornes said: ""This investigation demonstrates the force's ongoing commitment to the investigation of both current and non-recent sexual offences against children. ""Child sexual abuse and exploitation is an abhorrent and heinous crime and one which affects some of the most vulnerable people in our society."" The force had specialist safeguarding units across the county and worked with local authorities and charities to ""bring the perpetrators to justice"", he said. Latest news and updates from Yorkshire Det Insp Thornes urged any victims of sexual abuse, whether recent or historical, to report it to the police.

"This video can not be played Poland mourns mayor's death after stabbing The mayor of the Polish city of Gdansk has died in hospital, a day after being stabbed at a charity event. Pawel Adamowicz, 53, was attacked on stage in front of hundreds of people on Sunday. He was taken to hospital for stab injuries and underwent five hours of surgery at a local hospital. A 27-year-old with a criminal record has been arrested over the attack. Police believe he used a media pass to gain access to the stage. Poland's health minister on Monday confirmed Mr Adamowicz had died. ""We couldn't win,"" Lukasz Szumowski told local media, referring to the battle to save his life. Thousands attended vigils across Polish cities on Monday evening, including in Gdansk. President Andrzej Duda described the attack as an ""evil hard to imagine"". This video can not be played 'Mum, this man has a knife!' - witness describes the moment before Gdansk Mayor Pawel Adamowicz is fatally stabbed He said the day of the politician's funeral would be observed as a day of national mourning. The mayor was stabbed on Sunday while attending the Great Orchestra of Christmas charity - an annual event where volunteers raise money for medical equipment in hospitals. Moments before he was attacked, he posted a picture from the stage on Instagram. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Television footage from the event showed the suspect rushing the stage and stabbing the mayor several times. He then shouted to the crowd before being tackled to the ground and arrested. Paramedics tried to resuscitate Mr Adamowicz at the scene, before transferring him to a hospital. Polish media say the suspect is a 27-year-old named Stefan - but his full identity has so far been withheld. A police spokesman said the man had a long criminal history, including a bank robbery and an attack on a police officer. They also confirmed that he was released from prison late last year. Police say they are looking into how the suspect was able to breach the event's security. While on stage, he reportedly shouted ""Adamowicz is dead"" and said the Civic Platform party, which led the previous government and had supported Mr Adamowicz's re-election as an independent candidate, had wrongfully imprisoned him. He also alleged he had been tortured behind bars. People gathered outside the hospital where the mayor is being treated The suspect will undergo psychological assessment to see whether he can be held criminally responsible for the attack, prosecutor Krzysztof Sierak said at a press conference on Monday. Mr Adamowicz was a popular figure - known best for his liberal political views and extensive tenure as mayor. The father-of-two was from Gdansk and had held the position for two decades. He first came to power in 1998 - and had been re-elected four times since, including in November. Who was Pawel Adamowicz? The mayor studied law and became involved in politics at an early age Doctors said the victim sustained injuries to his heart, as well as cuts to his diaphragm and abdomen. Surgeons said he was given 41 units of blood during a five-hour operation on Sunday. After news of the severity of his condition broke, local residents queued at the hospital to donate blood. The BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw says his murder has left Poland in a state of shock. Politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned the attack. On Sunday, Interior Minister Joachim Brudzinski described it as ""an act of inexplicable barbarism"". Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki described is death as a ""huge tragedy"" for Poland.

"Syrian Kurds have been protesting against Turkish threats to carry out a new offensive Turkey has dismissed President Donald Trump's threat to ""devastate"" its economy if it attacks Kurdish forces in Syria after a pullout of US troops. ""You cannot get anywhere by threatening Turkey economically,"" Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said. US forces and the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) have fought in northern Syria against Islamic State. Turkey regards the YPG as terrorists. Mr Trump and Turkey's president again discussed Syria on Monday. In a phone call, Mr Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke about the need to create a ""security zone"" in northern Syria, the Turkish presidency said. President Trump stressed that Turkey should not ""mistreat the Kurds and other Syrian Democratic Forces with whom we have fought to defeat"" IS, the White House said. Mr Trump also ""expressed the desire to work together to address Turkey's security concerns"" in north-eastern Syria. Syrians: 'We are tired of war' US withdrawal backs Kurds in a corner Who are the Kurds? In December, the US president announced that Washington would pull out all troops from Syria because the Islamic State militant group had been ""defeated"". The sudden move shocked allies and led to criticism. Several senior US military officials resigned shortly afterwards. There were also fears that Kurds in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which had partnered with the US, would be attacked by Turkey once the US withdrew. Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday that the withdrawal from Syria had begun, and that the US would ""devastate Turkey economically if they hit the Kurds"". He also said any remaining IS fighters could be attacked from the air, and that a 20-mile (32km) ""safe zone"" could be established. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump offered no specifics on how the US could hurt Turkey's economy, and his announcement appeared to catch his advisers by surprise. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is currently touring the Middle East, responded to questions about Mr Trump's threat with: ""You'll have to ask the president... We have applied economic sanctions in many places, I assume he is speaking about those kinds of things."" Meanwhile, Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu described Mr Trump's tweet as a ""domestic policy message"" to critics. Mr Cavusoglu has rejected Mr Trump's threats, saying: ""We have said multiple times that we will not fear or be deterred by any threat."" He also criticised Mr Trump's methods, saying: ""Strategic alliances should not be discussed over Twitter or social media."" However, US sanctions have had an impact on Turkey's economy before. The Trump administration imposed sanctions and trade tariffs in August, amid a row over a detained US pastor - contributing to a sharp drop in the value of the Turkish lira. Pastor Andrew Brunson was released in October. Turkey's lira slump explained Is Turkey heading for an economic crisis? Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said Turkey expected the US to ""honour our strategic partnership"". ""Terrorists can't be your partners and allies,"" he said. Approximately 30% of Syria is controlled by the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance Over the weekend, before Mr Trump's latest tweets, Mr Pompeo said he had spoken to Mr Cavusoglu by phone and was ""optimistic"" that an agreement could be reached with Turkey to protect Kurdish fighters. Mr Pompeo said the US recognised ""the Turkish people's right and Mr Erdogan's right to defend their country from terrorists"". ""We also know that those fighting alongside us for all this time deserve to be protected as well,"" he added. Mr Erdogan has spoken angrily about American support for the Kurdish YPG militia, and vowed to crush it. Mr Cavusoglu said Turkey was ""not against"" the idea of a secure zone - but was targeting ""a terrorist organisation trying to divide Syria"". Mr Pompeo is now in Riyadh, where he discussed Iran and the conflicts in Yemen and Syria with the Saudi leadership. Mike Pompeo met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman on Monday He said he also raised human rights issues, including the detention of women's rights activists, and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey. Mr Pompeo said King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had both ""reiterated their commitment"" to holding the killers of Mr Khashoggi accountable. Prosecutors say Mr Khashoggi, a US-based critic of the Saudi government, was murdered in a ""rogue"" operation in Istanbul, by agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom. However, many in the West have accused the crown prince of ordering the killing - something he has denied. About 2,000 US military personnel are reported to be deployed in northern Syria. Ground troops first arrived in autumn 2015 when then-President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise YPG fighters. This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? The US did this after several attempts at training and arming Syrian Arab rebel groups to battle IS militants descended into chaos.

"US President Donald Trump has denied working for Russia, pouring scorn on the latest reports to cast scrutiny on his relationship with Moscow. Addressing reporters at the White House as he left for Louisiana, he said: ""I never worked for Russia."" He played down a Washington Post report that he had concealed a translation of a meeting with Mr Putin. According to the New York Times meanwhile, the FBI launched a hitherto unreported inquiry into the president. According to the newspaper, the FBI's suspicions were raised after Mr Trump fired its director, James Comey, in May 2017. That FBI inquiry, reports the New York Times, was taken over by justice department special counsel Robert Mueller. Mr Mueller is leading an ongoing investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Kremlin to influence the 2016 presidential election. Asked outside the White House on Monday if he was working for Russia, Mr Trump denied it outright before adding: ""I think it's a disgrace that you even ask that question because it's a whole big fat hoax."" The two leaders had a private conversation during the 2017 G20 summit in Hamburg The Republican president was posed the same question by a Fox News host on Saturday, and called it ""the most insulting thing I've ever been asked"". The New York Times notes in its own report no evidence has emerged publicly that Mr Trump took direction from Russian government officials. On Monday, the president said his dismissal of Mr Comey was ""a great service I did for our country"", while railing against FBI investigators as ""known scoundrels"" and ""dirty cops"". It was also reported at the weekend that Mr Trump had confiscated the notes of his own interpreter after a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to the Washington Post, the US president ordered the translator not to discuss the details of what was said. But on Monday, Mr Trump defended his nearly hour long discussion with Mr Putin in July 2017 on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. ""It's a lot of fake news,"" said Mr Trump, as he left to address a farming convention in New Orleans. ""That was a very good meeting. It was actually a very successful meeting."" He said he and Mr Putin discussed Israel and a German-Russian pipeline, adding: ""We have those meetings all the time no big deal."" ABC News reports that Democratic congressmen are considering issuing subpoenas to interpreters who attended Mr Trump's meetings with Mr Putin. Trump denies hiding detail of Putin talks FBI 'checked if Trump was working for Russia' Has Trump turned his back on Europe? On Monday, former Democratic White House candidate Hillary Clinton could not resist reminding Twitter users that during a campaign debate she had called Mr Trump the Russian leader's puppet.

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington A sitting US president has never been publicly asked if he is - knowingly or unwittingly - a Russian agent. Until now. For Donald Trump's critics, this is but one more indication of the uncharted territory the US is in, as the nearly two-year-long investigation into possible ties between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia grinds along. For Mr Trump's defenders - and the president himself - it is only the latest indignity the man has been subjected to by enemies intent on undermining his administration and discrediting his electoral victory. On Monday he called questions about his Russia ties a ""disgrace"" Those questions aren't going away, however. Stories like the one in the Washington Post this weekend outlining efforts the president made to conceal information about his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin will only stoke the flames of interest. Rumours abound that Robert Mueller's special counsel team could issue a final report as soon as next month. It may set out the case against the president and his team or offer them vindication. Until then, it's all a scramble to gain the high ground for the coming battles. Having taken over the House of Representatives this month, the Democrats are flexing their political muscles. Lawmakers have invited Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen to testify before a congressional committee next month, and have warned the president not to interfere. In a joint statement, congressmen Elijah Cummings, Adam Schiff and Jerrold Nadler said Mr Trump must not try to ""discourage, intimidate or otherwise pressure"" his former personal fixer. In December, Mr Cohen admitted arranging hush money payments to Mr Trump's alleged lovers, blaming his former boss for leading him to ""choose the path of darkness"". He has agreed to appear publicly before the House Oversight Committee on 7 February. You may also be interested in: Did Trump fire Comey as part of a cover-up?

According to prepared testimony, William Barr will pledge to protect the special counsel's investigation, and let the public know about the probe's findings. ""I believe it is vitally important that the Special Counsel be allowed to complete his investigation,"" Mr Barr is expected to say. But the former attorney general under President George HW Bush is likely to face a grilling from Democrats. They are likely to ask why he wrote in a legal memo last June that Mr Mueller's inquiry was ""fatally misconceived"". Has Trump turned his back on Europe?

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison A British-Iranian mother detained in Tehran has begun a three-day hunger strike in protest against being denied specialist medical care. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe wasjailed for five years in 2016after being convicted of spying, which she denies. The aid worker has endured pressure to spy on the UK for Iran, according to her husband, Richard Ratcliffe. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has summoned the Iranian ambassador to the UK to discuss the case. Mr Hunt has praised her bravery and criticised Iran for - in his words - allowing an innocent mother to feel she needs to resort to a hunger strike. Mr Ratcliffe said prison officials have refused to let Nazanin, 40, see a doctor to examine lumps in her breast and other health issues. He said his wife also needs neurological care over her neck pains and numbness in her arms and legs, as well as permission to see an outside psychiatrist. He added that it was hoped the hunger strike would get the Iranians to take his wife ""seriously"". Speaking at a news conference, Mr Ratcliffe set out his wife's demands - to be able to see an external doctor and to be given an agreement in writing that she will be allowed access to any medical treatment the doctor recommends. Mr Ratcliffe also described how his wife was told by members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard in late December that she would be ""safer afterwards"" if she spied on the UK Department for International Development and the civil society organisation Small Media. He said this offer, which she refused, ""really pushed her over the edge"". ""The only weapon we have is to tell Nazanin's story,"" he added. Speaking to the Observer,external, Mr Ratcliffe said: ""We know a hunger strike has significant physical consequences the longer it goes on for, and Nazanin is feeling a strong sense of trepidation. ""But there aren't many ways she can say, 'enough is enough, take me seriously'."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is going on hunger strike in Iran's Evin prison, alongside prominent Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi, who also requires medical attentionaccording to Amnesty International.,external Mr Ratcliffe said his wife would consider extending the strike if her demands to see a doctor were not met. Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle PM calls for jailed mum to be released Nazanin's husband tells of jail anguish Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, of Hampstead in north-west London, spent her 40th birthday on Boxing Day in prison, where she has been detained for more than 1,000 days. She was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 and has always maintained the visit was to introduce her daughter, Gabriella, to her relatives. The four-year-old has been staying with family in Iran since her mother was detained - although they were briefly reunited during athree-day temporary releaselast August. Since returning to prison, after her application for an extended release was denied, she hassuffered several panic attacks. Her husband has mounted a high-profile campaign for his wife's release, with Prime Minister Theresa May, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and London Mayor Sadiq Khan all calling for her to be freed. Monique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, where Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe works,  said: ""It is extremely shocking to see our colleague Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe going on hunger strike to protest at her inhumane treatment in Evin prison, at a time where her health is already at its poorest. ""I am sincerely worried about the dire consequences of this. ""As her employer, I repeat that Nazanin is totally innocent, and certainly not spy material, as portrayed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. ""The Iranian government and judiciary must act immediately, release her and allow urgent treatment before her health deteriorates any further.""

"Lloyds Banking Group has been criticised for introducing new overdraft charges on Monday ahead of a proposed crackdown later this year. An MP described the fees - which will equate to an annual interest charge of up to 61% - as ""unacceptable"". The Financial Conduct Authority wants to scrap overdraft fees and replace them with a single interest rate. Lloyds Banking Group said: ""The changes were announced prior to the FCA's latest recommendations."" MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, said: ""While these fees might be legal, they are not within the spirit of the FCA's recommendations."" She said: ""It is unacceptable for financial institutions to try to game the system at the expense of customers, particularly those struggling with their finances."" Ms Reeves added that the new fees would ""increase the charges for the vast majority of customers"". A quarter of current account holders will be hit by the new charges, which come into effect on 14 January  for Bank of Scotland, 28 January for Lloyds Bank and 4 February for Halifax customers. Rather than paying 1p every day for every Â£7 of overdraft used, the cost for the first Â£1,250 borrowed will increase to 1p a day per Â£6. That works out at an annual interest charge of 61%, much higher than widely-criticised guarantor loans or expensive credit cards aimed at people with poor credit records. The cost for borrowing between Â£1,250 and Â£2,500 remains at 1p a day per Â£7, while borrowing more than that will be charged at 1p a day per Â£8. The new tariff means anyone borrowing less than Â£4,100 on their overdraft will pay more. TheFinancial Conduct Authority,externalwants banks to charge a single interest rate for all types of overdraft. Under its proposals, banks would set a single rate for going into the red and customers would be able to compare banks for the best deal. The City watchdog has also proposed a ban on any fixed fees linked to an overdraft. ""The FCA isn't tinkering around the edges, it wants to radically change the UK overdraft market to make it simpler, fairer and easier for consumers to manage and compare,"" said analyst Andrew Hagger of Moneycomms. 'We were one bill away from disaster' 'Admitting problems helped us get debt-free' How much debt do UK households have? The bank maintains that there is nothing wrong with its new fees. It said they were in the spirit of the FCA's views ""in terms of removing costs for unplanned and complexity of charging"". Andrew Hagger disagreed. He said: ""I'm surprised that the increase is going ahead, as it doesn't fit in any way shape or form with what the regulator wants to see for personal overdrafts."" Ms Reeves said: ""We need an end to the excessive fees that continue to harm borrowers, particularly those with persistent money problems."" She added: ""Lloyds should rethink these fees as a matter of urgency."" There are arranged overdrafts, when current account holders borrow up to a limit agreed with, or offered by, the bank. About 19 million people use one each year. Some banks also have unarranged overdrafts, with extra or higher charges for going beyond this limit or going into the red without permission, used by 14 million people a year. Those aged 35 to 44 are most likely to have some form of overdraft, while about 10% of all 18 to 24-year-olds have exceeded their overdraft limit in the past 12 months. For customers, the charges and fees are difficult to compare - with a mix of interest rates, daily fees or monthly fees among banks. Those costs could be high even with a small debt. For example, someone could be charged Â£5 a day for borrowing Â£100 on overdraft. The majority of unarranged overdraft charges are paid by only 1.5% of customers. They pay about Â£450 a year in fees and charges, according to the FCA. On average, consumers in more deprived areas paid twice as much in charges for unarranged overdrafts as did consumers living in less deprived areas,the FCA found,external.

"Theresa May voted against the assembly in 1997 The prime minister has re-written a speech about Brexit following criticism it was factually inaccurate. Theresa May had planned to say that both sides had accepted the result of the Welsh assembly referendum in 1997. But she had voted against the creation of the institution following the devolution referendum. Labour and Plaid Cymru politicians accused her of hypocrisy - and the line was dropped from the speech. Instead, she said the result was accepted by parliament. Mrs May warned of ""paralysis in Parliament"" if the deal is rejected and said trust in politics would suffer ""catastrophic harm"" if the UK did not leave the EU. May: Back Brexit deal 'for country's sake' What's next if MPs reject May's deal? Members of the press had been told Mrs May, in Stoke-on-Trent, would say:  ""When the people of Wales voted by a margin of 0.3%, on a turnout of just over 50%, to endorse the creation of the Welsh Assembly, that result was accepted by both sides and the popular legitimacy of that institution has never seriously been questioned."" But when she gave the speech, she said that the result ""was accepted by parliament"". Mrs May had, in 1997 after the referendum, voted against the legislation that enacted the assembly, together with other Conservatives. Allow Twitter content?

Tory MP Nigel Evans said during that debate that it would have been better if the percentage majority in favour ""had been in double figures"". ""That would have settled the issue once and for all, but it did not and it remains unsettled,"" he said. The Conservative manifesto of 2005 also called for a further referendum on the assembly on expanding its powers, keeping it as it was or abolishing it. Before the event Professor Roger Scully of Cardiff University said the result was actually won on a margin of 0.6%,rather than 0.3%,external- although the figure remained in the revised speech. Jo Stevens said the briefed remarks exposed 'yet more utter hypocrisy from the PM' First Minister Mark Drakeford said Rhodri Morgan had ""reacted to the closeness of the result by reaching out to those opposed to the creation of the National Assembly and worked to establish its legitimacy in their eyes"". ""The success of that approach by Rhodri Morgan and Carwyn Jones was borne out in the emphatic majority to extend the National Assembly's powers in 2011,"" he said. ""It's hard to imagine a more different approach to that taken by Mrs May towards the EU referendum."" The Conservatives didn't support the result of Labour's 1997 referendum on Welsh devolution when the House of Commons voted on implementing it. At the second reading of the Government of Wales Bill - when the broad principle of the legislation was discussed -139 MPs opposed it,external. Most of these were Conservatives, with Mrs May, then a new MP, among them. Constitutional affairs spokesman Liam Fox later said: ""The low turnout was one of the factors that undermined the referendum in Wales."" But the bill passed into law in 1998 and the assembly - with powers relating to health, agriculture, fisheries, education, housing, highways and some other areas - was created the next year. Labour MP for Cardiff Central Jo Stevens said the development had exposed ""yet more utter hypocrisy from the PM"". Alun Davies, a Labour AM, said the briefed remarks showed ""ignorance and incompetence in equal measure"". ""It is a perfect metaphor for Brexit,"" he added. Prior to the speech Liz Saville-Roberts, Plaid Cymru MP, said: ""Unlike the unicorns of the Brexit referendum, the 1997 devolution vote was a clear question, with a clear outcome and clear consequences. The only party to attack its legitimacy was her party - this is hypocrisy of the highest order. ""Mrs May's revisionist history shows a disregard for Wales, devolution and democracy."" Former Wales Office special advisor Lauren McEvatt said on Twitter that ""stopping howlers like this is a pretty big reason (why) the Wales Office is still around"". ""No. 10 should have made use of them,"" she said.

"This video can not be played UK scientists estimate air pollution cuts British people's lives by an average of six months Wood burning stoves, open fires and farms all face new restrictions as the government sets out what it calls a ""world leading"" plan to tackle air pollution. In theirClean Air Strategy,external, published today, the government promises to set a ""bold new goal"" to reduce particulates across much of the country by 2030. But green groups say the scheme is vague and severely lacking in detail. They believe the plan proposes nothing new to tackle roadside dirty air. The new strategy, which is focused on tackling air pollution in England, has been launched just days after the family of anine-year-old girl who died from asthmawere given permission to apply for a fresh inquest into her death. The government's chief lawyer heard new evidence her death could be linked to unlawful levels of air pollution. Air pollution early deaths rise in EU Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? Even low air pollution may damage heart Retired librarian Catherine Bazell suffers from a lung condition called bronchiectasis Catherine Bazell is a retired London librarian who suffers from asthma and a condition called bronchiectasis. It's a long-term illness where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. ""People can't always see dirty air but it's there,"" she told BBC News. ""I find it really frustrating, it means that I feel really tired, I can get tightness in my chest, I find it hard to breathe, it just stops you from doing all things you'd like to do. ""You see the alerts, that say it's a very polluted day today and you are obliged to stay in to keep away from the pollution, and that makes me quite angry because why should we have to stay in? ""We need to do something about the air pollution so that people can live normal lives."" While overall levels of air pollution have been declining in recent decades, there has also been a growing scientific awareness of the scale of problems that it causes. NHS England says that almost 30% of preventable deaths in England are due to non-communicable diseases specifically attributed to air pollution. A pollutant called Particulate Matter (PM) is a particular concern with the World Health Organization (WHO) identifying it as the most damaging for people. Fine particulates, known as PM2.5, are around 200 times smaller than a grain of sand. They are a major health worry as they can penetrate deep into your lungs, pass into your bloodstream and get embedded in your bodily organs and your brain. The WHO's models indicate that around 92% of the world's population live in places where air quality levels exceed their guidelines. In the UK,more than 40 cities and townswere at, or have exceeded, the WHO limit. The government has previously said it will reduce by half the number of people living in areas breaching the WHO limits by 2025. But they now say they will go beyond this and set a ""world leading"" goal on exposure to PM2.5. Without giving many details, or a timeline, the government says that by 2030, fine particulate concentrations will be reduced below the WHO safe level ""across much of the country"". The government says it will publish evidence early in 2019 on what actions will be needed to meet this new target. Ministers argue that Brexit will allow the UK to go much further on this issue than the EU and become the first major economy to adopt air quality goals based on WHO recommendations. The most important activity that contributes to particulate pollution is the burning of fuels such as wood and coal in open fires and domestic stoves. This video can not be played Simple tips to avoid inhaling air from traffic and other common sources of pollution. Farming is also a major problem, as emissions of ammonia have increased in recent years. This gas reacts in the atmosphere with other chemicals to produce particulate matter that can be carried on the wind to major population centres. To deal with domestic burning, the government will ban the sale of the most polluting fuels and ensure that only the cleanest stoves are available for sale by 2022. They are also consulting on phasing out the sale of traditional house coal and on limiting the sale of wet wood, the type found on garage forecourts. The government's plan for these fuels is expected within months. For farmers, the government says it will introduce regulations to require them to use low emission farming techniques. There will be advice, training and support to help them invest in the technology to limit ammonia. The move on particulate matter has been welcomed by the WHO as an ""example for the rest of the world to follow"". Green campaigners also recognise the value of adopting the WHO guidelines but are worried about the lack of legally binding limits. ""The government has made a welcome commitment to set an ambitious new target for cleaning up the most dangerous fine particle air pollution, based on WHO standards,"" said Jenny Bates from Friends of the Earth. Emissions of ammonia from farming face new restrictions ""But while the WHO says standards should be reached by 2030, there is no date set in the government's strategy and the plan is severely lacking in detail on how such a target could be met."" Scientists also say the government initiative is laudable but may not work for everyone across the UK. ""The full evidence on reductions needed to attain the tougher WHO guidelines for PM2.5 is to be published later,"" said Prof Alastair Lewis from them National Centre for Atmospheric Science at the University of York. ""One would anticipate that there are likely to be some urban areas of the UK where this could be close to impossible to achieve."" Just a few years ago, garages across the UK reeked of oil and petrol. The smells usually came from the evaporation of fuel vapour, which released volatile organic compounds into the air. However, regulations to limit the emissions of these powerful air pollutants changed the odour of the UK's forecourts. An interim report from Imperial College shows the UK concentrations of PM2.5 in 2016 and how they may be reduced by the government's strategy by 2030 These new government plans may have a similar impact on some current air pollution smells. If the proposed restrictions on solid fuels go ahead, the smoky whiff of winter over many cities and towns might also disappear. The government says it will also provide a ""personal air quality messaging system"" to inform vulnerable members of the public with clear information about the forecast and accessible health advice. As well as new information, the new plan envisages that everyone will be financially better off if the plan succeeds. Air pollution is now the fourth biggest public health threat behind cancer, obesity and heart disease. According to the government, the steps outlined in this plan will cut the costs of dirty air to the UK by Â£1.7bn every year from 2020, rising to Â£5.3bn every year from 2030. Across the UK, about 1.5 million households use wood for fuel but these fires and stoves will now face restrictions because of their leading role in the production of particulate matter. Most people don't realise that a wood burning stove emits more particles per hour than a diesel truck. That's because a freshly cut log of wood contains about a pint of water, and much of the heat energy is used to dry the water out, which causes the wood to smoke and smoulder, releasing air pollutants. The key impact of the new strategy on existing stove owners will be on fuels like wet wood, and traditional house coal, which will likely be phased out. The government also plans to give local authorities more powers over existing smoke control areas, where you can only burn smokeless fuel - if you want to burn wood it must be in an approved device. The new strategy doesn't spell out what these extra powers will be, but the idea is to make regulations easier to enforce. The document also suggests that the government is looking to help local authorities ""to increase the rate of upgrades for inefficient and polluting heating devices"". The government will also ensure that all new stoves sold from 2022 comply with EU eco-design regulations. In fact, stoves branded eco-design compliant are already on the market. ""They won't look any different,"" said Dennis Milligan from the UK's Stove Industry Alliance. ""But the technology will allow combustion higher up in the fire chamber so that re-ignites any particles of wood that are in the smoke so the emissions that come out the chimney are reduced by 80% compared to a stove manufactured ten years ago."" It's not clear what difference these new regulations will make to sales of wood burning stoves - Recent data indicate that the market has boomed, largely driven by people looking to burn wood for its aesthetic appeal. UK levels of pollution from nitrogen oxides, produced in the main by diesel cars, have regularly exceeded European targets. So much so that the government has been successfully sued in the courts by campaign group Client Earth, to force them to come up with a plan. In July 2017, the governmentintroduced their detailed scheme for roads,external, which essentially puts the responsibility in the hands of local authorities. The cities with the worst pollution are supposed to develop plans for clean air zones that will charge drivers to enter. However, campaigners believe the government has its head in the sand on pollution from transport. As well as clean air zones, they should be taking steps to cut the number of vehicles on the roads. ""They are hoping it will all go away but the reality is an awful lot more needs to be done,"" Jenny Bates from Friends of the Earth told BBC News. ""I think they are afraid of the motoring lobby and they shouldn't be."" Other forms of transport are dealt with in the new plan including rail and shipping. The government says it wants to see the removal of all diesel-only trains by 2040. There are many ways to help. Swapping your car for walking, cycling or taking public transport is a major plus. For most of us, the health benefits far outweigh the risks of roadside pollution. You can also turn off your engine when you're stuck in a jam, or buy electric when you replace your vehicle. At home, you can burn less in your fireplace or your garden; service your gas boiler; and turn down your thermostat. Insulating your house means you'll burn less fuel. You can group on-line purchases to reduce the number of deliveries. And you can buy non-toxic cleaning fluids and sprays, because ordinary products cause emissions in the home. ""Air fresheners"" actually pollute the air. But one irony: much of the UK's pollution originates in mainland Europe, so we really need neighbouring countries to join the effort. As well as trying to deal with the major sources of particulate matter, the government's plan also deals with pollution that arises from ammonia, sulphur dioxide and non-methane volatile organic compounds. Ammonia from farms is a major focus as outlined above, for the role it plays in the development of PM.  However, it also poses major threats to sensitive natural habitats. ""Ammonia in the air over our farmlands dissolves into our wetlands and waterways and wreaks havoc on delicate aquatic ecosystems,"" said Hannah Freeman from the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. ""The proposed measures are a step forward, but what we really want is government policy that supports farmers to be true stewards, holistically managing our air, soil and water together.""

"Landscape painter Denise Di Battista says her sight is both her life and her livelihood An artist whose vision deteriorated after lens replacement surgery is one of dozens of people considering legal action against manufacturer, Oculentis. Denise Di Battista claims she has ""blind patches"" in her right eye. The BBC has been told that there have been 800 cases of patients in the UK experiencing ""opacification"" of a particular implanted Oculentis lens. Opacification is a known risk of this surgery, can occur with any intraocular lens and can have multiple causes. Denise Di Battista is a landscape painter and her sight is both her life and her livelihood. Like many people who have cataracts, or simply want to improve their vision, Denise had a routine eye operation in 2010 to replace both of her natural lenses. However, a few years later, the vision in her right eye unexpectedly started to deteriorate. ""If I was looking through my right eye, I would think I was almost blindâ¦. It affects my painting and that depresses me terribly,"" she told the BBC. Denise does not have a problem with black-and-white contrast but she does with colours, tones and low light. She says the picture of the shoes below represents what she can see in low light with her ""good"" left eye. The second image represents the level of vision in her affected right eye. Denise says these images show the difference between her left and right eyes Denise says she was devastated when she learned the problem was possibly caused by an issue with the lens. ""I was very, very shocked. When I came out of the consulting room, my daughter was waiting for me and she said I looked white."" The lenses Denise received were made by European manufacturer Oculentis. Reports began to emerge that a small number of patients who had received a particular lens were experiencing what is known as opacification, a cloudiness in their vision, caused by calcium deposits. Oculentis investigated and identified the problem as possibly being the result of an interaction between phosphate crystals used in the hydration process and silicone residues on the lens. The company says there is evidence some people may be predisposed to this problem or that certain medication can be a factor. Oculentis decided to advise providers to return affected batches of the type of lens Denise had been given.  There is no suggestion that any Oculentis lenses currently available are affected. Leading eye surgeon Sheraz Daya, who has tried to help patients like Denise, told the BBC: ""A percentage of lenses have deposits of calcium on the surface that only become evident five to seven years later, when they accumulate enough to obscure their vision. ""It is understandably devastating for patients who thought they were done and dusted for life and didn't anticipate an issue with the lens."" Oculentis is paying for some patients to undergo surgery to replace the lenses Oculentis says the only way to correct the problem is to replace the lenses and has paid for surgeons like Sheraz Daya to do this.  Thus far about half of those affected have had their lenses replaced. Around half a million people have cataract surgery each year, making it the most commonly performed operation in the UK. There are an estimated 800 cases from the affected batches of Oculentis lenses which have led to problems with opacification, a very small proportion of the total. In a statement, Oculentis told the BBC: ""We regret if any patients have experienced complications following the implant of one of our lenses. ""Opacification, or clouding of the lens, is a known risk of lens eye surgery and can be caused by a number of factors interacting, which are not necessarily attributable to the lens itself. Denise is nervous about having another procedure on her eyes ""The incidence rate is extremely low. It can be effectively remedied through lens exchange surgery, which is a safe and well-established procedure. ""Anyone experiencing any vision impairment should consult their surgeon or clinic who will be able to diagnose the cause and recommend an appropriate course of action, otherwise there is no need for any concern."" Denise Di Battista's lawyer, Peter Todd, a partner at Hodge, Jones & Allen, said: ""Mrs Di Battista has been left devastated by the deterioration in her sight since she had the Oculentis lens implanted. ""She is one of dozens of people who we are representing in upcoming legal action. All claim to have suffered similar experiences after having the lens implanted. We will be launching legal proceedings shortly."" The BBC has learnt that another law firm Devonshires also has dozens of similar cases. Denise De Battista is nervous about having her lens replaced as the procedure is not routine and not all eye surgeons are prepared to do it. So, for the time being, the land and seascapes that she loves and paints remain clouded and obscured.

"A group of lucky Cathay Pacific customers have scored first-class seats at economy prices, in the second fare blunder by the airline this month. Tickets on trips from Hong Kong to Portugal were sold on the airline's website for $1,512, instead of $16,000 usually charged for a similar journey. The carrier said it would honour the tickets as it investigates the cause of the error. It extends a recent run of blows to the firm including ahuge data breach. The mispriced fares were available on Cathay Pacific's website on Sunday. First-class flights from Lisbon to Hong Kong - via London with a connecting flight - were offered for $1,512 (Â£1,177), according to the South China Morning Post. A similar first-class journey through Frankfurt would cost $16,000. In a statement, the Hong Kong carrier said it would honour the tickets. ""We are looking into the root cause of this incident both internally and externally with our vendors,"" it said. ""For the very small number of customers who have purchased these tickets, we look forward to welcoming you on board to enjoy our premium services."" Just two weeks ago the airline made the same blunder. Lucky flyers made off with business-class seats on flights from Vietnam to New York for about $675 return. They should have cost $16,000. At the time, the carrier acknowledged its ""mistake"" and again, said it would welcome the passengers onboard. Cathay Pacific to honour $16,000 fares sold for $675 Airlines have a mixed history of honouring tickets sold in error. Singapore Airlines, for example, honoured tickets sold for less than half price in 2014. But United Airlines cancelled transatlantic tickets sold for less than $100 by a ""third party software provider"" the following year. The latest stumble extends a bad run for Cathay Pacific. In October, the firm was the subject of a data breach in its IT systems, jeopardising the personal information of up to 9.4 million passengers. Huge data hack hits Cathay Pacific A month earlier, it had to send one of its planes back to the paint shop afterspelling the airline's name ""Cathay Paciic""on the side of a jet. The Hong Kong-based airline joked ""Oops this special livery won't last long"" after the error was pointed out Those missteps come as the airline tries to return to profitability after posting its first ever back-to-back annual loss in March. Cathay Pacific has struggled against competition, particularly from low-cost Chinese carriers covering Hong Kong, mainland China and South East Asia.

"As the March deadline for leaving the European Union approaches, councils and other local organisations are drawing up contingency plans to be put in place in the event of the UK exiting the EU without a deal. The possibility that a no-deal Brexit  (ie where the UK immediately drops out of the EU single market and customs union) could lead to traffic jams, especially around ports, is one area being looked at. In a letter to MPs, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said it was ""possible that there could be some freight traffic disruption in Kent in the event of a no-deal, if additional customs checks were introduced in Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk, where freight services disembark."" Kent is home to the Port of Dover, which handles approximately10,500 lorries a day,external, with the Channel Tunnel receiving a further 6,000 lorries daily. Operation Brock lorry park A256 trial 'too little too late' No-deal Brexit planning shuts M26 overnight Brexit border checks 'may triple queues' Most lorries transporting freight overseas are accustomed to rolling on a ferry one end and rolling off at the other - it's relatively easy, seamless and quick. At the moment, freight vehicles going through Dover are subject to passport and security checks. But under a no-deal scenario, EU-bound lorries will also need to complete custom declarations. Furthermore, certain UK goods arriving into EU ports may also require physical checks, under single market rules. This would apply to certain food, animal and chemical products - like insecticides. The worry is that these extra checks could lead to bottlenecks, as lorries wait to be processed. In its no-deal guidance published in September, the UK government pledged to introduce ""contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic,external"" in the event of delays caused by extra checks. So how could traffic be affected and what are the plans to stop any gridlock? Dover has looked at the potential impact of more checks on lorries and - through independent modelling - has estimated that two minutes of extra processing time for each lorry would lead to tailbacks of 17 miles. The port authorities say that the present ""frictionless trade"" between the UK and the EU means that tailbacks in and around the port are ""very rare"". Researchers at Imperial College, London, have gone further. In a paper published last March, they estimated that extra check times could lead to a ""dramatic increase of congestion on the motorways as well as local streets,external"", with tailbacks of up to 29 miles. Given just how quickly the roads around Dover could become clogged, Kent County Council, along with the Department for Transport, has been developing contingency plans. Since 2015, a traffic management system known asDover Tap,external(Traffic Assessment Project) has been used to control traffic around the port during times of ""mild disruption"". When Tap is in use, lorry drivers heading to the Port of Dover via the A20 must use the left-hand lane only, and stick to a 40mph speed limit. Under a no-deal Brexit, Tap would remain the first line of defence. But if it proves unable to control the volume of traffic, then a plan called Operation Brock would come into effect. This involves a contraflow system - ie traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway. This system would operate for about 13 miles, between junctions eight (Maidstone) and nine (Ashford) on the M20, and lorries would be left queuing on the other side. This means -unlike under the previous Operation Stack- the M20 would be kept open and traffic would continue to flow in both directions at times of disruption. Kent county council says that this system would be able to cope with up to 2,000 lorries. If that proved to be insufficient, the next option would be to divert Dover traffic to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it as a lorry park to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time. The Department for Transport carried out two test runs at Manston on 7 January, using up to 90 lorries. It said the test went well and traffic flowed smoothly, although the Road Haulage Association complained the exercise ""was too little too late"" and should have begun months earlier. This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield on 7 January before travelling in convoy to Dover If further capacity was still required, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the M26 into a temporary lorry park. The M26 is a 10-mile motorway connecting the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20 near West Malling. Under this scenario, the M26 would be closed to normal road users and lorries would park on the carriageway. Kent council believes this option could accommodate a further 2,000 lorries. Ultimately it would be up to the police to decide the circumstances under which each plan would be triggered. Chris Grayling says the main focus of traffic contingency planning is solely on Kent - given the large numbers of lorries passing through Dover each day. His letter to local MPs adds that the situation in Kent is ""unique"" and other UK ports don't face the same risk. Part of the M20 was shut in the summer of 2015 under Operation Stack after port workers in Calais went on strike But that hasn't stopped other councils from considering their options. Portsmouth Council owns the city's port and says it's concerned about a lack of infrastructure outside the freight gates, saying it only has space for 13 lorries before they would end up queuing on a nearby roundabout. About 500 lorries are handled by Portsmouth International Port each day and the council says it's currently looking to acquire nearby land to turn into a potential lorry park in the event that additional checks cause delays. In the case of maximum disruption, lorries could be stacked on some local roads, including motorway sections - according to Assistant Chief Constable Dave Hardcastle on behalf of the Hampshire Local Resilience Forum. However, Mr Hardcastle adds this would be the ""least preferred option"" and the priority is to acquire Dunsbury Park in nearby Havant as a holding area. Ke Han, who specialises in traffic modelling and led Imperial College's research, believes the plans being developed by local councils should avoid significant traffic problems - but he still expects queues, possibly of up to 10 miles, around the Port of Dover in the event of no-deal. ""Lorry parks will reduce the impact on local traffic but they won't reduce the expected delays for the lorries. Even if you divert the lorries they still need to eventually converge at a single point,"" he says. There are also practical considerations for the drivers. ""If they're to be parked up for a day, drivers need to get access to coffee, food and toilets,"" Rona Hunnisett, from the Freight Transport Association, says. She welcomes the contingency plans being drawn up but says they're not a long-term solution, and delays will ultimately hurt businesses. ""We need to reduce the friction at the border if there is a no-deal Brexit,"" she says. The Department for Transport told BBC News it neither wanted nor expected a no-deal, but would ""continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies"".

"Standing on top of the roof of the Dublin Port Company's headquarters, you can see lots of building work amidst all the docked ships at the River Liffey's mouth. And while that construction is not entirely Brexit-related, management at the port says it has to be prepared for the possibility of a no-deal and any potential economic fallout. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March, whether or not there is a negotiated deal. British Prime Minister Theresa May is hoping that her draft Withdrawal Agreement will get through the House of Commons, but preparations are under way in case it does not. There is agreement across Irish society that Brexit will have an adverse effect on the country, but the worst scenario as far as the Irish government is concerned is that the UK leaves without a negotiated settlement. Politicians here refer to that option as a ""hard"" Brexit. What does Ireland do if thereâs no deal? All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU The International Monetary Fund forecasts that Ireland's economic growth would take a 4% hit ""in the long run""if there is a ""cliff-edge"" break with the EU, because of the highly integrated nature of the Irish and UK economies. And the independent Dublin-based think tankThe Economic and Social Research Institute estimates that a ""hard"" Brexit could cost households up to â¬1,400 (Â£1,260) a year,,externalbecause of a potential increase in food prices and possible trade tariffs. The Irish government set out its approach to dealing with a no-deal Brexit in December Despite no-one in authority being in a position to predict how Brexit will unfold, the Irish government has already announced plans for an extra 1,000 customs and veterinary staff to work at Dublin and Rosslare ports and at airports, as well as new money to train people in sectors likely to be badly affected. It has organised a series of very well-attended roadshows around the country with the involvement of state agencies with the theme""Getting Ireland Brexit Ready"",externalfor every Brexit scenario. And there is evidence that more companies - worried about possible delays and resulting costs at Dover - are forsaking the UK land-bridge for new ""Brexit-busting"" super-ferries that would sail directly between Dublin and Zeebrugge and Rotterdam, bypassing uncertainty in Britain. It is too early to say what impact they are having, but the development is seen as significant. There is an Irish political and economic consensus on Brexit. For political reasons there is widespread agreement that there has to be aso-called ""backstop""unless and until there is a wider trade agreement to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. It is feared that such a border could risk a return to violence after a hard-won peace. The hardest border Parts of the Conservative Party and the DUP as a whole strongly oppose the backstop, believing it risks weakening the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. They also feel it may effectively trap the UK in a customs arrangement with the EU, preventing it from making its own trade deals with non-EU states. There is also a consensus in Dublin that for economic reasons, the Republic of Ireland wants as close a relationship with the UK as possible for the sake of jobs and mutual prosperity after the UK leaves the EU. And yet, despite that consensus, the opposition parties in the DÃ¡il (parliament), Fianna FÃ¡il and Sinn FÃ©in, have frequently criticised Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael government for not doing enough to prepare for the no-deal scenario. There has also been an often unspoken fear that the EU might, at the last moment, try to force Ireland to relent on the backstop to allow Mrs May to get her deal to pass in Westminster. That concern is largely based on what happened during the financial crisis, when Dublin came under enormous pressure to apply for a bailout to protect its banks. But Irish government ministers insist that the remaining EU27 countries are at one on the issue. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, and the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, have been frequent visitors to Dublin, expressing solidarity with their Irish counterparts. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas reiterated that support at this week's Global Ireland conference in Dublin, appearing alongside Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney. Simon Coveney (l) and Heiko Maas (r) both emphasised the importance of avoiding a hard border While a no-deal Brexit is most definitely seen by many as a threat to the Irish state, it also offers opportunities. The Industrial Development Authority, which is responsible for attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the country, notes that more than 55 companies have moved at least part of their operations from London to the Irish capital because of Brexit. Those companies include Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, helping to make 2018 a record year for FDI job creation. There is a fear, though, that domestic companies - which tend to have a closer economic relationship with the UK than the multinationals - could suffer with resulting job losses, especially if the pound falls as a result of a failure to agree a deal. That would make Irish exports less competitive and British imports cheaper, raising the prospect of some companies lobbying for possible state support. Amid all the confusion and uncertainty about Brexit, the Irish government has consistently said that it thinks it more likely than not that a no-deal Brexit will be avoided, but stresses it necessarily has to plan for all eventualities. Management at Dublin Port is taking the politicians at their word, and getting ready for a no-deal Brexit scenario, preparing to house more customs officials and veterinary inspection staff. It seems certain that the cranes, trucks and construction staff at the mouth of the Liffey will be busy for some time to come. What will Ireland do if thereâs no deal?

"The plane crashed into a wall separating the airport from a residential area and then hit a house A cargo plane crash near the Iranian capital, Tehran, has killed 15 people, Iran's army says. The Boeing 707 came off the runway and hit a residential area while trying to land at Fath airport in Karaj, 40km (25 miles) west of Tehran, in poor weather. Only a flight engineer of the 16 people on board was found alive, with no-one reportedly killed on the ground. The plane's ""black box"" voice recorder has been found at the crash site, local media reported. Only the plane's flight engineer is known to have survived An army spokesman confirmed to state TV that the plane belonged to Iran, and that all those on board were Iranian citizens. Fath airport belongs to Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps, and is located in the central Iranian province of Alborz. The cargo aircraft was transporting meat from the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek. Its wreckage was found smouldering among houses in a residential area between Fath and another airport, Payam International Airport. Local media report that the houses were empty at the time of the crash. Rescue teams are now at the site of the wreckage This is the latest in a series of Iranian plane crashes in recent years. In February last year, Iran's Aseman Airlines was ordered to ground its fleet of ATR planes afterone of them crashed into the Zagros mountains. All 66 people on board died. And in August 2014, a Sepahan Airlines' Antonov planecrashed shortly after taking off from Tehran, killing 39 of the 40 people on board. It is believed engine failure was the cause Years of tough US sanctions have prevented officials from purchasing new planes and critical spare parts. A landmark 2015 deal between Tehran and Washington brought renewed hope that the situation would change - but this was dashed last May when the US pulled out, reinstating sanctions that had been lifted.

"The bright orange voice recorder was discovered on Monday The ""black box"" voice recorder from a Lion Air flight which crashed off the coast of Jakarta in October has been recovered, said officials on Monday. All 189 people on board died when Flight JT610 fell into the sea shortly after taking off for the short journey to Pangkal Pinang. The pilot had asked air traffic control for permission to turn back to the airport but then contact was lost. Investigators say the plane had encountered technical problems. The aircraft - a new Boeing 737 Max - broke into many pieces when it hit the water at high speed. The plane should not have been flying on the day it went down as it was not airworthy, Indonesian investigators have said. The bright orange voice recorder was found at least 50m (165ft) from where the first black box - the plane's flight data recorder - was found last November. The voice recorder was found on Monday morning but was ""broken into two pieces"". ""Hopefully it's still useful [to investigators],"" Haryo Satmiko, deputy head of Indonesia's transport safety committee (KNKT) told Agence France-Presse. Officials have been working for months to recover debris from the flight Indonesia's Navy spokesman Agung Nugroho told Reuters that the recorder was found 8m deep, under mud on the sea floor. Mr Nugroho said that a weak signal from the recorder had been detected ""for several days"". He added that the recorder had ""obvious scratches on it"", but that it was unclear what damage it had suffered. Human remains had also been found near where the voice recorder was discovered, said Mr Nugroho. When the flight data recorder was found in November, officials said that it could take up to six months to analyse data. The last moments before the Lion Air crash Grieving Lion Air bride takes wedding photos alone The plane's flight data recorder was recovered last November Listening to the last conversations between the pilots and ground control on the CVR should help investigators finish piecing together what went wrong in the short flight. Flight JT610 took off from Jakarta at 06:20 on Monday (23:30 GMT on Sunday). It crashed minutes after the pilot asked for permission to turn back to the airport. Findings by Indonesia's transport safety committee (KNKT) suggest that Lion Air had put the plane back into service despite it having had problems on earlier flights. The pilots appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling - a new feature of the Boeing 737 Max. The anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, despite efforts by pilots to correct this, the findings suggest. Investigators have now said that the plane was not airworthy and should have been grounded. Some victims' families are suing Boeing over the accident.

"Adam Levine is the lead singer of Maroon 5 Maroon 5 have been confirmed as the 2019 Super Bowl half-time show headliners - alongside rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi. It's one of the biggest gigs in the world - more than 100 million people watched Justin Timberlake's 2018 show. But Maroon 5's decision to perform next month isn't without controversy. There have been calls for them to pull out because of the NFL's stance over some players refusing to stand when the US national anthem is played. The Super Bowl half-time show takes place during the NFL's championship game, and artists who've performed there include Beyonce and Lady Gaga. But it's been rumoured that some big stars - including Rihanna and Cardi B -have refused to perform at the show.,external Colin Kaepernick (centre) hasn't played in the NFL since 2017 Since 2016, some American football players have refused to stand when the US national anthem is played at NFL games in protest against the treatment of black people in the US. It was started by former San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick, who first sat and later kneeled while other players stood. These actions angered President Donald Trump, who has called for players who ""disrespect"" the US flag to be sacked. In May last year, the NFL announced that teamswould be fined if players kneeledfor the US national anthem. Big Boi and Travis Scott will join Maroon 5 for the Super Bowl half-time show An online petition urging Maroon 5 to reconsider their decision to perform has more than 84,000 signatures. Fans of the band posted messages of support and excitement when the band shared a teaser video on their Twitter page. ""I'll be watching. Thanks for not succumbing to the pressure not to play,"" one person wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Syrian Kurds have been protesting against Turkish threats to carry out a new offensive US President Donald Trump has threatened to ""devastate Turkey economically"" if it attacks Kurdish forces in Syria following a planned pullout of US troops. In two tweets on Sunday, Mr Trump said that he did not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey either. US forces have fought alongside a Kurdish militia in northern Syria against the Islamic State (IS) group. Turkey, however, regards the People's Protection Units (YPG) as terrorists. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken angrily about American support for the group and vowed to crush it. Turkey's foreign minister has said the country ""will not be deterred by any threat"". Mr Trump's comments on Sunday followed further criticism of his abrupt decision to withdraw US forces from Syria. Syrians: 'We are tired of war' US withdrawal backs Kurds in a corner Who are the Kurds? A senior figure in Saudi Arabia's royal family,Prince Turki al-Faisal, told the BBC it would have a ""negative impact""that would benefit Iran, Russia and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is currently in the Saudi capital Riyadh as he tours the Middle East to reassure US allies in the region. The president defended his decision to withdraw troops, saying any remaining IS fighters could be attacked from the air. He did not say how Turkey's economy would suffer if it attacked the YPG. The US imposed sanctions and trade tariffs on Turkey in August, amid a row over a detained US pastor - contributing to a sharp drop in the value of the Turkish lira. Pastor Andrew Brunson was released in October. Turkey's lira slump explained Is Turkey heading for an economic crisis? Mr Trump also mentioned the creation of a ""20-mile (32km) safe zone"", which the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher says hints at the kind of solution Mr Pompeo is trying to negotiate. Allow Twitter content?

Turkey's foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, dismissed Mr Trump's threats. ""We have said multiple times that we will not fear or be deterred by any threat. You can get nowhere by threatening Turkey economically,"" he said. He also criticised Mr Trump's methods, saying: ""Strategic alliances should not be discussed over Twitter or social media."" President Erdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said Turkey expected the US to ""honour our strategic partnership"". ""Terrorists can't be your partners and allies,"" he said. President Trump shocked allies and faced strong criticism at home last month when he ordered US forces to immediately begin withdrawing from the approximately 30% of Syria controlled by the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance. Trump rewrites US-Syria policy Has IS been defeated? The US military began its pullout last week by withdrawing some military equipment from Syria, although its troops remained in the country. Over the weekend, Mr Pompeo said he had spoken to Mr Cavusoglu by phone and was ""optimistic"" that an agreement could be reached with Turkey to protect Kurdish fighters. Speaking in Abu Dhabi, Mr Pompeo said the US recognised ""the Turkish people's right and Mr Erdogan's right to defend their country from terrorists"". ""We also know that those fighting alongside us for all this time deserve to be protected as well,"" he added. Mike Pompeo is on a politically sensitive visit to the Middle East In Riyadh,Mr Pompeo discussed Iran and the conflicts in Yemen,externaland Syria with King Salman. It is not clear whether he sought an update on the investigation into the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Arabia's rulers, was murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul three months ago. About 2,000 US military personnel are reported to be deployed in northern Syria. Ground troops first arrived in autumn 2015 when then-President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise YPG fighters. This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? The US did this after several attempts at training and arming Syrian Arab rebel groups to battle IS militants descended into chaos. Over the intervening years, the number of US troops in Syria has increased, and a network of bases and airfields has been established in an arc across the north-eastern part of the country.

Mr Trump and Turkey's president again discussed Syria on Monday. In a phone call, Mr Trump and Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke about the need to create a ""security zone"" in northern Syria, the Turkish presidency said. President Trump stressed that Turkey should not ""mistreat the Kurds and other Syrian Democratic Forces with whom we have fought to defeat"" IS, the White House said. Mr Trump also ""expressed the desire to work together to address Turkey's security concerns"" in north-eastern Syria. Syrians: 'We are tired of war' US withdrawal backs Kurds in a corner Who are the Kurds? In December, the US president announced that Washington would pull out all troops from Syria because the Islamic State militant group had been ""defeated"". The sudden move shocked allies and led to criticism. Several senior US military officials resigned shortly afterwards. There were also fears that Kurds in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which had partnered with the US, would be attacked by Turkey once the US withdrew. Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday that the withdrawal from Syria had begun, and that the US would ""devastate Turkey economically if they hit the Kurds"". He also said any remaining IS fighters could be attacked from the air, and that a 20-mile (32km) ""safe zone"" could be established. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump offered no specifics on how the US could hurt Turkey's economy, and his announcement appeared to catch his advisers by surprise.

We have applied economic sanctions in many places, I assume he is speaking about those kinds of things."" Meanwhile, Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu described Mr Trump's tweet as a ""domestic policy message"" to critics. Mr Cavusoglu has rejected Mr Trump's threats, saying: ""We have said multiple times that we will not fear or be deterred by any threat."" He also criticised Mr Trump's methods, saying: ""Strategic alliances should not be discussed over Twitter or social media."" However, US sanctions have had an impact on Turkey's economy before.

Mr Pompeo said the US recognised ""the Turkish people's right and Mr Erdogan's right to defend their country from terrorists"". ""We also know that those fighting alongside us for all this time deserve to be protected as well,"" he added. Mr Erdogan has spoken angrily about American support for the Kurdish YPG militia, and vowed to crush it. Mr Cavusoglu said Turkey was ""not against"" the idea of a secure zone - but was targeting ""a terrorist organisation trying to divide Syria"". Mr Pompeo is now in Riyadh, where he discussed Iran and the conflicts in Yemen and Syria with the Saudi leadership. Mike Pompeo met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman on Monday He said he also raised human rights issues, including the detention of women's rights activists, and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey. Mr Pompeo said King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had both ""reiterated their commitment"" to holding the killers of Mr Khashoggi accountable. Prosecutors say Mr Khashoggi, a US-based critic of the Saudi government, was murdered in a ""rogue"" operation in Istanbul, by agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom. However, many in the West have accused the crown prince of ordering the killing - something he has denied. About 2,000 US military personnel are reported to be deployed in northern Syria.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison A British-Iranian mother detained in Tehran has begun a three-day hunger strike in protest against being denied specialist medical care. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe wasjailed for five years in 2016after being convicted of spying, which she denies. The aid worker has endured pressure to spy on the UK for Iran, according to her husband, Richard Ratcliffe. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has summoned the Iranian ambassador to the UK to discuss the case. Mr Hunt has praised her bravery and criticised Iran for - in his words - allowing an innocent mother to feel she needs to resort to a hunger strike. Mr Ratcliffe said prison officials have refused to let Nazanin, 40, see a doctor to examine lumps in her breast and other health issues. He said his wife also needs neurological care over her neck pains and numbness in her arms and legs, as well as permission to see an outside psychiatrist. He added that it was hoped the hunger strike would get the Iranians to take his wife ""seriously"". Speaking at a news conference, Mr Ratcliffe set out his wife's demands - to be able to see an external doctor and to be given an agreement in writing that she will be allowed access to any medical treatment the doctor recommends. Mr Ratcliffe also described how his wife was told by members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard in late December that she would be ""safer afterwards"" if she spied on the UK Department for International Development and the civil society organisation Small Media. He said this offer, which she refused, ""really pushed her over the edge"". ""The only weapon we have is to tell Nazanin's story,"" he added. Speaking to the Observer,external, Mr Ratcliffe said: ""We know a hunger strike has significant physical consequences the longer it goes on for, and Nazanin is feeling a strong sense of trepidation. ""But there aren't many ways she can say, 'enough is enough, take me seriously'."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is going on hunger strike in Iran's Evin prison, alongside prominent Iranian human rights activist Narges Mohammadi, who also requires medical attentionaccording to Amnesty International.,external Mr Ratcliffe said his wife would consider extending the strike if her demands to see a doctor were not met. Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle PM calls for jailed mum to be released Nazanin's husband tells of jail anguish Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has been held in Iran since April 2016 Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, of Hampstead in north-west London, spent her 40th birthday on Boxing Day in prison, where she has been detained for more than 1,000 days. She was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 and has always maintained the visit was to introduce her daughter, Gabriella, to her relatives. The four-year-old has been staying with family in Iran since her mother was detained - although they were briefly reunited during athree-day temporary releaselast August. Since returning to prison, after her application for an extended release was denied, she hassuffered several panic attacks. Her husband has mounted a high-profile campaign for his wife's release, with Prime Minister Theresa May, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and London Mayor Sadiq Khan all calling for her to be freed. Monique Villa, chief executive of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, where Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe works,  said: ""It is extremely shocking to see our colleague Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe going on hunger strike to protest at her inhumane treatment in Evin prison, at a time where her health is already at its poorest. ""I am sincerely worried about the dire consequences of this. ""As her employer, I repeat that Nazanin is totally innocent, and certainly not spy material, as portrayed by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. ""The Iranian government and judiciary must act immediately, release her and allow urgent treatment before her health deteriorates any further.""

"The bright orange voice recorder was discovered on Monday The ""black box"" voice recorder from a Lion Air flight which crashed off the coast of Jakarta in October has been recovered, said officials on Monday. All 189 people on board died when Flight JT610 fell into the sea shortly after taking off for the short journey to Pangkal Pinang. The pilot had asked air traffic control for permission to turn back to the airport but then contact was lost. Investigators say the plane had encountered technical problems. The aircraft - a new Boeing 737 Max - broke into many pieces when it hit the water at high speed. The plane should not have been flying on the day it went down as it was not airworthy, Indonesian investigators have said. The bright orange voice recorder was found at least 50m (165ft) from where the first black box - the plane's flight data recorder - was found last November. The voice recorder was found on Monday morning but was ""broken into two pieces"". ""Hopefully it's still useful [to investigators],"" Haryo Satmiko, deputy head of Indonesia's transport safety committee (KNKT) told Agence France-Presse. Officials have been working for months to recover debris from the flight Indonesia's Navy spokesman Agung Nugroho told Reuters that the recorder was found 8m deep, under mud on the sea floor. Mr Nugroho said that a weak signal from the recorder had been detected ""for several days"". He added that the recorder had ""obvious scratches on it"", but that it was unclear what damage it had suffered. Human remains had also been found near where the voice recorder was discovered, said Mr Nugroho. When the flight data recorder was found in November, officials said that it could take up to six months to analyse data. The last moments before the Lion Air crash Grieving Lion Air bride takes wedding photos alone The plane's flight data recorder was recovered last November Listening to the last conversations between the pilots and ground control on the CVR should help investigators finish piecing together what went wrong in the short flight. Flight JT610 took off from Jakarta at 06:20 on Monday (23:30 GMT on Sunday). It crashed minutes after the pilot asked for permission to turn back to the airport. Findings by Indonesia's transport safety committee (KNKT) suggest that Lion Air had put the plane back into service despite it having had problems on earlier flights. The pilots appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling - a new feature of the Boeing 737 Max. The anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down, despite efforts by pilots to correct this, the findings suggest. Investigators have now said that the plane was not airworthy and should have been grounded. Some victims' families are suing Boeing over the accident.

"I know that, right here, I've been writing about, and we've been discussing, our prime minister's and politicians' Brexit choices for more than two-and-a-half years. And, yes indeed, there have been many, many times we have reported it is a crunch moment, a crucial day, or a vital moment. And each mini-drama, each bizarre twist, each day where we have moved further from anything like politics-as-usual, has had meaning. That's true of the prime minister's speech in Florence, the meltingly hot cabinet day out at Chequers, Boris Johnson stalking out of the cabinet, or indeed, the EU saying ""non, non, non"" at Salzburg, or Gina Miller's Supreme Court appeal, where on Parliament's behalf - on behalf of all of us in a sense - she won a bigger say over Brexit for MPs. Ministers battle to save Brexit deal Reality Check: Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? I'm confused... what's happening with Brexit? How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Barring an almost incredible-to-imagine second delay to the vote, Tuesday is when MPs get the chance to express that wish - to say yes or no to the deal that's on the table. The weird thing about it is that unless, again, something almost impossible-to-ponder happens, we know they are, in large numbers, going to say no. There is precious little jeopardy in saying that, althoughbe sceptical of any predictions about the size of the defeat. MPs don't even trust each other on rebellions, let alone always stick to what they may brag about before. If you take a clear ""no"" vote as read then, there is a possibility that moves afoot to stop us leaving without a deal, will be taken by parliamentarians who have been studying the rule books very closely. Gina Miller's court case won MPs the right for a bigger say on Brexit In recent months amid the cacophony, Parliament has steadily been taking more and more control of the Brexit process, if not ownership of the problems. And it's likely this week there will be another attempt, maybe even before the vote, to remove the risk that we can leave without a deal. Of course it would need a majority of MPs' support (always, always, easier said than done). But remember even if they do, the immediate question will be: for what? At the moment there is no majority in Parliament for any plan that has actually been put on the table. And some cabinet ministers believe the attempt to snarl up the process in that way could be blocked in any case. If that's so, well, several cabinet ministers from different parts of the Tory party, have told me they expect the prime minister will have at least another attempt to get her deal, or something rather like it, through Parliament. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. But despite her reputation for secrecy, this week she will have to make something clear. Will she shift to what many in Parliament want, a closer relationship with the EU, perhaps moving across to some kind of customs union? Or will she ramp up preparations for no-deal, trying (which many just don't believe) to show that she really would be willing to walk away with no deal, in the hope that pressure would persuade the EU to crack and make it plain she is not for turning? That is likely to be the call she'll have to make. One cabinet minister told me: ""This week it distils into what people truly think - between those who are really scared of leaving without a deal, and those who are really scared of not leaving."" Even after all this time, the Tories, and this Brexit prime minister, are still faced with the same fundamental choice there always has been - take the risk of going it alone with a dramatic break from the EU, with all the turmoil that might go alongside it. Or cleave to a closer relationship with the EU, some kind of customs union by another name, that could tear the Tory party apart. Lord Hattersley calls for another referendum Blocking Brexit 'may cause far-right surge' Grieve: Delay Brexit if deal is rejected Delay is a tactic that has been used by Theresa May with great effect, arguably keeping her - even if unhappily - in office. Every route that she might choose has risks, perhaps none of the choices are tempting for Number 10. But on Tuesday night votes will actually be counted - the numbers, and decisions after they come, just won't wait much longer.

"Syrian Kurds have been protesting against Turkish threats to carry out a new offensive US President Donald Trump has threatened to ""devastate Turkey economically"" if it attacks Kurdish forces in Syria following a planned pullout of US troops. In two tweets on Sunday, Mr Trump said that he did not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey either. US forces have fought alongside a Kurdish militia in northern Syria against the Islamic State (IS) group. Turkey, however, regards the People's Protection Units (YPG) as terrorists. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken angrily about American support for the group and vowed to crush it. Turkey's foreign minister has said the country ""will not be deterred by any threat"". Mr Trump's comments on Sunday followed further criticism of his abrupt decision to withdraw US forces from Syria. Syrians: 'We are tired of war' US withdrawal backs Kurds in a corner Who are the Kurds? A senior figure in Saudi Arabia's royal family,Prince Turki al-Faisal, told the BBC it would have a ""negative impact""that would benefit Iran, Russia and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is currently in the Saudi capital Riyadh as he tours the Middle East to reassure US allies in the region. The president defended his decision to withdraw troops, saying any remaining IS fighters could be attacked from the air. He did not say how Turkey's economy would suffer if it attacked the YPG. The US imposed sanctions and trade tariffs on Turkey in August, amid a row over a detained US pastor - contributing to a sharp drop in the value of the Turkish lira. Pastor Andrew Brunson was released in October. Turkey's lira slump explained Is Turkey heading for an economic crisis? Mr Trump also mentioned the creation of a ""20-mile (32km) safe zone"", which the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher says hints at the kind of solution Mr Pompeo is trying to negotiate. Allow Twitter content?

Turkey's foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, dismissed Mr Trump's threats. ""We have said multiple times that we will not fear or be deterred by any threat. You can get nowhere by threatening Turkey economically,"" he said. He also criticised Mr Trump's methods, saying: ""Strategic alliances should not be discussed over Twitter or social media."" President Erdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said Turkey expected the US to ""honour our strategic partnership"". ""Terrorists can't be your partners and allies,"" he said. President Trump shocked allies and faced strong criticism at home last month when he ordered US forces to immediately begin withdrawing from the approximately 30% of Syria controlled by the YPG-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance. Trump rewrites US-Syria policy Has IS been defeated? The US military began its pullout last week by withdrawing some military equipment from Syria, although its troops remained in the country. Over the weekend, Mr Pompeo said he had spoken to Mr Cavusoglu by phone and was ""optimistic"" that an agreement could be reached with Turkey to protect Kurdish fighters. Speaking in Abu Dhabi, Mr Pompeo said the US recognised ""the Turkish people's right and Mr Erdogan's right to defend their country from terrorists"". ""We also know that those fighting alongside us for all this time deserve to be protected as well,"" he added.

"A group of lucky Cathay Pacific customers have scored first-class seats at economy prices, in the second fare blunder by the airline this month. Tickets on trips from Hong Kong to Portugal were sold on the airline's website for $1,512, instead of $16,000 usually charged for a similar journey. The carrier said it would honour the tickets as it investigates the cause of the error. It extends a recent run of blows to the firm including ahuge data breach. The mispriced fares were available on Cathay Pacific's website on Sunday. First-class flights from Lisbon to Hong Kong - via London with a connecting flight - were offered for $1,512 (Â£1,177), according to the South China Morning Post. A similar first-class journey through Frankfurt would cost $16,000. In a statement, the Hong Kong carrier said it would honour the tickets. ""We are looking into the root cause of this incident both internally and externally with our vendors,"" it said. ""For the very small number of customers who have purchased these tickets, we look forward to welcoming you on board to enjoy our premium services."" Just two weeks ago the airline made the same blunder. Lucky flyers made off with business-class seats on flights from Vietnam to New York for about $675 return. They should have cost $16,000. At the time, the carrier acknowledged its ""mistake"" and again, said it would welcome the passengers onboard. Cathay Pacific to honour $16,000 fares sold for $675 Airlines have a mixed history of honouring tickets sold in error. Singapore Airlines, for example, honoured tickets sold for less than half price in 2014. But United Airlines cancelled transatlantic tickets sold for less than $100 by a ""third party software provider"" the following year. The latest stumble extends a bad run for Cathay Pacific. In October, the firm was the subject of a data breach in its IT systems, jeopardising the personal information of up to 9.4 million passengers. Huge data hack hits Cathay Pacific A month earlier, it had to send one of its planes back to the paint shop afterspelling the airline's name ""Cathay Paciic""on the side of a jet. The Hong Kong-based airline joked ""Oops this special livery won't last long"" after the error was pointed out Those missteps come as the airline tries to return to profitability after posting its first ever back-to-back annual loss in March.

"This video can not be played UK scientists estimate air pollution cuts British people's lives by an average of six months Wood burning stoves, open fires and farms all face new restrictions as the government sets out what it calls a ""world leading"" plan to tackle air pollution. In theirClean Air Strategy,external, published today, the government promises to set a ""bold new goal"" to reduce particulates across much of the country by 2030. But green groups say the scheme is vague and severely lacking in detail. They believe the plan proposes nothing new to tackle roadside dirty air. The new strategy, which is focused on tackling air pollution in England, has been launched just days after the family of anine-year-old girl who died from asthmawere given permission to apply for a fresh inquest into her death. The government's chief lawyer heard new evidence her death could be linked to unlawful levels of air pollution. Air pollution early deaths rise in EU Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? Even low air pollution may damage heart Retired librarian Catherine Bazell suffers from a lung condition called bronchiectasis Catherine Bazell is a retired London librarian who suffers from asthma and a condition called bronchiectasis. It's a long-term illness where the airways of the lungs become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. ""People can't always see dirty air but it's there,"" she told BBC News. ""I find it really frustrating, it means that I feel really tired, I can get tightness in my chest, I find it hard to breathe, it just stops you from doing all things you'd like to do. ""You see the alerts, that say it's a very polluted day today and you are obliged to stay in to keep away from the pollution, and that makes me quite angry because why should we have to stay in? ""We need to do something about the air pollution so that people can live normal lives."" While overall levels of air pollution have been declining in recent decades, there has also been a growing scientific awareness of the scale of problems that it causes. NHS England says that almost 30% of preventable deaths in England are due to non-communicable diseases specifically attributed to air pollution. A pollutant called Particulate Matter (PM) is a particular concern with the World Health Organization (WHO) identifying it as the most damaging for people. Fine particulates, known as PM2.5, are around 200 times smaller than a grain of sand. They are a major health worry as they can penetrate deep into your lungs, pass into your bloodstream and get embedded in your bodily organs and your brain. The WHO's models indicate that around 92% of the world's population live in places where air quality levels exceed their guidelines. In the UK,more than 40 cities and townswere at, or have exceeded, the WHO limit. The government has previously said it will reduce by half the number of people living in areas breaching the WHO limits by 2025. But they now say they will go beyond this and set a ""world leading"" goal on exposure to PM2.5. Without giving many details, or a timeline, the government says that by 2030, fine particulate concentrations will be reduced below the WHO safe level ""across much of the country"". The government says it will publish evidence early in 2019 on what actions will be needed to meet this new target. Ministers argue that Brexit will allow the UK to go much further on this issue than the EU and become the first major economy to adopt air quality goals based on WHO recommendations. The most important activity that contributes to particulate pollution is the burning of fuels such as wood and coal in open fires and domestic stoves. This video can not be played Simple tips to avoid inhaling air from traffic and other common sources of pollution. Farming is also a major problem, as emissions of ammonia have increased in recent years. This gas reacts in the atmosphere with other chemicals to produce particulate matter that can be carried on the wind to major population centres. To deal with domestic burning, the government will ban the sale of the most polluting fuels and ensure that only the cleanest stoves are available for sale by 2022. They are also consulting on phasing out the sale of traditional house coal and on limiting the sale of wet wood, the type found on garage forecourts. The government's plan for these fuels is expected within months. For farmers, the government says it will introduce regulations to require them to use low emission farming techniques. There will be advice, training and support to help them invest in the technology to limit ammonia. The move on particulate matter has been welcomed by the WHO as an ""example for the rest of the world to follow"". Green campaigners also recognise the value of adopting the WHO guidelines but are worried about the lack of legally binding limits. ""The government has made a welcome commitment to set an ambitious new target for cleaning up the most dangerous fine particle air pollution, based on WHO standards,"" said Jenny Bates from Friends of the Earth. Emissions of ammonia from farming face new restrictions ""But while the WHO says standards should be reached by 2030, there is no date set in the government's strategy and the plan is severely lacking in detail on how such a target could be met."" Scientists also say the government initiative is laudable but may not work for everyone across the UK. ""The full evidence on reductions needed to attain the tougher WHO guidelines for PM2.5 is to be published later,"" said Prof Alastair Lewis from them National Centre for Atmospheric Science at the University of York. ""One would anticipate that there are likely to be some urban areas of the UK where this could be close to impossible to achieve."" Just a few years ago, garages across the UK reeked of oil and petrol. The smells usually came from the evaporation of fuel vapour, which released volatile organic compounds into the air. However, regulations to limit the emissions of these powerful air pollutants changed the odour of the UK's forecourts. An interim report from Imperial College shows the UK concentrations of PM2.5 in 2016 and how they may be reduced by the government's strategy by 2030 These new government plans may have a similar impact on some current air pollution smells. If the proposed restrictions on solid fuels go ahead, the smoky whiff of winter over many cities and towns might also disappear. The government says it will also provide a ""personal air quality messaging system"" to inform vulnerable members of the public with clear information about the forecast and accessible health advice. As well as new information, the new plan envisages that everyone will be financially better off if the plan succeeds. Air pollution is now the fourth biggest public health threat behind cancer, obesity and heart disease. According to the government, the steps outlined in this plan will cut the costs of dirty air to the UK by Â£1.7bn every year from 2020, rising to Â£5.3bn every year from 2030. Across the UK, about 1.5 million households use wood for fuel but these fires and stoves will now face restrictions because of their leading role in the production of particulate matter. Most people don't realise that a wood burning stove emits more particles per hour than a diesel truck. That's because a freshly cut log of wood contains about a pint of water, and much of the heat energy is used to dry the water out, which causes the wood to smoke and smoulder, releasing air pollutants. The key impact of the new strategy on existing stove owners will be on fuels like wet wood, and traditional house coal, which will likely be phased out. The government also plans to give local authorities more powers over existing smoke control areas, where you can only burn smokeless fuel - if you want to burn wood it must be in an approved device. The new strategy doesn't spell out what these extra powers will be, but the idea is to make regulations easier to enforce. The document also suggests that the government is looking to help local authorities ""to increase the rate of upgrades for inefficient and polluting heating devices"". The government will also ensure that all new stoves sold from 2022 comply with EU eco-design regulations. In fact, stoves branded eco-design compliant are already on the market. ""They won't look any different,"" said Dennis Milligan from the UK's Stove Industry Alliance. ""But the technology will allow combustion higher up in the fire chamber so that re-ignites any particles of wood that are in the smoke so the emissions that come out the chimney are reduced by 80% compared to a stove manufactured ten years ago."" It's not clear what difference these new regulations will make to sales of wood burning stoves - Recent data indicate that the market has boomed, largely driven by people looking to burn wood for its aesthetic appeal. UK levels of pollution from nitrogen oxides, produced in the main by diesel cars, have regularly exceeded European targets. So much so that the government has been successfully sued in the courts by campaign group Client Earth, to force them to come up with a plan. In July 2017, the governmentintroduced their detailed scheme for roads,external, which essentially puts the responsibility in the hands of local authorities. The cities with the worst pollution are supposed to develop plans for clean air zones that will charge drivers to enter. However, campaigners believe the government has its head in the sand on pollution from transport. As well as clean air zones, they should be taking steps to cut the number of vehicles on the roads. ""They are hoping it will all go away but the reality is an awful lot more needs to be done,"" Jenny Bates from Friends of the Earth told BBC News. ""I think they are afraid of the motoring lobby and they shouldn't be."" Other forms of transport are dealt with in the new plan including rail and shipping. The government says it wants to see the removal of all diesel-only trains by 2040. There are many ways to help. Swapping your car for walking, cycling or taking public transport is a major plus. For most of us, the health benefits far outweigh the risks of roadside pollution. You can also turn off your engine when you're stuck in a jam, or buy electric when you replace your vehicle. At home, you can burn less in your fireplace or your garden; service your gas boiler; and turn down your thermostat. Insulating your house means you'll burn less fuel. You can group on-line purchases to reduce the number of deliveries. And you can buy non-toxic cleaning fluids and sprays, because ordinary products cause emissions in the home. ""Air fresheners"" actually pollute the air. But one irony: much of the UK's pollution originates in mainland Europe, so we really need neighbouring countries to join the effort. As well as trying to deal with the major sources of particulate matter, the government's plan also deals with pollution that arises from ammonia, sulphur dioxide and non-methane volatile organic compounds. Ammonia from farms is a major focus as outlined above, for the role it plays in the development of PM.  However, it also poses major threats to sensitive natural habitats. ""Ammonia in the air over our farmlands dissolves into our wetlands and waterways and wreaks havoc on delicate aquatic ecosystems,"" said Hannah Freeman from the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. ""The proposed measures are a step forward, but what we really want is government policy that supports farmers to be true stewards, holistically managing our air, soil and water together.""

"I know that, right here, I've been writing about, and we've been discussing, our prime minister's and politicians' Brexit choices for more than two-and-a-half years. And, yes indeed, there have been many, many times we have reported it is a crunch moment, a crucial day, or a vital moment. And each mini-drama, each bizarre twist, each day where we have moved further from anything like politics-as-usual, has had meaning. That's true of the prime minister's speech in Florence, the meltingly hot cabinet day out at Chequers, Boris Johnson stalking out of the cabinet, or indeed, the EU saying ""non, non, non"" at Salzburg, or Gina Miller's Supreme Court appeal, where on Parliament's behalf - on behalf of all of us in a sense - she won a bigger say over Brexit for MPs. Ministers battle to save Brexit deal Reality Check: Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? I'm confused... what's happening with Brexit? How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Barring an almost incredible-to-imagine second delay to the vote, Tuesday is when MPs get the chance to express that wish - to say yes or no to the deal that's on the table. The weird thing about it is that unless, again, something almost impossible-to-ponder happens, we know they are, in large numbers, going to say no. There is precious little jeopardy in saying that, althoughbe sceptical of any predictions about the size of the defeat. MPs don't even trust each other on rebellions, let alone always stick to what they may brag about before. If you take a clear ""no"" vote as read then, there is a possibility that moves afoot to stop us leaving without a deal, will be taken by parliamentarians who have been studying the rule books very closely. Gina Miller's court case won MPs the right for a bigger say on Brexit In recent months amid the cacophony, Parliament has steadily been taking more and more control of the Brexit process, if not ownership of the problems. And it's likely this week there will be another attempt, maybe even before the vote, to remove the risk that we can leave without a deal. Of course it would need a majority of MPs' support (always, always, easier said than done). But remember even if they do, the immediate question will be: for what? At the moment there is no majority in Parliament for any plan that has actually been put on the table. And some cabinet ministers believe the attempt to snarl up the process in that way could be blocked in any case. If that's so, well, several cabinet ministers from different parts of the Tory party, have told me they expect the prime minister will have at least another attempt to get her deal, or something rather like it, through Parliament. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. But despite her reputation for secrecy, this week she will have to make something clear. Will she shift to what many in Parliament want, a closer relationship with the EU, perhaps moving across to some kind of customs union? Or will she ramp up preparations for no-deal, trying (which many just don't believe) to show that she really would be willing to walk away with no deal, in the hope that pressure would persuade the EU to crack and make it plain she is not for turning? That is likely to be the call she'll have to make. One cabinet minister told me: ""This week it distils into what people truly think - between those who are really scared of leaving without a deal, and those who are really scared of not leaving."" Even after all this time, the Tories, and this Brexit prime minister, are still faced with the same fundamental choice there always has been - take the risk of going it alone with a dramatic break from the EU, with all the turmoil that might go alongside it. Or cleave to a closer relationship with the EU, some kind of customs union by another name, that could tear the Tory party apart. Lord Hattersley calls for another referendum Blocking Brexit 'may cause far-right surge' Grieve: Delay Brexit if deal is rejected Delay is a tactic that has been used by Theresa May with great effect, arguably keeping her - even if unhappily - in office. Every route that she might choose has risks, perhaps none of the choices are tempting for Number 10. But on Tuesday night votes will actually be counted - the numbers, and decisions after they come, just won't wait much longer.

"Carlos and Carole Ghosn in 2016 The wife of former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has said he is suffering under ""harsh treatment"" in a Japanese jail, where he has been detained for nearly two months. In a letter to Human Rights Watch, Carole Ghosn described constant interrogations and appealed for action. Mr Ghosn's arrest for financial misconduct shocked the auto industry. His detention, which is likely to continue for months, has drawn criticism of Japan's justice system. In Japan, interrogations can be done without a lawyer present. Suspects can be detained for up to 23 days before being formally charged. Bail is not easily granted unless a suspect admits to the charges, according to theJapanese Federation of Bar Associations,external. Mr Ghosn, a towering figure of the car industry, faces three charges of financial misconduct including understating his income and aggravated breach of trust. He has denied any wrongdoing. ""For hours each day, the prosecutors interrogate him, browbeat him, lecture him and berate him, outside the presence of his attorneys, in an effort to extract a confession,"" Mrs Ghosn said in her nine-page letter to Human Rights Watch. There has been no immediate reaction to the claims from Japanese prosecutors. Ex-Nissan chair faces two new charges Ghosn: The relentless 'cost killer' The corporate scandals that rocked Japan Last week, a judge said incarcerating Mr Ghosn was justified to prevent possible evidence-tampering and because of the risk that he might flee. His defence team previously denied that the executive had been pressured to sign documents or a confession in Japanese, the AFP news agency reports. In the letter, which has been widely reported, Mrs Ghosn describes the conditions of her husband's detention. She said he is being held in a small, unheated cell and denied daily medication. He has lost weight since his detention, she said, and eats mainly rice and barley. Last week, the 64-year-old looked visibly thinner when he appeared in court for the first time since his arrest on 19 November. ""I urge Human Rights Watch to highlight his case... to press the government to reform its draconian system of pretrial detention and interrogation,"" the letter said. Mr Ghosn has been charged with aggravated breach of trust and understating his income Mr Ghosn's lawyers said hecould be in jail for another six months before his first trialis held. ""No one should be forced to endure what my husband faces every day, particularly in a developed nation like Japan, the third largest economy in the world,"" the letter said. Brazilian-born auto executive was the architect of the Renault-Nissan alliance, and brought Mitsubishi on board in 2016.

"Millions of tourists visit the Trevi fountain every year A row has broken out between the mayor of Rome and the Roman Catholic Church over what should happen to coins retrieved from the Trevi fountain. Every year nearly â¬1.5m (Â£1.3m) is fished out of the famous landmark. It is traditionally given to a Catholic charity to help the destitute. But now Mayor Virginia Raggi wants the money spent on the city's crumbling infrastructure instead. The Catholic charity Caritas says the loss of income will hit the poor. ""We did not foresee this outcome,"" Caritas director Father Benoni Ambarus told Avvenire, the newspaper of the Italian bishops' conference. ""I still hope it will not be final."" Protest party finds ruling Rome is hard Why do Rome's buses keep catching fire? The newspaper ran a scathing article on the move in its Saturday edition, headlined ""Money taken from the poorest"". City councillors have approved the change and it is due to take place in April. However, many Italians have taken to social media to ask the council to reconsider, the Ansa news agency reported. Ms Raggi took control of Rome in 2016 for the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which formed a national coalition government last year. Protesters say Mayor Virginia Raggi has not done enough to fix the city's problems Her popularity has fallen for failing to tackle the indebted city's issues. In October, thousands of protesters gathered outside city hall to denounce Ms Raggi for failing to address problems including uncollected rubbish and potholed roads. The Trevi fountain, nearly 300 years old, is visited by millions of tourists every year. The tradition of throwing coins was made famous by Frank Sinatra's Three Coins in the Fountain in the 1954 romantic comedy of the same name. The fountain also featured in the 1960 film La Dolce Vita which saw actress Anita Ekberg wade through its pristine waters in a strapless dress.

"The UK government's nuclear policy is under renewed scrutiny as the firm behind a Â£20bn reactor in Wales looks set to halt construction. Japanese media reports say Hitachi will suspend work on its Horizon division's Wylfa Newydd plant this week. The company says no formal decision has yet been made. But if the project is scrapped, it will cost 400 jobs and leave the Hinkley Point power station in Somerset as the only new UK reactor still being built. In November, plans to build a nuclear power station at Moorside in Cumbria were halted after Toshiba announced it was winding up its NuGeneration subsidiary, which was behind the project. The government continues to stress that it is still in talks with Hitachi about Wylfa. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: ""Negotiations with Hitachi on agreeing a deal that provides value for money for consumers and taxpayers on the Wylfa project are ongoing. ""They are commercially sensitive and we do not comment on speculation."" What's Wylfa - and why is it so important? Wylfa nuclear axe reports 'worrying' Wylfa Newydd future doubt 'speculation' 'Wylfa jobs could drain away to England' The latest developments are likely to force the government to sweeten future nuclear plant deals for potential investors, in what one expert has called a ""desperate leap in the dark"". Energy Secretary Greg Clark has already suggested that regulated asset base (RAB) funding could be used for nuclear projects in future. The method, which has already been used for other infrastructure schemes includingthe Â£4.2bn Thames Tideway ""super-sewer"", allows investors to receive returns before the projects have been completed. It also allows the Treasury to keep the costs off its books by recouping the investment from consumers' bills rather than through direct taxation. A BEIS spokesperson said on Sunday that it remained the government's objective in the longer term that new nuclear projects, like other energy infrastructure, should be financed by the private sector. The spokesperson added: ""Alongside our discussions with developers, we will be reviewing the viability of a regulated asset base model as a sustainable funding model based on private finance for future projects beyond Wylfa, which could deliver the government's objectives in terms of value for money, fiscal responsibility and decarbonisation."" Carwyn Jones, who holds the economic development portfolio on Anglesey council, said the project held ""a once in a generation opportunity"" for economic growth for the area. ""In terms of the economic development, jobs and opportunities, it's something we are holding out for,"" he said. However, Robat Idris, from campaign group People Against Wylfa B, said: ""We have warned for several years that the case doesn't stack up financially. ""It's time to go back to the drawing board. It's time for the local politicians to abandon this ridiculous dream that they've had."" One economist, Prof Dieter Helm of Oxford University, has said RAB funding could work if it is properly regulated. In an analysis of the model,external, he wrote: ""The RAB approach is... probably inferior to the direct procurement route, but the latter is ruled out by the Treasury-imposed constraints. ""The RAB model is a second-best, but much better than the Hinkley-style contract."" However, energy expert Prof Paul Dorfman, of the Energy Institute at University College London, is more sceptical. He told the BBC that nuclear power plants could not be built without ""vast"" public subsidies and that RAB funding was merely ""a fiscally dextrous form of subsidy"". He added: ""It's never been tried for projects as technically complex as nuclear power that take about a decade to build. ""It really looks as if the government are flailing. It's a last desperate leap in the dark."" Both Prof Helm and Prof Dorfman take the view that the UK has various possible ways of satisfying its future energy needs. Prof Helm says that nuclear faces ""deep challenges"", adding: ""It is for society to decide whether it wants new nuclear or not. The market cannot decide."" For Prof Dorfman, renewable energy is now ""cost-competitive with fossil fuels"" and offers ""a cheaper and better way forward"".

"Carlos and Carole Ghosn in 2016 The wife of former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has said he is suffering under ""harsh treatment"" in a Japanese jail, where he has been detained for nearly two months. In a letter to Human Rights Watch, Carole Ghosn described constant interrogations and appealed for action. Mr Ghosn's arrest for financial misconduct shocked the auto industry. His detention, which is likely to continue for months, has drawn criticism of Japan's justice system. In Japan, interrogations can be done without a lawyer present. Suspects can be detained for up to 23 days before being formally charged. Bail is not easily granted unless a suspect admits to the charges, according to theJapanese Federation of Bar Associations,external. Mr Ghosn, a towering figure of the car industry, faces three charges of financial misconduct including understating his income and aggravated breach of trust. He has denied any wrongdoing. ""For hours each day, the prosecutors interrogate him, browbeat him, lecture him and berate him, outside the presence of his attorneys, in an effort to extract a confession,"" Mrs Ghosn said in her nine-page letter to Human Rights Watch. There has been no immediate reaction to the claims from Japanese prosecutors. Ex-Nissan chair faces two new charges Ghosn: The relentless 'cost killer' The corporate scandals that rocked Japan Last week, a judge said incarcerating Mr Ghosn was justified to prevent possible evidence-tampering and because of the risk that he might flee. His defence team previously denied that the executive had been pressured to sign documents or a confession in Japanese, the AFP news agency reports. In the letter, which has been widely reported, Mrs Ghosn describes the conditions of her husband's detention. She said he is being held in a small, unheated cell and denied daily medication. He has lost weight since his detention, she said, and eats mainly rice and barley. Last week, the 64-year-old looked visibly thinner when he appeared in court for the first time since his arrest on 19 November. ""I urge Human Rights Watch to highlight his case... to press the government to reform its draconian system of pretrial detention and interrogation,"" the letter said. Mr Ghosn has been charged with aggravated breach of trust and understating his income Mr Ghosn's lawyers said hecould be in jail for another six months before his first trialis held. ""No one should be forced to endure what my husband faces every day, particularly in a developed nation like Japan, the third largest economy in the world,"" the letter said. Brazilian-born auto executive was the architect of the Renault-Nissan alliance, and brought Mitsubishi on board in 2016. In the past, he has been hailed a hero in Japan for turning around the ailing Nissan.

"As the March deadline for leaving the European Union approaches, councils and other local organisations are drawing up contingency plans to be put in place in the event of the UK exiting the EU without a deal. The possibility that a no-deal Brexit  (ie where the UK immediately drops out of the EU single market and customs union) could lead to traffic jams, especially around ports, is one area being looked at. In a letter to MPs, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said it was ""possible that there could be some freight traffic disruption in Kent in the event of a no-deal, if additional customs checks were introduced in Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk, where freight services disembark."" Kent is home to the Port of Dover, which handles approximately10,500 lorries a day,external, with the Channel Tunnel receiving a further 6,000 lorries daily. Operation Brock lorry park A256 trial 'too little too late' No-deal Brexit planning shuts M26 overnight Brexit border checks 'may triple queues' Most lorries transporting freight overseas are accustomed to rolling on a ferry one end and rolling off at the other - it's relatively easy, seamless and quick. At the moment, freight vehicles going through Dover are subject to passport and security checks. But under a no-deal scenario, EU-bound lorries will also need to complete custom declarations. Furthermore, certain UK goods arriving into EU ports may also require physical checks, under single market rules. This would apply to certain food, animal and chemical products - like insecticides. The worry is that these extra checks could lead to bottlenecks, as lorries wait to be processed. In its no-deal guidance published in September, the UK government pledged to introduce ""contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic,external"" in the event of delays caused by extra checks. So how could traffic be affected and what are the plans to stop any gridlock? Dover has looked at the potential impact of more checks on lorries and - through independent modelling - has estimated that two minutes of extra processing time for each lorry would lead to tailbacks of 17 miles. The port authorities say that the present ""frictionless trade"" between the UK and the EU means that tailbacks in and around the port are ""very rare"". Researchers at Imperial College, London, have gone further. In a paper published last March, they estimated that extra check times could lead to a ""dramatic increase of congestion on the motorways as well as local streets,external"", with tailbacks of up to 29 miles. Given just how quickly the roads around Dover could become clogged, Kent County Council, along with the Department for Transport, has been developing contingency plans. Since 2015, a traffic management system known asDover Tap,external(Traffic Assessment Project) has been used to control traffic around the port during times of ""mild disruption"". When Tap is in use, lorry drivers heading to the Port of Dover via the A20 must use the left-hand lane only, and stick to a 40mph speed limit. Under a no-deal Brexit, Tap would remain the first line of defence. But if it proves unable to control the volume of traffic, then a plan called Operation Brock would come into effect. This involves a contraflow system - ie traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway. This system would operate for about 13 miles, between junctions eight (Maidstone) and nine (Ashford) on the M20, and lorries would be left queuing on the other side. This means -unlike under the previous Operation Stack- the M20 would be kept open and traffic would continue to flow in both directions at times of disruption. Kent county council says that this system would be able to cope with up to 2,000 lorries. If that proved to be insufficient, the next option would be to divert Dover traffic to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it as a lorry park to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time. The Department for Transport carried out two test runs at Manston on 7 January, using up to 90 lorries. It said the test went well and traffic flowed smoothly, although the Road Haulage Association complained the exercise ""was too little too late"" and should have begun months earlier. This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield on 7 January before travelling in convoy to Dover If further capacity was still required, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the M26 into a temporary lorry park. The M26 is a 10-mile motorway connecting the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20 near West Malling. Under this scenario, the M26 would be closed to normal road users and lorries would park on the carriageway. Kent council believes this option could accommodate a further 2,000 lorries. Ultimately it would be up to the police to decide the circumstances under which each plan would be triggered. Chris Grayling says the main focus of traffic contingency planning is solely on Kent - given the large numbers of lorries passing through Dover each day. His letter to local MPs adds that the situation in Kent is ""unique"" and other UK ports don't face the same risk. Part of the M20 was shut in the summer of 2015 under Operation Stack after port workers in Calais went on strike But that hasn't stopped other councils from considering their options. Portsmouth Council owns the city's port and says it's concerned about a lack of infrastructure outside the freight gates, saying it only has space for 13 lorries before they would end up queuing on a nearby roundabout. About 500 lorries are handled by Portsmouth International Port each day and the council says it's currently looking to acquire nearby land to turn into a potential lorry park in the event that additional checks cause delays. In the case of maximum disruption, lorries could be stacked on some local roads, including motorway sections - according to Assistant Chief Constable Dave Hardcastle on behalf of the Hampshire Local Resilience Forum. However, Mr Hardcastle adds this would be the ""least preferred option"" and the priority is to acquire Dunsbury Park in nearby Havant as a holding area. Ke Han, who specialises in traffic modelling and led Imperial College's research, believes the plans being developed by local councils should avoid significant traffic problems - but he still expects queues, possibly of up to 10 miles, around the Port of Dover in the event of no-deal. ""Lorry parks will reduce the impact on local traffic but they won't reduce the expected delays for the lorries. Even if you divert the lorries they still need to eventually converge at a single point,"" he says. There are also practical considerations for the drivers. ""If they're to be parked up for a day, drivers need to get access to coffee, food and toilets,"" Rona Hunnisett, from the Freight Transport Association, says. She welcomes the contingency plans being drawn up but says they're not a long-term solution, and delays will ultimately hurt businesses. ""We need to reduce the friction at the border if there is a no-deal Brexit,"" she says. The Department for Transport told BBC News it neither wanted nor expected a no-deal, but would ""continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies"".

"Trips across the Channel won't be the same for Britons and EU citizens Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been keen to stress that the rights of EU citizens living in the UK will be protected in the case of a no-deal Brexit. But the EU cannot give such a guarantee for UK citizens because it would be up to individual member states. The Withdrawal Agreement, negotiated by former UK PM Theresa May, offers temporary guarantees for UK citizens in EU countries, but that has failed to get Parliamentary approval and a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is a very real possibility. Under no deal, a host of things would change overnight - what critics call the ""cliff edge"". But here we will focus on the situation of Britons living in another EU country (in the EU27). About 1.3m UK-born people are resident in the EU27, while the UK hosts about 3.2m EU27 nationals. The withdrawal deal would enable them to keep their current freedom of movement and other EU citizenship rights, until 31 December 2020, when the Brexit transition period ends. The Withdrawal Agreement - what it all means As for no deal, there is huge uncertainty about what it will mean for Britons living in France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere. The priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country. The European Commission, in itscontingency plan for no-deal Brexit,external, urges the EU27 to ""take a generous approach to the rights of UK citizens in the EU, provided that this approach is reciprocated by the UK"". It says the EU27 ""should adopt a pragmatic approach to granting temporary residence status"". Brexit: A really simple guide Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? How many Brits abroad are there? There is uncertainty over how a no deal would affect flights in Europe The Commission - the EU executive - has proposed visa-free travel for British visitors to the EU, provided the UK reciprocates. Under thepolitical declaration agreed alongside the withdrawal deal,externalthe UK says ""the principle of free movement of persons between the Union and the United Kingdom will no longer apply"" after the transition. It speaks of ""non-discrimination"" and ""full reciprocity"" and says both sides ""aim to provide, through their domestic laws, for visa-free travel for short-term visits"". However, that declaration is not legally binding; it spells out ambitions for the future UK-EU relationship, yet to be negotiated. Under no deal, the declaration would be null and void. The UK would immediately be treated by the EU as a ""third country"" like other non-EU states. So the rules for Britons in the EU could well be the same as for Americans or Chinese - it will depend on the rules of the individual member states. Some of them haveannounced interim measures,externalto protect UK citizens in the case of a no-deal Brexit, but they are generally only temporary, for example, Spain will offer transitional measures for 21 months after Brexit, Germany offers protection for nine months and France will put them in place for one year. Brexit and holidays: What do I need to know? British workers are integral to Airbus airliner production in Europe No deal would immediately hit Britons whose work currently takes them to more than one EU country. They would no longer be on a level playing field vis-a-vis EU citizens, who can easily move to another EU country and start a new job there. For Britons, post-Brexit, there will be more bureaucracy. Mobility in Europe is important for many private sector workers, especially in the tech sector,such as computer game designers,external. Specialists involved in pan-European research projects also need to be able to travel easily across the EU, often at short notice. Daniel Tetlow ofcampaign group British in Germany,externalsays ""Brits are now being discriminated against in job applications"". Post-Brexit, he said: ""I have the right only to continue working in Germany - I'm effectively landlocked. ""This has huge career implications for all UK citizens, not just those living in the EU, as is often misunderstood,"" he told the BBC. British in Germany is part of the coalition British in Europe. It is not clear which UK professional qualifications will be recognised in the EU post-Brexit, and vice versa. Those details are yet to be negotiated. Under the withdrawal deal, British students in the EU27 can continue under the current system. But from 2021 they may face much higher tuition fees - those that non-EU students have to pay. Only Germany and Norway (which applies EU rules) offer free tuition for international students. Why some UK citizens face Brexit dilemma No-deal Brexit 'biggest threat' to universities Job search in Berlin: Conditions will change for British jobseekers No deal would mean the current reciprocal healthcare, shared by the UK and the EU27, would no longer apply. It could send health insurance premiums soaring for UK citizens who need sufficient cover for holidays or work in the EU. No deal would most likely delay the registration of some medicines and/or delivery of them. Britons could find their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) - a passport to emergency medical treatment - is no longer valid in some EU countries. What will happen to the EHIC after Brexit? Will Britons living in the EU still get healthcare? The House of Commons Library says,externalthat post-Brexit, if a UK national moves to the EU, access to benefits will depend on the host country's immigration policy and the terms of any bilateral social security agreement it has with the UK. In the EU, social security contributions are co-ordinated. So someone who has worked in more than one member state can make just one application to the relevant agency where they are living when they reach pension age. That agency notifies any other EU state where the individual has worked, and the national insurance contribution that he/she paid there becomes part of the pension. That reciprocity disappears under a no-deal scenario. It is not clear whether any old bilateral UK deals with individual EU states on social security will be revived. The UK tax treatment of overseas pension transfers could change post-Brexit. Transfers from the UK to non-EU countries have been subject to a 25% UK ""overseas tax charge"" since 2017. There is no guarantee that tax-free transfers will continue for UK pensioners living in the EU. What does Brexit mean for UK pensioners living in Europe? BenalmÃ¡dena, Costa del Sol: British pensioners face Brexit uncertainty What about the EU27 countries where most UK citizens live? Of the estimated 310,000 Britons living in Spain, about 65,000 are resident and in permanent work. About one-third of the 310,000 are pensioners. No deal would be much less of a problem for a Briton with dual nationality. But Spain does not allow it - except for veterans of the 1930s left-wing International Brigades and Sephardi Jews who can prove a family connection with Spain. For other Britons, acquiring Spanish citizenship means surrendering a UK passport. ""Third country"" nationals in Spain have to prove annual income of at least â¬26,000 (Â£23,000; $30,000) to remain legally resident - and that could be a problem for some British pensioners, post-Brexit. Spain is offering a 21-month grace period of protection for UK nationals, after which proof of residence will be needed. Why is everyone talking about Gibraltar? Whatever happens, both governments say, the Common Travel Area (CTA) will remain in force. That is a relief for Britons living in Ireland and the people of Northern Ireland. Under the CTA, Irish and British citizens can travel and work freely in both countries. It is also recognised by the EU. The big risk is that no deal could bring back a ""hard"" Northern Ireland border - something the withdrawal deal goes to great lengths to prevent, with the controversial backstop plan. What will Ireland do if thereâs no deal? French MPs have granted the government emergency powers to issue decrees in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The government says it will not impose visas on British visitors, provided the UK government also maintains visa-free travel. Britons living in France will have their rights protected for a one-year transitional period, and will have to apply for a residence permit in the first six months. The French village that fears for its Brits From 31 October - in the event of no deal - Britons will have nine months to register for a new residence permit.

"Kelly Field, left, shared her experience with the makers of Sheridan Smith's Cleaning Up A woman who built up debts of Â£70,000 by betting online is calling for more support for female gambling addicts. Kelly Field shared her story with the makers of ITV's Cleaning Up. where Sheridan Smith plays an office cleaner who turns to crime to cover her gambling debts. Ms Field said she hopes the show will highlight how gambling addiction is not just a problem for men. ""There aren't as many women speaking out,"" she said. ""Gambling is seen as bookies and men and dogs and horses. But there's probably just as many women who are gambling addicts as men."" Ms Field said she was contacted by the programme makers and told them her story of how she used online gambling as ""escapism"" after a stressful period when she was off work due to a grievance. According to Mark Marlow, the writer of Cleaning Up, Sheridan Smith's character Sam ""came alive"" when he spoke to women about their gambling and how it affected family and friends. Barclays introduces 'spending blocker' Online gambling firms fined Â£14m ""I looked into the differences between why women gamble as opposed to why men gamble and I discovered women do it more as an escape,"" he said. Ms Field said she was pleased to see Smith, a Bafta Award-winning star, highlighting an issue such as gambling addiction. ""She's so popular and she creates such good characters that it will get the message across a lot further,"" she said. Within six months of being introduced to online bingo and online slot machines, Ms Field said she had run up debts of Â£10,000. She said: ""You're in this online virtual reality so you're not dealing with what you're dealing with in reality. ""It feels like playing computer games when you're a kid. You've got your high scores, your lives left. It just seems like digits, it's not really money. That's why people lose so much."" Sheridan Smith's character turns to insider trading to cover her gambling losses Ms Field said she hid her addiction at first, choosing to ""smile and hide the credit card bill"". But the pressure of the financial losses and lies took its toll. ""You isolate yourself so much for everybody. You get trapped in a cycle of playing to win, losing, then playing to win back whatever you've lost, and then losing more. You miss appointments, social events,"" she said. ""It takes a part of you that you never get back. You are physically and mentally not the person that you were before."" Eventually she confessed to her partner and went to the doctor, seeking counselling for addiction. But she said the counsellor never turned up to her appointment. After that, she spent several more years as an addict, increasing her debts by tens of thousands of pounds. ""People don't understand the struggle it takes to go to a medical professional and say you need help. I didn't go back to counselling with the NHS,"" she said. ""My partner was a nervous wreck. He didn't know how to help me and I didn't know how to get help."" Labour seeks ban on betting ads during events 'A banking app helped me beat my addiction' Eventually, at a point when Ms Field said she was suicidal, they got help from Beacon Counselling, a Stockport-based charity. She said that while it was hard to find information about support for addiction, online gambling adverts featuring celebrities were common on daytime TV. ""It's glamorising it and making it socially acceptable. If advertisers are going to do this, they should tell the whole story, including the dangers and where to get help."" To support her recovery, Ms Field stopped using a smartphone, stopped using debit and credit cards and put a block on gambling sites on the computer. As a BBC investigation highlightedflaws with industry schemes for problem gamblers, Ms Field said that credit card companies should do more to prevent people gambling their way into debt. She said: ""If there's suspect activity on your card they will stop transactions. So they know if you're spending Â£500 a day over six months. Why can't they block your card?"" The Gambling Commission is currently consideringbanning online betting with credit cards. But in the meantime, Ms Field said she will still be paying her debts until 2021. She said: ""It's a hard process. As much as it's negative, it's about taking the consequences of your actions. I spent the money, I should have to pay it back.""

"Millions of tourists visit the Trevi fountain every year A row has broken out between the mayor of Rome and the Roman Catholic Church over what should happen to coins retrieved from the Trevi fountain. Every year nearly â¬1.5m (Â£1.3m) is fished out of the famous landmark. It is traditionally given to a Catholic charity to help the destitute. But now Mayor Virginia Raggi wants the money spent on the city's crumbling infrastructure instead. The Catholic charity Caritas says the loss of income will hit the poor. ""We did not foresee this outcome,"" Caritas director Father Benoni Ambarus told Avvenire, the newspaper of the Italian bishops' conference. ""I still hope it will not be final."" Protest party finds ruling Rome is hard Why do Rome's buses keep catching fire? The newspaper ran a scathing article on the move in its Saturday edition, headlined ""Money taken from the poorest"". City councillors have approved the change and it is due to take place in April. However, many Italians have taken to social media to ask the council to reconsider, the Ansa news agency reported. Ms Raggi took control of Rome in 2016 for the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, which formed a national coalition government last year. Protesters say Mayor Virginia Raggi has not done enough to fix the city's problems Her popularity has fallen for failing to tackle the indebted city's issues. In October, thousands of protesters gathered outside city hall to denounce Ms Raggi for failing to address problems including uncollected rubbish and potholed roads. The Trevi fountain, nearly 300 years old, is visited by millions of tourists every year. The tradition of throwing coins was made famous by Frank Sinatra's Three Coins in the Fountain in the 1954 romantic comedy of the same name. The fountain also featured in the 1960 film La Dolce Vita which saw actress Anita Ekberg wade through its pristine waters in a strapless dress.

"Katie Boulter used her forehand to devastating effect against Makarova Australian Open 2019 Venue:Melbourne ParkDates:14-27 January Coverage:Daily live commentaries on the BBC Sport website, listen to Tennis Breakfast daily from 07:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and watch highlights on BBC TV and online from 19 January. Britain's Katie Boulter reached the Australian Open second round despite forgetting the rules in the tournament's first final-set tie-break. Boulter, 22, thought she had won after reaching seven in the decider against Russian 2015 semi-finalist Ekaterina Makarova and celebrated accordingly. ""I forgot it was first to 10,"" said the British number two, who composed herself to win 6-0 4-6 7-6 (10-6). But fellow Britons Harriet Dart and Heather Watson suffered heavy losses. Dart, 22, fell to a chastening 6-0 6-0 defeat by five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova as they opened the tournament on Rod Laver Arena. Watson, 26, fared little better, losing 6-1 6-2 to Croatian 32nd seed Petra Martic in hot conditions that she said had made her feel light-headed. Boulter will face another tough test in the second round when she plays Belarussian 11th seed Aryna Sabalenka on Wednesday. Fireworks, fist-pumps and proof Murray has a Hollywood finish left in him Murray loses five-set epic in possible farewell match Edmund out in first round but Evans wins Kerber and Stephens into round two Isner loses but Nadal & Anderson through Boulter came to prominence when she won her first Grand Slam match at Wimbledon last year. Since then she continued to climb up the rankings and broke into the world's top 100. That enabled the 22-year-old from Leicester to gain direct entry into a Grand Slam main draw for the first time in Melbourne - and she demonstrated her talent against 30-year-old Makarova. ""Being here on ranking gives me confidence,"" Boulter said. She hit 53 winners - compared to just 16 from the other side of the net - in a powerful display which showcased her ferocious forehand. The Briton, who is ranked 97th, needed just 26 minutes to take the first set as Makarova looked a shadow of the player who reached the 2014 US Open semi-finals and the last four in Melbourne four months later. Makarova - now ranked 60th in the world - recovered to edge a tight second set, clinching it with a break to love as Boulter's service game disintegrated. But Boulter possessed a steely determination and used that to dig deep on several occasions in the final set. The pair traded breaks to stay level midway through the set, before Boulter missed four break points in a marathon game which Makarova eventually held for 4-3. Boulter saved two herself in the following game, then missed another for a 6-5 lead, but put that behind her to come out firing in the tie-break. With a pro-British crowd behind her, she raced into a 5-0 lead and, after the premature celebrations at 7-4 ahead she regained her focus to win in two hours and 24 minutes. ""I ended up getting the win, I probably would have been devastated had I not,"" Boulter said. ""But I've got to take it light-heartedly now. At least I know the rule now. ""It's very tough to turn around because you've released and think you've won the match. ""Then you have to get back to work and dig deep. I'm pretty proud of myself."" Harriet Dart is ranked 131st in the world Dart won three matches last week to qualify for a place in the main draw of a Grand Slam for the first time, being rewarded with a tie against her ""idol"" Sharapova. But she says she was overcome by nerves on Melbourne Park's 15,000-capacity show court Laver. The Londoner only won 29 points as Sharapova, seeded 30th, needed just one hour and two minutes to reach the second round. ""I think nerves got the best of me but I tried my best and that's all I could do,"" Dart told BBC Sport. ""She hits a huge ball and it comes at you quick. She doesn't give you anything so it was always going to be difficult. ""I'm glad to have these experiences and hopefully get more of big experiences on big stages."" Heather Watson received treatment during her defeat by Martic, saying she felt dizzy and light-headed because of the heat Watson was tearful when she spoke to the media following her third successive first-round defeat at a Grand Slam. The former world number 38, who is now outside the top 100 and was replaced by Boulter as British number two on Monday, did not rule out hiring a sports psychologist to improve the mental side of her game. ""The mental part is really important. I feel everyone here can play tennis but it is about confidence and believing,"" she told BBC Sport. ""I am going to look into anything I can improve on.""
