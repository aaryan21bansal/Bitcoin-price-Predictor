"Ministers have decided not to extend the vaccine passport scheme to cinemas and theatres Scotland's vaccine passport system will not be extended to more venues, Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The first minister had been considering expanding the scheme to cover cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues. But she told MSPs that it would not be proportionate to do so, with case numbers having fallen slightly. People will be allowed to present a negative test rather than proof of two jabs to enter venues that are already covered by the scheme from 6 December. These include nightclubs and large events such as some football matches and concerts, and would bring Scotland's system into line with others in countries like Wales. Ms Sturgeon said taking a lateral flow test before socialising with others over the festive period was a ""vitally important"" step in minimising the spread of the virus. How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? A decision on adding more venues to the scheme had been expected for several weeks, with Ms Sturgeon previously telling MSPs that it could help ""get through what will be a challenging winter without having to reintroduce restrictions on trade"". The government published an evidence paper whichsuggested Scotland faced a choicebetween either extending the vaccine passport system or closing down venues and limiting the number of people who can meet up. However, ministers ultimately decided to do neither after studying the latest data at a meeting of Ms Sturgeon's cabinet on Tuesday morning. The first minister said that while Scotland was still in a precarious position, with ""significant and sustained"" pressure on the NHS, the data was actually ""more positive than we might have expected it to be"". Ms Sturgeon said the spread of the virus had stabilised - with the average number of new cases recorded each day falling by about 3% over the past week. She said that given the ""inevitable impact vaccine certification has on the operation of businesses"", ministers had concluded that extending the scheme would therefore not be proportionate. However, venues which remain covered by the scheme will be allowed to accept a negative lateral flow test instead of proof of vaccination from 6 December - as already happens in many other countries that have introduced vaccine passports. Ms Sturgeon said this had originally been left out of the scheme to help drive up vaccination rates, but that high uptake rates meant testing could now be included as an alternative. Ms Sturgeon urged people to take a lateral flow test before socialising over the festive period The first minister also urged people to get vaccinated before socialising over the festive period, saying: ""You could well be saving your own life, and the lives of your loved ones. ""You will be helping the NHS, and you will be maximising our chances of getting through this winter without the need for further restrictions."" Hospitality bosses had warned that pubs and restaurantscould face an ""avalanche of cancellations""if the certification scheme had been extended over the normally busy Christmas period. Business group CBI Scotland welcomed the decision not to do so, with director Tracy Black saying it ""strikes the right balance between managing the virus and protecting our economy recovery"". She said: ""Many firms would have faced practical challenges and increased costs to implement measures at a time when bumper trading is needed to claw back lost or diminished revenues."" The Federation of Small Businesses described the decision as a ""relief"", saying firms ""will now have a weight off their shoulders"". And the Scottish Retail Consortium said businesses would be ""delighted to see a reprieve from further restrictions"", praising ministers for listening to representations from industry. Nicola Sturgeon tends to signal well in advance what changes to Covid rules might be coming. Over the last two weeks, she and her deputy have made clear that extending the use of vaccine certification to further venues was a serious prospect. A Scottish government evidence paper went as far as to suggest that in order to suppress Covid more, ministers faced a choice between wider use of certification and lockdown-style measures. But today's statement from the first minister has stopped short of taking either option at this stage, taking account of pushback from business and relatively stable case numbers. Instead, they are counting on continued use of existing measures like vaccination and mask wearing and an appeal for greater use of home testing to stop the NHS being overwhelmed. Accepting lateral flow tests as well as proof of vaccination for entry to venues that already require certification aligns the Scottish scheme more closely with Wales and Northern Ireland. Opposition parties - who have questioned whether vaccine passports are effective - said the move amounted to a government u-turn after weeks of speculation about the scheme being expanded. Scottish Conservative health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane said ministers seemed to be ""making it up as they go along"". He said: ""The uncertainty that this government has left hanging over businesses for the last two weeks has been unnecessary and unacceptable."" And Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the government had been ""determined to be seen to be doing something, rather than doing the right thing"". He added: ""We have spent months pursuing the incorrect priority. The government's own evidence shows there is no real evidence of an increase in uptake of the vaccine, and transmission has not fallen. ""I welcome the change to include a negative test from now on but frankly we are in this position because the government couldn't accept it was wrong and move in the right direction."" Ms Sturgeon said Mr Sarwar was ""fundamentally wrong"", saying allowing the use of tests in the system earlier would have ""undermined the central primary objective of the scheme"", of driving up the vaccination rate. Meanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government's evidence paper was ""mince"", and claimed that ministers had caused ""weeks of uncertainty and panic"" for businesses.

"This video can not be played Covid-19: NI Executive ministers meet to discuss coronavirus measures People in Northern Ireland are being urged by Stormont ministers to work from home ""where possible"" in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. Current advicealready states that people should work from home where they can,externalbut ministers said they were ""strengthening"" that message. It follows an executive meeting about how to tackle rising infections. Ministers are also advising the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings. Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so- it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland. In England, since Covid restrictions lifted on 19 July, people have no longer been asked towork at home but businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to staff and customers. Most Covid restrictions have also been lifted in Wales, but employers are still encouraged to let people work from home where possible. In Scotland, most restrictions have been lifted, but working from home where possible is advised. The government wants employers to consider long-term ""hybrid"" working models. ""Hospital admissions are rising and modelling indicates that admissions will increase further in the coming weeks,"" Stormont executive ministers said. What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? ""The clear advice from public health experts is that an intervention is now required."" In a joint statement after Tuesday's meeting, Northern Ireland ministers said Covid-19 had ""once again taken a firm grip across our society"". Ministers said that if more people worked from home it would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they stopped short of ordering employers to facilitate home working, saying they ""recognise that this may present challenges in some work areas"". Instead, ministers said they were asking employees ""to work from home where they can and advise employers to support this where possible"". The health minister has warned that hospitality businesses could be forced to close again over Christmas The statement followed a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), who had recently said he believedanyone working from home last year when the pandemic began should do so again. He has warnedhospitality businesses may have to close over Christmasunless coronavirus transmission rates fall. Following Tuesday's meeting, ministers urged the public to take up the offer of vaccines and booster jabs, saying statistics were stark. ""Unvaccinated adults aged under 50 are almost 11 times more likely to need hospitalisation from Covid-19,"" they said. ""Unvaccinated individuals aged 50 and over are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those who are fully vaccinated."" Speaking after the meeting, First Minister Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was aware that restrictions had been ""acutely"" felt by the hospitality industry. ""We have to protect both lives and livelihood so we are working on the basis of having things open and safe,"" he said. ""No-one wants to be faced with a situation where business have to close,"" he added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said following the guidance was ""our best chance to avoid restrictions down the line"". She appealed to those who can work from home to ""please work from home and for employers to facilitate that"". ""We want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,"" she added. What we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. We know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required. There was no mention of a return to lockdown from ministers today, but they also can't rule anything out. The health minister has already warned that if we don't get a grip on Covid in the next two to three weeks, hospitality could again face closure at Christmas. That, it must be said, remains the worst, worst case scenario and ministers will be reluctant to go there. They'll hope the vaccination programme and ramping up of the booster programme in the next few weeks will help. Ministers are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year. The executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. In addition to promoting the vaccine message, ministers urged the public to ""make safer choices"" when coming in to contact with other people. This advices includes meeting people outdoors in preference to indoors, wearing face coverings and ensuring good ventilation of indoor settings. It is understood the Stormont executive has asked its Covid taskforce to examine issues around enforcement of wearing face masks. The taskforce will also look at the potential of setting up a scores-on-the-doors type system to rate businesses on their compliance with rules and mitigations. Mr Givan tweeted that the executive had ""engaged constructively and agreed a number of measures that will step up our collective efforts against the spread of Covid"". Allow Twitter content?

Earlier, Justice Minister Naomi Long said Stormont ministers may have to reintroduce some Covid-19 restrictions if there are ""no alternatives"". She said the executive was ""looking for ways that we can avoid having to take those drastic measures"" by focusing on measures such as the vaccine booster programme and Covid certification ""to make high-risk venues as safe as possible"". Mrs Long, the Alliance Party leader, said on Monday that ministers were ""not planning for Christmas closures"". On Tuesday, she told BBC News NI that there was a ""critical period"" ahead and ""we still have it within our gift"" to avoid the need for restrictions. However, Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster, which represents the hospitality industry, said the ""rhetoric"" coming from Stormont was unhelpful. ""I appreciate that planning has to go on behind closed doors,"" he said, but added that politicians were making ""half statements"" with no promise of support if tighter restrictions are imposed. Naomi Long said she did not have a crystal ball to predict the need for measures ""Those statements say to our workers: 'You might not have a job before Christmas' and it says to customers: 'Stay away'."" The executive met on Tuesday amid a high number of cases of Covid-19. On Tuesday,four Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Irelandand a further 1,476 new cases. Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI? Tough Covid choices return - but what's the data? Last weekministers voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports being introducedin Northern Ireland. The proof of certification scheme will require people to provide a passport or proof of a negative Covid test result to access venues such as nightclubs, pubs and restaurants. BBC News NI understands that a debate on the Covid passport regulations could happen at Stormont on 6 or 7 December. Robin Swann expressed disappointment that some hospitality businesses had not acted responsibly since rules were relaxed The measure is due to take effect from 29 November. But it will not be enforced until 13 December, as a two-week grace period will take place to allow time for businesses and customers to adjust to the change. The DUP - which voted against the plan coming into place - had asked for the assembly to be allowed to debate the regulations. In his paper to executive ministers last Thursday, Mr Swann then recommended allowing a debate in the assembly on the issue. Orla Smyth, who owns a cafe in Belfast, told BBC News NI that speculation about future measures was not ""helpful for public confidence in using services"". She explained it also made it difficult for ""business owners being able to function"". On Tuesday, Mrs Long said she did not have a ""crystal ball"" about how the coming weeks will unfold, but said she believed ""people have become slightly complacent because of the vaccine"". When asked about the number of people who do not wear mandatory face coverings in retail settings, she said it was not the ""primary responsibility"" of the police to enforce this. Rather, she added it was one of a number of agencies who have a role to play. What are Northern Ireland's rules on Covid-19?

"Mask wearing is now guidance rather than law The health minister has revoked Northern Ireland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions, so rules that were formerly legally binding, such as wearing face coverings in enclosed public spaces, are now merely guidance. This means that while people are encouraged to follow restrictions, they will not face any punishment for not doing so. However, individual businesses are still able to ask customers to follow certain rules. Issues that were previously covered by guidance - such as the advice to work from home where possible - have not changed either, because the changes only affect legal restrictions. People are still being strongly encouraged to wear face masks in enclosed public spaces, such as shops, restaurants, cafes, bars and on public transport. In post-primary schools it was always guidance - rather than a legal requirement - for pupils to wear face coverings. This has not changed. Hospitality and entertainment venues will still be strongly encouraged to use so-called Covid passports, and the certificates will still be available for anyone who needs them to travel abroad. Social distancing is also still encouraged as well as meeting outdoors or in well-ventilated places were possible. The requirement for offices to take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing had already been removed, but soon risk assessments will no longer be required. People are still advised to work from home where possible but Health Minister Robin Swann has made it clear he wants the guidance to be urgently reviewed. He said he would work with ministerial colleagues on the issue. There have not been any changes to the rules on self-isolation. The Department of Health clarified on Tuesday evening that - contrary to England - the self-isolation rules in Northern Ireland were never enshrined in legislation. Instead, they were classified as ""very strong guidance"". Anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 should self-isolate for 10 days from the date their symptoms start or the date they took a test, whichever is sooner. They can leave isolation from day six if they have two consecutive lateral flow tests taken 24 hours apart, with the first taken no earlier than day five, and provided they do not have a high temperature. The testing and contact-tracing system will also remain in place. People are no longer required to social distance outdoors in Northern Ireland Travel rules remain in place, although there are currently no countries on the red list for international travel. If you are fully vaccinated and travelling to Northern Ireland from a country outside the Common Travel Area, you do not have to take a pre or post-departure test or self-isolate on arrival. However you must complete a UK passenger locator form in the 48 hours before you arrive and be able to prove your vaccination status. If you are not fully vaccinated you must complete a UK passenger locator form in the 48 hours before you arrive and be able to prove your vaccination status. You must also book and pay for a pre-departure PCR or LFD test to be taken in the two days before you travel to Northern Ireland and book and pay for a PCR test to be taken on or before day two following arrival. Foreign countries all have their own rules which you must follow if you are travelling to them. Dentistry has been severely disrupted by the pandemic and a large backlog of patients seeking routine appointments has built up since the first lockdown in March 2020. Dentistry was not specifically mentioned with the lifting of Covid restrictions, so dentists are still working underoperational guidelines issued by the Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) which were last updated in December 2021,external. Currently, patients are asked about their Covid status before they attend appointments and those who have no symptoms of Covid or other respiratory infection can be treated under standard infection control measures that were in place before the pandemic began. But patients who test positive or who report Covid symptoms can only receive dental treatment if it is considered urgent and they should be segregated from other visitors to the surgery. A spokeswoman from the British Dental Association told BBC News NI that all enhanced measures to keep patients and staff safe have radically reduced capacity across the service and the current backlog means that routine appointments ""are still a long way off"". Translink said it will now encourage passengers to continue to wear face coverings in its vehicles and buildings A Translink spokesperson said the public service transport firm would ""continue to follow public health guidance"" regarding face coverings. ""To help keep everyone safe and in line with the latest guidance, we are encouraging our passengers to wear a face covering, if they can, in stations and on-board buses and trains,"" they added. There has been a mixed response on mask wearing guidelines from supermarkets and entertainment venues. Asda said wearing a face covering would now be ""a personal choice"". Sainsburys is continuing to ask people to wear them in its stores in Great Britain, but in Northern Ireland, the supermarket giant said it was reviewing what Stormont's health minister has said and will keep customers informed. Belfast's Grand Opera House has confirmed that it will continue to encourage people to wear face coverings, unless they are exempt or are eating and drinking. However, the Movie House Cinema chain said people could now make their own decisions on wearing face coverings.  It will also be removing guidance signs from its cinemas.

"Northern Ireland's infection rate has been climbing over the past week or so The Department of Health says there have been 11,502 positive cases in the previous seven days In total, there have been 2,847 coronavirus-linked deaths in Northern Ireland 390 people with Covid-19 are being in hospital, 33 are in intensive care Judith Cummings, Ali Gordon and Emily McGarvey As Stormont strengthens its work from home message in a bit to curb the spread of Covid-19, ministers also advised the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings.

""Our objective is to keep everywhere open and safe,"" said Michelle O'Neill. ""This is our best chance - working with us, working together."" Paul Givan added: ""The executive very much want to keep businesses open through the Christmas period because we absolutely recognise the hardship that people faced over the last 18 months. ""We can all pay our part to ensure that that can happen, by taking personal responsibility... so we can ensure we get through the next number of months."" The executive has met on a number of occasions in the past week to discuss rising Covid-19 transmission, Paul Givan says. The first minister says the meetings have been respectful, ""even when there has been some disagreement, no one has got angry"". ""We don't have the luxury of being able to get angry,"" he adds. He says ministers ""need to be calm, we need provide that steady leadership and obviously very determined to take measures that we believe will get the widest possible consensus and support from the community"". ""That's why today we're standing her collectively, we're putting out the message jointly, appealing to everyone to play their part.""

Paul Givan says the executive has agreed to take the issue of Covid-19 certifications to take into the assembly. This means there will be a vote before they come into effect. ""My position on that and that of my party has not changed,"" the first minister adds. Last weekthe DUP said the Covid-19 passport plan is ministers serving a ""distraction dish""that will not relieve the pressures on hospitals. ""There are differences at times in what the best approach is, both in the political institutions and right across the societies. ""What I'm appealing for is individually we can all make decisions that will make a cumulative effort. You may not support a mandatory passport, but you can support being vaccinated and getting your booster jab. You can practise good hand hygiene, you can try to limit those contacts in indoor settings. ""All of us can take individual actions."" Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent What we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. We know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required.

Ministers are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year. The executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. The chief executive of Retail NI said the decision to strengthen work-from-home guidance would have a ""significant knock-on effect on our local high streets and independent retailers who rely on footfall from office workers"" âThe Christmas period is
traditionally one of the busiest periods for many businesses, especially
smaller retailers who are the lifeblood of our towns and cities,"" said Glyn Roberts. ""If the work-from-home guidance continues, the inevitable loss in trade for
our high street retailers will be damaging. ""It is imperative that
the Executive works alongside the retail sector and implements a support
package to local traders affected by todayâs decision as a matter of urgency."" Asked whether the health service is fit for purpose, Robin Swann
said the challenges weâve seen in our health service âarenât solely caused by Covid,
they were there before Covid.â The health minister said the New Decade New Approach deal promised 300 nursing
places bringing ""our nursing trainees to 1,325 per year and nurses are going
through those processes now"". âThe NHS has always been challenged at this time of year, but especially
due to the pressures of Covid,â he said. He said there is a long term determination by ministers to âhave
a health service that delivers.â The executive is ""acutely aware"" of the impact the pandemic has had on businesses, in particular the hospitality industry, according to Paul Givan. The first minister says ""we have to protect both lives and livelihoods"". ""We're working on the basis of having things open and safe,"" he says. ""We're not working on the basis of wanting to close things down. ""I want our hospitality to be open right through the Christmas period."" He says that by adhering to Covid-19 safety measures, the public can work to keep hospitality open ""because nobody wants to have a position where businesses are faced with closure"". He adds that ""there isn't the furlough scheme or the hundreds of millions coming from London"" in terms of financial support. ""I don't think we're in a space where we can be looking at closures."" Ms O'Neill said sheâs asking people to redouble efforts
to prevent further interventions and ânone of us want to be in that positionâ. âThereâs a certain sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu of where we are today,â
she said. The deputy first minister said the rollout of the vaccination means we are in a
very different place to where we were this time last year. âThe predictions and the modelling tells us we could be in a
very difficult position by mid December if we donât reinforce the messages,â
she said. âWe set out our winter plan that we had tools if we needed
them and whenever health advice came forwards and said ânowâs the time we need
themâ we responded.â Health Minister Robin Swann said the measures would help keep society open and safe. ""We know what we need to do, we know what has worked in the past, but we also know in comparison to this time last year we also have the benefit of the vaccination and booster programme,"" he added.  The Department of Health has recorded 1,476 new cases of Covid-19. There have been four coronavirus-related deaths reported in the past 24 hours. Allow Twitter content?

As well as urging people to take up the vaccine and work from home where possible, the executive is also asking people to: Paul Givan says that, at the start of September, there were 135 Covid-19 outbreaks in nursing homes across Northern Ireland but, as of yesterday, there are 35. Mr Givan adds that there has been ""a very significant deduction"" in the number of people aged over 75 being admitted to hospital too. ""The evidence shows that being vaccinated and getting your booster is helping to reduce the chance of you being seriously ill and requiring hospitalisation."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says it is a moment to
âreset and refocus on where we areâ. âThese are uncertain times, but now is the time for action if
we want to achieve best possible outcome right now,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said this is âour best chance to avoid restrictions down
the lineâ and thatâs why weâre asking people to comply with certain measures. She appealed to those who can work from home to âplease work from
home and for employers to facilitate thatâ. âWe want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year
and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,"" she added. First Minister Paul Givan opens by saying that executive ministers are ""all very much united in asking the public to play its part, along with us as politicians, and that we can take every effort to try to minimise the transmission rate of the coronavirus"". He encourages people to meet outdoors, keep rooms ventilated and work from home, where possible. The DUP minister also urges the public to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and get booster jabs when offered. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has again reminded the travelling
public of the importance of wearing face coverings on public transport
including buses, trains and the Strangford Ferry. ""We all must remain vigilant and continue to play our part in preventing the spread of
Covid-19,"" she said. ""This includes
adhering to the Face Covering Regulations by wearing a face covering and

"Jennifer and Stephen Chapple were found seriously injured and died at their home in Norton Fitzwarren, Somerset A couple were killed in their home as their two children were asleep upstairs, police have said. Jennifer and Stephen Chapple were found seriously injured at the house in Dragon Rise, Norton Fitzwarren, Somerset, on Sunday. They died at the scene. Their children, aged five and six, are being looked after by family members. Two men, aged 34 and 67, were arrested on suspicion of murder. The older man has been released under investigation. Magistrates granted an extension to the custody time limit in relation to the younger man. Floral tributes have been left at the scene A post-mortem examination confirmed Mrs Chapple died from multiple stab wounds. Investigations into Mr Chapple's cause of death are ongoing. Det Insp Neil Meade, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: ""What happened to Stephen and Jennifer is utterly heart-breaking and I can't begin to imagine the impact their deaths will have on their two children. ""This is a tragic incident which has shocked the community."" Police have been searching the drains in Dragon Rise Officers were called to the property in the village near Taunton at about 21:45 GMT. Cordons remain at two properties on the housing estate as officers continue to examine them. Tributes have poured in to the couple since news of their deaths emerged. Mr Chapple, 36, taught computing at the nearby West Somerset College. Head teacher Gregg Mockridge said he will be ""sadly missed"". ""Steve was a fantastic colleague at West Somerset College, a brilliant teacher that cared deeply about the students in his care,"" he said. Mrs Chapple, 33, worked in the coffee shop at a garden centre in the village, where staff said they were ""devastated"" at the loss of their ""much-loved friend"". The community has been shocked by double murder Taunton MP Rebecca Pow said it was ""absolutely tragic and shocking"" to hear the news. She said: ""It's a very close knit community so it is really devastating news. I'm sure it would have shaken them to their foundations."" Avon and Somerset Police would not comment on social media reports that there had been an ongoing dispute about parking on the estate. But due to prior contact with the couple, the force has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"The second homes issue has sparked campaigns in some parts of Wales New powers to limit the creation of second homes and holiday lets could be given to councils in Wales next year. Homeowners might need local authority permission to convert properties, under proposals from the Welsh government. Ministers launched a consultation on changing the planning laws following concern about the effects of the number of second homes. Other ways of helping people on to the property ladder will be trialled in part of Gwynedd, starting in January. Dwyfor, which covers the Llyn Peninsula and the area west of Porthmadog, has been chosen as a test area and Â£1m will be available to buy and refurbish empty homes in the area. Two officials will be appointed to consult people in the areas on what can be done to help the housing market. What's Wales' problem with second homes? The village with more holiday homes than residents Second home owners 'discriminated against' Hundreds gather to protest second homes 'crisis' A report last year found more than 10% of homes in Gwynedd could be considered holiday homes. There has long been concern that second homes price people out of the Welsh language's heartlands in north and west Wales. Officials say they need more evidence about the problem and how to respond. But one second home owner warned that with so many second home owners being from England, Wales' housing policy was heading in a direction ""virtually bordering on racism"". Aberdaron, on the Llyn Peninsula, is one of the villages in the test area The consultation on changing planning rules will last three months and it could come into effect in the summer, officials say. It could mean planning permission is needed to convert a home to being a second home or short-term holiday let in places where councils think ""they are causing significant difficulties"". Climate Change Minister Julie James said: ""We want young people to have a realistic prospect of buying or renting affordable homes in the places they have grown up so they can live and work in their local communities. ""High numbers of second and holiday homes in one area can threaten the Welsh language in its heartlands and affect the sustainability of some rural areas."" Julie James told the Senedd ""there are no quick fixes"" to the problems In a dealannounced on Monday, Labour and Plaid Cymru promised ""immediate and radical action to address the proliferation of second homes"". Another consultation into using the tax system to control the second homes market closed last week and the Welsh government is sifting through the responses before ministers decide what to do. It could result in higher council taxes on second homes, or new restrictions on registering homes as businesses. Jonathan Martin, who shares his time between his main home in England and a second home on the Llyn Peninsular, said the way Wales is heading on the homes issue is ""virtually bordering on racism"". ""The council tax has already doubled on my property in Gwynedd council and my information is that they would like that to go up to 300%,"" he said. Jonathan Martin: ""Eighty-five per cent of second home owners are English - you can't ignore that"" ""What they want to do is to reduce second homes, not just contain what's going on - they want drastic measures which will probably be to do with taxation. ""You can't say this is fair, cannot.. if you're reasonable person. ""It's virtually bordering on racism - this is where this policy is bordering now. Eighty-five per cent of second home owners are English - you can't ignore that. ""Many members of our group are calling it racist. I'm not calling it racist and I don't think it is that yet, but it is so near and prejudicial. They can't see it and I really regret having to say that."" Tomos Coles says it is very hard to get on the housing ladder in Gwynedd People in Pwllheli said they were concerned about second homes, but some were sceptical about whether this latest initiative would help. Tomos Coles said: ""I don't think this is going to make much of a difference, to be honest. ""It's happened in the past and nothing has solved the issue so I don't see how they're going to solve the issue. ""It's very difficult here, there aren't many good paying jobs around here, so it's hard to get on to the ladder here especially when people already have another house."" Carolyn Green says people come to the area from far afield and buy ""what locals couldn't"" Carolyn Green said house price had been an issue for decades. ""I've lived here for 40 years and I don't know how we can change because the wages aren't high enough - we haven't got industry and people aren't earning enough to pay big mortgages. ""But last year Covid came and if your house was for sale - it was gone."" Rachael Clear says Rhosneigr feels like ""a home from home"", but admits being conflicted on the issue Rachael Clear, 26, from Sale in Greater Manchester, holidays in Rhosneigr, Anglesey, every year. It is not part of the test area, but experiences the same housing issues as Gwynedd. Her family rents holiday homes in the village every summer, used to own a caravan there and her mum and dad are thinking of buying one again. ""Rhosneigr for us is a beautiful place and the reason why we go is because it's so beautiful,"" she said. ""We know people there because we go so often but they're all locals there and it just seems so unfair that in most places like that you can't afford to live there. ""I think people find somewhere like that, people from England or from wherever, and they find it and they think it's beautiful and then they kind of plague it in some ways. ""I kind of feel guilty but the reason why we go every year is because it's kind of tradition from when my grandma used to go when she was younger."" Rhosneigr, on Anglesey's western shore, is not part of the trial, but second homes are an issue on the island Second home owners 'discriminated against' Hundreds gather to protest second homes 'crisis' Pilot planned to tackle second homes 'crisis' Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Watch: The BBC met a trader who says he can get at least 100 canisters of highly polluting HFCs A BBC investigation has uncovered a black market in highly polluting greenhouse gases being smuggled into the UK from Eastern Europe. The gases - hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) - are advertised and sold illegally via social media and the BBC found a trader suggesting smuggling them on coaches. HFCs are widely used in fridges, air conditioning and aerosol sprays. The EU and UK are limiting their use and want to eventually phase them out in favour of cleaner alternatives. But older machinery still runs on the most polluting HFCs - which has led to a black market worth millions. UK law states,externalonly registered companies can import, sell or use HFCs; and buyers must show an F-Gas (fluorinated gas) certificate, otherwise no sale would be allowed. Greenhouse gas build-up hit new high in 2020 The environmental disasters we've almost fixed CFC ban reduced global warming, say scientists The BBC's investigation began at the Romania-Ukraine border, where HFCs made in China have been smuggled through in the boots of cars or in lorries. We found scores of online adverts posted by local traders offering the gases for sale and met one trader, called ""George"", who said he could get large quantities of HFCs. After directing us to a quiet country road near the border crossing, he opened the boot of his car to reveal two canisters containing HFCs. He offered them for roughly Â£100 each. They sell on the UK's illicit market for up to Â£240. This video can not be played Watch: HFCs being sold illegally by a trader in North London To get the gases into the UK, he suggested smuggling them in the luggage compartments of passenger coaches that leave from the local bus station. He said he previously sent 70 or 80 at a time to Germany using this method - it was just a question of finding the right driver and paying them. The BBC took the bottles it bought to a legitimate supplier who emptied them and made the gases safe Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were developed as alternatives to ozone-depleting chemicals, which were banned under a global 1987 agreement known as the Montreal Protocol. The deal banned the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were gradually replaced by HFCs. HFCs are man-made, colourless and odourless. They are mainly used in air conditioning, industrial chillers and fridges and can also be found in some aerosol propellants and fire protection fluids. But they are powerful greenhouse gases, with some HFC blends thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. Scientists previously discovered HFCscontribute to global warming by trapping heat radiating off the Earth. The UK aims to reduce the use of HFCs by 69% by 2024. Fin Walravens of the Environmental Investigation Agency warned of the ""huge impact"" HFCs had on global warming Fin Walravens, a senior campaigner for the Environmental Investigation Agency, which investigates and campaigns against environmental crime, said the illegal HFCs trade was one most people knew nothing about - but the ""huge profits"" on offer made it ""very attractive"" to criminals. Bottles made and filled with the gases for under Â£30 in China can sell in the UK for more than Â£200. Ms Walravens urged customs and enforcement agencies to recognise that while HFCs might be invisible gases, they had ""a huge impact on global warming"". Mihai Stoica, executive director of Romanian environmental campaign group 2Celsius, called for the authorities to work together to urgently stop the trade. ""I think this should have happened yesterday, we need to do as much as we can as quickly as possible."" Despite the efforts of the authorities, the illegal HFC bottles are distributed across the EU and into the UK. The BBC found them openly advertised for sale on Facebook marketplace across the country. We contacted one seller in North London. He was not registered to handle the gases and offered them for sale in disposable canisters - which have been outlawed since 2006. The illegal HFCs trade was estimated to make up between 20% and 30% of the whole European market, according toa July report by the EIA,external. Rob Parker, European operations director for established supplier A-Gas, said the illegal HFCs trade was sometimes viewed as a ""victimless crime because it looks like nobody gets hurt"". ""But the profits from this will almost certainly be going back into organised crime where they'll be used for much darker activities,"" he added. ""Ultimately, more global warming can take place because the regulation hasn't been upheld."" A spokeswoman for the UK's Environment Agency (EA) said: ""We are firmly committed to ensuring that businesses comply with regulations to reduce emissions from HFCs, and will take strict enforcement action where necessary."" In September, the EA fined a company more than Â£1m for breaching F-gas regulations - exceeding the quotas of what it was allowed to put on the market. It was only the second time the EA had ever imposed fines on a UK company for breaking the regulations.

"Olivia Rodrigo is the biggest breakthrough artist of 2021 Olivia Rodrigo has emerged as the front-runner for next year's Grammy Awards, with nominations in all four of the main categories. The 18-year-old is up for best album, best new artist, record of the year and song of the year, for Drivers License. She faces competition from Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X in all of those categories, except best new artist. Abba also received their first ever Grammy nomination in the record of the year category. The Swedish band are recognised for their bittersweet comeback single, I Still Have Faith In You, which was released in September. Taylor Swift also picks up her second consecutive album of the year nomination, for Evermore. She won the award earlier this year for its companion album, Folklore. British musicians are relatively thin on the ground, but Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits is up for song of the year; while Arlo Parks and Glass Animals make the shortlist for best new artist. Coldplay also receive their 36th Grammy nod, for the single Higher Power (best pop group performance) and Paul McCartney is recognised for his lockdown album McCartney III (best rock album) and the track Find My Way (best rock song). Jon Batiste, best known as the keyboard player on Stephen Colbert's US chat show, received the most nominations overall Although relatively unknown in the UK, the jazz keyboardist Jon Batiste leads the nominations, with 11 in total - recognising both his eclectic solo album We Are and the soundtrack to the Pixar film, Soul. A member of a New Orleans musical dynasty, the musician says it is ""hard to put into words"" how he feels following the news. ""It's astonishment, shock, awe, gratefulness."" Justin Bieber, Doja Cat and H.E.R. follow Batiste with eight nominations apiece. Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo are close behind with seven. ""Many dreams have come true for me this year but this one is probably the most meaningful,"" said Rodrigo on learning of her nomination. ""This is unreal!"" added Billie Eilish, who could set a record by winning her third consecutive record of the year award for Happier Than Ever. ""Such amazing news to wake up to. I could scream."" Eilish already has seven Grammy awards Meanwhile, Korean pop sensation BTS miss out on the main categories, receiving a single nomination for pop duo/group performance. The group's monster hit Butter, which spent 10 weeks at number one in the US, is nominated alongside Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga's I Get A Kick Out Of You, Justin Bieber's Lonely, Coldplay's Higher Power and Doja Cat's Kiss Me More. This year's ballot also makes Jay-Z the most-nominated artist in Grammy history. He had been tied with legendary record producer Quincy Jones on 80, but surges ahead with three new nominations, including two in the best rap song category, for collaborations with DMX and Kanye West. The unstoppable rise of Olivia Rodrigo Is Lil Nas X the defining star of his generation? Grammy Awards scrap controversial voting committees The nominees were announced at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles on Tuesday morning, with help from Billie Eilish, H.E.R., Eurovision winners MÃ¥neskin and BTS themselves. With almost 22,000 songs and albums submitted for consideration, the shortlists in the main categories were expanded from eight to 10 nominees for the first time. ""We're living in a time of extraordinary growth in music,"" explained Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason, Jr. ""Over 60,000 songs a day are being released. With so much more music available. There's a lot more excellence to recognise and celebrate."" BTS made history as the first K-Pop act to earn a Grammy nomination last year The Grammys also made sweeping changes to their rules for 2022, afterThe Weeknd was controversially shut out of this year's awards. Organisers subsequently scrapped dozens of anonymous committees that had the ability to overrule votes in 72 of the 86 categories, allowing rank-and-file voters to choose the shortlists instead. Veiled in secrecy, the committees had been accused of vote-rigging, favouritism and racism. Several high profile artists including Drake, Frank Ocean and The Weeknd himself, boycotted recent ceremonies in protest. The change seems to have boosted the chances of artists with broad appeal, such as Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, whose duets album Love For Sale generated six nominations. The star is an only child, who started singing when she was in kindergarten in Temecula, California This time last year, Olivia Rodrigo was best known as the star of the Disney series High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. Then, in January, a few weeks before her 18th birthday, she released the lovelorn piano ballad Drivers License - which became an instant, but organic, global hit. The teenager followed it up with Sour, a debut album inspired by the same heartbreak (allegedly her Disney co-star Joshua Bassett). Showcasing her piercing, precise lyrics and precociously accomplished songwriting, it saw her hailed as ""pop's newest icon,external"" and hit number one on both sides of the Atlantic. In its incessantly hooky choruses, Sour embraced Rodrigo's musical inspirations, from Taylor Swift to Paramore. Both artistslater received writing creditsfor their influence, and therefore share her album of the year nomination. If Rodrigo sweeps all of the ""big four"" categories next January, she'll be only the third person in history to do so, after Christopher Cross and Billie Eilish. But she faces stiff competition from Bruno Mars' impeccably-crafted soul band Silk Sonic and, of course, from Swift herself. The so-called ""big four"" are the Grammys' most prestigious prizes. This year's field looks like this. Album of the year We Are - Jon Batiste Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga - Love For Sale Justin Bieber - Justice Doja Cat - Planet Her Billie Eilish - Happier Than Ever H.E.R. - Back Of My Mind Lil Nas X - Montero Olivia Rodrigo - Sour Taylor Swift - Evermore Donda - Kanye West Song of the year (recognising the songwriters) Bad Habits - Ed Sheeran A Beautiful Noise - Alicia Keys and Brandi Carlile Drivers License - Olivia Rodrigo Fight For You - H.E.R. Happier Than Ever - Billie Eilish Kiss Me More - Doja Cat ft Sza Montero (Call Me By Your Name) - Lil Nas X Peaches - Justin Bieber ft Daniel Caesar & Giveon Leave The Door Open - Silk Sonic Right On Time - Brandi Carlile Anderson .Paak and Bruno Mars have received multiple nominations for their joint project, Silk Sonic Record of the year (recognising the whole recording) I Still Have Faith In You - Abba Freedom - Jon Batiste I Get A Kick Out Of You - Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga Peaches - Justin Bieber ft Daniel Caesar & Giveon Right On Time - Brandi Carlile Kiss Me More - Doja Cat ft Sza Happier Than Ever - Billie Eilish Montero (Call Me By Your Name) - Lil Nas X Drivers License - Olivia Rodrigo Leave The Door Open - Silk Sonic Best new artist Arooj Aftab Jimmie Allen Baby Keem Finneas Glass Animals Japanese Breakfast The Kid Laroi Arlo Parks Olivia Rodrigo Saweetie Read more: The main nominees for the 2022 Grammy Awards Dua Lipa declined to submit her hit single Levitating for an award This year, the Grammys are actually recognising a 13-month time period, from 1 September, 2020, to 30 September, 2021. Even so, that rules out some of pop's biggest new albums, including Adele's 30, Ed Sheeran's = and Abba's Voyage. Also absent is The Weeknd, who is refusing to participate in the Grammys after being snubbed last year. Ariana Grande and Doja Cat also declined to submit their duets with the star for awards, in an apparent show of solidarity. But Kanye West didn't get the memo: His single Hurricane, which features The Weeknd and Lil Baby, made it onto the best melodic rap song shortlist. Taylor Swift also withheld her re-recorded version of Fearless from consideration. The original, released in 2008, is itself an album of the year winner. And Dua Lipa failed to submit her 4x-platinum chart hit Levitating, apparently to avoid recognising featured rapper DaBaby after he madehomophobic comments earlier this year. Country star Morgan Wallen also failed to receive a nomination after beingfilmed using a racial slurearlier this year. The singer, whose album Dangerous is the biggest-selling country record of 2021, was ruled ineligible at the Academy of Country Music Awards, but had been allowed to enter the Grammys, only for voters to pass him over in favour of acts like Chris Stapleton and Sturgill Simpson. Kacey Musgraves has protested at being moved from the country category to the (more competitive) pop field The Grammys are ostensibly decided by the 12,000 voting members of the Recording Academy. But for decades they were overseen by a shadowy group of ""secret committees"", who narrowed down the top 20 finalists in each category to the final shortlist of between five and eight nominees. Those committees were accused of corruption and insider dealing,most notably by ousted Recording Academy CEO Deborah Dugan, who said votes had been overruled and artists promoted onto shortlists without merit (the Academy called her allegations ""categorically false""). It came to a head this time last year, when R&B singer The Weeknd was overlooked in the nominations list, despite his single Blinding Lights having become one of the best-selling songs of the century. ""The Grammys remain corrupt,"" he tweeted in response. ""You owe me, my fans, and the industry transparency."" In April, the Grammys announced the committees would be scrapped; with regular voters getting to decide the shortlists in every category - including the ""big four"": Song of the year, record of the year, best new artist and best album. Even so, the awards have managed to stir up controversy, thanks to aseparategroup of committees: The steering committees, who decide which prizes artists are eligible for. The Nashville screening committee decided that Star-Crossed, the latest record by country superstar (and 2018 album of the year winner) Kacey Musgraves was actually a pop album, not country. Musgraves responded on Instagram with her middle fingers raised. ""You can take the girl out of the country (genre), but you can't take the country out of the girl,"" she wrote. In the end, the album failed to receive a single nomination in the more competitive pop field. The single Camera Roll, however, sneaked into the best country song shortlist.

"Naomi Long says it would be ""inappropriate"" for her department to oversee face covering compliance Businesses need to ""step up"" and help ensure the use of face coverings in their premises, Justice Minister Naomi Long has said. Aa health paperhas suggested Mrs Long's department should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%. The minister said her department did not have enforcement powers, adding personal responsibility was needed. She said there should be a ""co-ordinated effort"" across departments to encourage greater usage. The Alliance Party leader said the public needed to take ""personal responsibility"" for the wearing of face masks and adhering to other public health messaging such as maintaining hand hygiene and doing regular lateral flow tests. ""If we turn this into a just justice issue, then the automatic presumption is that it is for the police to enforce and it isn't that simple,"" the minister told BBC 's Evening Extra programme. ""We all have to take personal responsibility. ""Businesses need to step up too and say we will not grant admission to our premises, whether it's a retail environment or whether it's a cafe or restaurant, and say we will not grant admission unless you wear a mask and do the things we're asking you to do. ""Then if customers are difficult or abusive, that's the time the police can come in and enforce, but we cant reasonably expect the police to be in every shop, in every coffee shop, in every restaurant and in every setting."" Since summer 2020,customers have been required to wear face masks in shops, on public transport and in a number of indoor settings- unless they are exempt. Health Minister Robin Swann circulated a document to executive ministers last week with a range of proposals aimed at reducing transmission of the virus. In it, he suggested that Mrs Long should ""take the lead in pursuing a minimum of 80% adherence to face coverings requirements, to gather evidence of this for the executive and to report of the number of fixed penalty notices issued"". Health officials say they are worried about a drop in compliance with face covering rules Mrs Long said she did not ""have a team of enforcers to send out even if I had the authority to do so, so it's not that simple"". ""There are a number of bodies that have an enforcement role, for example, the PSNI has a role, local councils have a role, the Health and Safety Executive has a role across the board,"" she added. Executive to discuss Swann's Covid-19 proposals Health minister advises more working from home Tougher Covid rules 'could be needed by Christmas' NI ministers vote in favour of Covid passports Stormont Executive ministers met on Monday to discuss the paper from the Department of Health. Mrs Long said it was ""not unusual"" for departments to write a paper and then for other departments to give feedback and the paper be amended. She said the issue had become a ""storm in a teacup"". ""The difficulty then comes when that paper is leaked and it looks as though there is a row between the ministers,"" she said. ""The ministers are all very much agreed that we need to see a step up in terms of personal levels of responsibility that people take."" Robin Swann issued a paper to executive ministers last week warning more ""severe"" restrictions could be required before Christmas Last week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, thenmore ""severe"" restrictions could be required before Christmas. However, Mrs Long said the executive's focus at the minute is ""not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open"". In a written response to the health minister's paper, the justice minister said she was ""at a loss to understand"" why Mr Swann suggested she take on responsibility for the matter. In the letter to Mr Swann, seen by BBC News NI, she said a number of agencies were involved in overseeing compliance to Covid-19 restrictions including councils and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). ""The PSNI will also, rightly, only enforce where necessary,"" she added. Mrs Long warned that the executive had to be aware of the ""wider impact"" of expecting the PSNI to adjust its approach to enforcement. ""We have seen public confidence in policing being adversely affected whenever the public believe the PSNI are taking a disproportionate approach."" Where are masks still compulsory in the UK? She said the police and other enforcement agencies were there to be called on as a ""final measure"", as the duty remained with businesses to encourage compliance. She said: ""The idea that compliance can be solely or even primarily an issue for justice is fundamentally flawed, as recognised by previous decisions of the executive."" Mrs Long said she also believed a ""key problem"" in improving compliance was the lack of consistent messaging across the executive. She suggested that ministers needed to agree several ""key messages"" on public health advice at Monday's executive meeting and promote them ""relentlessly"". Mark Lindsay, chairman of the Police Federation for Northern Ireland, told BBC Radio Foyle that compliance can not solely be the responsibility of the PSNI. ""Police do have a role to play. It should not be misconstrued that police do not want to have anything to do with this, but it's about where we sit in the chain,"" he said. He said funding a warden scheme could be ""a more effective way... than expecting police to step away from more urgent and risky situations to come and deal with this"". Meanwhile, Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, said businesses do not have the power to make people wear face coverings. He told BBC's Radio Ulster's Nolan show: ""It is not our responsibility to police [it]. ""Retailers and their staff do not have the power of sanction, they do not have the power to legally enforce what they have been doing and they have spent millions and millions on making sure their shops are safe, their staff are trained, their staff are safe, encouraging and reminding customers of their responsibility. ""If there is going to be enforcement, it is a matter for the police."" Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts says enforcement of face coverings will be a matter for police On Thursday, Mr Swann advisedanyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year should do so again now. His document also suggested introducing a ""scores on the doors"" Covid compliance rating for businesses. Decisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must be agreed by the executive first. Health officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus. Stormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade. They have already agreed to put in placeproof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December.

""This is a tragic incident which has shocked the community."" Police have been searching the drains in Dragon Rise Officers were called to the property in the village near Taunton at about 21:45 GMT. Cordons remain at two properties on the housing estate as officers continue to examine them. Tributes have poured in to the couple since news of their deaths emerged.

"Northern Ireland's infection rate has been climbing over the past week or so The Department of Health says there have been 11,502 positive cases in the previous seven days In total, there have been 2,847 coronavirus-linked deaths in Northern Ireland 390 people with Covid-19 are being in hospital, 33 are in intensive care Judith Cummings, Ali Gordon and Emily McGarvey As Stormont strengthens its work from home message in a bit to curb the spread of Covid-19, ministers also advised the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings. The first and deputy first minister, along with the health minister, spoke on Tuesday afternoon. You can read more on the announcement and reaction to ithere. This video can not be played Executive 'united in asking public to play its part' The first and deputy first ministers said people needed to take personal responsibility. ""Our objective is to keep everywhere open and safe,"" said Michelle O'Neill. ""This is our best chance - working with us, working together."" Paul Givan added: ""The executive very much want to keep businesses open through the Christmas period because we absolutely recognise the hardship that people faced over the last 18 months. ""We can all pay our part to ensure that that can happen, by taking personal responsibility... so we can ensure we get through the next number of months."" The executive has met on a number of occasions in the past week to discuss rising Covid-19 transmission, Paul Givan says. The first minister says the meetings have been respectful, ""even when there has been some disagreement, no one has got angry"". ""We don't have the luxury of being able to get angry,"" he adds. He says ministers ""need to be calm, we need provide that steady leadership and obviously very determined to take measures that we believe will get the widest possible consensus and support from the community"". ""That's why today we're standing her collectively, we're putting out the message jointly, appealing to everyone to play their part."" Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so- it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland. In England, since Covid restrictions lifted on 19 July, people have no longer been asked towork at home but businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to staff and customers. Most Covid restrictions have also been lifted in Wales, but employers are still encouraged to let people work from home where possible. In Scotland, most restrictions have been lifted, but working from home where possible is advised. The government wants employers to consider long-term ""hybrid"" working models. BBC News NI understands that a debate on the Covid passport
regulations could happen at Stormont on 6 or 7 December. The DUP - which had voted against the plan coming into place - had asked for MLAs to be allowed to debate the regulations. In his paper to executive ministers last Thursday, Health Minister Robin Swann had then recommended allowing a debate in the assembly on the issue. Covid-19 vaccine passports arelikely to be introduced in Northern Ireland on 29 November, according to the Department of Health. Their use will see people providing a passport or proof of a negative Covid test result to access venues like nightclubs, pubs and restaurants. A two-week grace period to allow time for people to adjust to the change will last until 13 December. But where do you get one, how do you use it and when do you use it? Find the answershere. Paul Givan says the executive has agreed to take the issue of Covid-19 certifications to take into the assembly. This means there will be a vote before they come into effect. ""My position on that and that of my party has not changed,"" the first minister adds. Last weekthe DUP said the Covid-19 passport plan is ministers serving a ""distraction dish""that will not relieve the pressures on hospitals. ""There are differences at times in what the best approach is, both in the political institutions and right across the societies. ""What I'm appealing for is individually we can all make decisions that will make a cumulative effort. You may not support a mandatory passport, but you can support being vaccinated and getting your booster jab. You can practise good hand hygiene, you can try to limit those contacts in indoor settings. ""All of us can take individual actions."" Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent What we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. We know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required. There was no mention of a return to lockdown from ministers today, but they also can't rule anything out. The health minister has already warned that if we don't get a grip on Covid in the next two to three weeks, hospitality could again face closure at Christmas. That, it must be said, remains the worst, worst case scenario and ministers will be reluctant to go there. They'll hope the vaccination programme and ramping up of the booster programme in the next few weeks will help. Ministers are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year. The executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. The chief executive of Retail NI said the decision to strengthen work-from-home guidance would have a ""significant knock-on effect on our local high streets and independent retailers who rely on footfall from office workers"" âThe Christmas period is
traditionally one of the busiest periods for many businesses, especially
smaller retailers who are the lifeblood of our towns and cities,"" said Glyn Roberts. ""If the work-from-home guidance continues, the inevitable loss in trade for
our high street retailers will be damaging. ""It is imperative that
the Executive works alongside the retail sector and implements a support
package to local traders affected by todayâs decision as a matter of urgency."" Asked whether the health service is fit for purpose, Robin Swann
said the challenges weâve seen in our health service âarenât solely caused by Covid,
they were there before Covid.â The health minister said the New Decade New Approach deal promised 300 nursing
places bringing ""our nursing trainees to 1,325 per year and nurses are going
through those processes now"". âThe NHS has always been challenged at this time of year, but especially
due to the pressures of Covid,â he said. He said there is a long term determination by ministers to âhave
a health service that delivers.â The executive is ""acutely aware"" of the impact the pandemic has had on businesses, in particular the hospitality industry, according to Paul Givan. The first minister says ""we have to protect both lives and livelihoods"". ""We're working on the basis of having things open and safe,"" he says. ""We're not working on the basis of wanting to close things down. ""I want our hospitality to be open right through the Christmas period."" He says that by adhering to Covid-19 safety measures, the public can work to keep hospitality open ""because nobody wants to have a position where businesses are faced with closure"". He adds that ""there isn't the furlough scheme or the hundreds of millions coming from London"" in terms of financial support. ""I don't think we're in a space where we can be looking at closures."" Ms O'Neill said sheâs asking people to redouble efforts
to prevent further interventions and ânone of us want to be in that positionâ. âThereâs a certain sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu of where we are today,â
she said. The deputy first minister said the rollout of the vaccination means we are in a
very different place to where we were this time last year. âThe predictions and the modelling tells us we could be in a
very difficult position by mid December if we donât reinforce the messages,â
she said. âWe set out our winter plan that we had tools if we needed
them and whenever health advice came forwards and said ânowâs the time we need
themâ we responded.â Health Minister Robin Swann said the measures would help keep society open and safe. ""We know what we need to do, we know what has worked in the past, but we also know in comparison to this time last year we also have the benefit of the vaccination and booster programme,"" he added.  The Department of Health has recorded 1,476 new cases of Covid-19. There have been four coronavirus-related deaths reported in the past 24 hours. Allow Twitter content?

As well as urging people to take up the vaccine and work from home where possible, the executive is also asking people to: Paul Givan says that, at the start of September, there were 135 Covid-19 outbreaks in nursing homes across Northern Ireland but, as of yesterday, there are 35. Mr Givan adds that there has been ""a very significant deduction"" in the number of people aged over 75 being admitted to hospital too. ""The evidence shows that being vaccinated and getting your booster is helping to reduce the chance of you being seriously ill and requiring hospitalisation."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says it is a moment to
âreset and refocus on where we areâ. âThese are uncertain times, but now is the time for action if
we want to achieve best possible outcome right now,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said this is âour best chance to avoid restrictions down
the lineâ and thatâs why weâre asking people to comply with certain measures. She appealed to those who can work from home to âplease work from
home and for employers to facilitate thatâ. âWe want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year
and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,"" she added. First Minister Paul Givan opens by saying that executive ministers are ""all very much united in asking the public to play its part, along with us as politicians, and that we can take every effort to try to minimise the transmission rate of the coronavirus"". He encourages people to meet outdoors, keep rooms ventilated and work from home, where possible. The DUP minister also urges the public to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and get booster jabs when offered. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has again reminded the travelling
public of the importance of wearing face coverings on public transport
including buses, trains and the Strangford Ferry. ""We all must remain vigilant and continue to play our part in preventing the spread of
Covid-19,"" she said. ""This includes
adhering to the Face Covering Regulations by wearing a face covering and
following the advice of public transport operators.""  People in Northern Ireland are being urged by Stormont ministers to work from home ""where possible"" in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. Current advicealready states that people should work from home where they can,externalbut ministers said they were ""strengthening"" that message. If follows an executive meeting about how to tackle rising infections. Ministers are also advising the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings. Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so- it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland.

"Covid infection rates have started rising sharply in parts of Western Europe, prompting the introduction of fresh restrictions and lockdowns. It has triggered fears the UK could follow suit. But there are plenty of reasons to believe Britain will escape the worst of what is being seen on the continent. In fact, the UK may well be in the strongest position of all to weather Covid this winter. To understand why that could be the case, you need to look at the reasons why cases have started to take off in Western Europe. Unlike the UK - and England in particular - many parts of Europe kept major restrictions in place for much longer. Whereas England fully unlocked in mid-July, parts of Europe did not do this until the autumn, and in many places kept tougher restrictions in place even as they did. Part of this was to do with timing. The UK was hit by the more infectious Alpha variant and then Delta sooner, meaning it was in a position to push ahead with unlocking before others. But it was also a conscious choice backed by the government's top scientists, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance. The logic - along with the benefit of ending restrictions that themselves cause harm to health -  was that it was better to have the rebound in infection, the so-called exit wave, in the summer. It was felt the increase in the spread of the virus would be mitigated by the better weather, meaning more time spent outdoors, and would avoid the winter crunch when pressure on the health system increases across the board. The UK has, in effect, already had the wave the rest of Europe is seeing and has managed to avoid being swamped by it. That is mainly because of the amount of immunity built up. A combination of good vaccine rollout, particularly among the older more vulnerable groups who are the ones most at risk of serious illness, and natural immunity from infection means there is likely to be a much smaller pool of vulnerable people for the virus to infect. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been trying to quantify this by looking at what would happen if everyone was suddenly exposed to the virus in one go. Theymodelled this for England,external- although there is nothing to suggest Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be any different - and 18 other European nations. If this hypothetical situation happened, England would have by far the fewest people ending up in hospital - 62 per 100,000 people - because of immunity built up by vaccination and infection. That compares with more than 300 in Germany, largely because of their lower levels of infection to date, and more than 800 in Romania, which has struggled to convince its public to come forward for vaccination. This was the picture at the end of October. If the same analysis was done at the end of November it is likely the situation would be even more favourable for England, says lead researcher Dr Lloyd Chapman. That's because the UK is ploughing ahead faster than other nations with boosters. Again part of this is related to timing. As the UK was quicker off the mark with Covid vaccinations initially, there are greater numbers of people becoming eligible for a booster. ""We are giving those boosters to the very people who are most at risk at perhaps the best time - they will have the best protection in winter."" But Dr Chapman also points out this has come at a price - the high rates of infection have resulted in a greater amount of serious illness and death in recent months than many of our Western European neighbours. And he adds the research should not be seen as a guarantee we will escape the winter without seeing a surge in cases. ""We may be in the strongest position - but we could still see cases double and that would cause problems."" But is that likely? What is perhaps most remarkable about the UK is just how stable infection levels have been. Ever since the sharp rise seen in early summer peaked in mid-July, infection rates have bobbled along, small rises being followed by similar drops. There is no other part of Europe that has seen Covid infections held so stable with very few restrictions in place. Instead, when other nations have seen cases surge restrictions have tended to be reimposed. This is happening now in parts of Western Europe and follows on from what happened in Eastern Europe early in the autumn. Romania, for example, saw a sharp rise in cases in September and October and reacted by introducing a night curfew, sending children home from school and introducing health passes for access to public venues. It is telling that those nations that have had the most problems as winter arrives are the ones identified by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having the greatest pool of vulnerable people. How far this pattern spreads across Europe remains to be seen. But immunity alone does not explain why the UK, and in particular England, has seen such stable rates, says Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the government's infectious disease modelling group. Prof Medley, speaking in a personal capacity, believes it is more complex than that. ""I think we are seeing the public playing an important role."" He says a combination of limiting mixing and frequent use of rapid tests, which are more easy to access here than in many other countries, seems to be doing just enough to keep the virus in check. ""The government has passed the risk management to the public - and we've been able to do that better than other countries."" The big question is whether that will last throughout winter -ScotlandandNorthern Irelandare already talking about the possibility of tightening of restrictions. Prof Medley says it is ""delicately"" balanced, but with every passing week the chances are getting better.

Part of this was to do with timing. The UK was hit by the more infectious Alpha variant and then Delta sooner, meaning it was in a position to push ahead with unlocking before others. But it was also a conscious choice backed by the government's top scientists, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance. The logic - along with the benefit of ending restrictions that themselves cause harm to health -  was that it was better to have the rebound in infection, the so-called exit wave, in the summer. It was felt the increase in the spread of the virus would be mitigated by the better weather, meaning more time spent outdoors, and would avoid the winter crunch when pressure on the health system increases across the board. The UK has, in effect, already had the wave the rest of Europe is seeing and has managed to avoid being swamped by it. That is mainly because of the amount of immunity built up. A combination of good vaccine rollout, particularly among the older more vulnerable groups who are the ones most at risk of serious illness, and natural immunity from infection means there is likely to be a much smaller pool of vulnerable people for the virus to infect. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been trying to quantify this by looking at what would happen if everyone was suddenly exposed to the virus in one go. Theymodelled this for England,external- although there is nothing to suggest Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be any different - and 18 other European nations. If this hypothetical situation happened, England would have by far the fewest people ending up in hospital - 62 per 100,000 people - because of immunity built up by vaccination and infection. That compares with more than 300 in Germany, largely because of their lower levels of infection to date, and more than 800 in Romania, which has struggled to convince its public to come forward for vaccination. This was the picture at the end of October. If the same analysis was done at the end of November it is likely the situation would be even more favourable for England, says lead researcher Dr Lloyd Chapman. That's because the UK is ploughing ahead faster than other nations with boosters. Again part of this is related to timing. As the UK was quicker off the mark with Covid vaccinations initially, there are greater numbers of people becoming eligible for a booster. ""We are giving those boosters to the very people who are most at risk at perhaps the best time - they will have the best protection in winter."" But Dr Chapman also points out this has come at a price - the high rates of infection have resulted in a greater amount of serious illness and death in recent months than many of our Western European neighbours. And he adds the research should not be seen as a guarantee we will escape the winter without seeing a surge in cases. ""We may be in the strongest position - but we could still see cases double and that would cause problems."" But is that likely? What is perhaps most remarkable about the UK is just how stable infection levels have been. Ever since the sharp rise seen in early summer peaked in mid-July, infection rates have bobbled along, small rises being followed by similar drops. There is no other part of Europe that has seen Covid infections held so stable with very few restrictions in place. Instead, when other nations have seen cases surge restrictions have tended to be reimposed. This is happening now in parts of Western Europe and follows on from what happened in Eastern Europe early in the autumn. Romania, for example, saw a sharp rise in cases in September and October and reacted by introducing a night curfew, sending children home from school and introducing health passes for access to public venues. It is telling that those nations that have had the most problems as winter arrives are the ones identified by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having the greatest pool of vulnerable people. How far this pattern spreads across Europe remains to be seen. But immunity alone does not explain why the UK, and in particular England, has seen such stable rates, says Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the government's infectious disease modelling group. Prof Medley, speaking in a personal capacity, believes it is more complex than that. ""I think we are seeing the public playing an important role."" He says a combination of limiting mixing and frequent use of rapid tests, which are more easy to access here than in many other countries, seems to be doing just enough to keep the virus in check. ""The government has passed the risk management to the public - and we've been able to do that better than other countries."" The big question is whether that will last throughout winter -ScotlandandNorthern Irelandare already talking about the possibility of tightening of restrictions. Prof Medley says it is ""delicately"" balanced, but with every passing week the chances are getting better.

FT: Chelsea 4-0 Juventus Mina RzoukiEuropean football expert on BBC Radio 5 live Juventus have been a relatively terrible side - they have made a lot of mistakes in the market. They wanted to change strategies because they thought it was dull under Max Allegri so they changed to Maurizio Sarri and then realised they didn't have the right players for that and changed to Andrea Pirlo which was a complete mess. They went back to Allegri thinking that was the problem but the essence is that they don't possess any of the balance required - it's just a bunch of players that don't fit well together - the only strategy they really had today was to defend and try to counter. Unfortunately that's much easier to do when you're facing a striker but you could see when Allegri played this fixture at home he had a glint in his eye, he believed he could beat this Chelsea side. He didn't have that glint this time, he was a lot more worried. Probably because Romelu Lukaku wasn't there and there wasn't a reference point to defend against but this is not something that Juve can deal with because they don't have any players that are good on the ball. FT: Chelsea 4-0 Juventus Chelsea Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel, speaking to BT Sport:""We wanted to stay patient but at the same time not fall asleep. We wanted to increase the rhythm and intensity.

""I feel very aware that we do the invisible work and when we have to defend we really defend and dig in."" On injuries to Ben Chilwell and N'Golo Kante:""Ben has a sharp pain in the knee. N'Golo twisted his knee a little bit. They will both be examined tomorow. They are very sad things because N'Golo was very good before he went off and Chilly has been in a fantastic moment."" On keeping his squad happy:""The best thing to keep them happy is to win and everyone has to fight for their place. We still have some tough decisions. I feel like they are disappointed [when left out] but they will never let the team down and show it for too long and it doesn't affect their work ethic. We are in a good place. Sometimes you take tough decisions - it's like this in football. The best thing is to win and we want to keep on winning."" FT: Chelsea 4-0 Juventus  Allow Twitter content?

None of the clubs that play tomorrow can equal them. Chelsea have conceded only one goal in this Champions League season, fewest of all clubs. The fewest goals a team conceded in an entire (first) group phase is one goal: set 12 times, including by Chelsea in 2005-06 (goal differential of 7-1). This was Thomas Tuchelâs 50th

I remember coming back and training with the team after being in America. I was blown away by his technical ability. Especially for such a big, strong, athletic lad. His touch is velvet, he makes the right pass, takes the right decisions. And when he gets in front of goal it is like your top, top strikers' level of composure and technique."" FT: Chelsea 4-0 Juventus Karen CarneyFormer England and GB international on BBC Radio 5 Live From the get go the intensity, the press and the desire and hunger to get the result here was clearly visible from Chelsea. It was just about when they were going to be ruthless and punish Juventus - it was probably after about 15 minutes when they turned the screw. Reece James has been phenomenal tonight - he was a class above, defensively, attacking, his goals and his positional sense. Everyone played really well for Chelsea and you have to remember that was against Juventus. FT: Chelsea 4-0 Juventus Chelsea are also now through to the last 16. If they match or better Juve's result in the last round of games, they will win the group. Three late goals in Switzerland, where Atalanta led 2-1 against Young Boys, fell 3-2 behind before salvaging a point. It means Manchester United are not only through to the last 16 - they win Group F. Not a bad start for Michael Carrick. Chelsea 4-0 Juventus BT Sport Former Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole on BT Sport:""It was champagne football. It was a beautiful performance. Unbelievable. Look at the goalscorers and you add your Loftus-Cheeks and Mason Mounts to that, the academy graduates. The last goal summed it up. The confidence of the pass with the outside of the boot from Reece James. Even Timo Werner is getting in on the act."" Chelsea 4-0 Juventus Karen CarneyFormer England and GB international on BBC Radio 5 Live It's a brilliant all around goal from Chelsea. The pass out to Hakim Ziyech is exquisite - he plays it right across the six-yard line which is a nightmare for defenders but a dream for any centre-forward. He puts it into an area and Timo Werner is not going to miss from there. Chelsea 4-0 Juventus A masterclass. Juve's heaviest Champions League defeat, inflicted on them by a wonderful Chelsea. Timo Werner Just pop a cherry on top! Reece James is involved again, beating Moise Kean to the ball on halfway before sending a cross-field pass to Hakim Ziyech. He fires a superb low cross in that Timo Werner can't avoid side-footing in. It's an absolute rout. Chelsea 3-0 Juventus Now Moise Kean sends a shot dribbling wide. Juve are still chipping away, to be fair to them. Chelsea 3-0 Juventus Arthur tries his luck from distance but the effort trickles tamely wide. To say this has not been Juve's night is a huge understatement. Chelsea 3-0 Juventus Chelsea fans are giving it an ole to every pass now. The Blues are utterly outclassing Juventus.

"Most drink responsibly - but is there a problem with a minority drinking to excess? Pitch invaders versus both New Zealand and South Africa; a boy given Â£20 after having beer spilled on him in the Fiji match; a young fan vomited over while watching Australia. This season's four Wales rugby autumn internationals have made headlines for the wrong reasons as much as they have for the games themselves. It has led Cardiff's Principality Stadium to bebranded ""the world's biggest pub""by journalist Peter Jackson. But how serious is the drinking issue in rugby? Liver specialist Dr Dai Samuel said ""the halo of rugby has well and truly slipped this autumn"", while theInstitute of Alcohol Studies,external(IAS) called for an end to the ""cosy relationship"" between alcohol and rugby. ""The normalisation of heavy drinking in relation to sport is at odds with the health benefits of participating in sport,"" said IAS head of research Dr Sadie Boniface. Boy vomited on by drunk fan Pitch invader gets police order Former Wales second row Ian Gough said most fans just wanted a ""social beer"" at games, and will drink responsibly. But he urged a clampdown on the ""loose cannons"" in groups who went ""over the top"". Joey's mother wants people to be more aware of children at rugby matches The latest incident, in Saturday's victory over Australia, sawa six-year-old left ""in floods of tears""after he was vomited on. Joey's mother Sophie Delaney, from Chepstow, Monmouthshire, said the sick was ""all over the back of him, his coat, over me and on the floor"", with the perpetrator too drunk to even acknowledge it. After more than a year of no fans because of Covid, they have returned to the stadium in their droves The Welsh Rugby Union said it ""was sorry to hear about the family's experience"". ""In excess of 275,000 fans have attended the autumn nations series games and the vast majority of fans enjoy themselves in a responsible and considerate way,"" a spokesman said. ""It is policy for our staff to intervene if people are visibly intoxicated - this happens in three main areas: The turnstiles where people can be denied entry, at the point of sale if they try and buy alcohol, and in the stadium bowl."" Reports of alcohol-related issues date back a number of years and in autumn 2017,Supt Mark Cleland of British Transport Police,external, said: ""Always a disappointment to review the post-incident crime and see that yet again rugby fans were worse than football fans in Cardiff this weekend with their post-Wales v New Zealand drunken violent behaviour."" Rules have been in place, such as masks in the stadium concourses and supporters in their seats by a certain time before kick-off In football,alcohol cannot be sold within sight of the ground,external15 minutes before or after the game. ""I wonder why we haven't extended the alcohol ban to all sporting grounds?""asked IAS policy officer,externalHabib Kadiri. ""Perhaps it is because no other sports have attained football's notoriety. But why risk it?"" Dr Samuel, of the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant, said: ""If we think rugby union fans are above football fans then I think you have to have a hard look at the mirror because people don't behave like this in general any more and if you can't go without a pint for 40 minutes there clearly is something wrong."" The Principality Stadium is within a stone's throw of Cardiff pubs Describing the Principality Stadium as ""unique"", he said its city centre location meant fans could go straight from the pub to their seat and start drinking again. ""It's worrying that the whole atmosphere and concept of what an international match means now heavily involves alcohol and very often doesn't involve enjoying a game of rugby,"" he said onBBC Radio Wales. Incidents in Cardiff includea disabled fan being abused during the Wales-New Zealand gamein November 2017. A year later, the WRU introducedan alcohol-free zone, with 4,200 dry seats. Former Ospreys and Newport second row Ian Gough played at the stadium many times during his career Gough, who won 64 caps for Wales, said such provisions were important to segregate ""families from the groups of partying lads"", describing Saturday's incident as ""horrific"". ""I take my children to games and you don't expect or want that to happen,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales. ""I remember as a 15, 16-year-old going to the East Terrace in the old stadium and being weed on and that wasn't a nice experience. ""It's something that does need to be addressed but again it needs to be a balance - if someone is too drunk then they're told they have to leave."" He wants stronger enforcement against those drinking to excess, saying ""a lot of people would be very opposed"" to not being able to enjoy a match day pint. The pitch invader is escorted off the pitch before the Wales versus New Zealand match This season, a mandressed in a New Zealand kitwas able to get on to the turf and join the team's line-up for the anthem. Then, against South Africa, a spectator wastackled by stewards after running on to the pitch, and was later given a community resolution by police. For the Fiji match, a mandescribed how supporters spilled beer,externalall over his son. However, as they were leaving, one of their friends gave the youngster Â£20 as he wanted things ""put right"".

"Online electricals retailer AO World has warned Xbox and Playstation games devices, and iPhones could be in short supply this Christmas. A global shortage of computer chips has hit availability of such items. AO warned that these shortages as well as supply chain problems in the festive trading period would hit its profits. The retailer saw sales soar during lockdown, but that runaway growth has been halted by higher labour and transport costs. AO warned that the key festive trading period would be ""significantly softer"" than anticipated. On Tuesday, the firm posted a half-year pre-tax loss of Â£10m, down from an Â£18m profit in the six months last year. That sent AO's share price crashing by about 25% initially on Tuesday, although it had recovered slightly to stand about 15% lower by late morning. The nationwide lorry driver shortage that has hit many companies remains a problem, AO said. It had recruited about 500 new drivers to help beat labour shortages, but said it was still seeing ""meaningful supply chain challenges"", product shortages and higher costs of transport and freight. Tech retailers warn of low Black Friday stock Ikea to raise prices as supply problems bite Why is there an HGV driver shortage? ""At the start of our financial year in April, we planned for continued revenue growth and built up our cost base accordingly,"" AO said. ""However, since then, growth in the UK has been impacted by the nationwide shortage of delivery drivers and the ongoing disruption in the global supply chain, and the German online market has seen significantly increased competition. ""As we now look to the second half, we continue to see meaningful supply chain challenges with poor availability in certain categories, particularly in our newer products where we have less scale, experience and leverage."" In addition, shipping costs, the cost of materials and consumer price inflation ""remain challenging uncertainties"", the company said. Many companies - from toy, food and clothes retailers to furniture giant Ikea - have warned of labour shortages, higher costs and disruption to supplies. At the weekend,technology retailers warned that they may have insufficient stockto meet Black Friday demand due to delays in the supply chain. AO World, which sells a diverse range of electrical goods, including laptops, washing machines, and mobile phones, said the ""all-important"" festive period would be far tougher than it anticipated just a few weeks ago. It expects underlying profits for the year to March of between Â£10m-Â£20m compared with a previous forecast of between Â£35m-Â£50m issued in October. Profits last year nearly tripled to Â£64m. Richard Hunter, head of markets at online share broker Interactive Investor, called AO's problems a ""white-knuckle ride"". In addition to supply problems and staff shortages in the UK, he pointed to issues overseas. ""The group's foray into the German market is not only in the early stages of establishing the brand, but is also being faced by significantly increased competition,"" he said. The fall in AO's share price, which now stands at about 105p, will prove continuing disappointment for staff,who in 2020 were offered a generous bonus scheme. Employees would share Â£140m if the price hit Â£9.41 by 2025, and Â£240m if it went to Â£12.55. AO's highest closing price is about Â£4.30, reached in January.

"Ministers have decided not to extend the vaccine passport scheme to cinemas and theatres Scotland's vaccine passport system will not be extended to more venues, Nicola Sturgeon has announced. The first minister had been considering expanding the scheme to cover cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues. But she told MSPs that it would not be proportionate to do so, with case numbers having fallen slightly. People will be allowed to present a negative test rather than proof of two jabs to enter venues that are already covered by the scheme from 6 December. These include nightclubs and large events such as some football matches and concerts, and would bring Scotland's system into line with others in countries like Wales. Ms Sturgeon said taking a lateral flow test before socialising with others over the festive period was a ""vitally important"" step in minimising the spread of the virus. How does Scotland's vaccine passport work? Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? A decision on adding more venues to the scheme had been expected for several weeks, with Ms Sturgeon previously telling MSPs that it could help ""get through what will be a challenging winter without having to reintroduce restrictions on trade"". The government published an evidence paper whichsuggested Scotland faced a choicebetween either extending the vaccine passport system or closing down venues and limiting the number of people who can meet up. However, ministers ultimately decided to do neither after studying the latest data at a meeting of Ms Sturgeon's cabinet on Tuesday morning. The first minister said that while Scotland was still in a precarious position, with ""significant and sustained"" pressure on the NHS, the data was actually ""more positive than we might have expected it to be"". Ms Sturgeon said the spread of the virus had stabilised - with the average number of new cases recorded each day falling by about 3% over the past week. She said that given the ""inevitable impact vaccine certification has on the operation of businesses"", ministers had concluded that extending the scheme would therefore not be proportionate. However, venues which remain covered by the scheme will be allowed to accept a negative lateral flow test instead of proof of vaccination from 6 December - as already happens in many other countries that have introduced vaccine passports. Ms Sturgeon said this had originally been left out of the scheme to help drive up vaccination rates, but that high uptake rates meant testing could now be included as an alternative. Ms Sturgeon urged people to take a lateral flow test before socialising over the festive period The first minister also urged people to get vaccinated before socialising over the festive period, saying: ""You could well be saving your own life, and the lives of your loved ones. ""You will be helping the NHS, and you will be maximising our chances of getting through this winter without the need for further restrictions."" Hospitality bosses had warned that pubs and restaurantscould face an ""avalanche of cancellations""if the certification scheme had been extended over the normally busy Christmas period. Business group CBI Scotland welcomed the decision not to do so, with director Tracy Black saying it ""strikes the right balance between managing the virus and protecting our economy recovery"". She said: ""Many firms would have faced practical challenges and increased costs to implement measures at a time when bumper trading is needed to claw back lost or diminished revenues."" The Federation of Small Businesses described the decision as a ""relief"", saying firms ""will now have a weight off their shoulders"". And the Scottish Retail Consortium said businesses would be ""delighted to see a reprieve from further restrictions"", praising ministers for listening to representations from industry. Nicola Sturgeon tends to signal well in advance what changes to Covid rules might be coming. Over the last two weeks, she and her deputy have made clear that extending the use of vaccine certification to further venues was a serious prospect. A Scottish government evidence paper went as far as to suggest that in order to suppress Covid more, ministers faced a choice between wider use of certification and lockdown-style measures. But today's statement from the first minister has stopped short of taking either option at this stage, taking account of pushback from business and relatively stable case numbers. Instead, they are counting on continued use of existing measures like vaccination and mask wearing and an appeal for greater use of home testing to stop the NHS being overwhelmed. Accepting lateral flow tests as well as proof of vaccination for entry to venues that already require certification aligns the Scottish scheme more closely with Wales and Northern Ireland. Opposition parties - who have questioned whether vaccine passports are effective - said the move amounted to a government u-turn after weeks of speculation about the scheme being expanded. Scottish Conservative health spokesman Sandesh Gulhane said ministers seemed to be ""making it up as they go along"". He said: ""The uncertainty that this government has left hanging over businesses for the last two weeks has been unnecessary and unacceptable."" And Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the government had been ""determined to be seen to be doing something, rather than doing the right thing"". He added: ""We have spent months pursuing the incorrect priority. The government's own evidence shows there is no real evidence of an increase in uptake of the vaccine, and transmission has not fallen. ""I welcome the change to include a negative test from now on but frankly we are in this position because the government couldn't accept it was wrong and move in the right direction."" Ms Sturgeon said Mr Sarwar was ""fundamentally wrong"", saying allowing the use of tests in the system earlier would have ""undermined the central primary objective of the scheme"", of driving up the vaccination rate. Meanwhile Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the government's evidence paper was ""mince"", and claimed that ministers had caused ""weeks of uncertainty and panic"" for businesses.

"Paul Green (left) and Cleveland Davidson had their convictions overturned in July The conviction of a fourth member of the so-called Stockwell Six, wrongly jailed for allegedly attempting to rob a corrupt policeman, has been quashed. Texo Johnson, 67, was one of five young black men arrested after leaving Stockwell station on 18 February 1972. Three othershad their convictions overturned in July. Mr Johnson's solicitor Jenny Wiltshire said: ""Texo has lived his entire adult life with this hanging over him and time has not lessened his ordeal."" She added: ""He has said that the pain of what happened still lingers and that it is something he will take to his grave. This didn't need to be the case."" Transport police apologise for racism in the 70s Mr Johnson, who now lives in the US, was not present at the Court of Appeal hearing in the Royal Courts of Justice on Tuesday. Sir Julian Flaux, sitting with Lord Justice Dingemans and Lady Justice Andrews, said it is ""most unfortunate that it has taken nearly 50 years to rectify the injustice suffered"". The men, all aged between 17 and 20 at the time, were accused of trying to rob British Transport Police (BTP) officer Derek Ridgewell, who was in plain clothes. They were travelling on the London Underground from Stockwell station in south London, when Ridgewell claimed they attempted to rob him, before he fought back and arrested them with a team of undercover officers. Men 'framed by corrupt detective' to go to court Final conviction quashed in corrupt detective case Convictions quashed in corrupt detective case Although each of the six pleaded not guilty, five were convicted and sent to jail or borstal, a youth detention centre, despite telling jurors that police officers had lied and subjected them to violence and threats. The sixth member, Everet Mullins, was acquitted because it was shown that his reading ability was not good enough for him to have read and fully understood his signed statement, which was written for him by Ridgewell. Courtney Harriot, Paul Green and Cleveland Davidson, also now in their late 60s, saw their convictions ruled unsafe by the court in July. Paul Green (left) with Cleveland Davidson who branded it a ""total stitch-up"" The Stockwell Six case was the third time Ridgewell's corruption had led to wrongful convictions being overturned by the Court of Appeal. Ridgewell was involved in a number of high-profile and controversial cases in the early 1970s, culminating in the 1973 acquittals of the ""Tottenham Court Road Two"" - two young Jesuits studying at Oxford University. He was then moved into a department investigating mailbag theft, where he joined up with two criminals with whom he split the profits of stolen mailbags. Ridgewell was eventually caught and jailed for seven years, dying of a heart attack in prison in 1982 at the age of 37. In December 2019,three members of the ""Oval Four""- who were arrested at Oval Underground station in 1972 and accused of stealing handbags by Ridgewell's ""mugging squad"" - also had their convictions overturned. The final member was cleared in March 2020 prompting calls for a ""wholesale review"" of all cases linked to Ridgewell. Ms Wiltshire added: ""The British Transport Police knew about Det Sgt Ridgewell's corruption in 1973 but it took until this year for the force to undertake any review of this officer's cases. ""Considering this huge delay - and the potential it created for material to get lost - it is unsurprising that the force's available records have revealed no further mischief to be unravelled. ""I sincerely hope that the police's internal review of Det Sgt Ridgwell's actions was as thorough as it could have been and that there aren't other victims who had to yet to achieve the justice they deserve.""

"This video can not be played Watch: The BBC met a trader who says he can get at least 100 canisters of highly polluting HFCs A BBC investigation has uncovered a black market in highly polluting greenhouse gases being smuggled into the UK from Eastern Europe. The gases - hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) - are advertised and sold illegally via social media and the BBC found a trader suggesting smuggling them on coaches. HFCs are widely used in fridges, air conditioning and aerosol sprays. The EU and UK are limiting their use and want to eventually phase them out in favour of cleaner alternatives. But older machinery still runs on the most polluting HFCs - which has led to a black market worth millions. UK law states,externalonly registered companies can import, sell or use HFCs; and buyers must show an F-Gas (fluorinated gas) certificate, otherwise no sale would be allowed. Greenhouse gas build-up hit new high in 2020 The environmental disasters we've almost fixed CFC ban reduced global warming, say scientists The BBC's investigation began at the Romania-Ukraine border, where HFCs made in China have been smuggled through in the boots of cars or in lorries. We found scores of online adverts posted by local traders offering the gases for sale and met one trader, called ""George"", who said he could get large quantities of HFCs. After directing us to a quiet country road near the border crossing, he opened the boot of his car to reveal two canisters containing HFCs. He offered them for roughly Â£100 each. They sell on the UK's illicit market for up to Â£240. This video can not be played Watch: HFCs being sold illegally by a trader in North London To get the gases into the UK, he suggested smuggling them in the luggage compartments of passenger coaches that leave from the local bus station. He said he previously sent 70 or 80 at a time to Germany using this method - it was just a question of finding the right driver and paying them. The BBC took the bottles it bought to a legitimate supplier who emptied them and made the gases safe Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were developed as alternatives to ozone-depleting chemicals, which were banned under a global 1987 agreement known as the Montreal Protocol. The deal banned the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were gradually replaced by HFCs. HFCs are man-made, colourless and odourless. They are mainly used in air conditioning, industrial chillers and fridges and can also be found in some aerosol propellants and fire protection fluids. But they are powerful greenhouse gases, with some HFC blends thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide. Scientists previously discovered HFCscontribute to global warming by trapping heat radiating off the Earth. The UK aims to reduce the use of HFCs by 69% by 2024. Fin Walravens of the Environmental Investigation Agency warned of the ""huge impact"" HFCs had on global warming Fin Walravens, a senior campaigner for the Environmental Investigation Agency, which investigates and campaigns against environmental crime, said the illegal HFCs trade was one most people knew nothing about - but the ""huge profits"" on offer made it ""very attractive"" to criminals. Bottles made and filled with the gases for under Â£30 in China can sell in the UK for more than Â£200. Ms Walravens urged customs and enforcement agencies to recognise that while HFCs might be invisible gases, they had ""a huge impact on global warming"". Mihai Stoica, executive director of Romanian environmental campaign group 2Celsius, called for the authorities to work together to urgently stop the trade. ""I think this should have happened yesterday, we need to do as much as we can as quickly as possible."" Despite the efforts of the authorities, the illegal HFC bottles are distributed across the EU and into the UK. The BBC found them openly advertised for sale on Facebook marketplace across the country. We contacted one seller in North London. He was not registered to handle the gases and offered them for sale in disposable canisters - which have been outlawed since 2006. The illegal HFCs trade was estimated to make up between 20% and 30% of the whole European market, according toa July report by the EIA,external. Rob Parker, European operations director for established supplier A-Gas, said the illegal HFCs trade was sometimes viewed as a ""victimless crime because it looks like nobody gets hurt"". ""But the profits from this will almost certainly be going back into organised crime where they'll be used for much darker activities,"" he added. ""Ultimately, more global warming can take place because the regulation hasn't been upheld."" A spokeswoman for the UK's Environment Agency (EA) said: ""We are firmly committed to ensuring that businesses comply with regulations to reduce emissions from HFCs, and will take strict enforcement action where necessary."" In September, the EA fined a company more than Â£1m for breaching F-gas regulations - exceeding the quotas of what it was allowed to put on the market. It was only the second time the EA had ever imposed fines on a UK company for breaking the regulations.

"Scotland is facing a choice between extending the vaccine passport scheme and lockdown-style restrictions, the Scottish government has said. A final decision on whetherto extend certification will be made on Tuesday. But a new evidence paper claims that to ""suppress the virus further"" there is a choice between limiting social contacts or requiring passports at more hospitality venues. Any extension to the scheme would start on 6 December. Covid case numbers are currently much lower than during the most recent peak in August, but they have been slowly climbing again in recent weeks. The Scottish government is worried about the impact this could have on the NHS over winter. Cinemas, theatres and cafes could be among the venues affected by tougher rules which they claimwould have a ""devastating impact"" on business. Vaccine passports: How does Scotland's scheme work? Cancellation avalanche fears over vaccine passports Scotland can expect normal Christmas, says Swinney TheScottish government evidence paper on vaccine certification,externalstates: ""To suppress the virus further we are now faced with a choice. ""This is to limit social contacts and the risk of infection by limiting social contacts by closing venues, limiting group sizes and advising people not to meet each other. ""Alternatively we can enable people to meet up in a lower risk way by using certification to reduce the risk that an infectious person will be present in a higher risk setting."" The Scottish government says there have been more than 1.5m downloads of the NHS Covid status app so far The Scottish government is also considering whether a negative lateral flow Covid test result could be provided instead of proof of vaccination, as happens in most other countries that have introduced vaccine passports. The paper says this ""has advantages"" but warns these types of tests ""have limitations regarding their sensitivity"". In addition, the paper states a ""significant number of businesses and organisations"" would be affected by any extension of the scheme, primarily through extra costs. Employing and training more staff and supplying hardware to scan the passports were highlighted as potential cost factors, alongside a loss in revenue from cancelled tickets to events and customers choosing to go somewhere a passport is not required. But the report claims the costs incurred would be better than the alternative - which could see the return of restrictions or even closure because of a Covid-induced lockdown. The paper also suggests that research evidence ""indicates including a wider range of settings may increase the usefulness of certification as a measure to reduce infection"". It adds: ""Wider international evidence suggests that expanding the settings included in any certification scheme may encourage older individuals who are not yet vaccinated to take up the vaccine. ""While certification is unlikely to convince the most vaccine hesitant to be vaccinated, it may convince those who are currently indifferent."" Introduced in October, the current passport scheme only applies to nightclubs and major events such as concerts and football matches. Cinemas could be among the venues affected by any extension of the vaccine passport scheme Scottish ministers said at the time of the scheme's launch that its purpose was to drive up vaccination rates among younger people. The Scottish government paper states the current scheme has ""likely contributed to a small rise in vaccinations amongst the younger age group"". Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: ""With cases rising gradually and pressures on our NHS, our approach is to keep people safe and get through a challenging winter without having to re-introduce any restrictions. ""Our vaccine certification scheme is working well, with venues and events affected continuing to operate and more than 1.5 million downloads of the NHS Covid status app so far. ""We want businesses to remain open throughout the Christmas period so it is sensible to consider options available to expand Covid certification."" But Scottish Conservative Covid recovery spokesman, Murdo Fraser MSP, said: ""John Swinney continues to insists that the SNP's vaccine certification scheme is working well, yet in almost 70 pages of their so-called evidence document, the SNP government have failed to provide concrete proof of the scheme's effectiveness. ""In contrast, the devastating impact on businesses is all too clear. ""The SNP government has admitted that night-time venues have faced significant trade losses, rising costs and increased abuse of staff as a result of the existing scheme. Yet they are still considering extending the requirements to over 17,000 additional businesses."" BBC Scotland is keen to hear what questions you have about vaccine passports. The Scottish government's scheme came into effect in October, andon Tuesday the first minister will announce whether the scheme is to be expanded. Any changes would come into effect on 6 December.

"Online electricals retailer AO World has warned Xbox and Playstation games devices, and iPhones could be in short supply this Christmas. A global shortage of computer chips has hit availability of such items. AO warned that these shortages as well as supply chain problems in the festive trading period would hit its profits. The retailer saw sales soar during lockdown, but that runaway growth has been halted by higher labour and transport costs. AO warned that the key festive trading period would be ""significantly softer"" than anticipated. On Tuesday, the firm posted a half-year pre-tax loss of Â£10m, down from an Â£18m profit in the six months last year. That sent AO's share price crashing by about 25% initially on Tuesday, although it had recovered slightly to stand about 15% lower by late morning. The nationwide lorry driver shortage that has hit many companies remains a problem, AO said. It had recruited about 500 new drivers to help beat labour shortages, but said it was still seeing ""meaningful supply chain challenges"", product shortages and higher costs of transport and freight. Tech retailers warn of low Black Friday stock Ikea to raise prices as supply problems bite Why is there an HGV driver shortage? ""At the start of our financial year in April, we planned for continued revenue growth and built up our cost base accordingly,"" AO said. ""However, since then, growth in the UK has been impacted by the nationwide shortage of delivery drivers and the ongoing disruption in the global supply chain, and the German online market has seen significantly increased competition. ""As we now look to the second half, we continue to see meaningful supply chain challenges with poor availability in certain categories, particularly in our newer products where we have less scale, experience and leverage."" In addition, shipping costs, the cost of materials and consumer price inflation ""remain challenging uncertainties"", the company said. Many companies - from toy, food and clothes retailers to furniture giant Ikea - have warned of labour shortages, higher costs and disruption to supplies. At the weekend,technology retailers warned that they may have insufficient stockto meet Black Friday demand due to delays in the supply chain. AO World, which sells a diverse range of electrical goods, including laptops, washing machines, and mobile phones, said the ""all-important"" festive period would be far tougher than it anticipated just a few weeks ago. It expects underlying profits for the year to March of between Â£10m-Â£20m compared with a previous forecast of between Â£35m-Â£50m issued in October. Profits last year nearly tripled to Â£64m. Richard Hunter, head of markets at online share broker Interactive Investor, called AO's problems a ""white-knuckle ride"". In addition to supply problems and staff shortages in the UK, he pointed to issues overseas. ""The group's foray into the German market is not only in the early stages of establishing the brand, but is also being faced by significantly increased competition,"" he said. The fall in AO's share price, which now stands at about 105p, will prove continuing disappointment for staff,who in 2020 were offered a generous bonus scheme. Employees would share Â£140m if the price hit Â£9.41 by 2025, and Â£240m if it went to Â£12.55. AO's highest closing price is about Â£4.30, reached in January.

"This video can not be played Covid-19: NI Executive ministers meet to discuss coronavirus measures People in Northern Ireland are being urged by Stormont ministers to work from home ""where possible"" in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. Current advicealready states that people should work from home where they can,externalbut ministers said they were ""strengthening"" that message. It follows an executive meeting about how to tackle rising infections. Ministers are also advising the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings. Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so- it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland. In England, since Covid restrictions lifted on 19 July, people have no longer been asked towork at home but businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to staff and customers. Most Covid restrictions have also been lifted in Wales, but employers are still encouraged to let people work from home where possible. In Scotland, most restrictions have been lifted, but working from home where possible is advised. The government wants employers to consider long-term ""hybrid"" working models. ""Hospital admissions are rising and modelling indicates that admissions will increase further in the coming weeks,"" Stormont executive ministers said. What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? ""The clear advice from public health experts is that an intervention is now required."" In a joint statement after Tuesday's meeting, Northern Ireland ministers said Covid-19 had ""once again taken a firm grip across our society"". Ministers said that if more people worked from home it would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they stopped short of ordering employers to facilitate home working, saying they ""recognise that this may present challenges in some work areas"". Instead, ministers said they were asking employees ""to work from home where they can and advise employers to support this where possible"". The health minister has warned that hospitality businesses could be forced to close again over Christmas The statement followed a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), who had recently said he believedanyone working from home last year when the pandemic began should do so again. He has warnedhospitality businesses may have to close over Christmasunless coronavirus transmission rates fall. Following Tuesday's meeting, ministers urged the public to take up the offer of vaccines and booster jabs, saying statistics were stark. ""Unvaccinated adults aged under 50 are almost 11 times more likely to need hospitalisation from Covid-19,"" they said. ""Unvaccinated individuals aged 50 and over are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those who are fully vaccinated."" Speaking after the meeting, First Minister Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was aware that restrictions had been ""acutely"" felt by the hospitality industry. ""We have to protect both lives and livelihood so we are working on the basis of having things open and safe,"" he said. ""No-one wants to be faced with a situation where business have to close,"" he added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said following the guidance was ""our best chance to avoid restrictions down the line"". She appealed to those who can work from home to ""please work from home and for employers to facilitate that"". ""We want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,"" she added. What we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. We know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required. There was no mention of a return to lockdown from ministers today, but they also can't rule anything out. The health minister has already warned that if we don't get a grip on Covid in the next two to three weeks, hospitality could again face closure at Christmas. That, it must be said, remains the worst, worst case scenario and ministers will be reluctant to go there. They'll hope the vaccination programme and ramping up of the booster programme in the next few weeks will help. Ministers are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year. The executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. In addition to promoting the vaccine message, ministers urged the public to ""make safer choices"" when coming in to contact with other people. This advices includes meeting people outdoors in preference to indoors, wearing face coverings and ensuring good ventilation of indoor settings. It is understood the Stormont executive has asked its Covid taskforce to examine issues around enforcement of wearing face masks. The taskforce will also look at the potential of setting up a scores-on-the-doors type system to rate businesses on their compliance with rules and mitigations. Mr Givan tweeted that the executive had ""engaged constructively and agreed a number of measures that will step up our collective efforts against the spread of Covid"". Allow Twitter content?

Earlier, Justice Minister Naomi Long said Stormont ministers may have to reintroduce some Covid-19 restrictions if there are ""no alternatives"". She said the executive was ""looking for ways that we can avoid having to take those drastic measures"" by focusing on measures such as the vaccine booster programme and Covid certification ""to make high-risk venues as safe as possible"". Mrs Long, the Alliance Party leader, said on Monday that ministers were ""not planning for Christmas closures"". On Tuesday, she told BBC News NI that there was a ""critical period"" ahead and ""we still have it within our gift"" to avoid the need for restrictions. However, Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster, which represents the hospitality industry, said the ""rhetoric"" coming from Stormont was unhelpful. ""I appreciate that planning has to go on behind closed doors,"" he said, but added that politicians were making ""half statements"" with no promise of support if tighter restrictions are imposed. Naomi Long said she did not have a crystal ball to predict the need for measures ""Those statements say to our workers: 'You might not have a job before Christmas' and it says to customers: 'Stay away'."" The executive met on Tuesday amid a high number of cases of Covid-19. On Tuesday,four Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Irelandand a further 1,476 new cases. Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI? Tough Covid choices return - but what's the data? Last weekministers voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports being introducedin Northern Ireland. The proof of certification scheme will require people to provide a passport or proof of a negative Covid test result to access venues such as nightclubs, pubs and restaurants. BBC News NI understands that a debate on the Covid passport regulations could happen at Stormont on 6 or 7 December. Robin Swann expressed disappointment that some hospitality businesses had not acted responsibly since rules were relaxed The measure is due to take effect from 29 November. But it will not be enforced until 13 December, as a two-week grace period will take place to allow time for businesses and customers to adjust to the change. The DUP - which voted against the plan coming into place - had asked for the assembly to be allowed to debate the regulations. In his paper to executive ministers last Thursday, Mr Swann then recommended allowing a debate in the assembly on the issue. Orla Smyth, who owns a cafe in Belfast, told BBC News NI that speculation about future measures was not ""helpful for public confidence in using services"". She explained it also made it difficult for ""business owners being able to function"". On Tuesday, Mrs Long said she did not have a ""crystal ball"" about how the coming weeks will unfold, but said she believed ""people have become slightly complacent because of the vaccine"". When asked about the number of people who do not wear mandatory face coverings in retail settings, she said it was not the ""primary responsibility"" of the police to enforce this. Rather, she added it was one of a number of agencies who have a role to play. What are Northern Ireland's rules on Covid-19?

"Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. The PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. Under the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023: those with assets of less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay anything from these towards care fees - although they might have to pay from their income those with more than Â£100,000 in assets - the value of their home, savings or investments - will not get any financial help from the council those with assets between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 will qualify for council help, but will have to pay Â£86,000 out of their own pocket to reach the cap On Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246. Nineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead. The bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. What could care changes cost you and your family? Claims about social care fact-checked What are the challenges facing social care? Will the cap really fix the social care system? Defending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win. Pushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament. The Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a ""step in the right direction"" and ""an improvement on what we have today"". But he said its plans for calculating the cap were a ""big disappointment"" and ""not as generous as people like me wanted"". After a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like. But that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place. And on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable. The vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. Read Laura's blog in full Under the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit. The threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to Â£100,000 able to qualify, rather than Â£23,250 currently. The governmentannounced last week,externalthat only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap. Local authorities will meet care costs beyond the Â£86,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded througha new health and social care tax. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care. Sally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was ""sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment"". ""The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,"" she said. ""It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this."" When asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I can't predict individual situations."" After the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: ""Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected."" But the prime minister said the new system would be ""progressive"" and ""much better"" than the existing one. ""Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of Â£23,000 or more - now you get support if you have Â£100,000 or less, so we're helping people,"" Mr Johnson said. He added: ""We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country."" Lorraine, pictured as a child, and her mother Roma Lorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent ""every penny that she ever earned"" on care. Despite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of Â£140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. She says for her mother, 83, selling her home was ""probably the worst thing ever"". ""She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,"" Lorraine adds. ""Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances."" Every adult receiving care will have an account measuring how much they spend on care fees from their own income or assets Those with total assets worth more than Â£100,000 will have to pay all the care fees themselves Once assets fall below Â£100,000, people will be able to claim means-tested payments from their council to help with costs If they cannot pay for care from their income, they will have to contribute Â£1 for every Â£250 they have in assets Care home fees - such as for food and rent - will not count towards the Â£86,000 limit but will be capped at Â£200 a week People with assets under Â£20,000 won't have to contribute to their care costs, although they might have to contribute from their income.

"This video can not be played Covid-19: NI Executive ministers meet to discuss coronavirus measures People in Northern Ireland are being urged by Stormont ministers to work from home ""where possible"" in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. Current advicealready states that people should work from home where they can,externalbut ministers said they were ""strengthening"" that message. It follows an executive meeting about how to tackle rising infections. Ministers are also advising the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings. Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so- it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland. In England, since Covid restrictions lifted on 19 July, people have no longer been asked towork at home but businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to staff and customers. Most Covid restrictions have also been lifted in Wales, but employers are still encouraged to let people work from home where possible. In Scotland, most restrictions have been lifted, but working from home where possible is advised. The government wants employers to consider long-term ""hybrid"" working models. ""Hospital admissions are rising and modelling indicates that admissions will increase further in the coming weeks,"" Stormont executive ministers said. What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? ""The clear advice from public health experts is that an intervention is now required."" In a joint statement after Tuesday's meeting, Northern Ireland ministers said Covid-19 had ""once again taken a firm grip across our society"". Ministers said that if more people worked from home it would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they stopped short of ordering employers to facilitate home working, saying they ""recognise that this may present challenges in some work areas"". Instead, ministers said they were asking employees ""to work from home where they can and advise employers to support this where possible"". The health minister has warned that hospitality businesses could be forced to close again over Christmas The statement followed a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), who had recently said he believedanyone working from home last year when the pandemic began should do so again. He has warnedhospitality businesses may have to close over Christmasunless coronavirus transmission rates fall. Following Tuesday's meeting, ministers urged the public to take up the offer of vaccines and booster jabs, saying statistics were stark. ""Unvaccinated adults aged under 50 are almost 11 times more likely to need hospitalisation from Covid-19,"" they said. ""Unvaccinated individuals aged 50 and over are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those who are fully vaccinated."" Speaking after the meeting, First Minister Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was aware that restrictions had been ""acutely"" felt by the hospitality industry. ""We have to protect both lives and livelihood so we are working on the basis of having things open and safe,"" he said. ""No-one wants to be faced with a situation where business have to close,"" he added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said following the guidance was ""our best chance to avoid restrictions down the line"". She appealed to those who can work from home to ""please work from home and for employers to facilitate that"". ""We want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,"" she added. What we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. We know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required. There was no mention of a return to lockdown from ministers today, but they also can't rule anything out. The health minister has already warned that if we don't get a grip on Covid in the next two to three weeks, hospitality could again face closure at Christmas. That, it must be said, remains the worst, worst case scenario and ministers will be reluctant to go there. They'll hope the vaccination programme and ramping up of the booster programme in the next few weeks will help. Ministers are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year. The executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. In addition to promoting the vaccine message, ministers urged the public to ""make safer choices"" when coming in to contact with other people. This advices includes meeting people outdoors in preference to indoors, wearing face coverings and ensuring good ventilation of indoor settings. It is understood the Stormont executive has asked its Covid taskforce to examine issues around enforcement of wearing face masks. The taskforce will also look at the potential of setting up a scores-on-the-doors type system to rate businesses on their compliance with rules and mitigations.

"Mark Mullen has led Atom Bank since 2014 The online bank Atom Bank has introduced a four-day work week for its 430 staff without cutting their pay. Employees now work 34 hours over four days and get Monday or Friday off, when previously they clocked up 37.5 hours across the whole week. Boss Mark Mullen told the BBC it was inspired by the pandemic and would help improve wellbeing and retain staff. However, employees will have to work longer hours on the days that they are in. ""Before Covid, the conventional wisdom was you had to commute in, sit at a desk all day and repeat that process when you commuted home,"" said Mr Mullen, who has led the Durham-based bank since 2014. ""Covid showed us that it wasn't necessaryâ¦I think doing 9-5, Monday to Friday is a pretty old fashioned way of working."" 'I can't see myself going back to a five-day week' Four-day week 'an overwhelming success' in Iceland Atom was one of the UK's first digital challenger banks and had Â£2.7bn of loans on its books in the last financial year. Its new working arrangements kicked in on 1 November after a review found they would not affect customer service or productivity. Mr Mullen said the new arrangement was voluntary, but strongly reflected his staff's preferences for more flexible working. ""Everyone is expected to stick to it,"" he added. ""I can't be sending my staff emails on a Friday, I can't expect to them to respond to them."" The bank's headquarters in Durham Working patterns have changed over time. In the 19th Century most British workers worked six day weeks, but in the 1930s Henry Ford in the US and pharmacy chain Boots in the UK popularised the two-day weekend as a way of boosting wellbeing and productivity. Now, calls for a four-day work week are growing amid similar claims that it could improve people's lives. Recent researchfound trials of a four-day week among public sector workers in Icelandwere an ""overwhelming success"" and helped reduce stress and burnout. And Microsoft Japan said sales had been boosted by nearly 40% during an experiment in which staff worked a four-day week on full pay back in 2019. However, some employers believe it's not the right thing to do. In 2019, UK science research foundation the Wellcome Trustscrapped plans to trial a four-day weekfor its 800 head office staff, saying it would be ""too operationally complex"". The decision followed a three-month study which found compressing work into a Monday to Thursday window could negatively affect the wellbeing of some workers and harm productivity. ""It is undoubtedly a positive move for employers to seek to reduce people's working hours without compromising pay,"" Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, told the BBC. ""However, I think the challenge of simply reducing people's working hours without other changes is that you can increase exposure to stress, which is already one of the main causes of working time lost to sickness absence."" Atom is asking its staff to compress their hours into a shorter period, and proportionally their hours have not been cut by a whole day. But Mr Mullen said workers would still get paid the same and enjoy a ""three day weekend in perpetuity"". This video can not be played Would a four-day week boost productivity? He also hopes it will help attract talent at time when staff attrition at the bank is ""unusually"" high due to the pandemic. ""With Covid-19 causing vast numbers of people to reconsider how they want to live their lives, anything that leads to more productive, healthier, and, crucially, happier colleagues, is a win for everyone,"" he added.

Earlier, Justice Minister Naomi Long said Stormont ministers may have to reintroduce some Covid-19 restrictions if there are ""no alternatives"". She said the executive was ""looking for ways that we can avoid having to take those drastic measures"" by focusing on measures such as the vaccine booster programme and Covid certification ""to make high-risk venues as safe as possible"". Mrs Long, the Alliance Party leader, said on Monday that ministers were ""not planning for Christmas closures"". On Tuesday, she told BBC News NI that there was a ""critical period"" ahead and ""we still have it within our gift"" to avoid the need for restrictions. However, Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster, which represents the hospitality industry, said the ""rhetoric"" coming from Stormont was unhelpful. ""I appreciate that planning has to go on behind closed doors,"" he said, but added that politicians were making ""half statements"" with no promise of support if tighter restrictions are imposed. Naomi Long said she did not have a crystal ball to predict the need for measures ""Those statements say to our workers: 'You might not have a job before Christmas' and it says to customers: 'Stay away'."" The executive met on Tuesday amid a high number of cases of Covid-19. On Tuesday,four Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Irelandand a further 1,476 new cases. Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI? Tough Covid choices return - but what's the data? Last weekministers voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports being introducedin Northern Ireland. The proof of certification scheme will require people to provide a passport or proof of a negative Covid test result to access venues such as nightclubs, pubs and restaurants. BBC News NI understands that a debate on the Covid passport regulations could happen at Stormont on 6 or 7 December. Robin Swann expressed disappointment that some hospitality businesses had not acted responsibly since rules were relaxed The measure is due to take effect from 29 November. But it will not be enforced until 13 December, as a two-week grace period will take place to allow time for businesses and customers to adjust to the change. The DUP - which voted against the plan coming into place - had asked for the assembly to be allowed to debate the regulations. In his paper to executive ministers last Thursday, Mr Swann then recommended allowing a debate in the assembly on the issue. Orla Smyth, who owns a cafe in Belfast, told BBC News NI that speculation about future measures was not ""helpful for public confidence in using services"". She explained it also made it difficult for ""business owners being able to function"". On Tuesday, Mrs Long said she did not have a ""crystal ball"" about how the coming weeks will unfold, but said she believed ""people have become slightly complacent because of the vaccine"".

"This video can not be played Covid-19: NI Executive ministers meet to discuss coronavirus measures People in Northern Ireland are being urged by Stormont ministers to work from home ""where possible"" in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. Current advicealready states that people should work from home where they can,externalbut ministers said they were ""strengthening"" that message. It follows an executive meeting about how to tackle rising infections. Ministers are also advising the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings. Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so- it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland. In England, since Covid restrictions lifted on 19 July, people have no longer been asked towork at home but businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to staff and customers. Most Covid restrictions have also been lifted in Wales, but employers are still encouraged to let people work from home where possible. In Scotland, most restrictions have been lifted, but working from home where possible is advised. The government wants employers to consider long-term ""hybrid"" working models. ""Hospital admissions are rising and modelling indicates that admissions will increase further in the coming weeks,"" Stormont executive ministers said. What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? ""The clear advice from public health experts is that an intervention is now required."" In a joint statement after Tuesday's meeting, Northern Ireland ministers said Covid-19 had ""once again taken a firm grip across our society"". Ministers said that if more people worked from home it would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they stopped short of ordering employers to facilitate home working, saying they ""recognise that this may present challenges in some work areas"". Instead, ministers said they were asking employees ""to work from home where they can and advise employers to support this where possible"". The health minister has warned that hospitality businesses could be forced to close again over Christmas The statement followed a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), who had recently said he believedanyone working from home last year when the pandemic began should do so again. He has warnedhospitality businesses may have to close over Christmasunless coronavirus transmission rates fall. Following Tuesday's meeting, ministers urged the public to take up the offer of vaccines and booster jabs, saying statistics were stark. ""Unvaccinated adults aged under 50 are almost 11 times more likely to need hospitalisation from Covid-19,"" they said. ""Unvaccinated individuals aged 50 and over are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those who are fully vaccinated."" Speaking after the meeting, First Minister Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was aware that restrictions had been ""acutely"" felt by the hospitality industry. ""We have to protect both lives and livelihood so we are working on the basis of having things open and safe,"" he said. ""No-one wants to be faced with a situation where business have to close,"" he added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said following the guidance was ""our best chance to avoid restrictions down the line"". She appealed to those who can work from home to ""please work from home and for employers to facilitate that"". ""We want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,"" she added. What we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. We know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required. There was no mention of a return to lockdown from ministers today, but they also can't rule anything out. The health minister has already warned that if we don't get a grip on Covid in the next two to three weeks, hospitality could again face closure at Christmas. That, it must be said, remains the worst, worst case scenario and ministers will be reluctant to go there. They'll hope the vaccination programme and ramping up of the booster programme in the next few weeks will help. Ministers are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year. The executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. In addition to promoting the vaccine message, ministers urged the public to ""make safer choices"" when coming in to contact with other people. This advices includes meeting people outdoors in preference to indoors, wearing face coverings and ensuring good ventilation of indoor settings. It is understood the Stormont executive has asked its Covid taskforce to examine issues around enforcement of wearing face masks. The taskforce will also look at the potential of setting up a scores-on-the-doors type system to rate businesses on their compliance with rules and mitigations. Mr Givan tweeted that the executive had ""engaged constructively and agreed a number of measures that will step up our collective efforts against the spread of Covid"". Allow Twitter content?

"Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. The PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. Under the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023: those with assets of less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay anything from these towards care fees - although they might have to pay from their income those with more than Â£100,000 in assets - the value of their home, savings or investments - will not get any financial help from the council those with assets between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 will qualify for council help, but will have to pay Â£86,000 out of their own pocket to reach the cap On Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246. Nineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead. The bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. What could care changes cost you and your family? Claims about social care fact-checked What are the challenges facing social care? Will the cap really fix the social care system? Defending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win. Pushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament. The Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a ""step in the right direction"" and ""an improvement on what we have today"". But he said its plans for calculating the cap were a ""big disappointment"" and ""not as generous as people like me wanted"". After a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like. But that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place. And on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable. The vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. Read Laura's blog in full Under the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit. The threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to Â£100,000 able to qualify, rather than Â£23,250 currently. The governmentannounced last week,externalthat only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap. Local authorities will meet care costs beyond the Â£86,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded througha new health and social care tax. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care. Sally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was ""sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment"". ""The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,"" she said. ""It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this."" When asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I can't predict individual situations."" After the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: ""Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected."" But the prime minister said the new system would be ""progressive"" and ""much better"" than the existing one. ""Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of Â£23,000 or more - now you get support if you have Â£100,000 or less, so we're helping people,"" Mr Johnson said. He added: ""We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country."" Lorraine, pictured as a child, and her mother Roma Lorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent ""every penny that she ever earned"" on care. Despite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of Â£140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. She says for her mother, 83, selling her home was ""probably the worst thing ever"". ""She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,"" Lorraine adds. ""Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances."" Every adult receiving care will have an account measuring how much they spend on care fees from their own income or assets Those with total assets worth more than Â£100,000 will have to pay all the care fees themselves Once assets fall below Â£100,000, people will be able to claim means-tested payments from their council to help with costs If they cannot pay for care from their income, they will have to contribute Â£1 for every Â£250 they have in assets Care home fees - such as for food and rent - will not count towards the Â£86,000 limit but will be capped at Â£200 a week People with assets under Â£20,000 won't have to contribute to their care costs, although they might have to contribute from their income.

"A cap on the amount people in England pay for social care is to be postponed by two years. Councils had warned adult care services could worsen if the rollout was not delayed. The cap on care costs was due to be introduced in October 2023. The delay was announced in Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement. It means some people will continue to pay more than Â£86,000 for lifelong care needs. Following concern overchallenges including staffing and financial pressures, the government said an extra Â£2.8bn would be available for adult social care next year and Â£4.7bn the following year. This includes delaying the cap on social care costs, allowing councils to increase council tax by up to 5% and Â£1bn of extra funding next year, followed by Â£1.7bn the next year. Money for schools, care and NHS - but is it enough? Health Secretary Stephen Barclay said 200,000 more care packages would be delivered with this funding. Sir Andrew Dilnot, who helped to devise the care cap plan, said the delay was ""extraordinarily disappointing"". He said Mr Hunt had broken the government's2019 manifesto commitment,externalto fix social care. However, the National Care Forum - which represents not-for-profit health and social care providers - said funding increases were welcome, but ""much more is needed to put the sector on a sustainable long-term footing"". People would no longer pay more than Â£86,000 towards their care during their lifetime. The Â£86,000 limit, or cap, would only cover personal care, such as help washing or dressing. It would not cover living costs such as food, energy bills or accommodation After people reach the Â£86,000 cap, personal care would be paid for by local authorities People with assets under Â£20,000 wouldn't have to contribute to care costs (compared with Â£14,250 now). However, they might have to contribute from their income. Assets are things you own - like a house or savings Those with between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 would get help towards costs from their local council. This would be means-tested - so, it depends on things like income and property MPs back change to social care funding in England What are the challenges facing social care? Critics warned that people with fewer savings might end up using a bigger proportion of their own assets than better-off people. For example, after reaching the Â£86,000 cap, someone with a Â£100,000 house would be left with Â£20,000 - 20% of the value. (The first Â£20,000 of someone's assets is protected under the proposals). However, someone with a Â£500,000 house would be left with Â£414,000 after reaching the cap - leaving them about 83% of the value. Also under the proposals: Means-tested help that people get from their local councilwould not count towards the Â£86,000 cap,external Only money from someone's own income or savings would count So, if someone's care costs Â£860 a week and they were meeting the cost themselves, it would take 100 weeks to hit the cap. However, if the same person received council help it would take longer than 100 weeks. That means poorer people receiving means-tested help would make contributions from their own money for longer. The cap wouldn't cover living costs, like rent, food and utility bills. The guidance says people would have to meet these themselves - ""including after they reach the cap"". The government said living costs would be up to Â£200 a week. Will people still have to sell their homes? Government changes rules on social care cap Social care works differently across the UK. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is currently free,externalinScotlandfor those assessed by their local authority as needing it. The Scottish government is set to launch a new National Care Service, which it says will bethe biggest shakeup of public services since the creation of the NHS and will end the current social care ""postcode lottery"". Some care costs are already cappedinWales. Home care is free for over-75s,externalinNorthern Ireland.

"Plans to reform the way people pay for social care in England have been voted on by MPs. The government's proposals were approved but it faced significant opposition from other political parties and some of its own MPs - with concerns that not enough is being done to protect the poorest pensioners. The reforms include a cap - or limit - on the amount people will have to pay towards their personal care. It will be set at Â£86,000. After this has been reached, the local authority will pay for the care. This does not include living costs such as food, energy bills or accommodation. MPs back change to social care cost cap funding There have been claims about how much these changes will benefit people - we've been looking at some of them. As well as the cap, people will be eligible for some financial help from their local council towards the cost of care. This is means-tested and will be available to people who need social careand have less than Â£100,000 in assets.,external If someone has less than Â£20,000 in assets, then they won't have to spend any of those assets on their personal care. Social care: Boris Johnson defends his plan amid criticism over the cost cap The question being discussed by the prime minister is when your home counts towards your assets. He's right in his explanation. If you are receiving social care at home or if you are in a care home and your spouse is living in your home, the value of the home is not counted towards your assets. That's called the housing disregard. If you go into a care home and you do not have a spouse living in your home, then the value of your home is counted towards your assets and you may have to sell it, although there are schemes that allow you to defer the costs, and for the property to be sold after you die. This is controversial because it is at odds with what the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto said. It promised that: ""nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it"". You can read more about how the new system will work here But,as we've pointed out before, the government's language around this has shifted since the manifesto pledge. The Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said ""no-one will have to sell their house in their lifetime"". And Business Minister Paul Scully told Sky News today: ""There will be fewer people selling their houses and hopefully none."" The first thing to say about this claim from Labour's shadow health secretary is that this would only be the case if somebody was receiving social care in a care home - not if they were getting care in their own home. If they were receiving care at home or had a spouse living at home, then the home would not count towards their assets - under the housing disregard. If this wasn't the case, the rules mean that you would have to contribute from your savings and other assets towards your social care until you got down to having assets worth Â£20,000. This could include having to agree to sell your home in future. So in Mr Ashworth's example, if the Â£80,000 house was your only asset, you could lose three-quarters of your assets. And remember, these figures cover personal care and not other costs such as accommodation and food. People may be eligible for means-tested benefits to help with those costs. This piece was updated on 23 November to clarify the means-testing for social care support. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"This video can not be played Covid-19: NI Executive ministers meet to discuss coronavirus measures People in Northern Ireland are being urged by Stormont ministers to work from home ""where possible"" in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. Current advicealready states that people should work from home where they can,externalbut ministers said they were ""strengthening"" that message. It follows an executive meeting about how to tackle rising infections. Ministers are also advising the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings. Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so- it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland. In England, since Covid restrictions lifted on 19 July, people have no longer been asked towork at home but businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to staff and customers. Most Covid restrictions have also been lifted in Wales, but employers are still encouraged to let people work from home where possible. In Scotland, most restrictions have been lifted, but working from home where possible is advised. The government wants employers to consider long-term ""hybrid"" working models. ""Hospital admissions are rising and modelling indicates that admissions will increase further in the coming weeks,"" Stormont executive ministers said. What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? ""The clear advice from public health experts is that an intervention is now required."" In a joint statement after Tuesday's meeting, Northern Ireland ministers said Covid-19 had ""once again taken a firm grip across our society"". Ministers said that if more people worked from home it would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they stopped short of ordering employers to facilitate home working, saying they ""recognise that this may present challenges in some work areas"". Instead, ministers said they were asking employees ""to work from home where they can and advise employers to support this where possible"". The health minister has warned that hospitality businesses could be forced to close again over Christmas The statement followed a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), who had recently said he believedanyone working from home last year when the pandemic began should do so again. He has warnedhospitality businesses may have to close over Christmasunless coronavirus transmission rates fall. Following Tuesday's meeting, ministers urged the public to take up the offer of vaccines and booster jabs, saying statistics were stark. ""Unvaccinated adults aged under 50 are almost 11 times more likely to need hospitalisation from Covid-19,"" they said. ""Unvaccinated individuals aged 50 and over are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those who are fully vaccinated."" Speaking after the meeting, First Minister Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was aware that restrictions had been ""acutely"" felt by the hospitality industry. ""We have to protect both lives and livelihood so we are working on the basis of having things open and safe,"" he said. ""No-one wants to be faced with a situation where business have to close,"" he added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said following the guidance was ""our best chance to avoid restrictions down the line"". She appealed to those who can work from home to ""please work from home and for employers to facilitate that"". ""We want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,"" she added. What we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. We know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required. There was no mention of a return to lockdown from ministers today, but they also can't rule anything out. The health minister has already warned that if we don't get a grip on Covid in the next two to three weeks, hospitality could again face closure at Christmas. That, it must be said, remains the worst, worst case scenario and ministers will be reluctant to go there. They'll hope the vaccination programme and ramping up of the booster programme in the next few weeks will help. Ministers are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year. The executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. In addition to promoting the vaccine message, ministers urged the public to ""make safer choices"" when coming in to contact with other people. This advices includes meeting people outdoors in preference to indoors, wearing face coverings and ensuring good ventilation of indoor settings. It is understood the Stormont executive has asked its Covid taskforce to examine issues around enforcement of wearing face masks. The taskforce will also look at the potential of setting up a scores-on-the-doors type system to rate businesses on their compliance with rules and mitigations. Mr Givan tweeted that the executive had ""engaged constructively and agreed a number of measures that will step up our collective efforts against the spread of Covid"". Allow Twitter content?

Earlier, Justice Minister Naomi Long said Stormont ministers may have to reintroduce some Covid-19 restrictions if there are ""no alternatives"". She said the executive was ""looking for ways that we can avoid having to take those drastic measures"" by focusing on measures such as the vaccine booster programme and Covid certification ""to make high-risk venues as safe as possible"". Mrs Long, the Alliance Party leader, said on Monday that ministers were ""not planning for Christmas closures"". On Tuesday, she told BBC News NI that there was a ""critical period"" ahead and ""we still have it within our gift"" to avoid the need for restrictions. However, Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster, which represents the hospitality industry, said the ""rhetoric"" coming from Stormont was unhelpful. ""I appreciate that planning has to go on behind closed doors,"" he said, but added that politicians were making ""half statements"" with no promise of support if tighter restrictions are imposed. Naomi Long said she did not have a crystal ball to predict the need for measures ""Those statements say to our workers: 'You might not have a job before Christmas' and it says to customers: 'Stay away'."" The executive met on Tuesday amid a high number of cases of Covid-19. On Tuesday,four Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Irelandand a further 1,476 new cases. Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI? Tough Covid choices return - but what's the data? Last weekministers voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports being introducedin Northern Ireland. The proof of certification scheme will require people to provide a passport or proof of a negative Covid test result to access venues such as nightclubs, pubs and restaurants. BBC News NI understands that a debate on the Covid passport regulations could happen at Stormont on 6 or 7 December. Robin Swann expressed disappointment that some hospitality businesses had not acted responsibly since rules were relaxed The measure is due to take effect from 29 November. But it will not be enforced until 13 December, as a two-week grace period will take place to allow time for businesses and customers to adjust to the change. The DUP - which voted against the plan coming into place - had asked for the assembly to be allowed to debate the regulations. In his paper to executive ministers last Thursday, Mr Swann then recommended allowing a debate in the assembly on the issue. Orla Smyth, who owns a cafe in Belfast, told BBC News NI that speculation about future measures was not ""helpful for public confidence in using services"". She explained it also made it difficult for ""business owners being able to function"". On Tuesday, Mrs Long said she did not have a ""crystal ball"" about how the coming weeks will unfold, but said she believed ""people have become slightly complacent because of the vaccine"". When asked about the number of people who do not wear mandatory face coverings in retail settings, she said it was not the ""primary responsibility"" of the police to enforce this. Rather, she added it was one of a number of agencies who have a role to play. What are Northern Ireland's rules on Covid-19?

"Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. The PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. Under the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023: those with assets of less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay anything from these towards care fees - although they might have to pay from their income those with more than Â£100,000 in assets - the value of their home, savings or investments - will not get any financial help from the council those with assets between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 will qualify for council help, but will have to pay Â£86,000 out of their own pocket to reach the cap On Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246. Nineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead. The bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. What could care changes cost you and your family? Claims about social care fact-checked What are the challenges facing social care? Will the cap really fix the social care system? Defending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win. Pushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament. The Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a ""step in the right direction"" and ""an improvement on what we have today"". But he said its plans for calculating the cap were a ""big disappointment"" and ""not as generous as people like me wanted"". After a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like. But that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place. And on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable. The vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. Read Laura's blog in full Under the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit. The threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to Â£100,000 able to qualify, rather than Â£23,250 currently. The governmentannounced last week,externalthat only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap. Local authorities will meet care costs beyond the Â£86,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded througha new health and social care tax. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care. Sally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was ""sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment"". ""The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,"" she said. ""It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this."" When asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I can't predict individual situations."" After the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: ""Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected."" But the prime minister said the new system would be ""progressive"" and ""much better"" than the existing one. ""Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of Â£23,000 or more - now you get support if you have Â£100,000 or less, so we're helping people,"" Mr Johnson said. He added: ""We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country."" Lorraine, pictured as a child, and her mother Roma Lorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent ""every penny that she ever earned"" on care. Despite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of Â£140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. She says for her mother, 83, selling her home was ""probably the worst thing ever"". ""She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,"" Lorraine adds. ""Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances."" Every adult receiving care will have an account measuring how much they spend on care fees from their own income or assets Those with total assets worth more than Â£100,000 will have to pay all the care fees themselves Once assets fall below Â£100,000, people will be able to claim means-tested payments from their council to help with costs If they cannot pay for care from their income, they will have to contribute Â£1 for every Â£250 they have in assets Care home fees - such as for food and rent - will not count towards the Â£86,000 limit but will be capped at Â£200 a week People with assets under Â£20,000 won't have to contribute to their care costs, although they might have to contribute from their income.

"Covid infection rates have started rising sharply in parts of Western Europe, prompting the introduction of fresh restrictions and lockdowns. It has triggered fears the UK could follow suit. But there are plenty of reasons to believe Britain will escape the worst of what is being seen on the continent. In fact, the UK may well be in the strongest position of all to weather Covid this winter. To understand why that could be the case, you need to look at the reasons why cases have started to take off in Western Europe. Unlike the UK - and England in particular - many parts of Europe kept major restrictions in place for much longer. Whereas England fully unlocked in mid-July, parts of Europe did not do this until the autumn, and in many places kept tougher restrictions in place even as they did. Part of this was to do with timing. The UK was hit by the more infectious Alpha variant and then Delta sooner, meaning it was in a position to push ahead with unlocking before others. But it was also a conscious choice backed by the government's top scientists, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance. The logic - along with the benefit of ending restrictions that themselves cause harm to health -  was that it was better to have the rebound in infection, the so-called exit wave, in the summer. It was felt the increase in the spread of the virus would be mitigated by the better weather, meaning more time spent outdoors, and would avoid the winter crunch when pressure on the health system increases across the board. The UK has, in effect, already had the wave the rest of Europe is seeing and has managed to avoid being swamped by it. That is mainly because of the amount of immunity built up. A combination of good vaccine rollout, particularly among the older more vulnerable groups who are the ones most at risk of serious illness, and natural immunity from infection means there is likely to be a much smaller pool of vulnerable people for the virus to infect. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been trying to quantify this by looking at what would happen if everyone was suddenly exposed to the virus in one go. Theymodelled this for England,external- although there is nothing to suggest Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be any different - and 18 other European nations. If this hypothetical situation happened, England would have by far the fewest people ending up in hospital - 62 per 100,000 people - because of immunity built up by vaccination and infection. That compares with more than 300 in Germany, largely because of their lower levels of infection to date, and more than 800 in Romania, which has struggled to convince its public to come forward for vaccination. This was the picture at the end of October. If the same analysis was done at the end of November it is likely the situation would be even more favourable for England, says lead researcher Dr Lloyd Chapman. That's because the UK is ploughing ahead faster than other nations with boosters. Again part of this is related to timing. As the UK was quicker off the mark with Covid vaccinations initially, there are greater numbers of people becoming eligible for a booster. ""We are giving those boosters to the very people who are most at risk at perhaps the best time - they will have the best protection in winter."" But Dr Chapman also points out this has come at a price - the high rates of infection have resulted in a greater amount of serious illness and death in recent months than many of our Western European neighbours. And he adds the research should not be seen as a guarantee we will escape the winter without seeing a surge in cases. ""We may be in the strongest position - but we could still see cases double and that would cause problems."" But is that likely? What is perhaps most remarkable about the UK is just how stable infection levels have been. Ever since the sharp rise seen in early summer peaked in mid-July, infection rates have bobbled along, small rises being followed by similar drops. There is no other part of Europe that has seen Covid infections held so stable with very few restrictions in place. Instead, when other nations have seen cases surge restrictions have tended to be reimposed. This is happening now in parts of Western Europe and follows on from what happened in Eastern Europe early in the autumn. Romania, for example, saw a sharp rise in cases in September and October and reacted by introducing a night curfew, sending children home from school and introducing health passes for access to public venues. It is telling that those nations that have had the most problems as winter arrives are the ones identified by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having the greatest pool of vulnerable people. How far this pattern spreads across Europe remains to be seen. But immunity alone does not explain why the UK, and in particular England, has seen such stable rates, says Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the government's infectious disease modelling group. Prof Medley, speaking in a personal capacity, believes it is more complex than that. ""I think we are seeing the public playing an important role.""

"Covid infection rates have started rising sharply in parts of Western Europe, prompting the introduction of fresh restrictions and lockdowns. It has triggered fears the UK could follow suit. But there are plenty of reasons to believe Britain will escape the worst of what is being seen on the continent. In fact, the UK may well be in the strongest position of all to weather Covid this winter. To understand why that could be the case, you need to look at the reasons why cases have started to take off in Western Europe. Unlike the UK - and England in particular - many parts of Europe kept major restrictions in place for much longer. Whereas England fully unlocked in mid-July, parts of Europe did not do this until the autumn, and in many places kept tougher restrictions in place even as they did. Part of this was to do with timing. The UK was hit by the more infectious Alpha variant and then Delta sooner, meaning it was in a position to push ahead with unlocking before others. But it was also a conscious choice backed by the government's top scientists, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance. The logic - along with the benefit of ending restrictions that themselves cause harm to health -  was that it was better to have the rebound in infection, the so-called exit wave, in the summer. It was felt the increase in the spread of the virus would be mitigated by the better weather, meaning more time spent outdoors, and would avoid the winter crunch when pressure on the health system increases across the board. The UK has, in effect, already had the wave the rest of Europe is seeing and has managed to avoid being swamped by it. That is mainly because of the amount of immunity built up. A combination of good vaccine rollout, particularly among the older more vulnerable groups who are the ones most at risk of serious illness, and natural immunity from infection means there is likely to be a much smaller pool of vulnerable people for the virus to infect. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been trying to quantify this by looking at what would happen if everyone was suddenly exposed to the virus in one go. Theymodelled this for England,external- although there is nothing to suggest Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be any different - and 18 other European nations. If this hypothetical situation happened, England would have by far the fewest people ending up in hospital - 62 per 100,000 people - because of immunity built up by vaccination and infection. That compares with more than 300 in Germany, largely because of their lower levels of infection to date, and more than 800 in Romania, which has struggled to convince its public to come forward for vaccination. This was the picture at the end of October. If the same analysis was done at the end of November it is likely the situation would be even more favourable for England, says lead researcher Dr Lloyd Chapman. That's because the UK is ploughing ahead faster than other nations with boosters. Again part of this is related to timing. As the UK was quicker off the mark with Covid vaccinations initially, there are greater numbers of people becoming eligible for a booster. ""We are giving those boosters to the very people who are most at risk at perhaps the best time - they will have the best protection in winter."" But Dr Chapman also points out this has come at a price - the high rates of infection have resulted in a greater amount of serious illness and death in recent months than many of our Western European neighbours. And he adds the research should not be seen as a guarantee we will escape the winter without seeing a surge in cases. ""We may be in the strongest position - but we could still see cases double and that would cause problems."" But is that likely? What is perhaps most remarkable about the UK is just how stable infection levels have been. Ever since the sharp rise seen in early summer peaked in mid-July, infection rates have bobbled along, small rises being followed by similar drops. There is no other part of Europe that has seen Covid infections held so stable with very few restrictions in place. Instead, when other nations have seen cases surge restrictions have tended to be reimposed. This is happening now in parts of Western Europe and follows on from what happened in Eastern Europe early in the autumn. Romania, for example, saw a sharp rise in cases in September and October and reacted by introducing a night curfew, sending children home from school and introducing health passes for access to public venues. It is telling that those nations that have had the most problems as winter arrives are the ones identified by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having the greatest pool of vulnerable people. How far this pattern spreads across Europe remains to be seen. But immunity alone does not explain why the UK, and in particular England, has seen such stable rates, says Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the government's infectious disease modelling group. Prof Medley, speaking in a personal capacity, believes it is more complex than that. ""I think we are seeing the public playing an important role."" He says a combination of limiting mixing and frequent use of rapid tests, which are more easy to access here than in many other countries, seems to be doing just enough to keep the virus in check. ""The government has passed the risk management to the public - and we've been able to do that better than other countries."" The big question is whether that will last throughout winter -ScotlandandNorthern Irelandare already talking about the possibility of tightening of restrictions. Prof Medley says it is ""delicately"" balanced, but with every passing week the chances are getting better.

"More than 90% of Black Friday deals were the same price or cheaper in the six months before the sales event last year, a Which? investigation has found. The consumer association told shoppers to make sure the discounts were ""truly genuine"" ahead of this year's sales. It said 184 out of 201 items from six retailers, which included Amazon and John Lewis, were priced the same or cheaper before Black Friday in 2020. Trading standards warned a deal ""may not be what it's all cracked up to be"". Katherine Hart, lead officer at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, added the ""prospect of scams rears its ugly head"" during the sales event, which takes place on Friday. ""It seems that the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales events get bigger every year, and many bargains can be found; however, we all must remain vigilant and practise shopping safety,"" she added. ""Sometimes sellers raise their prices before a sales period to make it look like a great deal is on offer during the sale."" Which? said popular items it found to be the same price or less before Black Friday last year included washing machines, soundbars and TVs. It analysed items from Amazon, AO, Argos, Currys, John Lewis and Richer Sounds by looking at the prices offered by the companies every day during the six months before and after 2020's Black Friday, as well as on the day itself. ""When looking at prices six months before and after Black Friday 2020, just one of the 201 products was at its cheapest price on Black Friday alone,"" the consumer champion said. One of the ""worst individual deals"", it added, was a Zanussi washing machine at John Lewis that was cheaper than its Black Friday price on 88 different days before the day itself. ""'Discounted' to Â£309 on Black Friday, customers could have bought it Â£60 cheaper at Â£249 five months before and for Â£289 within just a month after,"" Which? said. Richer Sounds had the highest proportion of deals with four out of 14, that were not cheaper or the same price before Black Friday. Ele Clark, Which? retail editor, said it was important shoppers did research before diving into the sales. ""Take time to identify the products you really want and check that the 'deal' you're seeing represents a genuine saving,"" she said. In response to Which?'s investigation, Amazon said it sought to ""offer our customers great value thanks to low prices all year round"" and that customers could ""easily compare prices, allowing them to make an informed purchase decision"". Meanwhile, John Lewis said it monitored prices all year round and match high street competitors as part of its ""never knowingly undersold"" policy. It explained a portable music speaker advertised on last year's Black Friday was the same price between 20 November 2020 to 12 January 2021 as ""those days were actually all part of the Black Friday promotional activity"". Richer Sounds admitted a Yamaha music speaker, which was priced in last year's promotion at Â£159 with an RRP of Â£199, had actually been that price or less on 277 other days and hadn't been for sale at its full price at the store since 2018. Richer Sounds said the deal was a ""mistake"" and apologised to any customers who were misled by it.

"This video can not be played Covid-19: NI Executive ministers meet to discuss coronavirus measures People in Northern Ireland are being urged by Stormont ministers to work from home ""where possible"" in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. Current advicealready states that people should work from home where they can,externalbut ministers said they were ""strengthening"" that message. It follows an executive meeting about how to tackle rising infections. Ministers are also advising the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings. Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so- it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland. In England, since Covid restrictions lifted on 19 July, people have no longer been asked towork at home but businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to staff and customers. Most Covid restrictions have also been lifted in Wales, but employers are still encouraged to let people work from home where possible. In Scotland, most restrictions have been lifted, but working from home where possible is advised. The government wants employers to consider long-term ""hybrid"" working models. ""Hospital admissions are rising and modelling indicates that admissions will increase further in the coming weeks,"" Stormont executive ministers said. What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? ""The clear advice from public health experts is that an intervention is now required."" In a joint statement after Tuesday's meeting, Northern Ireland ministers said Covid-19 had ""once again taken a firm grip across our society"". Ministers said that if more people worked from home it would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they stopped short of ordering employers to facilitate home working, saying they ""recognise that this may present challenges in some work areas"". Instead, ministers said they were asking employees ""to work from home where they can and advise employers to support this where possible"". The health minister has warned that hospitality businesses could be forced to close again over Christmas The statement followed a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), who had recently said he believedanyone working from home last year when the pandemic began should do so again. He has warnedhospitality businesses may have to close over Christmasunless coronavirus transmission rates fall. Following Tuesday's meeting, ministers urged the public to take up the offer of vaccines and booster jabs, saying statistics were stark. ""Unvaccinated adults aged under 50 are almost 11 times more likely to need hospitalisation from Covid-19,"" they said. ""Unvaccinated individuals aged 50 and over are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those who are fully vaccinated."" Speaking after the meeting, First Minister Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was aware that restrictions had been ""acutely"" felt by the hospitality industry. ""We have to protect both lives and livelihood so we are working on the basis of having things open and safe,"" he said. ""No-one wants to be faced with a situation where business have to close,"" he added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said following the guidance was ""our best chance to avoid restrictions down the line"". She appealed to those who can work from home to ""please work from home and for employers to facilitate that"". ""We want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,"" she added. What we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. We know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required. There was no mention of a return to lockdown from ministers today, but they also can't rule anything out. The health minister has already warned that if we don't get a grip on Covid in the next two to three weeks, hospitality could again face closure at Christmas. That, it must be said, remains the worst, worst case scenario and ministers will be reluctant to go there. They'll hope the vaccination programme and ramping up of the booster programme in the next few weeks will help. Ministers are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year. The executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. In addition to promoting the vaccine message, ministers urged the public to ""make safer choices"" when coming in to contact with other people. This advices includes meeting people outdoors in preference to indoors, wearing face coverings and ensuring good ventilation of indoor settings. It is understood the Stormont executive has asked its Covid taskforce to examine issues around enforcement of wearing face masks. The taskforce will also look at the potential of setting up a scores-on-the-doors type system to rate businesses on their compliance with rules and mitigations. Mr Givan tweeted that the executive had ""engaged constructively and agreed a number of measures that will step up our collective efforts against the spread of Covid"". Allow Twitter content?

Earlier, Justice Minister Naomi Long said Stormont ministers may have to reintroduce some Covid-19 restrictions if there are ""no alternatives"". She said the executive was ""looking for ways that we can avoid having to take those drastic measures"" by focusing on measures such as the vaccine booster programme and Covid certification ""to make high-risk venues as safe as possible"". Mrs Long, the Alliance Party leader, said on Monday that ministers were ""not planning for Christmas closures"". On Tuesday, she told BBC News NI that there was a ""critical period"" ahead and ""we still have it within our gift"" to avoid the need for restrictions. However, Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster, which represents the hospitality industry, said the ""rhetoric"" coming from Stormont was unhelpful. ""I appreciate that planning has to go on behind closed doors,"" he said, but added that politicians were making ""half statements"" with no promise of support if tighter restrictions are imposed. Naomi Long said she did not have a crystal ball to predict the need for measures ""Those statements say to our workers: 'You might not have a job before Christmas' and it says to customers: 'Stay away'."" The executive met on Tuesday amid a high number of cases of Covid-19. On Tuesday,four Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Irelandand a further 1,476 new cases. Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI? Tough Covid choices return - but what's the data? Last weekministers voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports being introducedin Northern Ireland. The proof of certification scheme will require people to provide a passport or proof of a negative Covid test result to access venues such as nightclubs, pubs and restaurants. BBC News NI understands that a debate on the Covid passport regulations could happen at Stormont on 6 or 7 December. Robin Swann expressed disappointment that some hospitality businesses had not acted responsibly since rules were relaxed The measure is due to take effect from 29 November. But it will not be enforced until 13 December, as a two-week grace period will take place to allow time for businesses and customers to adjust to the change. The DUP - which voted against the plan coming into place - had asked for the assembly to be allowed to debate the regulations. In his paper to executive ministers last Thursday, Mr Swann then recommended allowing a debate in the assembly on the issue. Orla Smyth, who owns a cafe in Belfast, told BBC News NI that speculation about future measures was not ""helpful for public confidence in using services"". She explained it also made it difficult for ""business owners being able to function"". On Tuesday, Mrs Long said she did not have a ""crystal ball"" about how the coming weeks will unfold, but said she believed ""people have become slightly complacent because of the vaccine"". When asked about the number of people who do not wear mandatory face coverings in retail settings, she said it was not the ""primary responsibility"" of the police to enforce this. Rather, she added it was one of a number of agencies who have a role to play. What are Northern Ireland's rules on Covid-19?

"One in three childcare providers in Northern Ireland is planning to put up prices as they struggle with rising costs, a survey has suggested. The survey was carried out by social enterprise Employers For Childcare and received more than 2,200 responses from parents and childcare providers. It found almost a third of childcare providers described their current financial position as ""distressed"". Some said that they were facing immediate risk of closure. At the same time, about a quarter of families - 28% - said they were struggling to find and pay for the childcare they need. The research suggested the average cost of a full-time childcare place in Northern Ireland was Â£170 per week - the equivalent of 34% of the median weekly household income in Northern Ireland. Aoife Hamilton, the enterprise's head of charity services, said: ""Childcare providers are facing unprecedented challenges - in recruiting and retaining staff and meeting salaries, particularly with the increase announced to the National Living Wage, as well as rising food and energy costs and uncertainty over numbers and occupancy levels. ""We have been reporting on childcare in Northern Ireland for over a decade and for many years, parents and childcare providers have been telling us about the issues they face, but this is the most worrying picture yet."" Aoife Hamilton said they were hearing that this was the ""most worrying picture yet"" The affect of Covid-19 on the sector means one in two parents (51%) who took part in the survey said the pandemic had changed their childcare requirements. In 2021, families reported using an average of 39 hours of childcare per week, down from 42 hours in 2020. Alicia Lappin is among the working parents who are concerned about rising childcare costs. The mother of four from Portadown, County Armagh, would like to return to work full time, but said ""the cost of childcare doesn't allow me to do it"". ""Year on year, it seems that my pay packet goes up pennies but the childcare seems to go up pounds... every single year it's a bit more,"" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""It's got to the stage where I've had to make my hours part time in order to be able to cover the cost of childcare - it doesn't financially pay me to be there full time."" Her children are aged nine, seven, four and 15 months.  With the eldest three in school or nursery, she currently pays for day care for her youngest child. She pays about Â£75 for him for 15 hours a week while she is at work. The centre is run by a social enterprise and Ms Lappin admits it is ""relatively cheap compared to what other people are paying"" but the bill is still a ""huge proportion"" of her part-time wage. By the time she factors in other work-related outgoings such as fuel costs, parking and tax, there is very little left. ""I don't work for the money at the minute.  I'm working because I want my foot in the door, I don't want to lose my position and I'm working because I love what I do,"" she said. Speaking on the same programme, childcare provider Diane Koplewsky said her industry was facing rising costs and currently has no choice but to pass them on to customers. She is the co-owner of the Sleepy Hollow Group which is one of Northern Ireland's biggest childcare companies, operating across 18 locations. ""As household costs increase, so do business costs,"" she said. ""Our PPE, cleaning, hygiene costs have all increased and ironically, so has our insurance even though insurers didn't pay out when we had to close. ""So the cost of operating a childcare business has never been higher."" Childcare provider Diane Koplewsky says she has no choice but to increase costs Ms Koplewsky called for more government support for her industry so that childcare costs are no longer a barrier to employment for parents. ""Childcare needs to be valued as essential element of the economic infrastructure and we need to fund it as such,"" she said. ""We aren't seeing any level of investment in childcare here - working parents deserve it, childcare providers deserve it and so do our workforce. ""Our workforce need to be valued for their role in care, we need to be valued as early educators."" Ms Koplewsky said childcare providers ""do not want to increase fees"" because they know the challenges facing working parents. However, she said their only source of income at the moment is parents' fees and these may have to rise if there is no government investment. ""Nobody wants to increase costs but what else are we to do if we don't get funding from the executive?"" Maria McDonagh who owns Adventures Day Nursery in west Belfast said she has been left with no other choice but to increase fees. She said: ""For us to be able to remain in business, we are probably looking at up to a 15% increase - 10% should cover wage increases and increases in the cost of providing food and activities and resources, but the energy costs will be the remaining hike that we have to look at this year."" Maria McDonagh says the price hike will cover wage increases, as well as the increased costs of food, energy and equipment. Dad-of-two Liam Mahaffy saw his childcare provider close its doors last month. He said: ""It's very sad for my son, the friends he had made there, they are all going to separate places now so it will be hard to maintain those friendships. It is very upsetting for the staff, they were absolutely brilliant the whole time."" Liam Mahaffy says childcare bills could become like a third mortgage when his second child starts going next year His partner is currently on maternity leave so while their current bill is significant, it is likely to increase next year. He said: ""It literally is, for us, a second mortgage, and that's just for three days a week. In another seven months' time, there will be a second one going into childcare so hopefully that's not a third mortgage. ""When my partner goes back after maternity leave, she might have to reduce her hours. I will be looking after them two days a week. It definitely does impact more, unfortunately, on women's employment prospects.""

"Robin Swann says closures may come if infections continue to rise, but it is not inevitable There is a possibility that hospitality venues may be asked to close over Christmas if Covid-19 cases continue to increase, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. But he told the Northern Ireland Assembly it was not ""inevitable"". Stormont ministers have met to discuss plans to help curb the spread of Covid-19 and will meet again on Tuesday. On Thursday, Mr Swann advisedanyone who worked from home when the pandemic began last year to do so again now. His document also suggested introducing a ""scores on the doors"" Covid compliance rating for businesses. Mr Swann said on Monday that ""if the current trajectory continues with regard to the increased cases we are seeing, we may once again face the possibility where venues are asked to close their doors during the Christmas season"". ""But let me be clear, it is not inevitable and I do not want to have to re-introduce further restrictions unless completely unavoidable,"" he added.

Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill tweeted that Mr Swann had presented a paper to ministers who met on Monday morning to consider it. She said that while the ""meeting was constructive and progress was made, it was agreed more work was needed"". ""The executive will meet again in the morning to finalise the approach,"" she added. Health Minister Robin Swann said he did not want to have to re-introduce further restrictions unless unavoidable Decisions on whether to strengthen current mitigations must first be agreed by the executive. Health officials believe the proposals could help reduce transmission of the virus. On Monday,three Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Irelandand a further 1,469 new cases. Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so. It is currently the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland. Justice Minister Naomi Long said on Monday that the executive was ""not planning for Christmas closures"". ""We started off in terms of looking at vaccine certification as one means of trying to ensure that we drive down transmission and as those who are in more high-risk environments are less likely to become seriously ill as a result, that's one means of keeping the doors open on businesses,"" she added. ""We've been considering the paper today around how we actually try to get the basics right and get people to comply with things like handwashing, wearing masks, trying to voluntarily reduce their number of close contacts, trying to ensure where people can work from home they do work from home. ""Our focus at the minute is not on closure but on trying to keep businesses open."" Ms O'Neill said on Twitter that it was ""vitally important that all executive ministers work together to get us through this difficult period"". ""It's time to redouble our efforts to limit the spread of the virus, protect lives and our hospital system,"" she added. I think this was the strongest warning from Robin Swann that unless people do change their ways, it is not inevitable, but a distinct possibility [that venues may be asked to close]. If we are talking about carrot and stick, I think that is potentially the stick. Mr Swann will hope that hits home, because nobody wants that to happen. Certainly the people who run these establishments don't want it to happen. People would like a Christmas, but Robin Swann is saying people have got to change their ways. Last week, the Department of Health warned that unless cases decrease significantly in the next three weeks, thenmore ""severe"" restrictions could be required before Christmas. Stormont ministers have said they do not want to have to impose tougher mitigations that could damage trade. They have already agreed to put in placeproof of Covid status for certain sectors, which will become enforceable from 13 December. The plan means people will have to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 or proof of a negative coronavirus test result to access nightclubs, pubs, cinemas, theatres and restaurants. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had voted against the proposals but Mr Swann and other Stormont ministers said the use of Covid status certification would save lives. The health minister suggests plans to encourage employees to return to the workplace should be reversed DUP ministers had said they wanted to see other measures explored by health officials, which could also help reduce the number of Covid cases. At present, executive advice on working from home is that people should continue to do so where they can. Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI? Tough Covid choices return - but what's the data? Meanwhile,Northern Ireland's justice minister has raised concerns about a proposal for her departmentto ""take the lead"" in managing compliance around face coverings to help combat Covid-19. The health paper suggested Naomi Long should oversee plans to raise compliance levels above 80%. She said the proposal was ""entirely inappropriate"". In Mr Swann's paper to ministers ahead of Monday's meeting, he suggested that a decision taken by the executive on 23 September encouraging employers to ""begin planning a gradual return to the workplace"" for employees should be reversed. The proposal goes on to say that the message should be communicated by stating that if a person worked from home when the pandemic began in March 2020 then ""they should be working from home now"". On Friday, Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Sir Michael McBride, said research had shown that working from home was ""one of the single most effective interventions"" to control the virus. Another proposal raised by the minister is a ""Covid score"" for businesses based on their compliance with regulations and Covid safety measures. Mr Swann said while this suggestion was dismissed as an option last year, he believes it should be revisited and has suggested the executive's Covid taskforce take on the development of such a scheme. Mr Swann has advised more enforcement is needed against those breaching Covid-19 restrictions The document also advises ensuring enforcement against those breaching existing Covid restrictions, including people who do not comply with wearing face coverings where they are legally required. Mr Swann said that since rules on mandatory face coverings in shops and public transport were introduced in summer 2020, only five fines had been issued to people for failing to follow the law. The minister added that unless enforcement was strengthened, the public would see ""compliance as unimportant and optional"". Most of the proposals in the paper are aimed at improving messaging and communication of current coronavirus advice. Mr Swann is also understood to have said in his paper that communications on public health are ""much more effective when delivered with a united voice by all executive ministers"".

"James Brown of Pulled Apart By Horses says the band have made no touring income since 2019 One-third of musicians were still earning nothing after restrictions on live events were lifted this summer, according to UK charity Help Musicians. The music industry is one of the last sectors to recover from the pandemic, it said, with 83% of professional musicians unable to find regular work. The findings are based on a survey of 929 musicians in August. Almost nine in 10 were earning less than Â£1,000 per month, and 22% were considering giving up music altogether. Restrictions on live music were removed in England and Wales in July, and Scotland in August, after Covid had kept the live music industry shut for most of the pandemic. ""A lot of venues were like, 'Well, we'll just stay shut until we can get back to full capacity again',"" Ruth Lyon of folk-rock band Holy Moly and the Crackers told BBC News. Her group went from playing 120 shows a year pre-lockdown to almost 18 months off stage. ""We had 30 festivals lined up, we had a tour booked at the end of last year and we had shows pretty much every single weekend - and that all just fell apart within a few days."" Covid-19: Impact on music industry revealed Musicians' coronavirus fund runs out of cash Lyon said her earnings fell by more than 75% in 2020. Her band weren't able to resume shows until last month because she has an immunosuppressant condition that puts her at high risk of infection. ""I couldn't be in a position where I could be a guinea pig,"" she explained. ""We had to wait until it was safe for me and I was cleared by my medical team to go back out."" Holy Moly and the Crackers saw their income drop by more than 75% during the pandemic, and it still hasn't recovered James Brown, guitarist with Leeds-based rock band Pulled Apart By Horses, said their earnings ""nosedived"" last year - and royalties from streaming services and radio airplay could not make up the shortfall. ""It takes time for royalties to come through,"" he explained. ""They can take months, if not years. So the backlog for musicians of being able to earn a good stable salary from music has slowed down to a halt."" Unable to tour, Brown took work as a composer for film and TV soundtracks, but still found himself unable to make ends meet. He ended up asking Help Musicians for support, both financially and for his mental health. ""To go from 10 years of performing live to suddenly hitting this brick wall, where you were told it's not happening anymore - it's devastating,"" he said. Help Musicians said it had seen a 60% increase in people getting in contact for mental health support, with one in eight saying they were experiencing a mental health problem that was preventing them from returning to work. During the pandemic, the charity distributed Â£18m to 19,000 struggling musicians. ""We recognise that for some musicians, it will take a long time to rebuild and the team at Help Musicians will continue to be available to those musicians who find themselves in real crisis over the months ahead,"" chief executive James Ainscough said. Concerts and festivals are starting to return, although most major tours have been pushed back to spring 2022 Even getting back into the swing of playing concerts can be a challenge, as Pulled Apart By Horses discovered this summer. ""We did actually play one festival that didn't get cancelled in August, and it was so bizarre,"" said Brown. ""After having all that time off not being around people and then being thrown straight in at the deep end, it was just like, 'What is going on?' It was kind of terrifying."" Speaking about her return to performing, Lyon, said: ""I've loved it, but it's been different. ""Usually, I'd get carried off stage and be straight onto the merch stall, hugging people and taking selfies - but I'm still trying to keep my distance a bit, so I've really missed that aspect of it."" Even so, she said getting back on stage had been beneficial to her mental health. ""Performance is a huge part of who I am, and it makes me feel quite powerful,"" she said. ""Having that taken away for almost two years was kind of crazy - so getting back to it has been a big boost."" Lyon added that, if there's one silver lining to the dire circumstances musicians have faced in the last two years, it's that they're more willing to seek help. ""So many of my friends never even thought about getting counselling or going to therapy before this - and now everybody's talking about it. So in a way that's a good thing,"" she said. ""Reach out if you need to, don't be ashamed. We're all struggling."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"More than 90% of Black Friday deals were the same price or cheaper in the six months before the sales event last year, a Which? investigation has found. The consumer association told shoppers to make sure the discounts were ""truly genuine"" ahead of this year's sales. It said 184 out of 201 items from six retailers, which included Amazon and John Lewis, were priced the same or cheaper before Black Friday in 2020. Trading standards warned a deal ""may not be what it's all cracked up to be"". Katherine Hart, lead officer at the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, added the ""prospect of scams rears its ugly head"" during the sales event, which takes place on Friday. ""It seems that the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales events get bigger every year, and many bargains can be found; however, we all must remain vigilant and practise shopping safety,"" she added. ""Sometimes sellers raise their prices before a sales period to make it look like a great deal is on offer during the sale."" Which? said popular items it found to be the same price or less before Black Friday last year included washing machines, soundbars and TVs. It analysed items from Amazon, AO, Argos, Currys, John Lewis and Richer Sounds by looking at the prices offered by the companies every day during the six months before and after 2020's Black Friday, as well as on the day itself. ""When looking at prices six months before and after Black Friday 2020, just one of the 201 products was at its cheapest price on Black Friday alone,"" the consumer champion said. One of the ""worst individual deals"", it added, was a Zanussi washing machine at John Lewis that was cheaper than its Black Friday price on 88 different days before the day itself. ""'Discounted' to Â£309 on Black Friday, customers could have bought it Â£60 cheaper at Â£249 five months before and for Â£289 within just a month after,"" Which? said. Richer Sounds had the highest proportion of deals with four out of 14, that were not cheaper or the same price before Black Friday. Ele Clark, Which? retail editor, said it was important shoppers did research before diving into the sales. ""Take time to identify the products you really want and check that the 'deal' you're seeing represents a genuine saving,"" she said. In response to Which?'s investigation, Amazon said it sought to ""offer our customers great value thanks to low prices all year round"" and that customers could ""easily compare prices, allowing them to make an informed purchase decision"". Meanwhile, John Lewis said it monitored prices all year round and match high street competitors as part of its ""never knowingly undersold"" policy. It explained a portable music speaker advertised on last year's Black Friday was the same price between 20 November 2020 to 12 January 2021 as ""those days were actually all part of the Black Friday promotional activity"". Richer Sounds admitted a Yamaha music speaker, which was priced in last year's promotion at Â£159 with an RRP of Â£199, had actually been that price or less on 277 other days and hadn't been for sale at its full price at the store since 2018. Richer Sounds said the deal was a ""mistake"" and apologised to any customers who were misled by it.
