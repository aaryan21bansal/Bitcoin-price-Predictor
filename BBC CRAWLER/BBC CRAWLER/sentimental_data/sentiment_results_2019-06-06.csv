"Grammy-winning American singer Dr John has died at the age of 77 after suffering a heart attack. The New Orleans-born musician died on Thursday, according to a message posted on his official Twitter account. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame singer combined the genres of blues, pop, jazz, boogie woogie and rock and roll. A statement said: ""Towards the break of day June 6, iconic music legend Malcolm John Rebennack, Jr, known as Dr John, passed away of a heart attack."" The musician ""created a unique blend of music which carried his hometown, New Orleans, at its heart, as it was always in his heart,"" it continued. ""The family thanks all whom shared his unique musical journey & requests privacy at this time. Memorial arrangements will be announced in due course."" Allow Twitter content?

Former Beatles drummerRingo Starr also tweeted a picture,,externalalong with the message: ""God bless Dr John, peace and love to all his family. I love the doctor, peace and love."" His career started in the late 1950s, when he became prominent as a pianist and singer on the New Orleans music scene. Born Malcolm John Rebennack in New Orleans, his love of music was fostered by his father, who ran an appliance store that also sold records. His mother, meanwhile, had worked as a model, and thanks to her connections, Malcolm's face appeared on boxes of Ivory Soap. Despite being kicked out of the church choir, he pursued his love of music, attending local clubs and working at a studio in town during his teens. His first love was the guitar, but he had to switch to piano after being shot while trying to defend a bandmate who was being pistol-whipped in 1960. ""Ronnie was just a kid and his mother had told me 'You better look out for my son,'"" he told Smithsonian.com in 2009. ""Oh God, that was all I was thinking about. I tried to stop the guy, I had my hand over the barrel and he shot."" He later became part of the famed ""Wrecking Crew"" - a group of LA backing musicians who played on hits by Aretha Franklin, Van Morrison, Cher Frank Zappa and countless others. The Dr John character, modelled on a voodoo priest, was created in the late 1960s. Rebennack initially wanted another singer to play the role, but when they pulled out at the last minute, ""I just did it myself out of spite,"" he said. ""I never thought I would be doing another record. I never wanted to be a frontman. All of a sudden, I got into it, and it wasn't as bad as I thought."" Blending New Orleans jazz, blues and psychedelia, he gained recognition with the release of his album Gris-Gris in 1968; and scored a US top 10 hit in 1973 with Right Time, Wrong Place. Dr John performing at the Grammy Awards in 2013 His live shows were known for their carnival atmosphere and he would wear costumes of bright colours, feathers and plumes, and scatter glitter on the audience. The musician, who successfully battled heroin addiction, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend in 2011; and won his most recent Grammy in 2012 when Locked Down was named best blues album. That album touched on drugs, his time in prison - he got a two-year sentence for drug charges in the mid-60s - and efforts to repair his relationship with his children. He was married twice and toldthe New York Times,externalhe had ""a lot"" of children. Blues guru Dr John on voodoo rock.

"This video can not be played ""South Wales is going to be like a ghost town"" Ford's engine plant in Bridgend is set to close in autumn 2020, with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Union officials were told of the plans at a meeting with Ford bosses which include the offer of redeployment. Workers were sent home after receiving a letter which said they will lose their jobs in phases by 25 September next year. Ford blamed ""changing customer demand and cost"" for the closure plans and denied Brexit was a factor. In a statement, Ford of Europe president Stuart Rowley said creating a sustainable business required the company to make ""difficult decisions"", including the need to make its engine manufacturing base suitable for the vehicles it produces in the future. ""We are committed to the UK. However, changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead."" Later, he said the decision was nothing to do with Brexit although he realised the company's plans would be ""very significant for the employees, their families and the community in south Wales"". As it happened: Bridgend reacts to Ford closure plans Political reaction: 'Workers deserve better' Bridgend 'hanging on by its fingernails' Mr Rowley has confirmed the company will repay Â£11m in incentives offered by the Welsh Government. Economy minister Ken Skates said he was ""absolutely livid"" at Ford's decision to ""turn their back on Bridgend"". ""We pumped a huge amount of money into this facility and we expected more from Ford."" He toldGareth Lewis on BBC Radio Walesthat he was working with the chemicals company Ineos and others ""who would like to come to this area"". He added the site is ""a priority"" for any inward investment. This video can not be played The story of Ford in Bridgend Workers at the plant said they were devastated. ""I'm expecting to lose my job,"" said Tony Phillips, who has been at the plant for 31 years, adding that they were ""good, well-paid jobs"". Fellow worker Mark Lendrum said: ""South Wales is going to be like a ghost town."" Leader of Bridgend council Huw David, said there is ""not a family in Bridgend that won't be affected by this"" and it is a ""fabulous workforce"" from Newport to Llanelli. ""We don't know how we are going to recover from this. ""Both governments want to keep the jobs here. We as the council will help people to find other work,"" he said. Graham Rees is one of the 1,700 workers at the Bridgend plant Graham Rees has worked at Ford in Bridgend for 35 years. ""You see work come and go, when an engine dies off, there's a replacement, but this time, what do you do? ""It doesn't matter what you're building, if people don't want to buy it, it's at the end at its life, full stop,"" he said. ""You get a feeling that yes, the end is nigh, but nobody wants to admit that, so you prepare yourself and get on with it. ""There is no light at the end of the tunnel, you've just got to face the truth."" The closure news comes just months after Ford said it wascutting its Welsh workforce by 1,000, with 370 going in a first phase. Investment in a new petrol engine, called Dragon, was scaled back, while production of an engine for Jaguar Land Rover is due to end this year. Ford Bridgend loses out in global race Electric cars hope for Bridgend Just days ago, it was revealed thatcar sales in the UK had fallen again. GMB regional organiser Jeff Beck said: ""We're hugely shocked by today's announcement. It's a real hammer blow for the Welsh economy and the community in Bridgend."" He said the union would continue to work with Ford, other unions and the Welsh Government ""to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news"". Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said Ford had treated its UK workers ""abysmally"". ""The fact remains that it is cheaper, easier and quicker to sack our workers than those in our competitor countries,"" he said, vowing to ""resist this closure with all our might"". Ford chose Bridgend for its new engine plant in the summer of 1977 after competition from elsewhere in Europe, chiefly from Ireland. The company needed an engine for its new model - code-named Erika - which became the next generation Ford Escort. It was to be built at Halewood on Merseyside and at Saarlouis in Germany from 1980. The promise had been for 2,500 jobs but by the time it opened in May 1980, Ford had decided to take on only 1,400 workers. There were 22,000 people applying for the roles. Concerns about the plant's long term futurewere raised more than a decade ago when the decision was taken to no longer have Ford UK and Ford Europe making different designs of cars compared with the USA and rest of the world. The mark III Ford Escort - which was nearly called the Ford Erika after its development name Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he knew it was an ""extremely worrying and uncertain time for Ford workers, their families in Bridgend and the surrounding communities"". ""The UK government will work closely with Ford, the trade unions and the Welsh Government, to make sure this highly-valued workforce can move into new skilled employment."" Earlier, Mr Cairns told BBC Wales he had been in touch with Ken Skates about exploring the production of electric vehicles as a means of protecting jobs in the Bridgend area. Mr Cairns said the UK government and Welsh Government ""have already been working on potential investors"" but ""clearly there is a lot more work"". He added that ""the Brexit issue doesn't stand up"" in being a part of Ford's decision. But Bridgend Labour MP Madeleine Moon said she believed it was ""very clearly about Brexit"". ""The knock-on effect to the south Wales economy is huge - there are 12,000 associated jobs. ""The map has just been rubbed out,"" she said. This video can not be played Bridgend MP Madeleine Moon said she was ""very emotional"" over the closure plan Mr Skates said the Welsh Government would provide a ""rapid response taskforce to support workers"". Since 1978 about Â£140m in taxpayers' money has been invested in the plant, Mr Skates said. That had been ""money well spent"" since the plant had ""pumped back"" Â£3bn into the Bridgend economy over the last 10 years alone, Mr Skates said. ""What we have repeatedly said to Ford over recent months and years is that Wales stands ready, it is perfectly situated and positioned to help businesses."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the news was ""incredibly sad"", and pledged the Welsh Government would do ""everything in its power"" to support those affected and to ""work with all partners to explore options for the future of the plant"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said closure would be ""one of the most bitter blows"" to the Welsh economy for more than 30 years. ""The implications of this in terms of the supply chain in terms of job losses is very, very grave indeed,"" he added.

This is down to acombination of different reasons. The car industry troubles have been blamed in part, ""because the trade future is uncertain with Brexit,"" according to consultant Anna-Marie Baisden.

He also said it highlighted the limits of the Welsh Government's ""inward investment strategy"". It's the Brexit equivalent of a Rorschach test - you can interpret the inkblot or decision in different ways. Those who want to see us stay in the EU see Brexit as a factor in Ford Bridgend's closure, whilst Brexiteers point the finger of blame at the wider pressures bearing down on the automotive industry - from a shift to electric cars to falling demand from China. Ford announced back in December that it was restructuring its operations right across Europe. As part of that change, a plant in Bordeaux in France is to be closed and thousands of jobs cut in Germany. Brexit, obviously, was not a factor in those decisions. Given that context, here in Wales and the UK, the additional issue of Brexit and the ongoing uncertainty over what kind of economic relationship we'll have with EU's single market doesn't help matters. Nissan, when it announced its decision to move production from Sunderland to Japan, said Brexit uncertainty is not helping them ""plan for the future"" whilst Honda said that its plant closure in Swindon wasn't related to our departure from the EU.

"This video can not be played Peterborough chooses ""hope over fear"" - Jeremy Corbyn Labour has narrowly seen off a Brexit Party challenge to hold on to its Peterborough seat in a by-election. Union activist Lisa Forbes retained the constituency for Labour, taking 31% of the vote and beating the Brexit Party's Mike Greene (29%) by 683 votes. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called it an ""incredible"" win for the ""politics of hope over the politics of fear"". But Nigel Farage, who founded the Brexit Party less than two months ago, called its showing ""very significant"". The Conservatives came third with 21%, while the Liberal Democrats were fourth with 12%, followed by the Green Party on 3%. Fifteen candidates stood Turnout was 48.4%, down from 67.5% in the 2017 general election, when Labour beat the Tories by 607 votes Voters in Peterborough backed Leave by 61% to 39% in the 2016 EU referendum Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Tory big guns Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt visited the city during the hard-fought campaign Theresa May, who will officially resign as Conservative leader later, did not visit the constituency The Peterborough by-election was called after Fiona Onasanya - who won for Labour in 2017 but was convicted of lying over a speeding offence and thrown out of the party - became the first MP to be ousted under recall rules. In her victory speech, Ms Forbes said, to cheers from her supporters, that ""the politics of hope can win regardless of the odds"". ""Despite the differing opinions across our city, the fact that the Brexit Party have been rejected here in Peterborough shows that the politics of division will not win,"" she said. The Brexit Party had been the bookmakers' favourite to take the Cambridgeshire seat - which would have been its first at Westminster - following its success in the recent European elections. This video can not be played ""I'm pleased the Brexit Party didn't win"" The Labour leader challenged the next Tory leader to call an immediate general election Joining Labour's victory celebrations on a visit to the city, Mr Corbyn said: ""All the experts wrote Lisa Forbes off. All the experts wrote Labour off. Write Labour off at your peril."" The Labour leader said the party had triumphed due to its anti-austerity message and its opposition to a ""cliff-edge"" no-deal Brexit that would threaten jobs and investment. He challenged whoever succeeds Theresa May as Conservative leader to call an immediate general election. Despite the Brexit Party's failure to take the seat, leader Mr Farage said he was ""pretty buoyed"", as it had ""come from nowhere and produced a massive result"". He rejected claims that its focus on a single issue limited its appeal, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme we have a ""very strong, simple message that people believe in"". Mr Farage later handed in a letter to Downing Street calling for his party's MEPs to be included in the UK's Brexit negotiating team. He told reporters he believed the NHS should be included in future US trade negotiations despite the political outcry when Donald Trump raised the possibility earlier this week - comments which the US president subsequently appeared to row back on. The Brexit Party has made a huge impression - but history is written by the winners. Had Nigel Farage's party actually won this narrowly, he would have had much more momentum to argue not just to get Brexit done by the end of October, but to have huge influence potentially over how the Conservatives choose their leader. Had Labour lost narrowly, there would have been a big demand from the rank and file for Jeremy Corbyn to sharpen his Brexit act and to call for a referendum under all circumstances. That has not happened either. The conclusion that the Labour leadership is drawing from this is that people actually wanted to talk about things other than Brexit. By talking about council cuts, crime, and education, they managed not to fight on the same territory as their opponents and were able to carve out their own distinctive message, get out their core vote and sneak over the line. Conservative leadership candidate Boris Johnson tweeted his ""commiserations"" to Tory candidate Paul Bristow, who, he said, ""did not deserve to come third"", while fellow contenders Dominic Raab, Matt Hancock and Jeremy Hunt said the result showed the threat from Labour. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the ""clear message"" from its poor performance in Peterborough as well as in recent council and European elections was the public wanted the government to deliver on the Brexit referendum result.

But he added that the combined results had been ""enough to disturb the regular rhythms of two-party politics"". Ms Forbes caused controversy during the campaign when she liked a social media post which said Theresa May had a ""Zionist slave masters agenda"". Labour said she had liked a video expressing solidarity with the victims of March's terror attacks on mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch ""without reading the accompanying text, which Facebook users know is an easy thing to do"". ""She has fully accounted for this genuine mistake and apologised,"" a party source said. But the Jewish Labour Movement called for Ms Forbes to have the Labour whip suspended, meaning she would have to sit in the Commons as an independent MP. Meanwhile, Labour Against Antisemitism asked for her to be suspended from the party, calling her election a ""dark day"" for Labour. New MP hails 'significant' win.

"Khuram Butt booked a trip to Turkey, but his wife told an inquest she feared he would go on to Syria The widow of one of the London Bridge attackers is ""not going to grieve"" his death, she has told an inquest. Khuram Butt and two other men were shot dead by police after they killed eight people in a 10-minute attack. Butt's wife, Zahrah Rehman, told the Old Bailey his actions were ""disgusting"" and their children would never know where his grave was. She denied prior knowledge of her husband's plot but said she had been worried he wanted to go to Syria. When Butt booked a holiday to Turkey in 2015, Ms Rehman refused to go because she feared he would take their son on to the war-torn country, she said. She told her family about her concerns and they took both Butt's and the child's passports away. Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge with a rented van before stabbing people in nearby Borough Market. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack On the day of the attack, Ms Rehman said Butt had a lie-in until 11:00 BST and did not kiss his children goodbye when he left. Armed police stormed Butt's home at about 08:00 BST the following day and arrested Ms Rehman. She broke down in court as she described her shock at finding out what her husband had done. ""I could not register it that I was living with him and he was in the same house as me and my kids,"" she said. ""We were living together. But it was almost as if we were living different lives. ""I knew it was a possibility that he wanted to go to Syriaâ¦ but he never told me that he hates this country and wanted to attack this country."" The victims of the London Bridge attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Ms Rehman said she did not observe the traditional period of mourning for her husband after his death or attend his funeral. In the aftermath of the attack, she said she laid flower tributes to the victims on London Bridge. ""My kids will never know where his grave is but I was there mourning with the rest of London on that bridge,"" she said. She told how she still cannot look at photographs of Butt's victims. By Keiligh Baker, BBC News, at the Old Bailey Ms Rehman gave evidence from behind a screen, but the court could hear emotion in her voice as she described her horror at her husband's actions. She began sobbing as she told the court how some people had shunned her in the two years since the horrific events of 3 June 2017. ""People say: 'She's the wife, she had to have known',"" she said. ""But believe me - I did not know."" The inquest was shown two pictures of the small flat she shared with Butt and their two children. Piles of brightly coloured children's toys and a framed wooden heart on the wall made it an incongruous setting for an extremist to plan a murderous attack. Ms Rehman said her family was originally from Pakistan, but she was born and brought up in the UK. When she first met Butt through family connections she said he was ""really confident"", ""charismatic"", and ""quite light-hearted"". They had an arranged marriage on Christmas Day, 2013. ""We were just a normal Muslim family,"" she said. London Bridge attacker 'energised' by Choudary Attackers 'used knives from Lidl' Bullet 'centimetres' from London Bridge witness But she said her husband was quite strict and would get ""angry"" with his sister if she came to visit without wearing a headscarf. And her brother had encouraged Butt to stop partying, drinking alcohol and smoking weed. Butt had been upset about the plight of the Syrian people under President Bashar al-Assad, Ms Rehman told the court. The room was shown a video of Ms Rehman and Butt on their honeymoon in Pakistan, during which Butt was heard saying, ""Dawlat al-Islamiyah"" - another name for the Islamic State group. Ms Rehman said she did not know what her husband was saying as she did not understand Arabic. In a second video, filmed on a plane, the couple joke about naming airports after extremists. Ms Rehman suggests calling a London airport after Abu Luqman, an alias of radical preacherAnjem Choudary. She said he was the first extremist she thought of and it was ""just a stupid joke"". By 2015, Ms Rehman said she was aware her husband sometimes met Choudary. She told Butt he should not associate with the preacher, but ""he wouldn't listen"". She was not allowed to be in the same room as men, so would go into the bedroom when Butt's friends came to the flat. ""I was usually on my laptop... watching my filmsâ¦ I wouldn't be paying attention to what they were talking about,"" she said. Ms Rehman was told that by mid-2015 MI5 had intelligence Butt might be planning an attack in the UK. But she said she was not aware of any plot. At one point, the couple had an argument when Butt suggested taking a second wife, and she left him for about a month to live with her mother. While they were separated, Channel 4 broadcast a programme featuring Butt called The Jihadis Next Door. The court previously heard how during the programme Butt condemned the UK government, particularly over its actions in Iraq and Syria. Ms Rehman told the Old Bailey: ""I was really angry at him. I was really embarrassed and ashamed at him."" The pair got back together, she said, but continued to argue. Those who died were: Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39.

"Ford confirms it plans to close its Bridgend plant next year Workers have been told of plans to close the factory on 25 September 2020 The firm have ceased production at the plant until Monday Ford denied Brexit was the reason for the planned closure The workers were told they were expected to lose their jobs in phases The plant opened in 1980 and employs 1,700 workers Catryn Jenkins, Chris Wood and Caleb Spencer And that brings us to the end of our live coverage on the announcement that Ford are set to close their plant at Bridgend with the loss of 1,700 jobs. There will be more reaction on BBC Wales news online and other BBC services. We leave you with this video of the plant's history. This video can not be played Bridgend Ford closure: End of an era There are three conclusions to be drawn from the news that Ford will close its Bridgend plant, according to Prof Karel Williams, an automotive expert from Manchester Business School:  Former leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Assembly, Andrew RT Davies reacts to Bridgend MP Madeline Moon's claim that Brexit was the reason for Ford's decision Allow Twitter content?

""There is not a family who will not be affected by the closure of the Ford plant,"" the leader of Bridgend council Huw David said following the announcement. He added that he did not know ""how we are going to recover from this"". ""We are hoping the plant can be saved,"" he said. ""Itâs a long shot
but we have a fabulous workforce here. Both governments want to keep the jobs
here. ""Itâs our single biggest private employer in Bridgend and
has a workforce from Newport to Llanelli."" âTodayâs announcement is another crushing blow for UK automotive manufacturing and, especially, the staff and their families in and around Bridgend,"" said Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chief executive Mike Hawes. ""Fordâs challenges are not unique: economic uncertainty at home and abroad, technological change and global trade issues are stressing markets and forcing companies to review operations and make difficult decisions. ""Success in this fiercely competitive global industry, however, starts at home and we hope that all efforts will be made over the coming weeks to restore confidence, bolster demand and ensure there is long term competitiveness for this crucial sector.â The Welsh Government has confirmed it will set up a task force to help workers find other jobs following Ford's announcement to close its Bridgend factory. Ford's European president Stuart Rowley
confirms the company will repay Â£11m in incentives offered by the Welsh Government.   Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Des Quinn, National Officer of Unite was in the meeting at Ford HQ in Brentwood this morning. He told the BBC News Channel that Ford had ""betrayed"" its workforce in Bridgend. ""We don't believe the plant had to close - it may have become inevitable because of the actions of the company. ""When the company talked about making the Dragon engine in the UK they talked about making 500,000 - but reduced that to 250,000 and then down to 120,000 because they've put that global platform elsewhere in low cost economies. ""The UK is an important profitable market for Ford to sell cars and we think they should be building engines here and supporting the market they rely on to make a profit. ""Unfortunately you can only judge Ford by its actions. Ford had 27 plants in the UK, we're down to five, four if this closure proposal goes through. ""It will be absolutely devastating, not just to Bridgend, it will be devastating to Wales as a country. It will be devastating to UK manufacturing because of the supply chain which goes to the four corners of the UK and wider to Europe. ""It's devastating to the communities - the local pubs and clubs and shops that will also be hit because of this. ""It's absolutely dreadful news and a betrayal of Ford workers in Bridgend. ""It's been some time in coming. ""It's been inaction from the company that's got us here. Performance was improving in the plant and we were keen to get new products in there and unfortunately the reluctance from the company to move forward with that has got us to this stage."" Professor Peter Wells, director of automotive industry
research at Cardiff University said: âUnfortunately Bridgend is caught up in the middle of the
situation Fords finds itself in. They simply have too much capacity, not enough
successful models and badly in need of restricting the whole operation across
Europe. âThe future for Bridgend workers looks relatively bleak
unless they can find new work. âThey have a fantastic track record and with the appropriate
investment they could be making other things. âBut the investment climate in general in the UK,
particularly for the automotive sector, is very poor and unless theyâve got
work, they are going to struggle.â Secretary
of State for Wales Alun Cairns said: âI fully
recognise that this an extremely worrying and uncertain time for Ford workers,
their families in Bridgend and the surrounding communities. ""The UK
Government will work closely with Ford, the trade unions and the Welsh
Government, to make sure this highly-valued workforce can move into new skilled
employment. âIn my discussions with Ford
management, they have confirmed that they will offer redeployment opportunities
to staff while colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions are standing
by to provide advice and support to others in the local area. âThe UK government remains committed to protecting and creating jobs in Wales. ""We will
do all we can to ensure that the skilled Welsh workforce continues to be a
world leader in the automotive sector through our established programmes which
are aimed at maintaining our strength and competitiveness as the nature of the
industry rapidly changes.â  ENDS  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Federation of Small Businesses Wales said it was a âdevastating
blowâ for Bridgend and the wider region, especially workers for Ford and the
supply chain. Head of external affairs Ben Cottam said: âFor 40 years,
Ford has been part of the economic landscape of Wales and has a
long-established, embedded and innovative supply chain of smaller businesses in
Wales and beyond. âUK and Welsh governments now need to move quickly and as a
priority, work with individual businesses and business organisations to gauge
the potential impact and determine what support will be needed.â He called the dynamism of the employees a âhuge asset to
Walesâ and said it âmust not be lostâ. A UK government spokesman said: âFordâs announcement today
follows earlier announcements that the company has made about its ongoing
global restructuring plans, nevertheless the news of their intention and
consultation on closing the Bridgend plant will be very worrying for the
dedicated workforce. âFord has committed
to supporting employees throughout the consultation process and beyond,
including with redeployment opportunities to other Ford sites in the
UK. ""At the same time, they have also reaffirmed their commitment to their
other sites in the UK. ""The UK government will be working closely with
Ford, local stakeholders and trade union representatives through the
consultation.â Ford Europe's president Stuart Rowley said: ""We will be sourcing Dragon engines from Mexico but
we will not move the production facility from Bridgend to Mexico."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9998574

"Neymar has denied allegations that he raped Najila Trindade in a Paris hotel A woman has appeared on Brazilian TV to go public with accusations that she was raped by star footballer Neymar. Najila Trindade, who filed a rape allegation last Friday, told SBT Brasil the incident in a Paris hotel on 15 May was ""an assault together with rape"". Neymar has denied the accusations, posting a WhatsApp message exchange to try to prove his innocence. He appeared briefly to play for Brazil on Wednesday in a game he said was the most difficult of his career. Neymar was injured after 20 minutes of the match against Qatar in Brasilia and willmiss the upcoming 2019 Copa America tournament in Brazil with a ruptured ankle ligament. Ms Trindade says she was attracted to the Paris St-Germain and Brazil forward and wanted to have sex with him. She said she was flown to Paris and put up in a hotel at Neymar's expense. Ms Trindade said she was an ""ordinary person - a model and a student of interior design"" and a ""daughter and mother"". The interviewer asked Ms Trindade whether what happened was an assault or rape, and Ms Trindade replied that it was ""an assault together with rape"". She said that when she met Neymar, he was ""aggressive, totally different than the boy that I got to know through the messages"". Ms Trindade said she was initially prepared for consensual sex but demanded the use of a condom. She alleged that Neymar refused, became aggressive again and raped her. She said she told him to stop but he refused. SBT published part of the interview on Twitter (in Portuguese). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The video footage shows an altercation purported to be between Ms Trindade and Neymar in a hotel room, reportedly filmed by Ms Trindade. The pair lie down on a bed, after which the woman stands and starts to slap the man, who defends himself with his feet. The woman says: ""I'm going to hit you, you know why. Because you beat me up yesterday"", suggesting the altercation was a second meeting. Neymar has said that he and Ms Trindade met twice. In the SBT interview, Ms Trindade said she only began to understand everything that had happened to her after the first meeting ended, and that she returned because she wanted to prove the events and ""wanted justice"".

Neymar has not commented so far on the TV interview. His father, Neymar dos Santos, was interviewed by TV Record about the hotel room footage and he said it was clearly a set-up that proved his son was innocent. In an earlier statement, Neymar's management called the accusations ""unjust"" and said the footballer had been the ""victim of an attempted extortion"". Neymar repeated the extortion accusation in a seven-minute video on his Instagram page. Speaking in Portuguese, the footballer said: ""What happened that day was a relationship between a man and a woman, within four walls, like with any couple. And the next day nothing much happened. We kept exchanging messages. She asked me for a souvenir for [her child]."" During the video, the 27-year-old showed what he claimed were a long series of WhatsApp messages with Ms Trindade, including intimate photographs of her. He said he had to make them public to ""prove that nothing really happened"". In her interview, Ms Trindade denied accusations of extortion, saying: ""I want justice, not financial compensation.""

Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro visited Neymar in hospital after the footballer's injury on Wednesday, wishing him ""a good and speedy recovery"". Mr Bolsonaro said earlier: ""He is in a difficult moment, but I believe in him."" Meanwhile. Mastercard announced that it would suspend an advertising campaign featuring Neymar. The firm said it would not use the footballer in its adverts until the situation was ""cleared up"" The lawyers who first represented Ms Trindade say her initial complaint was of ""aggression"" or ""physical violence"" by Neymar. They said they had discussed a settlement with Neymar's lawyers but that those lawyers then rejected it. The two legal teams dispute who initially asked for the meeting. Ms Trindade then filed a rape allegation in SÃ£o Paulo last Friday. Her lawyers said the allegation was ""incompatible with the strategy"" they had agreed, and they parted company with her on Saturday. She now has new representation. In her interview, Ms Trindade said of a lawyer in her first legal team: ""He didn't fully believe me. I felt he was prejudiced. He portrayed it as if I'd not been raped, that I had wanted it."" Neymar could also face investigation over publishing the images of Ms Trindade without her permission, as the act may infringe laws designed to protect privacy.

Asked about meeting Mrs May, he said: ""It couldn't have been more perfect.
""She said to me, 'you did well'."" John McOwan, 98, from Peebles in the Scottish borders, was a sergeant with the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers on D-Day. He landed on Sword Beach four days after June 6. He said: ""The Prime Minister said she was very pleased to meet me. I said that I admire her very much and she smiled. ""This whole trip has been mind-boggling. I shook hands with President Macron in Portsmouth, as well as Sheridan Smith. ""The service was very emotional. The tears were running down my face because it was so touching.""

"This video can not be played Phone footage appears to show glasses being thrown and England fans clashing with Portuguese police Fans responsible for trouble in Porto before Thursday's Nations League semi-final are ""not true England supporters"" and an ""embarrassment to the team"", the Football Association has said. Two England fans were arrested in clashes with riot police on Wednesday night and two officers were injured. Bottles were thrown at Portuguese fans in a fans' zone as supporters watched Portugal beat Switzerland 3-1. It was the second night in a row that supporters had caused trouble. A UK police chief has called their behaviour ""completely unacceptable"" and says an investigation team hopes to identify offenders when they return to UK airports. ""We have an investigation team up and running in the UK gathering footage,"" Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts, the National Police Chiefs' Council football policing lead, told BBC Radio 5 live. ""We aim to get them to court, hopefully when they get back to the airport we will identify them as we want them banned. ""Unfortunately what we see here are people, some of whom have never been brought to the attention of the police and we don't know if they'll behave like drunk yobs until they've consumed too much alcohol."" There are believed to be 15,000 England supporters in Portugal and around 500 attended Wednesday's game at Porto's Estadio do Dragao. Some fans are staying in Porto, which is 30 miles away from Guimaraes where England face the Netherlands. Portuguese police confirmed to BBC Sport: ""Two English fans were arrested in Porto due to aggressions to police officers and another was identified because of his behaviour. Two police officers were injured in the intervention."" The trouble comes a week after the FA released their 'Don't be that idiot' campaign, warning fans about anti-social and ""embarrassing behaviour"". ""The FA strongly condemns the scenes witnessed in Porto overnight,"" it said in a statement. ""Anyone responsible for these disturbances cannot be seen as true England supporters and are not welcome in football. They are an embarrassment to the team and the thousands of well-behaved fans who follow England in the right way."" The Football Supporters' Association, a national fans organisation, said it ""unreservedly condemned the anti-social behaviour and violent disorder"". Chief executive Kevin Miles said: ""This is exactly the type of incident that Football Banning Orders (FBO) were made for and we're sure the authorities will be seeking to identify perpetrators. ""While the UK police don't have powers of arrest in Portugal they can retrospectively apply for FBOs which stop these people getting into UK stadiums or following England away. ""The most galling aspect of these incidents - which most England fans didn't witness, let alone condone - is that the rest of us will all suffer as a consequence of the reputation perpetuated by this minority of idiots."" Deputy Chief Constable Roberts said Portuguese riot police were deployed in the main square of Porto against a group of England fans on Wednesday night. ""The behaviour of a small number of the England fans out here continues to tarnish the reputation of the genuine fans who are simply trying to enjoy the football,"" said Roberts. ""It is believed the fans had been throwing bottles at Portugal fans who were watching the match in the same area. ""This is the second evening in a row where disorder has occurred in Porto. Last night there were issues outside a bar, where bottles were thrown and minor damage was caused. ""The behaviour we are witnessing is incredibly disappointing and again I would point fans towards the recent video from the FA - 'Don't be that idiot'. More than 100 England fanswere arrestedin Amsterdam in March 2018, when Gareth Southgate's side played the Netherlands in a friendly. England were also threatened with disqualification from Euro 2016 but were not formally charged by Uefa, after fan trouble at the tournament. But last year's World Cup in Russia passed without any trouble. Mark Lowen, BBC News, Porto Trouble in Portugal was feared; when England played the Netherlands in Amsterdam last year, more than a hundred England fans were arrested. There were ugly scenes too in Seville last October so Portuguese police were braced for violence. In the end, last night passed off relatively calmly. But when Portugal went 1-0 up against Switzerland, a hardcore group of England fans threw beer bottles in the fan zone. The police moved in with batons, cheered by some Porto residents. This morning, Avenida da Liberdade, where the trouble flared, had been cleaned up, but some local businesses lamented the ugly scenes. Manuel Alvos, serving in a cafÃ© where England fans were drinking beer from late morning, told me the behaviour was shameful. ""They're fine until they start with alcohol"", he said. ""Portugal is a calm country. It's bad for tourism when this happens - and bad for football."" As rain began to beat down, the bars along Porto's Douro river largely emptied of England fans - many of them taking the short train ride to where tonight's match will take place: Guimaraes, the picturesque town that was once the capital of Portugal after its independence in the 12th Century. The FA has called last night's scenes ""an embarrassment"" and many of the 18,000 England fans here will share that sentiment. Once again, the behaviour of a few has tarnished the image of English football.

"The chancellor has warned Theresa May that reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 could cost the UK more than Â£1tn. The Financial Times reports that the PM wants to introduce the legislation to Parliament next week as ""one of her most important legacies"". Philip Hammond has written to her, saying it would mean less money for schools, police and hospitals. The Committee on Climate Change recommended the target in May. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said next week would see the first stage in the process of making this new target law - but any legislation would ""have to wait until after Mrs May and after Brexit, so it could still be some time off"". 'How can I help fight climate change?' Scientists call for zero emissions law Climate change: What do all the terms mean? Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, criticised his opposite number, saying: ""We are facing a climate emergency and Philip Hammond clearly doesn't get it. ""The Tory party is way overdue in adopting a target already put forward by Labour, and now the chancellor is creating obstacles to prevent the action we desperately need to take."" A No 10 spokeswoman said there were ""a lot of figures out there on this issue that don't factor in the benefits or consider the costs of not doing this"". She added: ""The costs relating to meeting this target are whole-of-economy costs, not a fiscal cost, and so it's not really right to frame it as a trade-off for public spending."" The CCC, which is the independent adviser to government on climate change, put the cost at Â£50bn a year. It said, while the UK would not be able to hit ""net zero"" emissions any sooner, 2050 was still an extremely significant goal. According to the letter,seen by the FT,external, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy believes it will cost more, estimating Â£70bn a year. Mr Hammond said: ""On the basis of these estimates, the total cost of transitioning to a zero-carbon economy is likely to be well in excess of Â£1tn."" The chancellor also warned the move could leave some industries ""economically uncompetitive"" - unless other countries the UK competes with follow suit. He said it was right for the UK to lead when it came to climate change, but the implications of pursuing the target needed to be ""better understood"". Analysis by BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith Philip Hammond is not opposed to ambitious energy targets, but it's clear he's worried about the cost - not just the financial cost, but also the potential political cost. And in Mr Hammond's view, there are hard choices to be made. Encouraging consumers to change their habits and household appliances - like boilers - will come at a hefty price in terms of possible subsidies or tax incentives, and that will mean less cash for public services. There could also be a significant additional cost for business, particularly small firms, all of which is likely to prove politically fraught. Of course, Mr Hammond won't be around to feel the political heat when these changes are introduced, but it's clear he thinks his successors at the Treasury need to start doing some serious work on the numbers. Next week will be the first stage in the process when the government announces its intention to press ahead with the net zero target. However, any legislation will have to wait until after Mrs May and after Brexit, so it could still be some time off. Former Energy Secretary, and Liberal Democrat leadership contender, Ed Davey said it was time to act on climate change. ""[Mr] Hammond might be trying to reclaim his crown as a fiscal hawk in the dying embers of [Mrs] May's premiership, but this intervention is wrong-headed and threatens our children's future,"" he said. ""The cost of tackling the climate emergency is massively outweighed by the long term cost of not acting. The chancellor has got his sums wrong."" The government's current target is to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050. Mr Hammond said the UK was not on track to reach that goal, so to go further would need an ""ambitious policy response"". Analysis by BBC science editor David Shukman The tussle over whether Britain should set a carbon target of net zero is being watched closely far beyond these shores. For months, the government has been campaigning to host what is set to be the most important climate summit for years - a vast event known as COP26, due to be staged in December 2020. The conference will have the pivotal role of formally putting the Paris Agreement into effect - the world's only international accord designed to limit global warming. The thinking in Whitehall is that for post-Brexit Britain, hosting this monumental gathering would send a powerful and positive signal, and several Tory leadership candidates have highlighted their support for the move. But other countries want the prize too, with Italy offering to play host, and Belgium and Turkey throwing their hats into the ring. The decision is due to be made on 27 June at talks in Bonn, and live coverage around that time of the Conservative leadership process may be seen as a sign of uncertainty in London. Setting a net-zero carbon target might tip the balance. There's a lot at stake. The CCC said England can eliminate emissions by 2050, while Scotland could go carbon-free sooner -by 2045. Wales can onlycut 95% of its emissions by 2050because of its farm industry, andNorthern Ireland will follow England's targets. The BBC's environment analyst, Roger Harrabin, said Scotland had exceptional potential for planting trees (which absorb carbon dioxide) and is more suited for carbon capture and storage. A No 10 spokesman said the government was committed to legislating to net zero and was responsible for commissioning the CCC's report. He said it ""strongly welcomed the recommendations"" from the committee and it ""remains our intention to make announcement on next steps as soon as we can"". By BBC Reality Check's Anthony Reuben The Committee on Climate Change puts the cost of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at between 1% and 2% of GDP - the total output of the UK economy - a year. GDP is currently about Â£2tn a year, so, at the moment, that amount would be between Â£20bn and Â£40bn. Remember, this isn't all government spending - things like transport and power generation could get more expensive, which would increase bills. The CCC reckons the cost will be about Â£50bn a year in 2050, but will be less in the early years of the transition. Still, you can see how those figures could reach a total of Â£1tn over 30 years. The letter also refers to a figure of Â£70bn a year from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy - although the department has declined to comment on whether it has actually come up with that figure. But these figures are only covering the cost - they do not include any possible benefits, creating new jobs in new industries, for example. Although many environment groups are supportive of the move, many campaigners have complained the CCC target is too soft. The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change has called on the government to adopt the recommendations, but ""adopt a net-zero target before 2050"". And Extinction Rebellion -the group which protested in and shut down parts of London in April- wants the government to hit the net zero target by 2025. Dr Doug Parr, Chief Scientist for Greenpeace UK, said Mr Hammond was putting ""ideology before our wellbeing"". He added: ""If you want to know whether a policy is a good idea, you include the benefits as well as the costs, and in this case the benefits include an economy fit for the 21st century, cleaner air, warmer homes and maximising the chances of civilisation surviving.""

"Neil Woodford has apologised to investors for the situation People with pensions and savings invested in Neil Woodford's now suspended flagship fund have expressed concern over how it was promoted. Mr Woodford - one of the UK's most high-profile stockpickers - stopped money going in or out of his Woodford Equity Income Fundearlier in the weekafter increasing numbers of investors asked for their money back. Some of those investors would include pension funds, responsible for people's life savings. Thousands of individuals also chose the fund for their self-invested pensions or Individual Savings Accounts (Isas), often through fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown. The platform has been a cheerleader for Mr Woodford, but some say that went on for too long. Hargreaves Lansdown's share price has taken a heavy hit since Tuesday's announcement, falling another 6% on Wednesday. What went wrong for Woodford and why it matters Stockpicker Neil Woodford apologises for suspending fund Many smaller investors are also questioning whether there were sufficient warnings about the possibility of being locked out of their investment. Gus Harris-Reid, 32, has about Â£6,000 stuck in the suspended fund. ""If it was business as usual, I would not be concerned. Now, I may take some or all of it out and invest elsewhere when I can,"" the mechanical engineer from Edinburgh says. ""The bad publicity may mean a drop in value, though."" Gus Harris-Reid says his faith has been shaken He says that all fund managers can suffer a bad year at any time and investors should be prepared for that. However, the suspension meant this was a different grade of seriousness. ""The fact it had to be blocked is concerning,"" he says. ""It has shaken my faith."" Another 32-year-old, Robert Taylor, from London, says he was unaware that a fund could be locked up like this. ""It was not made clear that this could happen. It is frustrating,"" he says. Robert Taylor is now not so pleased the fund has been suspended He says there is likely to be a ""mad rush"" of people withdrawing when the fund reopens, although this simply risked realising a loss. ""I have an Isa regular saver and switched my portfolio to stop investing in Woodford around six months ago. I didn't sell my stake at the time as I presumed he'd eventually turn it around. This doesn't look to be the case and now I can't change my mind,"" he says. Former pensions minister Ros Altmann told the BBC that regulators needed to look at the risk warnings given to investors in general, as it should be made clear that in some circumstances, people would not be able to get money out. Paul Adams, from Birmingham, says that he sold his stake in the fund ""at a heavy loss"" just two weeks before the suspension. ""I invested in three of his funds due to his reputation. However, over the years I have seen my investments fall by as much as 33%,"" he says. ""I have never made any money out of Woodford."" Paul Adams believes Mr Woodford's reputation has taken a hit He says that fund managers' reputations can take years to build up, but were quick to fall - and the value was ""nosediving"". He says he was ""bemused"" as to why Hargreaves Lansdown continued to promote the fund as one of its favourites, in its Wealth 50 list. Mr Woodford's funds were only removed from the chart on Monday. Stuart Evans says that he was already an investor using the Hargreaves Lansdown platform, and studied the Wealth 50 list for ideas for long-term investments to help pay for his grandchildren's further education in the future. ""As a result, I felt it was a reasonably sound investment,"" the 68-year-old says. ""I was looking for something that would not let me down and would grow steadily over the years."" Stuart Evans based his investment on the Wealth 50 list At its launch of the Woodford fund, a research director at Hargreaves said that Mr Woodford ""was one of the finest fund managers of his generation"" and he intended to invest in the fund, as did his wife. There are 1.2 million people on the platform and it continued to promote the fund when it saw a significant downturn. ""We are advocates of long-term investing and think Woodford's multi-decade track record remains compelling - but we don't underestimate the disappointment investors must feel with Woodford's recent performance,"" Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, told the BBC. On Monday, it dropped the Woodford funds off its favourite list. On Wednesday, it bowed to pressure to drop its management fee for Woodford investors. It is not the only platform which promoted Woodford funds as an investment. Another - St James's Place - moved away from Woodford funds on Wednesday.

The UK Health Alliance on Climate Change has called on the government to adopt the recommendations, but ""adopt a net-zero target before 2050"". And Extinction Rebellion -the group which protested in and shut down parts of London in April- wants the government to hit the net zero target by 2025. Dr Doug Parr, Chief Scientist for Greenpeace UK, said Mr Hammond was putting ""ideology before our wellbeing"". He added: ""If you want to know whether a policy is a good idea, you include the benefits as well as the costs, and in this case the benefits include an economy fit for the 21st century, cleaner air, warmer homes and maximising the chances of civilisation surviving.""

"Khuram Butt booked a trip to Turkey, but his wife told an inquest she feared he would go on to Syria The widow of one of the London Bridge attackers is ""not going to grieve"" his death, she has told an inquest. Khuram Butt and two other men were shot dead by police after they killed eight people in a 10-minute attack. Butt's wife, Zahrah Rehman, told the Old Bailey his actions were ""disgusting"" and their children would never know where his grave was. She denied prior knowledge of her husband's plot but said she had been worried he wanted to go to Syria. When Butt booked a holiday to Turkey in 2015, Ms Rehman refused to go because she feared he would take their son on to the war-torn country, she said. She told her family about her concerns and they took both Butt's and the child's passports away. Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge with a rented van before stabbing people in nearby Borough Market. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack On the day of the attack, Ms Rehman said Butt had a lie-in until 11:00 BST and did not kiss his children goodbye when he left. Armed police stormed Butt's home at about 08:00 BST the following day and arrested Ms Rehman. She broke down in court as she described her shock at finding out what her husband had done. ""I could not register it that I was living with him and he was in the same house as me and my kids,"" she said. ""We were living together. But it was almost as if we were living different lives. ""I knew it was a possibility that he wanted to go to Syriaâ¦ but he never told me that he hates this country and wanted to attack this country."" The victims of the London Bridge attack clockwise from top left - Chrissy Archibald, James McMullan, Alexandre Pigeard, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Xavier Thomas, Sara Zelenak, Kirsty Boden Ms Rehman said she did not observe the traditional period of mourning for her husband after his death or attend his funeral. In the aftermath of the attack, she said she laid flower tributes to the victims on London Bridge. ""My kids will never know where his grave is but I was there mourning with the rest of London on that bridge,"" she said. She told how she still cannot look at photographs of Butt's victims. By Keiligh Baker, BBC News, at the Old Bailey Ms Rehman gave evidence from behind a screen, but the court could hear emotion in her voice as she described her horror at her husband's actions. She began sobbing as she told the court how some people had shunned her in the two years since the horrific events of 3 June 2017. ""People say: 'She's the wife, she had to have known',"" she said. ""But believe me - I did not know."" The inquest was shown two pictures of the small flat she shared with Butt and their two children. Piles of brightly coloured children's toys and a framed wooden heart on the wall made it an incongruous setting for an extremist to plan a murderous attack. Ms Rehman said her family was originally from Pakistan, but she was born and brought up in the UK. When she first met Butt through family connections she said he was ""really confident"", ""charismatic"", and ""quite light-hearted"". They had an arranged marriage on Christmas Day, 2013. ""We were just a normal Muslim family,"" she said. London Bridge attacker 'energised' by Choudary Attackers 'used knives from Lidl' Bullet 'centimetres' from London Bridge witness But she said her husband was quite strict and would get ""angry"" with his sister if she came to visit without wearing a headscarf. And her brother had encouraged Butt to stop partying, drinking alcohol and smoking weed. Butt had been upset about the plight of the Syrian people under President Bashar al-Assad, Ms Rehman told the court. The room was shown a video of Ms Rehman and Butt on their honeymoon in Pakistan, during which Butt was heard saying, ""Dawlat al-Islamiyah"" - another name for the Islamic State group. Ms Rehman said she did not know what her husband was saying as she did not understand Arabic. In a second video, filmed on a plane, the couple joke about naming airports after extremists. Ms Rehman suggests calling a London airport after Abu Luqman, an alias of radical preacherAnjem Choudary. She said he was the first extremist she thought of and it was ""just a stupid joke"". By 2015, Ms Rehman said she was aware her husband sometimes met Choudary. She told Butt he should not associate with the preacher, but ""he wouldn't listen"". She was not allowed to be in the same room as men, so would go into the bedroom when Butt's friends came to the flat. ""I was usually on my laptop... watching my filmsâ¦ I wouldn't be paying attention to what they were talking about,"" she said. Ms Rehman was told that by mid-2015 MI5 had intelligence Butt might be planning an attack in the UK. But she said she was not aware of any plot. At one point, the couple had an argument when Butt suggested taking a second wife, and she left him for about a month to live with her mother. While they were separated, Channel 4 broadcast a programme featuring Butt called The Jihadis Next Door. The court previously heard how during the programme Butt condemned the UK government, particularly over its actions in Iraq and Syria. Ms Rehman told the Old Bailey: ""I was really angry at him. I was really embarrassed and ashamed at him."" The pair got back together, she said, but continued to argue. Those who died were: Xavier Thomas, 45, Christine Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, SÃ©bastien BÃ©langer, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39.

"Current systems require people to remove liquids and laptops from their bags Passengers at Heathrow airport will be able to keep their liquids and laptops inside their carry-on bags, once new security equipment is installed. The airport is investing Â£50m in the computer tomography (CT) security scanners, to be rolled out over the next few years. The technology, similar to CT scanners used in hospitals, provides a clear picture of a bag's contents. Detailed 3D images can be easily rotated and dissected by staff. Heathrow chief operations officer, Chris Garton, said: ""This cutting-edge kit will not only keep the airport safe with the latest technology, but will mean that our future passengers can keep their focus on getting on with their journeys and less time preparing for security screening."" Aviation Minster Baroness Vere added: ""Passenger safety remains our top priority, and this programme clearly shows the huge importance we place on security."" The technology is already being used in the US, including Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport and Chicago's O'Hare. The US Transportation Security Administration hopes to deploy 300 of the scanners by 2020.

"This video can not be played Young people in Birmingham spoke to the BBC about their future plans Rising rents mean young people are less likely to move to UK cities where average salaries are higher, a report indicates. The number of young people in private rented accommodation who moved for a new job has almost halved in 20 years. Despite the higher wages available, financial incentives for moving are lower, say researchers. ""Pay gains are being swallowed up by high housing costs,"" said Lindsay Judge of the Resolution Foundation. ""For young people in particular, there are real advantages to moving when it comes to trying new roles and developing skills - and housing should not be a barrier that prevents them doing this."" Although unemployment has fallen, the Resolution Foundation found that rents had climbed the fastest in higher-paying areas of the UK. Lettings fee ban brings cheer to tenants Can a landlord kick me out? Have you been affected by this issue? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Private rents have risen by almost 90% in the UK's highest-paying local authority areas, while rents have increased by just over 70% among the lowest-paying local authority areas. In 1997, after housing costs were deducted from salaries, private renters moving from a low-paying area such as East Devon to a mid-paying area such as Bristol would have received an average financial gain of about 16%. Today, the financial gain would be a mere 1%. Of course, millennials and the so-called ""Generation Z"" have other reasons for not moving apart from money.

""There is no way I can pursue my profession anywhere but up North, if I also want to have any savings or a life outside of my job."" Mr Walker said that although commercial archaeological contractors across the UK offered more attractive salaries than academic institutions and private foundations, the salaries were not enticing enough to make him want to move down South.

"This video can not be played ""South Wales is going to be like a ghost town"" Ford's engine plant in Bridgend is set to close in autumn 2020, with the loss of 1,700 jobs. Union officials were told of the plans at a meeting with Ford bosses which include the offer of redeployment. Workers were sent home after receiving a letter which said they will lose their jobs in phases by 25 September next year. Ford blamed ""changing customer demand and cost"" for the closure plans and denied Brexit was a factor. In a statement, Ford of Europe president Stuart Rowley said creating a sustainable business required the company to make ""difficult decisions"", including the need to make its engine manufacturing base suitable for the vehicles it produces in the future. ""We are committed to the UK. However, changing customer demand and cost disadvantages, plus an absence of additional engine models for Bridgend going forward make the plant economically unsustainable in the years ahead."" Later, he said the decision was nothing to do with Brexit although he realised the company's plans would be ""very significant for the employees, their families and the community in south Wales"". As it happened: Bridgend reacts to Ford closure plans Political reaction: 'Workers deserve better' Bridgend 'hanging on by its fingernails' Mr Rowley has confirmed the company will repay Â£11m in incentives offered by the Welsh Government. Economy minister Ken Skates said he was ""absolutely livid"" at Ford's decision to ""turn their back on Bridgend"". ""We pumped a huge amount of money into this facility and we expected more from Ford."" He toldGareth Lewis on BBC Radio Walesthat he was working with the chemicals company Ineos and others ""who would like to come to this area"". He added the site is ""a priority"" for any inward investment. This video can not be played The story of Ford in Bridgend Workers at the plant said they were devastated. ""I'm expecting to lose my job,"" said Tony Phillips, who has been at the plant for 31 years, adding that they were ""good, well-paid jobs"". Fellow worker Mark Lendrum said: ""South Wales is going to be like a ghost town."" Leader of Bridgend council Huw David, said there is ""not a family in Bridgend that won't be affected by this"" and it is a ""fabulous workforce"" from Newport to Llanelli. ""We don't know how we are going to recover from this. ""Both governments want to keep the jobs here. We as the council will help people to find other work,"" he said. Graham Rees is one of the 1,700 workers at the Bridgend plant Graham Rees has worked at Ford in Bridgend for 35 years. ""You see work come and go, when an engine dies off, there's a replacement, but this time, what do you do? ""It doesn't matter what you're building, if people don't want to buy it, it's at the end at its life, full stop,"" he said. ""You get a feeling that yes, the end is nigh, but nobody wants to admit that, so you prepare yourself and get on with it. ""There is no light at the end of the tunnel, you've just got to face the truth."" The closure news comes just months after Ford said it wascutting its Welsh workforce by 1,000, with 370 going in a first phase. Investment in a new petrol engine, called Dragon, was scaled back, while production of an engine for Jaguar Land Rover is due to end this year. Ford Bridgend loses out in global race Electric cars hope for Bridgend Just days ago, it was revealed thatcar sales in the UK had fallen again. GMB regional organiser Jeff Beck said: ""We're hugely shocked by today's announcement. It's a real hammer blow for the Welsh economy and the community in Bridgend."" He said the union would continue to work with Ford, other unions and the Welsh Government ""to find a solution to the issue and mitigate the effects of this devastating news"". Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey said Ford had treated its UK workers ""abysmally"". ""The fact remains that it is cheaper, easier and quicker to sack our workers than those in our competitor countries,"" he said, vowing to ""resist this closure with all our might"". Ford chose Bridgend for its new engine plant in the summer of 1977 after competition from elsewhere in Europe, chiefly from Ireland. The company needed an engine for its new model - code-named Erika - which became the next generation Ford Escort. It was to be built at Halewood on Merseyside and at Saarlouis in Germany from 1980. The promise had been for 2,500 jobs but by the time it opened in May 1980, Ford had decided to take on only 1,400 workers. There were 22,000 people applying for the roles. Concerns about the plant's long term futurewere raised more than a decade ago when the decision was taken to no longer have Ford UK and Ford Europe making different designs of cars compared with the USA and rest of the world. The mark III Ford Escort - which was nearly called the Ford Erika after its development name Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said he knew it was an ""extremely worrying and uncertain time for Ford workers, their families in Bridgend and the surrounding communities"". ""The UK government will work closely with Ford, the trade unions and the Welsh Government, to make sure this highly-valued workforce can move into new skilled employment."" Earlier, Mr Cairns told BBC Wales he had been in touch with Ken Skates about exploring the production of electric vehicles as a means of protecting jobs in the Bridgend area. Mr Cairns said the UK government and Welsh Government ""have already been working on potential investors"" but ""clearly there is a lot more work"". He added that ""the Brexit issue doesn't stand up"" in being a part of Ford's decision. But Bridgend Labour MP Madeleine Moon said she believed it was ""very clearly about Brexit"". ""The knock-on effect to the south Wales economy is huge - there are 12,000 associated jobs. ""The map has just been rubbed out,"" she said. This video can not be played Bridgend MP Madeleine Moon said she was ""very emotional"" over the closure plan Mr Skates said the Welsh Government would provide a ""rapid response taskforce to support workers"". Since 1978 about Â£140m in taxpayers' money has been invested in the plant, Mr Skates said. That had been ""money well spent"" since the plant had ""pumped back"" Â£3bn into the Bridgend economy over the last 10 years alone, Mr Skates said. ""What we have repeatedly said to Ford over recent months and years is that Wales stands ready, it is perfectly situated and positioned to help businesses."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the news was ""incredibly sad"", and pledged the Welsh Government would do ""everything in its power"" to support those affected and to ""work with all partners to explore options for the future of the plant"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said closure would be ""one of the most bitter blows"" to the Welsh economy for more than 30 years. ""The implications of this in terms of the supply chain in terms of job losses is very, very grave indeed,"" he added.

This is down to acombination of different reasons. The car industry troubles have been blamed in part, ""because the trade future is uncertain with Brexit,"" according to consultant Anna-Marie Baisden. But the head of autos research for Fitch Solutions added there had also been a ""shift away from what is being made at the moment, in terms of diesel cars"". What's behind the car industry crisis? BMW and JLR  join forces on electric cars Fiat Chrysler withdraws bid for Renault Karel Williams, an automotive expert from Manchester Business School said the plant closure is ""collateral damage"" from other ""larger developments"" such as the push towards electric engines. He also said it highlighted the limits of the Welsh Government's ""inward investment strategy"". It's the Brexit equivalent of a Rorschach test - you can interpret the inkblot or decision in different ways. Those who want to see us stay in the EU see Brexit as a factor in Ford Bridgend's closure, whilst Brexiteers point the finger of blame at the wider pressures bearing down on the automotive industry - from a shift to electric cars to falling demand from China. Ford announced back in December that it was restructuring its operations right across Europe. As part of that change, a plant in Bordeaux in France is to be closed and thousands of jobs cut in Germany. Brexit, obviously, was not a factor in those decisions. Given that context, here in Wales and the UK, the additional issue of Brexit and the ongoing uncertainty over what kind of economic relationship we'll have with EU's single market doesn't help matters. Nissan, when it announced its decision to move production from Sunderland to Japan, said Brexit uncertainty is not helping them ""plan for the future"" whilst Honda said that its plant closure in Swindon wasn't related to our departure from the EU.

Union officials were told of the plans at a meeting with Ford bosses which include the offer of redeployment. Workers were sent home after receiving a letter which said they will lose their jobs in phases from 25 September next year. Ford blamed ""changing customer demand and cost"" for the closure plans and denied Brexit was a factor.

"Ford confirms it plans to close its Bridgend plant next year Workers have been told of plans to close the factory on 25 September 2020 The firm have ceased production at the plant until Monday Ford denied Brexit was the reason for the planned closure The workers were told they were expected to lose their jobs in phases The plant opened in 1980 and employs 1,700 workers Catryn Jenkins, Chris Wood and Caleb Spencer And that brings us to the end of our live coverage on the announcement that Ford are set to close their plant at Bridgend with the loss of 1,700 jobs. There will be more reaction on BBC Wales news online and other BBC services. We leave you with this video of the plant's history. This video can not be played Bridgend Ford closure: End of an era There are three conclusions to be drawn from the news that Ford will close its Bridgend plant, according to Prof Karel Williams, an automotive expert from Manchester Business School:  Former leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Assembly, Andrew RT Davies reacts to Bridgend MP Madeline Moon's claim that Brexit was the reason for Ford's decision Allow Twitter content?

""There is not a family who will not be affected by the closure of the Ford plant,"" the leader of Bridgend council Huw David said following the announcement. He added that he did not know ""how we are going to recover from this"". ""We are hoping the plant can be saved,"" he said. ""Itâs a long shot
but we have a fabulous workforce here. Both governments want to keep the jobs
here. ""Itâs our single biggest private employer in Bridgend and
has a workforce from Newport to Llanelli."" âTodayâs announcement is another crushing blow for UK automotive manufacturing and, especially, the staff and their families in and around Bridgend,"" said Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chief executive Mike Hawes. ""Fordâs challenges are not unique: economic uncertainty at home and abroad, technological change and global trade issues are stressing markets and forcing companies to review operations and make difficult decisions. ""Success in this fiercely competitive global industry, however, starts at home and we hope that all efforts will be made over the coming weeks to restore confidence, bolster demand and ensure there is long term competitiveness for this crucial sector.â The Welsh Government has confirmed it will set up a task force to help workers find other jobs following Ford's announcement to close its Bridgend factory. Ford's European president Stuart Rowley
confirms the company will repay Â£11m in incentives offered by the Welsh Government.   Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Des Quinn, National Officer of Unite was in the meeting at Ford HQ in Brentwood this morning. He told the BBC News Channel that Ford had ""betrayed"" its workforce in Bridgend. ""We don't believe the plant had to close - it may have become inevitable because of the actions of the company. ""When the company talked about making the Dragon engine in the UK they talked about making 500,000 - but reduced that to 250,000 and then down to 120,000 because they've put that global platform elsewhere in low cost economies. ""The UK is an important profitable market for Ford to sell cars and we think they should be building engines here and supporting the market they rely on to make a profit. ""Unfortunately you can only judge Ford by its actions. Ford had 27 plants in the UK, we're down to five, four if this closure proposal goes through. ""It will be absolutely devastating, not just to Bridgend, it will be devastating to Wales as a country. It will be devastating to UK manufacturing because of the supply chain which goes to the four corners of the UK and wider to Europe. ""It's devastating to the communities - the local pubs and clubs and shops that will also be hit because of this. ""It's absolutely dreadful news and a betrayal of Ford workers in Bridgend. ""It's been some time in coming. ""It's been inaction from the company that's got us here. Performance was improving in the plant and we were keen to get new products in there and unfortunately the reluctance from the company to move forward with that has got us to this stage."" Professor Peter Wells, director of automotive industry
research at Cardiff University said: âUnfortunately Bridgend is caught up in the middle of the
situation Fords finds itself in. They simply have too much capacity, not enough
successful models and badly in need of restricting the whole operation across
Europe. âThe future for Bridgend workers looks relatively bleak
unless they can find new work. âThey have a fantastic track record and with the appropriate
investment they could be making other things. âBut the investment climate in general in the UK,
particularly for the automotive sector, is very poor and unless theyâve got
work, they are going to struggle.â Secretary
of State for Wales Alun Cairns said: âI fully
recognise that this an extremely worrying and uncertain time for Ford workers,
their families in Bridgend and the surrounding communities. ""The UK
Government will work closely with Ford, the trade unions and the Welsh
Government, to make sure this highly-valued workforce can move into new skilled
employment. âIn my discussions with Ford
management, they have confirmed that they will offer redeployment opportunities
to staff while colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions are standing
by to provide advice and support to others in the local area. âThe UK government remains committed to protecting and creating jobs in Wales. ""We will
do all we can to ensure that the skilled Welsh workforce continues to be a
world leader in the automotive sector through our established programmes which
are aimed at maintaining our strength and competitiveness as the nature of the
industry rapidly changes.â  ENDS  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Federation of Small Businesses Wales said it was a âdevastating
blowâ for Bridgend and the wider region, especially workers for Ford and the
supply chain. Head of external affairs Ben Cottam said: âFor 40 years,
Ford has been part of the economic landscape of Wales and has a
long-established, embedded and innovative supply chain of smaller businesses in
Wales and beyond. âUK and Welsh governments now need to move quickly and as a
priority, work with individual businesses and business organisations to gauge
the potential impact and determine what support will be needed.â He called the dynamism of the employees a âhuge asset to
Walesâ and said it âmust not be lostâ. A UK government spokesman said: âFordâs announcement today
follows earlier announcements that the company has made about its ongoing
global restructuring plans, nevertheless the news of their intention and
consultation on closing the Bridgend plant will be very worrying for the
dedicated workforce. âFord has committed
to supporting employees throughout the consultation process and beyond,
including with redeployment opportunities to other Ford sites in the
UK. ""At the same time, they have also reaffirmed their commitment to their
other sites in the UK. ""The UK government will be working closely with
Ford, local stakeholders and trade union representatives through the
consultation.â Ford Europe's president Stuart Rowley said: ""We will be sourcing Dragon engines from Mexico but
we will not move the production facility from Bridgend to Mexico."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9968298
"Fiat Chrysler has withdrawn its merger proposal for French carmaker Renault, the Italian-American firm has said. The announcement followed a failed attempt by Renault board members to reach a decision on the offer. Renault said it had been unable to reach agreement because French government representatives had requested a postponement. The French government is the biggest shareholder in Renault, with a stake of more than 15%. Japan's Nissan also owns 15% of Renault, while Renault owns 43.4% of Nissan's shares. Renault's share price fell by nearly 7% on Thursday in response to Fiat Chrysler's decision. Fiat Chrysler made the offer for Renault at the end of last month, describing it as a ""transformative"" proposal that would create a global automotive leader. Carmakers have faced pressure to consolidate amid major industry shifts, including towards electric vehicles. ""It has become clear that the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully,"" Fiat Chrysler said in a statement. But the carmaker said it remained ""firmly convinced of the compelling, transformational rationale"" of the proposal, the terms of which were ""carefully balanced to deliver substantial benefits to all parties"". Fiat Chrysler proposes merger with Renault Renault and Nissan usher in new era Fiat Chrysler in $4.5bn US expansion Industry shifts toward electric models, along with stricter emissions standards and the development of new technologies for autonomous vehicles, have put increasing pressure on carmakers to consolidate. Older, and often heavily indebted carmakers, also face rising competition from new entrants in the motoring sector including Tesla, as well as cash-rich companies developing driverless technology such as Amazon and Google-owned Waymo. The Fiat Chrysler tie-up with Renault would have allowed the companies to share development costs on key technology such as electric vehicles and self-driving cars and to create an important player in the automotive industry. The merger proposal came at a time when Renault had already been facing challenges as part of an alliance with Japan's Nissan. The former chief executive of both Renault and Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, is awaiting trial following his fourth arrest in Japan amid allegations of financial misconduct. Five charts on the Carlos Ghosn scandal Ghosn: The relentless 'cost killer' The allegations have put a strain on the 20-year-old alliance, which also includes Japan's Mitsubishi Motors.

"This video can not be played Phone footage appears to show glasses being thrown and England fans clashing with Portuguese police Fans responsible for trouble in Porto before Thursday's Nations League semi-final are ""not true England supporters"" and an ""embarrassment to the team"", the Football Association has said. Two England fans were arrested in clashes with riot police on Wednesday night and two officers were injured. Bottles were thrown at Portuguese fans in a fans' zone as supporters watched Portugal beat Switzerland 3-1. It was the second night in a row that supporters had caused trouble. A UK police chief has called their behaviour ""completely unacceptable"" and says an investigation team hopes to identify offenders when they return to UK airports. ""We have an investigation team up and running in the UK gathering footage,"" Deputy Chief Constable Mark Roberts, the National Police Chiefs' Council football policing lead, told BBC Radio 5 live. ""We aim to get them to court, hopefully when they get back to the airport we will identify them as we want them banned. ""Unfortunately what we see here are people, some of whom have never been brought to the attention of the police and we don't know if they'll behave like drunk yobs until they've consumed too much alcohol."" There are believed to be 15,000 England supporters in Portugal and around 500 attended Wednesday's game at Porto's Estadio do Dragao. Some fans are staying in Porto, which is 30 miles away from Guimaraes where England face the Netherlands. Portuguese police confirmed to BBC Sport: ""Two English fans were arrested in Porto due to aggressions to police officers and another was identified because of his behaviour. Two police officers were injured in the intervention."" The trouble comes a week after the FA released their 'Don't be that idiot' campaign, warning fans about anti-social and ""embarrassing behaviour"". ""The FA strongly condemns the scenes witnessed in Porto overnight,"" it said in a statement. ""Anyone responsible for these disturbances cannot be seen as true England supporters and are not welcome in football. They are an embarrassment to the team and the thousands of well-behaved fans who follow England in the right way."" The Football Supporters' Association, a national fans organisation, said it ""unreservedly condemned the anti-social behaviour and violent disorder"". Chief executive Kevin Miles said: ""This is exactly the type of incident that Football Banning Orders (FBO) were made for and we're sure the authorities will be seeking to identify perpetrators. ""While the UK police don't have powers of arrest in Portugal they can retrospectively apply for FBOs which stop these people getting into UK stadiums or following England away. ""The most galling aspect of these incidents - which most England fans didn't witness, let alone condone - is that the rest of us will all suffer as a consequence of the reputation perpetuated by this minority of idiots."" Deputy Chief Constable Roberts said Portuguese riot police were deployed in the main square of Porto against a group of England fans on Wednesday night. ""The behaviour of a small number of the England fans out here continues to tarnish the reputation of the genuine fans who are simply trying to enjoy the football,"" said Roberts. ""It is believed the fans had been throwing bottles at Portugal fans who were watching the match in the same area. ""This is the second evening in a row where disorder has occurred in Porto. Last night there were issues outside a bar, where bottles were thrown and minor damage was caused. ""The behaviour we are witnessing is incredibly disappointing and again I would point fans towards the recent video from the FA - 'Don't be that idiot'. More than 100 England fanswere arrestedin Amsterdam in March 2018, when Gareth Southgate's side played the Netherlands in a friendly. England were also threatened with disqualification from Euro 2016 but were not formally charged by Uefa, after fan trouble at the tournament. But last year's World Cup in Russia passed without any trouble. Mark Lowen, BBC News, Porto Trouble in Portugal was feared; when England played the Netherlands in Amsterdam last year, more than a hundred England fans were arrested. There were ugly scenes too in Seville last October so Portuguese police were braced for violence. In the end, last night passed off relatively calmly. But when Portugal went 1-0 up against Switzerland, a hardcore group of England fans threw beer bottles in the fan zone. The police moved in with batons, cheered by some Porto residents. This morning, Avenida da Liberdade, where the trouble flared, had been cleaned up, but some local businesses lamented the ugly scenes. Manuel Alvos, serving in a cafÃ© where England fans were drinking beer from late morning, told me the behaviour was shameful. ""They're fine until they start with alcohol"", he said. ""Portugal is a calm country. It's bad for tourism when this happens - and bad for football."" As rain began to beat down, the bars along Porto's Douro river largely emptied of England fans - many of them taking the short train ride to where tonight's match will take place: Guimaraes, the picturesque town that was once the capital of Portugal after its independence in the 12th Century. The FA has called last night's scenes ""an embarrassment"" and many of the 18,000 England fans here will share that sentiment. Once again, the behaviour of a few has tarnished the image of English football.

Boris Johnson has warned the Tories face ""potential extinction"" if the UK doesn't leave by then. Rival Jeremy Hunt said a revised deal could be done by then under a leader with ""the right negotiating skills"". The former foreign secretary told a leadership hustings on Tuesdaythe party would ""not be forgiven"" if it failed, and said he was the candidate best placed to beat Labour and ""put Nigel Farage back in his box"". The comments came as the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) of Tory MPs called on leadership contenders to abandon Mrs May's Brexit deal and step up preparations for a no-deal exit in October. Where do the hopefuls stand on Brexit? Tories agree leadership contest rule changes Second Tory leadership candidate pulls out International Development Secretary Mr Stewart told BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett that anyone promising to renegotiate by October was effectively committing to leaving without a deal because it was impossible. Meanwhile, in other Tory leadership developments: In a campaign video,,externalForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says he believes that with him at the helm and ""the right negotiating skills"", the UK can get a revised deal with Brussels ""even before the end of October."" He also pledged to turn the UK economy into the ""greenest in Europe"". Andrea Leadsomtold the Telegraph,externalthat as PM she would host a monthly phone-in with members of the public. In astatement to Bloomberg,external, Rory Stewart pledged to increase spending on schools, the police and research Sam Gyimah said the new PM should get a ""final chance"" to renegotiate the Brexit deal before it is put to a referendum. Esther McVey told LBC radio that only those who ""believe in Brexit"" would serve in her cabinet until the UK leaves the EU. The EU has consistently said it is not willing to re-open the current withdrawal agreement negotiated between the bloc and Mrs May, despite it being voted down by MPs three times. The winner of the contest to lead the Conservative Party will become the next prime minister. Who has declared and who still might? BBC to host Tory leader TV debates Mr Stewart and Mr Johnson are two of 11 candidates running to become the next leader of the Conservative Party, and the next UK prime minister. On Tuesday, two pulled out of the leadership race as the partytightened the rules for the contestamid concerns about the size of the field. Candidates will now need the support of eight MPs to take part in the race, and to secure of 5% of the vote in the first round, and 10% of the vote in the second round, to progress. Charles Walker, the acting joint-chair of the Tory backbench 1922 Committee, said it was ""not unreasonable for someone seeking to be leader of the party and prime minister to be able to muster"" that level of support. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he expected the Parliamentary side of the leadership contest - where MPs narrow the field down to two final candidates - to take no more than two weeks. The winner will then be chosen by the wider membership of the Conservative Party. Mr Johnson suggested the solution to the current deadlock would be to replace the Irish backstop - the controversial insurance policy designed to maintain an open border - with ""alternative arrangements"". The EU, though, has said the backstop is a key part of the withdrawal agreement, which it is not willing to reconsider or subject to a time limit. Mr Johnson, who has insisted the UK must leave by the end of October with or without a deal, said a no-deal exit would cause ""some disruption"". But he warned that demands for a further referendum would grow if the country was forced to seek another extension from the EU. Mr Stewart said ""politicians need to stop pretending they are going to get a new deal from Brussels"". ""Anyone who knows anything about Europe can assure you there is not the slightest hope of getting a new deal through Europe by 31 October. Not a hope. ""There is a lack of realism."" Earlier, Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt would not be drawn on whether she planned to enter the leadership race, but she claimed that nobody wanted a no-deal Brexit, and the EU ""understand they have to move on some things"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the Brexiteer said: ""I stayed in cabinet and fought to try and get a deal and to try and build a consensus, both in my party and but also in Parliament. ""What we have learnt though is if you are trying to get that objective, you can't take no deal off the table."" Fellow Leave-backer and Tory MP Steve Baker told BBC's Politics Live he had not decided whether to run, but said the party needed someone ""very direct [and] with a clear plan"" for Brexit. He has published his own plan for leaving the EU, ""A Clean Managed Brexit,external"", calling for a future partnership ""based not on the close mandatory alignment and single customs territory which the draft agreement was designed to facilitate, but one centred on a mutually-beneficial advanced free trade agreement"". Mr Baker added: ""No one voted to ask permission to leave. We voted to leave with the hope of negotiating mutually-beneficial cooperation as an independent country. We continue to hope to do so.""

"The Conservatives face ""potential extinction"" if they do not get Brexit done, Boris Johnson has warned. The former foreign secretary told a leadership hustings the party will ""not be forgiven"" if it does not take the UK out of the EU by 31 October as planned. He said he was best placed to beat Labour and ""put Nigel Farage back in his box"" but reportedly ruled out a snap general election if he becomes PM. Mr Johnson is one of 11 candidates vying to succeed Theresa May as leader. His comments came as the Eurosceptic European Research Group (ERG) called on leadership contenders to abandon Mrs May's Brexit deal. A paper published by the influential ERG said the next prime minister should sign up to the 31 October deadline and step up preparations for a no-deal exit on World Trade Organisation terms. On Tuesday, two candidates pulled out of the leadership race as the partytightened the rules for the contestamid concerns about the size of the field.

Tories agree leadership contest rule changes Second Tory leadership candidate pulls out Trump declines to meet 'negative' Corbyn Mr Johnson, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart and ex-Commons leader Andrea Leadsom addressed the One Nation Conservative Caucus of Tory MPs in Parliament at the first hustings of the campaign. The group, which opposes a no-deal Brexit, has invited all the candidates to appear before them to make their case for the top job. Mr Johnson, regarded as the frontrunner in the contest, said the party was facing an ""existential crisis"" following its drubbing in last month's European elections. ""We will not be forgiven if we do not deliver Brexit on October 31,"" he said. ""We need to realise the depth of the problems we face. Unless we get on and do this thing, we will be punished for a very long time. There is a very real choice between getting Brexit done and the potential extinction of this great party."" His warning was echoed by fellow leadership hopeful Ms Leadsom, who said a delay to the UK's exit from the EU could ""spell the end"" for the party. Mr Johnson suggested the solution to the current deadlock would be to replace the Irish backstop - the controversial insurance policy designed to maintain an open border - with ""alternative arrangements"" so as to facilitate a ""managed exit"" from the EU. The EU has said the backstop must remain in the withdrawal agreement and has resisted calls from Tories and the DUP for a time limit, or exit date, to be put on it. The Tory leadership hustings hosted by the One Nation Caucus of Conservative MPs began with reporters, me included, starting to loiter outside. Between us and the action inside, there were two heavy wooden doors and a pretty thick wall - and some parliamentary security staff not particularly keen on us leaning too obviously against either the doors or the wall. A rather forthright conversation then began between us lot in the press pack and Conservative Party officials about why we weren't allowed in - given those in the room were discussing who should be our prime minister by the end of next month. Read more from Chris here Mr Johnson, who has insisted the UK must leave by the end of October with or without a deal, said a no-deal exit would cause ""some disruption"". But he warned that demands for another referendum on the UK's future in Europe would grow if the UK was forced to seek another extension from the EU. He insisted: ""I believe I am best placed to lift this party, beat Jeremy Corbyn and excite people about conservatism and conservative values."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid told the meeting that if his party ""don't look like change, voters will go for change in the form of (Jeremy) Corbyn"". He stressed that the party should not seek to emulate Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, insisting ""we will not beat the Brexit Party by becoming the Brexit Party"". In a reference to Benjamin Disraeli's ""one nation"" political philosophy, he added: ""One nation is a term that was coined by a prime minister who was a bit of an outsider. Pick a prime minister who is also a bit of an outsider."" International Development Secretary Rory Stewart told the event: ""I began this race believing I should be a truth-teller on principle - ironically I have discovered that it is very popular - and the only way to avoid an election and win the next one is by being straight with people. ""No more unicorns, no more red lines, no more promises we can't deliver. That's how we get Brexit done, defeat Corbyn and unify the country."" He also told MPs he would not sign a confidence and supply deal with the DUP in exchange for funding, as Mrs May did. The winner of the contest to lead the Conservative Party will become the next prime minister. Who has declared and who still might? BBC to host Tory leader TV debates Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt would not be drawn on whether she planned to enter the leadership race. But she claimed that nobody wanted a no-deal Brexit, and the EU ""understand they have to move on some things"". She told the programme: ""I stayed in cabinet and fought to try and get a deal and to try and build a consensus, both in my party and but also in Parliament. ""What we have learnt though is if you are trying to get that objective, you can't take no deal off the table."" Ms Mordaunt added: ""In recent days, in my discussions that I have had with people on the EU side of the negotiating table, I am really optimistic and I think they understand they have to move on some things. ""I voted to Leave and I still remain optimistic that we can get a good deal for the UK.""

"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.

He will become prime minister on 24 July and Parliament begins its summer recess the following day. A week later there will be a by-election and the rest of August will be pretty quiet, both in Westminster and Brussels. Parliament returns at the start of September but will take another recess later in the month for party conferences. On 17 October there will be a summit of EU leaders. Brexit is scheduled for 31 October, the day before the new European Commission takes office.

"This video can not be played Five numbers that explain US border crisis US President Donald Trump has said ""not nearly enough"" progress is being made in negotiations with Mexico to avert his threatened tariffs. Trump administration officials will meet for a second day of talks with Mexico's foreign minister in Washington on Thursday. Mr Trump vowed import duties of 5% will take effect on Monday unless Mexico stems the flow of migrants to the US. Those numbers reached their highest level in more than a decade last month. US Vice-President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held talks with Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard at the White House on Wednesday, but the 90-minute meeting ended without agreement. Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Trump's border wall - in seven charts Mr Ebrard told a news conference afterwards the negotiations had been cordial, but tariffs were not even discussed. ""The dialogue was focused on migration flows and what Mexico is doing or is proposing to the United States, our concern about the Central American situation,"" he said. The US president, who is in Europe for World War Two commemorations, warned on Twitter that the tariffs would go ahead next Monday if there is no breakthrough. Allow Twitter content?

Under his proposal, duties would rise by 5% every month on goods including cars, beer, tequila, fruit and vegetables, reaching 25% by October. Mr Trump wants Mexico to stop the hundreds of thousands of mostly Central American migrants who have been seeking entry to the US this year. The US president announced the planned Mexico tariffs last week on Twitter, catching members of his own party and financial markets unawares. This video can not be played More than 1,000 migrants cross through a hole in the fence near El Paso, Texas, in the largest single border breach ever recorded White House trade adviser Peter Navarro had raised hopes earlier on Wednesday of a possible rapprochement. He told CNN ""we believe that these tariffs may not have to go into effect, precisely because we have the Mexicans' attention"". Mr Navarro said Mr Trump wants Mexico to commit to take all asylum seekers and to divert more resources to its own southern border with Guatemala. Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has said he is optimistic about defusing a potential trade war that analysts have said could tip his country's economy into recession. Some commentators have speculated that Mr Trump will not follow through, pointing out that he reversed course on a threat to close the US-Mexico border in April. But the US president insisted in a tweet on Tuesday he was not ""bluffing"". The US is already locked in a tit-for-tat tariff war with China. Some members of the president's Republican party in the Senate have threatened a rare revolt. They have raised the possibility of banding together with Democrats to form a veto-proof majority against his plan. But other Republican senators and members of the House of Representatives are sticking by Mr Trump on his signature issue. This video can not be played Trump says it's ""likely"" that Mexico tariffs will happen Many lawmakers are worried about the potential impact on cross-border trade and increased costs for US businesses and consumers on imported Mexican goods. With the clock ticking toward next year's US elections, Democrats have accused Mr Trump of using tariffs and immigration to distract from his political problems. And the US president has reportedly faced resistance from some of his own advisers, including US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, an architect of Mr Trump's China trade policy. Mr Lighthizer is said to have expressed concern that any duties on Mexico could harm efforts to persuade Congress to approve a new North American trade deal. What Trump has in common with Abe Lincoln and Ferris Bueller Mexico warns tariffs will hit US hard The stakes were raised on Wednesday as US Customs and Border Protection announced that migrant arrests had surged in May to the highest level in more than a decade. Border Patrol apprehended 132,887 migrants attempting to enter the US from Mexico in May, marking a 33% increase from the month before. It said 84,542 were families and 11,507 unaccompanied children. The arrests were the highest monthly total since Mr Trump took office. Another 11,391 migrants were deemed ""inadmissible"" and turned away after arriving at US ports of entry, bringing the overall figure to 144,278. ""We are in a full-blown emergency, and I cannot say this stronger, the system is broken,"" said acting CBP Commissioner John Sanders. Official figures show illegal border crossings have been in decline since 2000. In 2000, 1.6 million people were apprehended trying to cross the border illegally - that number was just under 400,000 in 2018. In 2017, Mr Trump's first year in office, the figures were the lowest they had been since 1971. The decline was in large part due to a dip in the number of people coming from Mexico. In the past two years, however, the number of arrests has been rising again, especially in recent months.

"Councillor Laura Booth said she received abuse on Facebook about the flat lace-up shoes A mayor who has a prosthetic leg has reacted to social media ""hate speak"" about her choice of footwear which she believes could discourage disabled people from entering public life. Stockport mayor Laura Booth, whose left leg was amputated below the knee as a child, said she was mocked on Facebook for wearing flat shoes to an event. She said one comment read: ""Look at the state of her"". Ms Booth said her footwear did not diminish her ability to do her job. The councillor, who also has chronic pain and back problems, wore pink leather lace-up shoes to a ceremony at a bakery in Reddish on Monday. She said she wanted to walk to the event and stand up, rather than use her wheelchair. Ms Booth explained: ""People commented on the bakery's photo; 'A mayor in trainers, disapproving face', 'Look at the state of her'. 'Get back to your caravan'. ""They make these judgements and can get really nasty."" Ms Booth, who lost her leg after a car crash, said: ""I am prone to falling, I have a different gait so I need shoes with support. There is limited choice. ""It's these attitudes which will put people off entering public life if they have a health condition or disability,"" she said.

"This video can not be played The Queen recalls words from her father, King George VI The Queen has paid tribute to the ""heroism, courage and sacrifice"" of those who died in the D-Day landings. She was joined by 16 world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, in Portsmouth to commemorate the 75th anniversary of history's largest combined land, air and naval operation. Mr Trump, who was on the last day of his UK state visit, said D-Day ""may have been the greatest battle ever"". Veterans of the landings in Normandy to liberate western Europe also attended. The commemorations included: A flypast by the Red Arrows RAF aerobatic team and historic aircraft Parachute jumps by D-Day veterans Readings by world leaders from the diaries and letters of people who fought and died in the war An hour-long production telling the story of the invasion A joint statement by 16 countries pledging to avoid a repeat of the ""unimaginable horrors"" of the conflict The Queen said the veterans of D-Day demonstrated ""more than courage and endurance"", showing ""unconquerable resolve"". The quotes came from a broadcast by her father, King George VI, made at the time of the massive operation that signalled the end of Nazi power in Western Europe. What were the D-Day landings? 10 things you might not know about D-Day D-Day veteran: 'I looked at the wounded and I cried' Watch: D-Day landings commemorated ""The fate of the world depended on their success,"" she said. ""Many of them would never return, and the heroism, courage and sacrifice of those who lost their lives will never be forgotten."" She thanked them ""with humility and pleasure, on behalf of the entire country, indeed the whole free world"". This video can not be played D-Day veteran: 'I didn't want to let my friends down'. Later in the afternoon, veterans Harry Read, 95, and John Hutton, 94, parachuted back into Normandy, 75 years after their first landing. However this time, they jumped in tandem with members of the Army's Parachute Regiment display team, the Red Devils. They were greeted with cheers and applause as they landed in the French fields. Mr Hutton told the BBC before the jump: ""My main objective is to pay my respects to people on the ground who never came back."" Mr Read added: ""[On D-Day] there was an almighty fireworks display taking place just ahead of us - and we were going straight into it. ""It was an horrendous inferno to go in to."" At 18:40BST around 300 veterans on board the cruise ship MV Boudicca waved and cheered as she left harbour in Portsmouth bound for Normandy. They were followed by a flotilla of Royal Navy vessels. Other ships in the harbour sounded their horns as a mark of respect as the Boudicca left. The countries represented at the event have agreed to make a joint statement pledging to ensure the ""unimaginable horror"" of the war is not repeated. Called ""the D-Day proclamation"", the 16 signatories - including the UK and the US - will commit to working together to ""resolve international tensions peacefully"". On Thursday, further memorial services are planned to mark 75 years since the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944 - the start of the campaign to liberate Nazi-occupied north-west Europe. Veterans went on stage to be honoured by the audience Mrs May, Prince Charles, the Queen and Mr Trump stood for the UK national anthem The Queen told the crowd she was ""delighted"" to be able to thank veterans for their service. She added: ""When I attended the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings, some thought it might be the last such event. In pictures: Day three of Trump's UK state visit 'I survived D-Day - then had my first champagne' The weathermen who helped save D-Day ""But the wartime generation, my generation, is resilient."" Members of the armed forces and more than 300 veterans, who are all over 90 years old, attended the event in Portsmouth - one of the key embarkation points on D-Day. It was when the Queen rose to her feet, not once but twice, that it became clear just who were the honoured guests at this commemoration. Not the presidents or the prime ministers, not the military brass nor the servicemen and women who made the ceremony snap and sing. The Queen said that when she attended the 60th anniversary of D-Day some thought it might be the last such event. But, she said, the wartime generation - my generation, she emphasised - is resilient. All true. But the men who stepped forward to bathe in the applause of the audience today are looking ever more frail. And one by one they are leaving us. And so the Queen stood, twice - to honour them for the nation, and to thank them, from her heart. Sgt John Jenkins, who is 99 and served with the Pioneer Corps in the Normandy landings, said: ""I was terrified, I think everyone was. ""You never forget your comrades because we were all in it together. It is right that the courage and sacrifice of so many is being honoured 75 years on. We must never forget."" Hundreds of other veterans are in northern France to mark the occasion there. The event marks Mrs May's last official engagement as prime minister The RAF's Red Arrows were part of a flypast, which also included historical aircraft Leaders from every country that fought alongside the UK on D-Day joined the Queen and the Prince of Wales for the commemorations on Southsea Common. They included French President Emmanuel Macron, US President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Also attending were German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as leaders from Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, New Zealand, Poland and Slovakia.  156,000allied troops landed in Normandy, across 5beaches 7,000ships and landing craft involved and 10,000 vehicles 4,400from the combined allied forces died on the day 4,000 - 9,000German casualties Thousandsof French civilians also died The commemoration featured an hour-long production telling the story of the invasion, with testimony from veterans, theatrical performances and music. Veterans saluted the crowd, and actress Sheridan Smith performed a Dame Vera Lynn song. Mr Trump read the same prayer given by President Roosevelt in a radio message ahead of the D-Day landings, while the last letter of a young resistance fighter, executed aged 16, was read out by President Macron. Mrs May read a letter from Captain Norman Skinner of the Royal Army Service Corps, to his wife Gladys on June 3 1944. It was in his pocket as he landed on Sword Beach, but he was killed the following day. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn attended the D-Day event after boycotting a state banquet held for the Trumps on Monday Tory leadership rivals Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt share a joke Thousands of members of the public, separated from the VIPs and veterans by a large security fence, watched the events live on big screens on Southsea Common. A designated protest area was set up in Guildhall Square, more than a mile (1.6km) from the Southsea Common events. Civic leaders were worried any protests near the main event might upset the veterans. Members of the public sat on Southsea Common to watch the event On D-Day, Jim Booth, now 97, climbed into a fold-up canoe and shone a beacon out to sea to guide allied craft safely to shore The event included a flypast of the RAF's Red Arrows aerobatic team and historic aircraft, including Spitfires and Hurricanes. The Queen, Prince Charles, the US president and first lady met six veterans at a reception after the ceremony. World leaders then met to discuss the western alliance and security. French President Emmanuel Macron met veterans after taking to the stage to read a letter from an executed French Resistance fighter The memories of a Royal Navy electrician R G Watts, as he left Southampton to Normandy in June 1944, were read to the crowd The commemorations to mark the Allied invasion of northern France come a day after Mr Trump had aseries of political meetings as part of his three-day state visitto the UK. Following the commemorations in Portsmouth, Mr Trump boarded Air Force One for a flight to Shannon for his first visit as US president to the Republic of Ireland.

"Amazon executive Jeff Wilke said the drone had been engineered to minimise noise Amazon has said it will use drones to deliver packages to customers âwithin monthsâ. It unveiled its latest iteration at a conference in Las Vegas, touting the machine's ability to spot obstacles such as people, dogs, and clotheslines. Amazon executive Jeff Wilke said the drone would be able to travel 15 miles to carry packages weighing 5lbs (2.3kg) or less. Mr Wilke did not say where in the world the drone deliveries would initially take place, or precisely when. However, the US Federal Aviation Administration told the BBC it had granted Amazon a permit to operate the drone in the US. ""The FAA issued a Special Airworthiness Certificate to Amazon Prime Air allowing the company to operate its MK27 unmanned aircraft for research and development and crew training in authorized flight areas,"" the regulator said. ""Amazon Prime Air plans to use the aircraft to establish a package delivery operation in the United States. This certificate is valid for one year and is eligible for renewal."" The prototype drone has ""shrouds"" to act as protection from its propellers, which double up as wings In the past, Amazon has been accused of using the promise of drone delivery as a headline-grabber to push its publicity around its Prime membership service. But in December 2016, the company ran an apparently successful trial in Cambridge, UK. A package was delivered, by drone, in 13 minutes. On stage during the firmâs âRe:Marsâ conference - an event highlighting the firm's work in machine learning, robotics, automation and space - Amazon displayed the drone that will be used. It uses six rotors, and âseesâ whatâs around it using a combination of data from visual, thermal and ultrasonic sensors. Allow YouTube content?

The firm insisted that it had built a drone with multiple redundancies for avoiding objects, even if it lost its connectivity. ""Some drones are autonomous but not able to react to the unexpected, relying simply on communications systems for situational awareness,âMr Wilke said,external. ""If our droneâs flight environment changes, or the droneâs mission commands it to come into contact with an object that wasnât there previously - it will refuse to do so - it is independently safe.â The firm shared a video of a test flight, but its sound was covered by music. One aspect that might affect societal acceptance could be noise, said Carolina Milanesi, from Creative Strategies. âI'm sure that it will be a concern, although it might not be that different from the noise from a delivery truck arriving at your home. âThe only difference is that the drone might be closer to a person's home if it's landing in the garden."" Mr Wilke said the droneâs design had ""been optimized to minimize intrusive, high-frequency soundsâ. _______ Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?
