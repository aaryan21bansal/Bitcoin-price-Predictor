"The EU and UK chief negotiators have stepped back from post-Brexit trade talks after a member of the EU team tested positive for Covid-19. The EU's Michel Barnier said his UK counterpart Lord David Frost had agreed to suspend negotiations between them for a ""short period"". Mr Barnier added their teams would continue discussions in ""full respect"" of safety guidelines. They are locked in talks as the clock counts down to a December deadline. Both sides are seeking an agreement to govern their trading relationship once the UK's post-Brexit transition period ends in January 2021. Fishing rights, competition rules and how any deal would be enforced remain key areas of disagreement. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What's happening with Brexit? Brexit trade sticking points 'can be resolved' On Thursday, Mr Barnier tweeted that a member of his negotiating team had tested positive for the virus, as talks over a deal continued in Brussels. ""With David Frost, we have decided to suspend the negotiations at our level for a short period,"" he added. In reply, Lord Frost said he was in ""close contact with Michel Barnier about the situation,"" and ""the health of our teams comes first"". BBC Brussels correspondent Nick Beake said he had been told Mr Barnier would now self-quarantine following the team member's test result. Our correspondent added it was not clear how long the pause in top-level talks would last. But he said it was understood no members of the UK team in Brussels would be required to self-isolate, and that most of them would return to London soon, with talks continuing remotely. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Suspension of talks between the chief negotiators will come as an unhelpful development, with just five weeks remaining before the 31 December deadline. EU leaders are holding a video conference later on Thursday and could discuss the latest developments - although it is not officially on the agenda. On Sunday, before the latest round of talks began, Lord Frost said there had been ""some progress in a positive direction in recent days"". But he warned the two sides ""may not succeed"" to strike a deal, with ""significant elements"" not yet agreed. He added that any deal would have to be ""compatible with our sovereignty,"" and allow the UK to ""take back control of our laws, our trade, and our waters"". The two sides are seeking to reach agreement on limits on government subsidies for industry, to prevent what the EU regards as unfair competition with the UK. They are also negotiating how closely the UK should have to follow the EU's social, labour, and environmental standards after the transition. They are yet to agree how any such commitments should be enforced - with the EU demanding robust powers in case there are disputes. The UK and EU teams are also haggling over how much access European fishing boats should have to British waters and how much they would be allowed to catch from next year.

"Fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger have fallen into administration, putting more than 4,700 jobs and almost 500 shops at risk. It comes after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer for both businesses. No redundancies have been announced yet and no stores closed. EWM Group blamed the pandemic for a collapse in trade, but said it was still in talks with potential buyers. ""In recent weeks we have had constructive discussions with a number of potential buyers for Peacocks and Jaeger,"" it said in a statement. ""But the continuing deterioration of the retail sector due to the impact of the pandemic and second lockdown have made this process longer and more complex than we would have hoped."" It said that a ""standstill agreement"" secured with the High Court that temporarily put off administration had now expired. ""Therefore as directors we taken the desperately difficult decision to place Peacocks and Jaeger into administration while those talks continue,"" it said. Jaeger is a London-based fashion business with 76 stores and concessions and employs 347 staff. Cardiff-based Peacocks operates 423 stores with 4,369 staff. Some Peacocks stores had already begun to shut following an announcement on 15 October. Philip Day has quietly built a retail empire over the last 18 years and his huge footprint on high streets across the UK served him well. He did so by snapping up a string of businesses out of administration. Critics say he didn't do much with them. He didn't do much business online, either. That left him and his chains more exposed when shoppers stampeded to the internet during lockdown. Mr Day still has Bonmarche, a business which he bought through a separate investment vehicle and isn't affected by the current insolvency process. It went into administration last year amid challenging trading conditions. He went on to buy it back, with fewer stores. Will he now do the same with Peacocks or walk away? According to the most recent company accounts, the EWM Group made a pre-tax profit of Â£31m in the six months until March 2019. It also had plenty of cash in the bank and next to no debt. How quickly things have unravelled. The news come two weeks after Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group called in administrators for its eponymous clothing chain and its homeware brand Ponden Home, putting almost 3,000 more jobs at risk. Tony Wright, joint administrator of the business from FRP Advisory, said talks with potential buyers for Jaeger and Peacocks were at an advanced stage, suggesting the brands could still be saved. ""Jaeger and Peacocks are attractive brands that have suffered the well-known challenges that many retailers face at present,"" he said. ""We are in advanced discussions with a number of parties and working hard to secure a future for both businesses."" Edinburgh Woollen Mill (EWM) is owned by businessman Philip Day, who has a Â£1.14bn fortune, according to the Sunday Times Rich List published in May 2020.

"Dame Nancy Rothwell told BBC Newsnight she had written to Zac Adan and apologised A university leader has apologised to a student who was allegedly ""racially profiled"" on campus by security officers. But Manchester University's vice chancellor said she could not ""commit"" to meeting 19-year-old Zac Adan, due to an ongoing inquiry. Footage posted online showed Mr Adanheld up against a wall at Fallowfield halls of residence. He said he was accused of ""looking like a drug dealer"" by staff. Dame Nancy Rothwell told BBC Newsnight she had written to Mr Adan and apologised but could not meet him ""because that could influence the investigation"". The security staff have been suspended and an inquiry is ongoing, she said. Mr Adan, a first year French and Linguistics student at the university, previously said he had been left ""traumatised"" after being stopped. Returning to his halls of residence after visiting a local shop, he had been asked to present his identification and ""the next thing I know I was being pinned up against the wall"", he said. Zac Adan said he was left traumatised after being ""pinned against the wall"" Mr Adan said: ""There was no conversation. They just pinned me up against the wall and said I looked like a drug dealer. Why? Because I am black and wearing a hoodie?"" Dame Nancy said: ""I was very, very concerned by it, I've apologised to the student for the distress that he felt. ""I immediately suspended the staff and there is now an investigation ongoing."" Mr Adan, who moved to the UK from Italy a few years ago, said earlier this week that he wanted to talk to university leaders about the incident. Dame Nancy said she would ""consider"" meeting Mr Adan in person but did not want to ""influence the investigation"", adding: ""Just as I won't meet with the security staff either. He has met with several of our staff."" Mr Adan had also been offered counselling, she said. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

"The first vaccination against coronavirus is expected to be delivered in Scotland next month, the health secretary has announced. Jeane Freeman said the NHS would be ready to vaccinate people from the first week of December if safety approval is given. It is hoped up to one million people could be vaccinated by the end of January if there are no delays. Frontline NHS and care workers will be among the first recipients. Ms Freeman said distributing the vaccine would be one of ""the biggest civilian logistical challenges in our lifetime"". How Scotland reached 5,000 deaths during the pandemic Health boards 'will be ready' to deliver vaccine Who will have the vaccine first and when can I get it? A total of three vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford and Moderna - have alreadyreported good preliminary datafrom trials. The health secretary said it was not yet known which vaccines would be approved for use or precisely when the first doses would be delivered. She added: ""The safety of the Covid-19 vaccine is paramount to us. ""Scotland has a strong track record of delivering immunisation programmes, but this programme will be the largest of its kind ever undertaken. ""NHS Boards will identify acceptable and accessible locations, both for mass vaccination and for local access. ""We will be getting in touch with the first priority groups in the coming weeks and I urge people to take up the vaccine when they are offered it."" Ms Freeman said that if the vaccines at the most advanced stage get regulatory approval then the Scottish government hopes to have 320,000 doses to deploy in the first two weeks of December. The UK government health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the NHS in the rest of the UK is ready to begin delivering the Pfizer vaccine from the start of next month but warned what was ""more likely is that we may be able to start rolling it out before Christmas"". Everyone over the age of 18 in Scotland, a total of 4.4m people, will be offered the vaccination by the end of the programme. Ms Freeman suggested this could be achieved by the spring of next year. A senior Scottish government health source later said the aim was to vaccinate all over-18s ""as fast as possible"" but stressed there was ""no firm delivery timetable"". The priorities for the first wave of vaccine distribution, from December to February, are: front-line health and social care staff older residents in care homes care home staff all those aged 80 and over unpaid carers and personal assistants those delivering the vaccination programme. The next tranche of immunisations is expected to take place from February if there are no delays. It will target those over the age of 65 and younger people with extra clinical risks. They will be followed by the wider general population. A workforce of about 2,000 vaccinators will be needed, and support from the military will be provided to ensure the vaccination programme runs smoothly. Ms Freeman said the NHS was looking at mirroring some aspects of the flu jab programme for the rollout of the vaccine The logistics of how the vaccines are transported and stored are still being addressed, she added. The vaccines will be delivered in a range of public locations, as well as through mobile sites and in some cases in people's homes. Walk-through and drive-through clinics being used for the flu vaccination programme are being considered for use in the rollout of the Covid vaccine. Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said lessons needed to be learned from the ""chaotic"" flu vaccination programme. She added: ""The ambition to deliver one million vaccinations by the end of January needs to be matched by resources and investment in staff, and a clear plan on logistics."" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said distributing the vaccine would be ""one of the biggest public health exercises in history"". He said: ""The national booking service will be critical to an orderly rollout of a Covid-19 vaccination, so we need more details of how this will be established urgently.""

"Close contact services and coffee shops that are due to reopen on Friday can still do so - but only for one week Northern Ireland is set to face a two-week period of tougher Covid-19 lockdown measures from next Friday. Non-essential retail will have to shut, and the hospitality sector will have to remain closed. The measures were agreed by the executive on Thursday. Schools will be allowed to stay open. Close contact services can reopen this Friday, but will have to close again on 27 November. Read the guidance from the executive on the new restrictions,external The executive met on Thursday after Health Minister Robin Swannwarned more restrictions were necessaryby the end of November. He said otherwise, a full lockdown in mid-December would not be enough to prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. The measures agreed by ministers are extensive and will include: Closure of all non-essential retail Closure of close contact services such as hair and beauty salons and driving instructors; exemptions for those in film and TV production, those involved in health and social care services and elite sport services Hospitality will only be permitted to offer takeaway services - food and drink in motorway services, airports and harbour terminals remain open Closure of all leisure and entertainment to include soft play areas, gyms, golf courses, tennis courts, fitness studios and swimming pools Sporting events only permitted at elite level and to be played without spectators Closure of places of worship with exceptions for weddings, civil partnerships and funerals - the maximum number present will remain at 25 It is understood that close contact services and coffee shops that are due to reopen on Friday can still do so - but only for one week. If they do not want to, it's believed they will be able to access financial support for staying closed. The executive is set to develop more financial support packages in the next few days. Cafe owners in Belfast have been preparing ahead of reopening on Friday Off licences will be allowed to remain open, but will have to close at 20:00. No household gatherings of more than one household, other than current bubbling arrangements, will be permitted with exceptions for caring, maintenance, house moves. Schools and childcare will remain open. Public parks and outdoor play areas will also be permitted to stay open. These restrictions are much tougher than the ones the DUP rejected just one week ago. Then they vetoed the health minister's plans using the controversial cross-community vote - not once, but twice. Now from next Friday, Northern Ireland will revert back to similar measures introduced in March, with the exception of schools remaining open. None of the parties appeared for interview this evening to explain the move, but naturally it's a huge blow to those who hoped they had the green light to reopen. Health officials will be relieved ministers have taken their advice on board, but this move only takes Stormont to the middle of December. Further restrictions after that haven't been been ruled out, but the executive says what it's doing now represents the best chance of getting us to Christmas. The executive took the decision to introduce the circuit breaker from next Friday, after modelling showed it was the ""best time to introduce restrictions and avoid the likelihood"" of further measures before Christmas. Ministers were told on Thursday that the R-number - or transmission level of the virus - has settled at around one, but that hospital inpatient numbers are still sitting at a higher level than the first wave. The stay at home message will remain as strong guidance. It is understood a potential proposal to put travel restrictions into legal force did not get much support around the executive table and it was felt it would be too difficult to enforce. The executive has said liaisons with the PSNI on visibility will continue. First Minister Arlene Foster, whose party theDUP had blocked proposals to extend some restrictionslast week, said it was not a position the executive ""had hoped to be in"", with the regulations due to end next week. ""The R rate has unfortunately not dropped as far, or for as long, as had been estimated. We have taken some time today to look at the reasons for this. Sadly it is clear that a careless minority have significantly undermined the sacrifices of the many,"" she said. ""So I want to take this opportunity to say to those who feel it's acceptable to flout public health advice, think again. ""We all need to work together to save our hospitals, to save Christmas, to save lives."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the interventions agreed on Thursday night were ""difficult but necessary"" to avoid hospitals being overwhelmed in the run-up to Christmas. In a video on social media, she said the impact of the virus had been ""brought home"" to her, after a relative of hers had died with Covid-19 overnight. Health Minister Robin Swann, who had been urging the executive to agree to tighter measures, said he wanted to thank his colleagues for supporting the recommendations. This virus has tested us all across society in ways we have never been tested before,"" he said. ""Nowhere has the pressure been more severe than in our health and social care system. ""All of us now have to work really hard to achieve a happier festive season. Please follow the public health advice and stay at home. Let's all redouble our efforts and look after each other."" Simon Hamilton, chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, said trust in the executive was now at ""rock bottom"", as a result of the decision taken to close non-essential retail again.

He said: ""The decision to close retail is probably the biggest boost to online shopping in Northern Ireland since the invention of the internet. ""It cannot be understated what damage a decision to close shops at this time will do to jobs."" While Glyn Roberts of Retail NI warned the decision would ""kill small businesses, rather than the virus"". ""In the next week, we will see a huge rush of shoppers to our high streets, which clearly will not help with social distancing,"" he said. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said he accepted the executive's decision but said the timing could not be worse. ""November and December are peak trading months and millions of pounds per week will be lost in sales during what should be our busiest period,"" he said. ""We are asking the executive urgently to provide clarity about the criteria for reopening and to ensure that affected businesses are adequately supported in the coming months."" Hospitality representatives have also criticised the decision to keep their sector closed for another two weeks from next Friday. Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said ministers should not underestimate the ""huge amount of anger"" across his industry. ""We now expect to meet with the health minister, chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser tomorrow for an urgent meeting with the hospitality industry steering group to start the process of working a way out of this awful situation,"" he added.

"The rheumatoid arthritis drugs tocilizumab appears to treat people who are critically ill with Covid-19, early trial data shows. The researchers in the UK and the Netherlands said it was ""an absolutely amazing result"". The drug is no longer being trialled as the researchers are so confident in the data, but the precise effect on survival is still being calculated. Other experts have urged caution until the full data is released. Tocilizumab targets the immune system, which goes into overdrive in some patients with coronavirus. It is this reaction, rather than the virus itself, which can be deadly. The trial was run by Imperial College London, the UK's Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre, and Utrecht University. It focused on the most severely ill patients, who needed to be put on a ventilator. Trials of the drug were stopped two days ago as independent monitors said there was enough evidence, from the first 303 patients, to show it was working. However, interpreting the results is complex. They show an improvement in ""outcomes"", but this is a statistical conflation of other measures such as survival rates and time in intensive care. Doctors know the drug is doing something, but it will take time to know whether it is saving lives or just speeding up recovery. ""We don't know that yet, we are hopeful it does both,"" said Prof Anthony Gordon from Imperial. However, he said it was ""very encouraging"", a ""big result"", and that tocilizumab could ""become the standard of care"". It will still take weeks to properly assess the data, which has not yet been formally published. The treatment costs between Â£500 and Â£1,000 and is given intravenously. Steroids,including dexamethasone, are the only drugs proven to be save lives from Covid-19 and they tend to calm the whole of the immune system. Tocilizumab targets specific parts within that complex system. The researchers hope they have found another. Dr Lennie Derde, an intensive care consultant at the University Medical Center in Utrecht, said: ""This is an absolutely amazing result. ""To have a second effective therapy for critically ill patients within months of the start of the pandemic is unprecedented."" However, other experts have urged caution until the final results are analysed, as previous studies have given a mixed picture. Prof Peter Horby, who was part of the team at the University of Oxford that showed dexamethasone was protective, said: ""This is an encouraging result which suggests that other, more targeted, anti-inflammatory drugs may also help. ""The results so far on tocilizumab have been mixed, with four randomised controlled trials having reported results, of which two were negative and two were positive... I eagerly look forward to seeing the full results."" FollowJameson Twitter,external At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Russia has converted an ice rink into a field hospital amid a surge in cases A ""tough"" six months lies ahead for Europe, which is again the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Hans Kluge, WHO Europe director, said the continent had recorded more than 29,000 new Covid-19 deaths last week. However, he said new cases were declining as lockdowns curb infections. And at a virtual summit on Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc could approve two vaccines by year's end. Most European countries reintroduced tight restrictions to stem the spread of the disease as a second wave of the pandemic gathered pace in October. So far, Europe has seen 15,738,179 confirmed infections and 354,154 deaths attributed to the coronavirus, with only the Americas reporting higher region-wide figures,according to WHO data,external. Tracking the global coronavirus outbreak A large portion of those infections and deaths have been registered in the UK, Russia, France, Spain, Italy and Germany. In Europe, the UK has the highest death toll at 53,870, while France has the highest number of cases at 2,115,717. He said Europe accounted for 28% of global cases and 26% of deaths. He expressed particular concern over the situation in Switzerland and France, where intensive care units are at 95% capacity. ""Europe is once again the epicentre of the pandemic, together with the United States,"" Mr Kluge told a news conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, adding that latest figures showed there was ""one person dying every 17 seconds"". ""There is light at the end of the tunnel but it will be a tough six months,"" he said, referring to the development of vaccines. The development of vaccines, which train the immune system to fight off the virus, have raised hopes of bringing the pandemic under control. Four vaccines - Oxford, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sputnik and Moderna - have reported good preliminary data. EU leaders discussed the pandemic response at a virtual summit on Thursday. Mrs von der Leyen said the European Medicines Agency could give ""conditional marketing authorisation"" for the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines ""as early as the second half of December if all proceeds now without any problem"". This video can not be played Europe's streets empty ""We will continue co-ordinating our efforts to keep citizens informed on vaccination,"" she added. EU leaders have come up with a â¬1.8tn (Â£1.6tn) EU budget until 2027. including a â¬750bn coronavirus recovery fund. ButHungary and Poland have blocked approval of the budget, over a clause that ties funding with adherence to the rule of law in the bloc. EU faces high-stakes challenge to Covid budget Meanwhile, researchers in the UK and the Netherlands have said thata drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis - tocilizumab - appears to treat people who are critically ill with Covid-19. The findings are the results of early data from a trial focusing on the most severely ill patients - some experts have urged caution until the full data is released. How many coronavirus vaccines will there be? How do we know if vaccines are safe? Mr Kluge said recent progress on vaccines was promising, but did not yet represent ""a silver bullet"" because ""we know the supply will be limited particularly in the beginning"". In the meantime, social distancing and wearing a mask remained the best ways to mitigate the spread of the virus, he said. ""Lockdowns are avoidable, I stand by my position that lockdowns are a last resort measure,"" Mr Kluge said. ""Mask use is by no means a panacea, and needs to be done in combination with other measures. However, if mask use reached 95%, lockdowns would not be needed."" France is in its second national lockdown, with people only allowed to leave home to go to work or school, buy essential goods, seek medical help or exercise for one hour a day. Anyone going outside must carry a written statement justifying their journey. French Health Minister Olivier Veran said that while it was too soon to lift restrictions, the virus was not circulating as widely as before the latest measures were introduced. He told a news conference that anxiety and uncertainty caused by the pandemic was affecting the mental health of the population but that ""we must not reduce our efforts"". In Italy, where Covid-related deaths have already more than doubled in November compared with October, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte warned that Christmas would look very different this year. ""Big parties, kisses and hugs will not be possible, this would mean an abrupt rise in the [infection] curve in January,"" he said, adding: ""We hope that we can still buy and exchange gifts."" Scientists advising the UK government have raised similar concerns, warning that mixing between households at Christmas could pose ""substantial risks"", particularly for older people more vulnerable to coronavirus. Another 22,915 daily cases of Covid were recorded in the UK,externalon Thursday, and there were 501 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the government's dashboard shows. Russia is also recording more than 20,000 new cases each day. Authorities in the capital Moscow have opened five field hospitals to help cope, including one in an ice rink.

"Barack Obama described Vladimir Putin as ""tough, street-smart, unsentimental"" Former US President Barack Obama likens Russia's Vladimir Putin to a tough Chicago ""ward boss"" and describes former French President Nicolas Sarkozy as being full of ""overblown rhetoric"" in the first volume of his two-part memoir. A Promised Land sold nearly 890,000 copies in the US and Canada in its first 24 hours - a record for publisher Penguin Random House. It is expected to become by far the biggest-selling presidential memoir in history. In the book, Mr Obama recalls his travels around the world as the 44th US president and his meetings with world leaders. So who made a good impression and who didn't? The Eton-educated conservative who served as UK prime minister from 2010-2016 was ""urbane and confident"" and had ""the easy confidence of someone who'd never been pressed too hard by life"". Mr Obama said he warmed to him as a person (""I liked him personally, even when we butted heads"") but made no secret of the fact that he disagreed with his economic policies. ""Cameron hewed closely to free-market orthodoxy, having promised voters that his platform of deficit reduction and cuts to government services - along with regulatory reform and expanded trade - would usher in a new era of British competitiveness,"" he wrote. ""Instead, predictably, the British economy would fall deeper into a recession."" This video can not be played Barack Obama and David Cameron team-up for table tennis at the Globe Academy in south London Mr Obama said the Russian leader reminded him of the political barons he encountered during his early career in Chicago. He writes he was ""like a ward [district] boss, except with nukes and a UN Security Council veto"". He continues: ""Putin did, in fact, remind me of the sorts of men who had once run the Chicago machine or Tammany Hall [a New York City political organisation] - tough, street-smart, unsentimental characters who knew what they knew, who never moved outside their narrow experiences, and who viewed patronage, bribery, shakedowns, fraud, and occasional violence as legitimate tools of the trade."" The former French president was ""all emotional outbursts and overblown rhetoric"" and like ""a figure out of a Toulouse-Lautrec painting"", according to Mr Obama. ""Conversations with Sarkozy were by turns amusing and exasperating, his hands in perpetual motion, his chest thrust out like a bantam cock's, his personal translator... always beside him to frantically mirror his every gesture and intonation as the conversation swooped from flattery to bluster to genuine insight, never straying from his primary, barely disguised interest, which was to be at the centre of the action and take credit for whatever it was that might be worth taking credit for."" Barack Obama said he liked Nicolas Sarkozy's ""boldness, charm and manic energy"" The German leader is referred to as ""steady, honest, intellectually rigorous, and instinctually kind"". Mr Obama notes that she had, at first, been sceptical of him, because of his lofty rhetoric and speech-making skills. ""I took no offence, figuring that as a German leader, an aversion to possible demagoguery was probably a healthy thing."" Barack Obama described Angela Merkel as ""honest"" and ""kind"" Mr Obama found the Turkish leader to be ""cordial and generally responsive to my requests"". ""But whenever I listened to him speak, his tall frame slightly stooped, his voice a forceful staccato that rose an octave in response to various grievances or perceived slights. I got the strong impression that his commitment to democracy and the rule of law might last only as long as it preserved his own power."" The former Indian prime minister is described as having been ""wise, thoughtful, and scrupulously honest"" and the ""chief architect of India's economic transformation"". Mr Singh was a ""self-effacing technocrat who'd won the people's trust not by appealing to their passions but bringing about higher living standards and maintaining a well-earned reputation for not being corrupt"", Mr Obama observes. Obama memoir praises India opposition leaders I read all those Trump tell-alls. Here's what I learned Barack Obama met VÃ¡clav Klaus (c) and the then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Prague in 2010 Mr Obama was an admirer of VÃ¡clav Havel - the Czech Republic's first president after the Velvet Revolution - but found his successor VÃ¡clav Klaus more troubling. Mr Obama writes that he feared the Eurosceptic president signalled a rise of right-wing populism across Europe and embodied ""how the economic crisis [of 2008-9] was causing an uptick in nationalism, anti-immigrant sentiment, and scepticism about [European] integration"". He added: ""The hopeful tide of democratisation, liberalisation, and integration that had swept the globe after the end of the Cold War was beginning to recede.""

"Governments across the UK face a ""difficult balance"" in easing Covid-19 restrictions for Christmas, Scotland's first minister has warned. Nicola Sturgeon took part in UK-wide talks on Wednesday as part of efforts to find a ""sensible and safe plan"" to lift restrictions. Ms Sturgeon said she hoped to be able to announce further details next week. But she said it was important to ensure it did not cause a spike in the number of cases - and deaths - in January. About 2.3m people in western and central Scotland are to be subject to the top level of Covid restrictions from 18:00 on Friday in a bid to drive down ""stubbornly high"" levels of the virus ahead of the festive period. A survey for BBC Scotland has suggested that many Scots are happy for the government to set ""strict rules"" to contain the pandemic, but that a majority would also like a break from them over the festive period. Do Scots back a Christmas break from restrictions? Level 4 move could 'ease' Christmas rules for Scots Talks have been held between leaders in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland to agree a ""common approach"" to relaxing restrictionsto allow family get-togethers. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament on Friday that reducing the number of people who have the virus by Christmas would obviously lower the risk of it being transmitted to others. At her weekly question session, Ms Sturgeon said officials had been tasked with drawing up a ""sensible and safe plan to allow people a greater degree of normality over Christmas"", and said she would announce further details next week. However, she said a balance had to be struck between allowing people some leeway to celebrate together, while avoiding a major spike in the number of cases. She said: ""We are determined to strike the right balance between the understandable desire - which I share - to see family over the Christmas period, but also to do that in a way that does not lead to increased loss of life and harm to health over January."" This echoed a warning from one scientist who advises the government, Prof Andrew Hayward, who said mixing households at Christmascould pose ""substantial risks""to older and more vulnerable people. Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson pressed Ms Sturgeon for details, asking if ""the current restrictions are the price for a relaxation this Christmas"", or ""if we have to start preparing ourselves now for a January shutdown too"". Ms Sturgeon said it was important to drive down prevalence of the virus in advance of any easing of the rules, saying this would lower the risk of infections spreading when people are allowed to meet. She added: ""I don't underestimate what a difficult balance this will be for all of us to strike. I want people to have a degree of normality over Christmas, but I don't want to be in a position of the country having to live with a death toll that could have been avoidable if we get that balance wrong."" The first minister also said the government was working to provide extra support to older people and ""anyone who is on their own"" through winter, and was considering a specific ""loneliness campaign"". New laws restricting travel in many areas of Scotland are due to come into force on Friday Meanwhile, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard urged the first minister to drop plans to enforce travel restrictions in law. From 18:00 on Friday the police will be able to impose fines on people who travel in or out of areas which are in level three or four without a reasonable excuse. Mr Leonard said the move was a ""red herring"" which would confuse and potentially criminalise people. He said the government should instead focus on properly resourcing the testing and tracing system and providing comprehensive support for health workers and businesses. Ms Sturgeon said the rules and exemptions had beenpublished on the Scottish government website,external, adding that it was ""absolutely incumbent"" on her to ""do the right thing"" even if it was not popular. She said ""a significant proportion"" of the population was moving into the highest level of restrictions, and said ""we must avoid taking the virus from high prevalence areas to low prevalence ones"".

"The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have marked their 73rd wedding anniversary by releasing a photograph showing them opening a card from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children. The homemade gift was created by Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis and is emblazoned with 73. The photograph was taken earlier this week in the Oak Room at Windsor Castle. The Queen, 94, was a 21-year-old princess when she married Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten on 20 November 1947. Their enduring relationship has lasted the longest of any British sovereign. On Friday afternoon, Buckingham Palacetweeted a message thanking,external""everyone for their kind wishes"" for the Queen and Duke on their anniversary and sharing a picture of the couple on their honeymoon in Hampshire in 1947.

"This video can not be played Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger expressed disappointment his party lost, but said ""numbers don't lie"" US President-elect Joe Biden's narrow victory in Georgia has been officially certified by Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. It comes as legal efforts by Donald Trump's allies to challenge his defeat were dismissed in three other states. The Democrat beat his Republican rival in Georgia by 12,670 votes, according to the audit required by state law. Mr Raffensperger on Friday said he was disappointed that his party lost but that ""numbers don't lie"". Mr Biden is set to take office in January as the 46th US president. Mr Biden's victory margin in the public vote overall stands at more than 5.9 million. His victory in the US Electoral College system, which determines who becomes president, is projected to be 306 to 232 - far above the 270 he needs to win. Why Republicans are fighting in Georgia Melania Trump's hometown hopes its fame will last What is the electoral college? Mr Trump has so far refused to concede and has made allegations of widespread electoral fraud, without providing any evidence. The latest defeat comes as he has summoned Michigan state lawmakers to the White House on Friday ahead of that state's deadline to certify election results. White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany denied that Mr Trump was holding a campaign ""advocacy meeting"" with the lawmakers, saying it was instead a routine check-in with local officials. This video can not be played ""The campaign, which I won, by the way"": Trump falsely claims election win Also on Friday, Mr Trump gave a briefing from the White House on drug pricing, where he again falsely claimed to have won the election. In his first public appearance in a week, he took no questions and seemed to imply he knew another administration would take over soon. ""There will never be anything like this. I just hope they keep it,"" he said touting new rules aimed as reducing prescription drug costs. Mr Raffensperger said on Friday that the result had been certified,posting the result to the secretary of state's website,external. This video can not be played Joe Biden says Americans are ""witnessing incredible irresponsibility"" from Donald Trump On Thursday, Mr Raffensperger - who oversees the election process - said the hand audit of ballots had not altered Mr Biden's victory in the state. ""Georgia's historic first statewide audit reaffirmed thatthe state's new secure paper ballot voting system,externalaccurately counted and reported results,"" he said in a statement. On Friday, the self-proclaimed Trump supporter went on to say: ""Like other Republicans. I'm disappointed, our candidate didn't win Georgia's electoral votes. ""I live by the motto that numbers don't lie. As secretary of state, I believe that the numbers that we have presented today are correct."" The Democrats' victory is their first in a presidential race in Georgia since Bill Clinton was elected in 1992. The recount found the error rate was no greater than 0.73% in any county and Mr Biden's margin of victory over Mr Trump remained at under 0.5%. The results will be certified on Friday. Trump campaign senior legal adviser Jenna Ellis said the audit had gone ""exactly as we expected"" because, she said without evidence, the state had recounted illegal ballots. But Gabriel Sterling, a Republican who serves as Georgia's voting system implementation manager, told CNN on Thursday: ""One of the big complaints is these machines somehow flipped votes or changed votes or did stuff. They didn't, at least not in Georgia. We proved it."" During the audit this week, nearly 6,000 untallied votes were found - paring back Mr Biden's lead slightly - but they were the result of human error and not fraud, Mr Sterling said. This video can not be played BBC Reality Check breaks down the bill for the world's most expensive election Officials in Floyd County have fired their election manager over the matter, local media reported on Thursday. He was speaking after a virtual meeting with governors, including Democrats and Republicans, about the coronavirus crisis on Thursday. Asked about Mr Trump's lack of concession, Mr Biden said the president was sending ""incredibly damaging messages... to the rest of the world about how democracy functions"" and that he would be remembered ""as being one of the most irresponsible presidents in American history"". This video can not be played How to move on after the US election ""It's hard to fathom how this man thinks,"" he continued, adding: ""It's just outrageous what he's doing."" Of the election result, the  president-elect - who is due to take office in January - said: ""The vast majority of people believe it's legitimate."" Republican SenatorMitt Romney, who lost to Barack Obama in 2012, echoed Mr Biden in a tweet,external, slamming Mr Trump's ""overt pressure on state and local officials to subvert the will of the people and overturn the election"". ""It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action by a sitting American President,"" he wrote. Republicans lost their final lawsuit inGeorgiaas a court rejected their effort to block the results' certification, which happened on Friday. The judge who dismissed the case was appointed by Mr Trump last year. InArizona, a judge rejected a lawsuit filed last week by the state Republican Party seeking a new audit of ballots in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix - the state capital and largest city. InPennsylvania, the Trump campaign lost their bid in state court to throw out more than 2,000 postal ballots. At a Thursday briefing, Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani continued to lay out unsubstantiated conspiracy theories and accusations of electoral fraud. He railed against the reporting of his team's legal challenges, saying the media had shown an ""irrational pathological hatred for the president"". What legal challenges is Trump planning? Mr Giuliani also said the campaign was withdrawing its last remaining lawsuit inMichigan. He said it had achieved its aim of stopping the certification of the result in one key county. However, the vice-chairman of Wayne County's canvassing board said an attempt by its two Republican members to rescind their earlier certification of the result was invalid, and the certification was binding. One of the Republicans said Mr Trump had called her personally after the vote had been certified ""to make sure I was safe"". Mr Biden won the county by a huge margin, according to unofficial results, and prevailed in Michigan by about 146,000 votes. One possibility that US media are speculating on is that he will try to get Republican-friendly state legislatures in key states to override the choice of voters and instead select members of the US Electoral College who would be favourable to the president. Mr Trump has invited Michigan's Republican lawmakers to the White House on Friday, hinting at a possible change in tactics. Michigan is one state Mr Trump is attempting to flip Instead of winning by direct popular vote, a US president must accumulate a majority of ""electors"" that each state is designated according to its congressional representation. Most states determine these based on who won the popular vote there. But federal law says statehouse legislators have the power to pick electors if the state has ""failed to make a choice"". This would appear a long shot as no evidence of electoral fraud has been shown and to potentially disenfranchise millions of voters would spark uproar. Reuters news agency quoted one source familiar with the Trump strategy as saying it was now a ""more targeted approach towards getting the legislators engaged"". But one of the Michigan lawmakers going to the White House, Mike Shirkey, said earlier this week that the legislature appointing electors was ""not going to happen"". What happens now? What Trump could do after leaving the White House Making history - the first woman vice-president How is President Trump challenging the result?

"Stuart says his novel is ""a love story looking at that unconditional, often tested love that children can have for flawed parents"" Douglas Stuart has won the Booker Prize for Shuggie Bain, his debut novel about a boy in 1980s Glasgow trying to support his mother as she struggles with addiction and poverty. Chair of judges Margaret Busby said the judges' decision was unanimous and they only ""took an hour to decide"". The book is ""challenging, intimate and gripping... anyone who reads it will never feel the same"" she said. Stuart, 44, said he was ""absolutely stunned"" to win. He dedicated his book and his prize to his mother, who died of alcoholism when he was 16. The writer added he would like to give his fellow nominees ""a hug"" and that the ""greatest gift"" was being able to ""touch readers' lives"". He toldBBC Radio 4's Today programmethe book was ""turned down 32 times"" before it was finally published. ""As someone writing a working class story - as a boy I always felt excluded by booksâ¦ - it pays to persevere, and I'm so grateful to be here now,"" he said. Listen: Douglas Stuart on the huge response to Shuggie Bain The novel follows the life of Agnes Bain, who is descending into despair and struggling with alcohol after the breakdown of her marriage. All but one of her children have been driven away by her deterioration, and that child, Shuggie, struggles to help Agnes while suffering huge personal problems of his own. This year's nominees are (clockwise from top left): Tsitsi Dangarembga, Avni Doshi, Maaza Mengiste, Douglas Stuart, Diane Cook and Brandon Taylor. The novel is ""destined to be a classic"" and is ""full of such emotional rage, a book that can make you laugh as well as make you cry"", Busby said. ""It's dealing with tough subject matter, with characters not having an easy time - some of the things that happen will make you smile but it's not one where everyone lives happily ever after. ""It's not a pleasant read, but it's a hopeful read, challenging, intimate, gripping."" Stuart, who grew up in Glasgow and lives in New York, is the second Scot to win the prize, following James Kelman in 1994 for How Late it Was, How Late. Stuart hassaid the book changed his life,externalbecause it was one of the first times he had seen his people and dialect on the page. Barack Obama spoke about ""fiction's power to put ourselves in someone else's shoes"" The writer, who made New York his home to start a career in fashion design, started writing his book a decade ago. He told the BBC Shuggie Bain was ""a love story looking at that unconditional, often tested love that children can have for flawed parents"". ""I'm sorry if I make it sound like a bleak book, it's actually very funny, it's tender and there's a lot of intimacy and love. I think that's the Glaswegian spirit. Growing up in Glasgow was, I think, probably one of the greatest inspirations of my life,"" he said. ""Part of the reason Shuggie is queer is because I am queer and I grew up in Glasgow. I also liked the balance Shuggie offered to Agnes because it's really about how these two are receding from the world, and how they cling to each other and rely on each other,"" he added. He said after his win that ""for 30 years I've carried a lot of loss and love and pain, so I wanted to say what it is like... to write this has been hugely cathartic"". The writer said that getting on the Booker longlist made a huge difference to him, as it was published just before lockdown in the US, resulting in sales being ""swallowed"" by the coronavirus pandemic. He is hoping the prize money will help him ""focus on my writing"", which will now be his main career, as well as help him return to Glasgow. ""I married an American which is why I'm here but my heart is in Scotland. My family are all still there. I'm always looking for a way home,"" he said. The ceremony, broadcast from London's Roundhouse, included contributions from the Duchess of Cornwall and former US President Barack Obama. Sir Kazuo Ishiguro, who won the 1989 Booker for The Remains of the Day, was also part of the socially distanced proceedings, along with last year'sjoint winners Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo. Gaby Wood, the literary director of the Booker Prize Foundation, said the judges were under strict instructions not to have more than one winner for this year's Â£50,000 prize. She added that under new guidelines, if they could not agree on a winner, a majority vote would be honoured. By Rebecca Jones, BBC arts correspondent Hurrah! The Booker Judges do not always get it right, but this year they are spot on. For me, Shuggie Bain was undoubtedly the best novel on this year's shortlist. Be warned though. It is not an easy read. A haunting story of poverty and addiction in 1980s Scotland, it can be grim and upsetting. Douglas Stuart has said it made him feel ""quite sad"" writing it. I admit, there was only so much I could read at a time. But it is also a novel that is full of love and compassion. Shuggie is a sweet, gentle soul who is ""no right"", longs to be normal and will do anything for his mother, despite their chaotic life. And while Agnes is selfish and self-destructive, she can be warm and funny too. You root for both of them, hoping they find happiness. Both characters get under your skin. Agnes and Shuggie became part of my life and I still think about them, long after I finished the novel. That is a real achievement, especially for a debut novel. Douglas Stuart said he grew up in a house with no books. Now he has won the biggest prize in publishing. He deserves it. The duchess said: ""While Covid deprived us of so many cultural pleasures - we have, at least, been able to read. And as long as we can read, we can travel, we can escape, we can explore, we can laugh, we can cry and we can grapple with life's mysteries."" Mr Obama added: 'I've always turned to writing to make sense of our world â¦ And at their best, Booker Prize-listed books remind me of fiction's power to put ourselves in someone else's shoes, understand their struggles, and imagine new ways to tackle complex problems and effect change."" Sir Kazuo said the award is best at ""shining a light on a career of a writer who's been writing very brilliantly but far from the limelight"". Last year the judges could not choose between Margaret Atwood and Bernardine Evaristo The Booker prize is open to any novel written in English by an author of any nationality and four of this year's nominated books were  written by debut novelists. All of this year's nominees are based outside the UK.

"Dr Cathy Gardner with her father Michael Gibson, who died aged 88 in a care home in Oxfordshire in April A woman whose father died with Covid has won the first stage of a legal challenge over measures taken to protect those living in care homes. Dr Cathy Gardner, from Sidmouth in Devon, claims there was a failure to implement ""adequate"" measures to protect residents. It follows the death of her father in an Oxfordshire care home in April. The government and health bodies oppose Dr Gardner's challenge and asked the judge to dismiss the case. Dr Gardner said: ""This is for the thousands of families affected by the loss of loved ones in care homes since March."" At a remote hearing on Thursday, Mr Justice Linden granted Dr Gardner permission for a full hearing of her challenge. He said: ""I consider it in the interests of justice for the claim to be heard."" Dr Gardner, who is bringing her case alongside Fay Harris, argues certain key policies and decisions led to a ""shocking death toll"" of care home residents. These include an alleged policy of discharging patients from hospital into care homes without testing and suitable isolation arrangements. The legal action is being brought against the Department for Health and Social Care, NHS England and Public Health England. Dr Gardner, who has a PhD in virology, said her legal team would ask ""to see the evidence behind the decisions that they took, how those decisions were taken, who was involved in discussions, why they decided to discharge people from hospital without testing and why they didn't commence any sort of real protection of people in care homes"". Sir James Eadie QC, barrister for the government and PHE, said the challenge was ""unarguable"". In court documents, he said: ""The government was faced with unprecedented challenges and fast-evolving scientific advice. ""Throughout the period in issue it considered how best to protect older people both within and outside care homes. ""That involved making a series of judgments based on expert scientific advice, in an area in which the science was uncertain and evolving. ""There is no arguable basis on which to conclude that those judgments fell outside the range of reasonable responses to the pandemic as it, and understanding of it, developed.""

Gladys Lewis, 74, from Pentre, and sons Dean, 44, Darren, 42, from Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf,died within a week. On Thursday people gathered outside St Peter's Church in Pentre to listen to the funeral service through loudspeakers. Their family urged people to ""do their part"" to curb the spread of the virus. Relatives had previously described how the family had been careful to avoid catching Covid-19 because Gladys had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Darren, who had Down's syndrome, had been on life support with pneumonia earlier in the year. Father Philip Leyshon and Father Haydn England Simon wear PPE face visors as they stand beside the coffins of Gladys, Dean and Darren Lewis the evening before their funeral Relatives, who were inside the church, had wanted the three funerals to be held at the same time so that they could be together. Mourners wore masks and clapped as the three coffins were taken through the town. Father Haydn England-Simon, who led the service, said no family ""should ever go through"" what the Lewises had. David Lewis and his wife Gladys ""adored each other"" Grandmother Gladys Lewis died at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 29 October. The next day her eldest son Dean was found unresponsive at his home in Treorchy. He had only gone out once a week to shop for his parents. His younger brother Darren died on 2 November after being treated in intensive care at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital. The family were unable to be with Darren before his death, due to them testing positive for Covid-19 and having to self-isolate.

"Fifteen pro-democracy lawmakers resigned this month in protest at China's new rules China has strongly rebuked the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada after being accused of a concerted effort to silence critics in Hong Kong. The countries, which form the Five Eyes alliance, criticised China's imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong. They urged Beijing to reverse course. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman responded that if countries ""dared harm China's sovereignty, they should beware that their eyes could be blinded"". ""The Chinese never stir trouble , but they aren't afraid of trouble either,""  Zhao Lijian told journalists in Beijing on Thursday, saying it did not ""matter if they had five or 10 eyes"". Chinaâs new brand of tough-talking diplomats Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? Why people are scared of Hong Kong's new law Last week, Hong Kong expelled four pro-democracy lawmakers from its legislature after Beijing passed a resolution allowing the city's government to dismiss politicians deemed a threat to national security. In response,all of Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers announced their resignation.For the first time since the UK handed the territory back to China in 1997, the body has almost no dissenting voices. This video can not be played Claudia Mo: ""We have given up the legislative fight at least for the time being."" The dismissal of the four lawmakers was viewed by many as the latest attempt by China to restrict Hong Kong's freedoms, something Beijing denies. Foreign ministers from the Five Eyes group urged China to reinstate them, saying the move was a clear breach of Beijing's legally binding commitments to protect the territory's freedoms and autonomy. They also accused Beijing of undermining the rights of people in Hong Kong to elect their representatives. Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing alliance of the five Anglophone countries set up during the Cold War and initially developed to monitor the USSR and its allies. Earlier, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said any attempt by foreign states to threaten or pressure Beijing to make concessions was ""doomed to fail"". This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Hong Kong was returned to China under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which allowed it to retain more rights and freedoms than the mainland until 2047. As a Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong was to have its own legal system, multiple political parties, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech. But in late June China passed a controversial, far-reaching national security law in the territory after years of pro-democracy and anti-Beijing protests, which reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. It criminalises ""secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces"". Beijing says the law will return stability to the territory, but western governments and human rights groups say it effectively curtails freedom of speech and protest. After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety. Earlier this month, a reporter who helped investigate suspected police involvement in a violent attack on protesters last year was arrested, in whatjournalists said was a tactic to discourage reporting. In response to the security law, theUK offered Hong Kong residents still holding British National Overseas (BNO) statusa route to British citizenship. Around 300,000 people currently hold BNO passports, while an estimated 2.9 million people born before the handover are eligible for one.China last month strongly criticised the UKin response, telling London to ""immediately correct its mistakes"".

"Eamonn Harrison, pictured at a Belgian truck stop on 22 October 2019, denies manslaughter A lorry driver accused over the deaths of 39 migrants has told a court he was watching Netflix as people were allegedly loaded into his trailer. Eamonn Harrison dropped off a trailer containing Vietnamese migrants at a Belgian port and they were found dead the next day in Essex, jurors heard. Mr Harrison told the court he did not know there were people in the trailer. The 23-year-old, of Newry, County Down, denies manslaughter and being involved in a wider people-smuggling operation. The court had previously been told the 39 victims, aged 15 to 44, suffocated in the sealed trailer en route from Zeebrugge to Purfleet in Essex. Irish haulier boss Ronan Hughes, 41, and lorry driver Maurice Robinson, 26, have previously admitted manslaughter. Giving evidence in an Old Bailey trial Mr Harrison told jurors he had agreed to deal with ""stolen goods"" as he owed Mr Hughes over a drink-drive accident. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, and Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, were among the victims The court heard on 22 October 2019 Mr Harrison parked his lorry in northern France and said he expected to take a consignment of Coca-Cola before speaking with Mr Hughes, who instead told him it would be ""a load of stolen goods"". He said he waited for 30 minutes for a Romanian he knew as Alex to arrive before setting off to get breakfast at McDonald's. Mr Harrison said: ""Ronan was in contact with me to tell me to turn around and the man was there."" He said Alex was not present but another eastern European was and ""he clearly knew the lorry, what it was there for"". ""He goes to me, 'are you OK?' I said yes. He was telling me where he wanted me to go. His English was not really the best."" The bodies of 39 Vietnamese nationals were discovered in a refrigerated trailer on 23 October last year Mr Harrison said the man told him to ""close the curtains"" and ""lie down"" once he had moved his lorry. He did as he was told and watched ""a wee bit of Netflix"" in bed, Mr Harrison told the court. He told jurors: ""I got a bang on the door. He gives me a thumbs up and I move off. That's what I did. It was fairly quick, five minutes."" Alisdair Williamson QC, defending, asked Mr Harrison: ""Did you - in order to work off your debt to Mr Hughes - agree that human beings could be put in the back of your trailer?"" ""No I did not,"" Mr Harrison replied. During cross-examination, prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones said it was ""my case that you shut them into your trailer. Did you?"" Mr Harrison replied: ""No I did not."" When questioned further he added: ""I did not know they were [in the trailer]."" Mr Harrison and Gheorge Nica, 43, of Basildon, Essex, deny 39 counts of manslaughter. Mr Harrison, lorry driver Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota, 37, of Birmingham, have denied being part of a wider people-smuggling conspiracy, which Nica has admitted he was involved in.

"The move to fund free school meals will cost more than Â£40m The Department of Education (DE) will pay for free school meals for eligible children during all school holidays until April 2022. The move has been approved by the Northern Ireland executive and will cost more than Â£40m. It means the families of approximately 100,000 children will receive payments when children are off school. Education Minister Peter Weir said the payments would begin during the Christmas break in 2020. Footballer Marcus Rashford has led calls for similar supportto be provided during holiday periods in England. In Northern Ireland, payments to those eligible for free school meals were previously made over the summer and half-term holidays in 2020. Families of about 97,000 childrenreceived payments of Â£27 every fortnight per child in lieu of free meals. Rashford welcomes school holiday support NI Executive to extend free school meals scheme Funding of Â£12m confirmed for free school meals Those families will now receive a similar two week payment from the week beginning Monday 14 December. Those payments will continue over the half-term, Easter, summer and Christmas holidays in 2021 and until Easter 2022. Mr Weir said he welcomed the decision the Executive had taken to support the department's proposal. ""This is very good news, especially for those families who are struggling financially during this pandemic,"" he said. ""The issue of 'holiday hunger' has become an increasing concern this year. Peter Weir says access to a health nutritious meal should be ""a basic right for all children"" ""I realise the vital importance for children who normally receive a free school meal to have access to a nutritious meal without placing their family under further hardship in these difficult times. ""Access to a healthy nutritious meal should be a basic right for all children and it is vital that we continue this support to ensure children and young people come back to school after holiday periods, healthy and ready to learn. ""Their future depends on it,"" he added. The decision was welcomed by the Children in Northern Ireland charity. Their chief executive Pauline Leeson said the executive had taken a ""courageous"" decision. ""This is a major step for every parent who struggles to find the money for meals outside term time, every child and young person who might otherwise go hungry and for every organisation who has stepped up and provided holiday hunger projects,"" she said.

"Protesters have condemned President Macron over his comments about Islam French President Emmanuel Macron has asked Muslim leaders to agree a ""charter of republican values"" as part of a broad clampdown on radical Islam. On Wednesday he gave the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) 15 days to work with the interior ministry. The CFCM has agreed to create a National Council of Imams, which will reportedly issue imams with official accreditation which could be withdrawn. It follows three suspected Islamist attacks in little more than a month. The charter will state that Islam is a religion and not a political movement, while also prohibiting ""foreign interference"" in Muslim groups. Mr Macron has strongly defended French secularism in the wake of the attacks, which included the beheading of a teacher who showed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class discussion last month. France targets radical Islam amid row with Turkey Anti-France rallies held globally as tensions rise Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France Late on Wednesday, the president and his interior minister, GÃ©rald Darmanin, met eight CFCM leaders at the ÃlysÃ©e palace.

The formation of the National Council of Imams was also agreed upon. This video can not be played French President Emmanuel Macron says France 'will never give in' President Macron has also announced new measures to tackle what he called ""Islamist separatism"" in France. The measures include a wide-ranging bill that seeks to prevent radicalisation. It was unveiled on Wednesday, and includes measures such as: Restrictions on home-schooling and harsher punishments for those who intimidate public officials on religious grounds Extending to all children a national identification number (INE) that would be used under the law to ensure they are attending school. These numbers already exist inside the school system but would also include home-schooled children and those in some private schools. Parents who break the law could face up to six months in jail as well as large fines A ban on sharing the personal information of a person in a way that allows them to be located by people who want to harm them ""We must save our children from the clutches of the Islamists,"" Mr Darmanin told the Le Figaro newspaper on Wednesday. The draft law will be discussed by the French cabinet on 9 December. This video can not be played The French president led a vigil for Samuel Paty in Paris, attended by Mr Paty's family and about 400 guests Samuel Paty, the teacher who was killed outside his school last month, was targeted by an online hate campaign before his death on 16 October. Le Monde newspaper has published emails sent between Paty and colleagues in the days after he showed the cartoons in class. ""It's really distressing and particularly as it comes from a family whose child wasn't in my lesson and isn't someone I know,"" Paty wrote. ""It's becoming a malicious rumour."" He later wrote in a separate email: ""I won't do any more teaching on this topic - I'll choose another freedom as a subject for teaching."" Earlier this year, President Macron described Islam as a religion ""in crisis"" and defended the right of magazines to publish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. Such depictions are widely regarded as taboo in Islam and are considered highly offensive by many Muslims. Following these comments, the French leader became a figure of hate in several Muslim-majority countries. Protesters have also called for a boycott of French products. In France, state secularism (laÃ¯citÃ©) is central to the country's national identity. Freedom of expression in schools and other public spaces is part of that, and curbing it to protect the feelings of a particular religion is seen as undermining national unity. France has Western Europe's largest Muslim population. Clarification 23 November: This article has been amended to make clear that identification numbers already exist for many school pupils, but under these plans would be extended to include all children.

"Twenty-one people were killed in two blasts on 21 November 1974 A man arrested in connection with the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings which killed 21 people is reported to be Michael Patrick Reilly. The blasts at the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on the night of 21 November also injured 220 people. Police said a man, 65, was held at his Belfast home on Wednesday under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and would be questioned in Northern Ireland. Mr Reilly has strongly denied any involvement in the bombings. Inquests into the deaths of those killed in the bombings found they were unlawfully killed West Midlands Police added the address was being searched and the man was to be interviewed under caution at a police station. Fresh inquests last year ruled the victims were unlawfully killed, but did not establish who was responsible. Six men, who became known as the Birmingham Six, were wrongly jailed for the bombings in 1975 following a botched police investigation, but their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991. Saturday marks the 46th anniversary of the bombings and the arrest comes within a month of an announcement from Home Secretary Priti Patel that she would consider the case for a public inquiry into the attacks.

"Coleen Rooney accused Rebekah Vardy of leaking stories to the press about her private life in 2019 Coleen Rooney ""pointed the finger"" at Rebekah Vardy as ""the villain"" who leaked stories to the press about her private life, the High Court has heard. The wife of ex-England footballer Wayne Rooney was dubbed ""Wagatha Christie"" for her ""sting operation"" involving posting false stories on Instagram which later appeared in The Sun. Mrs Rooney then said the source of those leaks was the account of Mrs Vardy. She is suing Mrs Rooney for libel. Mrs Vardy, 38, was accused by Mrs Rooney of leaking stories over the course of five months. She denies the accusation. At the High Court, Mrs Vardy's barrister Hugh Tomlinson QC said Mrs Rooney's posts were an ""untrue and unjustified defamatory attack... published and republished to millions of people"". He said the spat had been trivialised in the media as ""wag wars"" but ""the impact on Mrs Vardy was not trivial"". Rebekah Vardy was pictured arriving at training for ITV's Dancing On Ice in Nottingham on Thursday Last year Mrs Rooney said she planted three false stories on her Instagram stories and blocked all users except for Mrs Vardy's account. Court documents say the three fake stories that appeared in The Sun consisted of Mrs Rooney travelling to Mexico to ""see what this gender selection is all about"", returning to TV, and the basement flooding in her house. On a Twitter post, she wrote: ""I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. ""It's ................ Rebekah Vardy's account."" Mr Tomlinson said Mrs Rooney's social media post made it clear that the person accused of leaking the stories ""is Rebekah Vardy, the finger is being pointed at her, as the villain, the person, the someone, the one person"". The Twitter backlash led some social media users to link Mrs Vardy with ""the disappearance of Madeline McCann"", and joke she was the new leader of the so-called Islamic State group, the barrister added. Mr Tomlinson wrote that the accusations had made Mrs Vardy feel suicidal, she had taken three trips to the hospital due to anxiety, and had fears she would lose her baby due to the stress of the situation. Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy was the subject of ridicule from opposition fans The written statement claims Mrs Vardy's footballer husband Jamie has also been the subject of ridicule, with opposition supporters shouting taunting chants such as ""Becky Vardy's a grass"". Mrs Rooney's legal team claims Mrs Vardy ""was in fact responsible for consistently passing on information about the defendant's private Instagram posts and stories to The Sun"". David Sherbourne, representing Mrs Rooney, stated in written submissions the message readers would take away from Mrs Rooney's tweet was ""it was Rebekah Vardy's account that was the source of private stories about the defendant appearing in The Sun - not Rebekah Vardy herself"". He added: ""The fact that these sting operation stories also then appeared in The Sun... is the reason why the defendant published the post which is the subject of this claim."" Mrs Vardy's counsel Hugh Tomlinson QC and Mrs Rooney's representative David Sherbourne made representations to Mr Justice Warby at the preliminary hearing Mr Tomlinson said both Mrs Vardy and Mrs Rooney had agreed for a ""stay"" of proceedings until February, so there could be ""one final attempt to resolve the matter without the need for a full trial"". Neither Mrs Rooney nor Mrs Vardy attended the preliminary hearing in London. At the hearing, Mr Justice Warby was asked to determine the ""natural and ordinary"" meaning of Mrs Rooney's posts. The judge said he would give his ruling on Friday afternoon. The hearing took place at the High Court in London Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

For the occupied West Bank, only people returning from East Jerusalem would not need to quarantine. The rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip are not covered by the lifting of the rules. Scotland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith said it had been decided not to change the country's travel corridor list this week. It comes as more thantwo million people are to be placed under Scotland's toughest Covid lockdown restrictions from Friday. Dr Smith said: ""This approach aligns with the other home nations when they went into stricter measures several weeks ago and we will continue to closely monitor the global situation.""

"Stormont ministers are continuing to meet in a bid to reach agreement on further Covid-19 restrictions. Health Minister Robin Swann had warned more interventions were necessary before the end of this month. Otherwise, he said a full lockdown in mid-December would not be enough to stop hospital services being overwhelmed. The executive has been considering advice from health officials throughout the afternoon. It is thought discussions will continue into Thursday evening, with ministers taking a brief adjournment until 18:00 GMT. It is believed that is to allow health officials to take some of the minister's advice and put it into formal recommendations. Several Stormont sources said it appeared all the parties were ""in the right space"" to support Mr Swann's proposals, reported BBC News NI's Jayne McCormack. The DUP, which previously opposed the extension of some restrictions, has indicated it may support recommendations this time - given the advice being presented by health officials. Close-contact services, cafes and coffee shops are set to reopen this Friday but restrictions on pubs, restaurants and hotels will expire at midnight next Thursday. It is understood the minister has also asked the executive to consider the possible introduction of local, legally enforceable travel restrictions. Until now, the executive has only advised against ""unnecessary travel"". Meanwhile, the Department of Health has said Northern Ireland will initially be in line for up to 4.35 million doses of vaccines when they are eventually made available. Two of the leading vaccines - Pfizer and AstraZeneca - have completed their final trials and are seeking authorisation. The Department of Health confirmed to the Press Association that NI would receive 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and 2.85 million doses of AstraZeneca. It said this will be in line with allocations made through the Barnett Formula. It is possible they could be available for use in the UK by the end of December. On Thursday, the Department of Health confirmed 12 coronavirus-related deaths in the previous 24 hours, bringing the department's death toll to 901. There were 487 new cases of the virus recorded. There are also 456 people being treated in hospitals in Northern Ireland for Covid-19, with 41 in ICU and 32 on ventilators. In the Republic of Ireland four further coronavirus-related deaths and 429 new cases were recorded on Wednesday. The Irish Department for Health said there were 290 patients being treated in hospital, and there were 33 people in ICU. There have been 15 additional hospitalisations in the past 24 hours. Thursday's full meeting at Stormont is the first sincelast week's row over extending some regulations. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party was focused on finding consensus and said Arlene Foster had ""spent a lot of time this week talking to her fellow ministers, trying to get people back together"".. ""If the infection rate is rising and the current restrictions are not working, we need to learn the lessons of that,"" he told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster. The marked change in tone from the DUP is certainly significant. Just seven days ago, the party was the loudest advocate against more restrictions on hospitality, and Arlene Foster had insisted the regulations would fall away on 27 November. The party's attitude to lockdown measures has changed, which senior figures put down to the rising rates of infection - something health officials had already warned of last week. However it's thought the DUP wants more measures introduced as lockdown on its own does not appear to be doing enough. The atmosphere around the executive table appears very different today, so far - with the potential that consensus could be reached by the five parties. But we have been here before, and it could still take time before any final decision is reached. If the executive does now reach agreement, some may wonder what the difficult events of last week were all about. On Wednesday, Mr Swann said he would bringa range of options to ministers including restrictions and initiatives. He said the measures were aimed at restricting the spread of Covid-19 ahead of Christmas. NI's Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young has said the R-rate - the rate of transmission of the virus - in Northern Ireland is currently sitting at ""around one"", and has risen since schools reopened two weeks ago. Sir Jeffrey said his party would ""work with the health minister and other ministers in the executive to arrive at a consensus"". ""I certainly hope we're not in a position where anyone has to use a veto in this situation and we're working closely with the health minister and with other ministers to arrive at a set of proposals that people can agree to on all sides,"" he added. Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said not being able to open on 27 November would be ""devastating"" for businesses. ""If we are not open, the current funding does not save the businesses, and furlough is not free,"" he said. Swann to bring new Covid proposals to NI Executive NI Executive aiming to 'protect' Christmas period Covid-19 row lays bare Stormont's rocky foundations But Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) in NI, said easing restrictions now would see ""us paying the price further down the road"". This video can not be played Health Minister Robin Swann speaking at Wednesday's Covid-19 briefing Meanwhile, Mr Swann has written to the UK government asking for four million fast-turnaround Covid-19 tests. The Department of Health confirmed Mr Swann's request for the fast tests, which would allow Northern Ireland's entire population to be tested. However, it is thought they would, if approved, more likely be used in a targeted way, by focusing on health workers or specific communities.

"Elisa Granato was one of the volunteers given the Oxford vaccine The Oxford coronavirus vaccine shows a strong immune response in adults in their 60s and 70s, raising hopes that it can protect age groups most at risk from the virus. Researchers saythe Lancet phase two findings,external, based on 560 healthy adult volunteers, are ""encouraging"". They are also testing whether the vaccine stops people developing Covid-19 in larger, phase three trials. Early results from this crucial stage are expected in the coming weeks. Three vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech, Sputnik and Moderna - have already reported good preliminary data from phase three trials, with one suggesting94% of over-65s could be protected from Covid-19. The Oxford data is from an earlier stage, which tests the safety of the vaccine and the body's response to it, but in the long run it's likely this vaccine could be easier to roll out because it doesn't need to be stored at very cold temperatures. The UK government has ordered more of the Oxford vaccine, manufactured by AstraZeneca, than any other - 100 million doses - compared to 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and five million of the Moderna vaccine. Prof Andrew Pollard, study lead from the University of Oxford, told the BBC he was ""absolutely delighted with the results"" showing a strong immune response ""even in those over 70 years of age"". On whether the vaccine protects people against Covid-19, he said they were ""not there yet"" but the data would probably be released ""before Christmas"". Prof Pollard said there was ""no competition"" with other vaccines, adding that multiple vaccines needed to be successful. ""We will need all of them to protect people around the globe,"" he said. How many coronavirus vaccines will there be? How do we know if vaccines are safe? The challenge with developing a Covid vaccine is to trigger the body to fight back against the virus no matter how old someone is. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Older people's weaker immune systems mean vaccines do not tend to function as well as they do in younger people. These trial results from the University of Oxford, peer-reviewed in the Lancet, suggest that may not be a problem. They show that older adults aged 56-69 and over 70 had a similar immune response to younger adults aged 18-55. Dr Maheshi Ramasamy, an investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: ""The next step will be to see if this translates into protection from the disease itself."" VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Two weeks after the second dose, more than 99% of participants had neutralising antibody responses. These included people of all ages. The T-cell response - another measure of how well the immune system responds - peaked two weeks after the first dose of the vaccine, regardless of age. ""The robust antibody and T-cell responses seen in older people in our study are encouraging,"" Dr Ramasamy said. ""The populations at greatest risk of serious Covid-19 disease include people with existing health conditions and older adults. ""We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure."" Older adults were also less likely to experience side-effects, which were usually mild. And there were no serious safety issues relating to the vaccine, called ChAdOx1 nCov-2019. Volunteers in the trial were put into groups and given one or two doses of the vaccine or a dummy jab. The reaction of their immune systems was assessed on the day they got the jab, then one, two and four weeks after both doses. First patients injected in UK Covid vaccine trial Oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response Pfizer vaccine is '94% effective in over-65s' The Oxford vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees that has been modified so it cannot grow in humans. Work began on the vaccine in January and it was developed in under three months, starting human trials - the first in Europe - in April in Oxford. Phase three trials of the vaccine, which look at how effective it is at protecting people against the Covid-19, started at the end of August and are still continuing. When data from this stage is sent to the regulators, scrutinised and approved, the vaccine can be given the green light to be used on people worldwide. The Oxford vaccine is expected to be easier to manufacture on a global scale than Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine, and the university is committed to making hundreds of millions of doses available to the developing world. The UK's large order of the vaccine means that if it is approved before Christmas and becomes available early next year, it would make a major difference to how quickly Covid vaccines could be given to people in priority groups.

"Jeremy Corbyn is currently sitting as an independent MP in the Commons Jeremy Corbyn's solicitors have written to Labour calling for his suspension as one of the party's MPs to be lifted, the BBC has been told. The former leader was readmitted as a party member on Tuesday, after a short suspension for his reaction to a report into anti-Semitism in Labour. But his successor Sir Keir Starmer has refused to let him sit as a Labour MP. He said his predecessor's remarks had ""undermined trust"" in the party within the Jewish community. Mr Corbyn has been told his suspension from the parliamentary party will last for three months, though this can be reviewed. The BBC understands Mr Corbyn's lawyers criticised the lack of a specific timescale when the suspension took place. And he could face a further investigation under the parliamentary party's rules. Why was Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour? What does the Labour anti-Semitism report say? A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims BBC political correspondent Iain Watson has seen a letter from 15 members of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) who support Mr Corbyn to the most senior party official, alleging political interference in the former leader's case. But many MPs and Jewish groups stand by the decision taken by the new leader. The parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement, MP Margaret Hodge, said the move by Sir Keir had stopped her from resigning from the party. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""[Mr Corbyn] is not a victim. We have been the victim of the anti-Semitism."" The Labour Party confirmed that a solicitor's letter had been received but no legal proceedings had begun. The uneasy truce between the current leadership and the supporters of the former leader ended when Sir Keir Starmer refused to readmit Jeremy Corbyn to the Parliamentary Labour Party. And so, a battle has begun. Another former Labour leader and ex-prime minister, Gordon Brown, has called for Mr Corbyn to apologise for the comments leading to his suspension, in which he said the scale of anti-Semitism had been dramatically overstated. But Mr Corbyn shows no signs of doing so. In the coming week, Sir Keir will want to focus on the government's handling of the pandemic and on the spending review. But, like Labour leaders before him, he is now facing a serious conflict in his own ranks. Mr Corbyn was suspended at the end of October after a damning report by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into Labour's handling of anti-Semitism allegations during his tenure as leader. But it was the former leader's response to the report - saying the scale of anti-Jewish abuse had been ""dramatically overstated"" by his political opponents - that led to the decision by Labour's general secretary David Evans to suspend him after 54  years of membership. A panel of the NEC decided on Tuesday to readmit Mr Corbyn as a member, but this did not mean he would automatically be reinstated as a Labour MP. On Wednesday, Sir Keir decided not to allow his predecessor to represent Labour in the Commons - known as stripping him of the party whip - meaning while Mr Corbyn remains an MP, he will sit as an independent. Another former Labour leader, ex-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, has called for Mr Corbyn to apologise for his comments. And former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson, who served under Mr Corbyn,told the BBC's Newscast podcast:""It would just be a lot easier if there could be more contrition [on Mr Corbyn's part], rather than lawyers' letters flying around.""

"Online news and lifestyle site Buzzfeed is taking over HuffPost in a deal that brings together two of the most high-profile digital media firms. Seller Verizon Media will become a minority shareholder in Buzzfeed as part of the deal and invest in the combined company. The two firms will also join up for advertising and sharing content, a partnership they said would ""create new revenue opportunities"". The pricewas not disclosed,external. Buzzfeed chief executive Jonah Peretti will lead the combined business. He co-founded HuffPost, formerly known as the Huffington Post, in 2005 with publisher Arianna Huffington and started Buzzfeed a year later. HuffPost rose to prominence during the George W Bush presidency as a site for liberal bloggers, many of whom contributed for free. Buzzfeed made its name creating content like listicles and quizzes, which drew young audiences. It also brought on reporters for its news site. But digital media firms have struggled to draw online advertising dollars away from tech giants such as Facebook and Google. In recent years, Buzzfeed and HuffPost have both shed staff. In May, Buzzfeed closed its newsrooms in the UK and Australia and slashed staff pay. Buzzfeed closing UK and Australian news operations Instagram 'will overtake Twitter as a news source' Mr Peretti said the new deal would increase Buzzfeed's heft, by adding HuffPost readers to its audience and allowing it to tap into Verizon's ad network. HuffPost is expected to remain a standalone brand, alongside other Buzzfeed sites, including Tasty and Buzzfeed News. Buzzfeed chief executive Jonah Peretti will lead the combined business A spokeswoman for Buzzfeed declined to comment on the possibility of job losses triggered by the tie-up. Verizon Media is part of a US telecom giant, which is known primarily for its pay-TV and mobile phone service. It acquired HuffPost in 2015 when it bought AOL for $4.4bn (Â£3.32bn), later combining it with Yahoo. Just a few years later, it wrote down the value of the properties by nearly $5bn. ""While considering opportunities to work together, naturally, Jonah and I also discussed the property he co-founded, HuffPost,"" said Verizon Media boss Guru Gowrappan. ""We quickly realised BuzzFeed's strategy would complement HuffPost's roadmap, injecting it with new energy and growing the brand into the future. ""We are deeply invested in the continued success of HuffPost and I couldn't think of a better partner to take HuffPost to the next level."" A few years ago companies like BuzzFeed and HuffPost were growing fast. The business model was simple. Produce viral content aimed at younger, online savvy audiences and cash in on online advertising revenue. That hasn't been as lucrative as they would have hoped. Ads on digital news stories can actually be quite a clunky way to advertise - less focussed than many advertisers would like. So Facebook and Google, which offer incredibly bespoke targeting, mop up a massive percentage of online advertising. More than half of all the money spent on online advertising is with these two companies. Many smaller digital media companies were laying off staff even before the pandemic. Covid-19 has inflamed these problems. People, stuck at home, are clicking more, but advertisers have been cautious. That's left companies that were seen as revolutionary only a few years ago trying to work out how to survive. This takeover should be seen in this context - the latest attempt to find a better way of making digital media work financially.

"Customers queue outside Game in Westfield in Stratford, east London Many customers hoping to get hold of a PlayStation 5 on its launch day have been left disappointed after online retailers sold out of the console. In an email to customers, Game blamed courier firm Yodel, which has strenuously denied it is at fault, for some pre-ordered consoles not being delivered on launch day. Currys PC World and John Lewis had sold out of the PS5 by lunchtime. That led some gamers to pay nearly double the retail price on eBay. The PS5 was released in the UK on 19 November but lockdown has meant that people cannot purchase one in physical stores. The US launch took place last week. Currys PC World was forced to institute a virtual queuing system which grew to 150,000 long. John Lewis was among retailers that have struggled with demand There were also issues with the PlayStation 5 order pages on Game, Amazon, Tesco and John Lewis's websites, which failed to load or appeared broken for many visitors. Matt, 29 from Essex, who tried to order a PS5 online but could not get one, said he was ""very disappointed"" with how the launch had been handled. He said: ""There's clearly not been sufficient stock made available by Sony, and the suppliers haven't managed sales well either, none of my stock alerts worked, and I visited websites when I could only to find the consoles hadn't been listed yet or were already sold out. ""To make matters worse some consoles are now cropping up on second hand sales sites at double the price due to the severe lack of supply, and it's worrying that some people may buy them when they should have been able to get one at launch day."" Currys PC World said it had sold 12,000 PS5s but was sorry for those unable to get their hands on one, although it assured customers there would be ""other chances in the lead up to Christmas"". John Lewis tweeted that consoles had sold out at 10:00 GMT. Those hoping to receive their consoles today are from pre-orders that took place in September. Many people who were not allocated a pre-order tried to buy a console when launch day stock went on sale at 09:00. Some people pre-ordering from one of the largest retailers, Game, faced disappointment if they were expecting to unbox their goods on launch day. In an email to customers, Game said: ""Due to the volume of PlayStation 5s in the UK market and the size of the product, the launch has led to UK-wide delivery challenges for all retailers and couriers."" It goes on to say that it has had to use ""multiple couriers"" to get the consoles delivered on time but then singled out Yodel, saying the firm has ""informed us that not all orders due to be delivered by them will be delivered on release day"". Game customers received this message, which blamed Yodel for late deliveries Yodel issued a furious clarification about its role. ""Yodel does not work directly with Game. Our client is GFS, a fulfilment business who work in partnership with Game,"" it said in a statement. ""We have been consistently clear on the order volumes we are able to carry for them and it is deeply disappointing that Yodel's name has been incorrectly used in an email to customers on the status of orders."" It said there were ""currently no delays within our network"". This video can not be played WATCH: Hands-on with the PS5 Game has since clarified that the ""vast majority"" of deliveries would be made on time, with the remainder coming a day later. Consumers should take note that if they try and call GFS directly and use the telephone number listed at the top of its website,they face up to about a Â£4 charge for a five minute call,external, despite the fact the firm's home page does not mention a fee. Nevertheless, the delays have led to customers venting frustration on Twitter - much of it targeted at Yodel. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some of those who had pre-ordered from Game asked why they had paid an extra fee to have a Royal Mail delivery that has now been given to another courier firm. Others reported delays with orders from Amazon and other retailers. Some gamers went to online auction site eBay, with many paying double the recommended retail price. The vast majority of listings were sold between Â£700 and Â£800, despite the disc edition costing Â£449.99 and the digital edition at Â£349.99 - however, some bids pushed beyond the Â£1,000 mark. He added he had resigned himself to having to wait until after Christmas. Piers Harding-Rolls, a gaming analyst with research firm Ampere said demand for both the PS5 and the new Xbox consoles had been very strong and would probably ""come in waves as the product is restocked"". ""Clearly it is disappointing for consumers that have pre-ordered not to receive their console on launch day. The situation is exacerbated as there is no opportunity to buy on launch day at physical retail as in the past. ""Whether you are impacted or not appears to come down to the retailer you pre-ordered with which indicates that this is a company-specific issue rather than a broader industry problem. The UK is not alone in this respect - some US retailers also had their challenges last week during the launches.""

"David Lewis, 81, lost his two sons and wife within a week of each other Mourners lined the streets to celebrate the lives of an adoring mother and her two sons who died within days of each other after contracting coronavirus. Gladys Lewis, 74, from Pentre, and sons Dean, 44, Darren, 42, from Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf,died within a week. On Thursday people gathered outside St Peter's Church in Pentre to listen to the funeral service through loudspeakers. Their family urged people to ""do their part"" to curb the spread of the virus. Relatives had previously described how the family had been careful to avoid catching Covid-19 because Gladys had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Darren, who had Down's syndrome, had been on life support with pneumonia earlier in the year. Father Philip Leyshon and Father Haydn England Simon wear PPE face visors as they stand beside the coffins of Gladys, Dean and Darren Lewis the evening before their funeral Relatives, who were inside the church, had wanted the three funerals to be held at the same time so that they could be together. Mourners wore masks and clapped as the three coffins were taken through the town. Father Haydn England-Simon, who led the service, said no family ""should ever go through"" what the Lewises had. David Lewis and his wife Gladys ""adored each other"" Grandmother Gladys Lewis died at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 29 October. The next day her eldest son Dean was found unresponsive at his home in Treorchy. He had only gone out once a week to shop for his parents. His younger brother Darren died on 2 November after being treated in intensive care at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital. The family were unable to be with Darren before his death, due to them testing positive for Covid-19 and having to self-isolate. The family at the beach when the children were younger The grandmother-of-13 and great-grandmother-of-four would ""fight the world and win to make sure her children and grandchildren had what they needed and deserved"". During the service the family said Mrs Lewis had been married to husband David, 81, for 44 years after meeting him in Blackpool. They were keen dancers and ""absolutely adored"" each other. Father-of-three Dean was said to have a ""heart of gold"", while Darren was a keen football fan. Writing in the order of service, the family said: ""As a family we cannot express how much your love, messages and support mean to us all.""

"The NHS is trying to get more non-urgent treatments carried out It will take ""a number of years"" for NHS waiting times in Wales to recover to pre-coronavirus levels, the organisation's boss has warned. The number of people waiting more than 36 weeks for planned hospital treatments is six times higher than at the start of 2020. Waiting list figures, published for the first time since March, show nearly 169,000 people waiting. The total waiting list has now swelled by more than 55,500. The number has grown aftermost non-urgent treatment was postponedto prepare the NHS for the first coronavirus wave. Since then, the service has been trying to restart non-emergency treatments and aims to keep them going as much as possible during the second wave. Despite recent progress, NHS Wales chief executive Andrew Goodall warned waiting times could grow even further, saying there was a ""real concern"" that hospital doctors were only able to see about half as many in-patients and day cases as normal. He believes there will be a third fewer out-patients seen and operating theatres working at half their usual capacity due to infection control measures. Data showed that between March and August there had been a five-fold increase in the longest waiting times of more than 36 weeks. ""The overall waiting list has not changed so much, it's simply patients have been shifted more to the end of the list as we've had to prioritise urgent and emergency cases,"" Dr Goodall added. ""We have made a lot of improvement on waiting times in recent years and it will take us a number of years to recover that and it will take investment and resources also."" Before today, the last figures related to waiting times in January. So we can now see that by September: Numbers of patients waiting more than 36 weeks - nine months - to start treatment in hospital have grown from 27,314 in January to 168,944 (an increase of 518%) Those waiting between six and nine months have risen from 49,548 to 116,807 (up 136%) Compared to a year ago, the number on the list waiting more than nine months has risen 800% The longest waits included 41,202 people waiting for orthopaedic or trauma treatment - a 372% increase since January - and 203 waiting for cardiothoracic surgery, more than four times as many. Welsh Government targets state 95% of patients should be treated within six months and nobody should wait longer than six months. Recent analysis by the BBC Wales Investigates programme suggestedat least 49,000 people in Wales were waiting more than a yearin September and for six out of seven health boards, at least 25,000 were waiting for surgery. That would amount to a tenfold increase in the number of patients compared to September 2019. The Welsh Government said ""difficult decisions"" were made to postpone surgery and outcomes for patients would have been even worse had it not acted. The NHS has gradually resumed non-urgent activity since the first wave and is trying to get procedures done, in so far as that is possible, but it has been substantially lower than what is usual. This video can not be played Clive Price said he was frustrated having to wait for orthopaedic surgery Clive Price, from Merthyr Tydfil, is waiting for a hip operation, which has been put off because of Covid. He was expecting to find out in April before surgery was cancelled and fears he could be waiting a long time. ""Out of 10, the pain is 20,"" he said. ""All the way down, my leg goes dead if I'm sitting down too much."" Mr Price added: ""You're afraid to go into hospital because of Covid - I'd go in now if I could but I've been told nothing. Operations like mine are going up and up, I could be waiting months. I want to get it done and go out."" New experimental measures of performance 53,903patients seen across 13 A&E units 15minutes average wait, time to triage 54minutes average wait, time to see clinician 43.9%no follow-up required 25.9%patient admitted to hospital Along with waiting times figures, theWelsh Government has published for the first time,externalthree new ""experimental"" performance measures for A&E departments: Time to triage:This is the average time someone has to wait for an initial assessment, and performance by triage category (how urgent your condition appears to be) will be broken down into three categories - immediate, very urgent and urgent. Those very urgent or urgent had 15 and 16 minute median waits Time to clinician:The average time a patient waits for a more thorough assessment by a clinician - 58.4% were said to be seen within a ""valid time"" Outcome:Information on where people end up after being assessed and treated at the emergency department. It shows among other outcomes that 25.9% were admitted, 43.9% needed no follow-up, while 12.1% were referred to a GP No targets have been set in relation to these measures and the Welsh Government said they were set with input from front-line emergency care staff. Ten-fold increase in patients waiting for treatment Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Has the firebreak lockdown had an impact? Dr Jo Mower, clinical director for the National Programme for Unscheduled Care, has been a consultant in Cardiff for the past 16 years. She said she was confident the new measures, alongside the current time-targets, would be better for those who came to A&E themselves, as well as those who arrive by ambulance. ""There may be times when we're overwhelmed, but we want to ensure our patients are triaged and assessed as close to their arrival time as possible, so the patient can get the right treatment, especially for those critical interventions like heart attacks, sepsis, strokes - and this will identify those patients but also those who could possibly wait a little longer for their treatment."" The current target is 95% of patients should spend no longer than four hours in A&E, but this has never been met since it was introduced in 2010. The waiting times for A&E for October showed 76.5% of patients were seen, transferred or discharged within four hours, a slight improvement on both January and about the same October 2019. There were 4,360 patients who waited more than 12 hours, even though the targets state nobody should have to wait that long. However, critics of the current measures say they give little indication of the quality and urgency of care given to patients. Meanwhile, in September, there was a 13.5% rise in patients entering the single cancer treatment pathway, compared to the month before, although this was still 1,145 (8.7%) compared to a year before. For the third month in a row, the Welsh Ambulance Service failed to meet its target of reaching 65% of ""red"" life-threatening calls within eight minutes. In October, 60.8% arrived within eight minutes. Health officials said one issue is that it can take up to six minutes for staff to get into full PPE kit before seeing each patient, while a standard clean now for ambulances took up to 20 minutes after each call. Dr Goodall said once the pandemic has been brought under control, the NHS would need to transform the way it works in order to tackle the backlog. But he said the rapid changes made to deal with Covid-19 - such as the growth in video consultations - proved what was possible, and he believed ministers would consider long-term funding challenges. ""I personally feel our longest waiting times may still take a number of years to resolve. But what I don't want to happen is we continue to respond in the same old fashioned way."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething said an extra Â£30m had been made available for the remainder of 2020/21. But he said the effects of Covid would be long-lasting. ""The extraordinary figures today underscore the nature of the challenge that our NHS faces and the very direct impact of responding to this unfinished pandemic,"" he said. ""If we'd tried to run our services as normal I am confident we'd have been overwhelmed, but not allowing this to happen means we've built up a significant backlog which means it'll take pretty much a full Senedd term to resolve. It's important that people understand the reality of where we are."" He added: ""That will mean more challenges for people who are waiting longer and it'll mean significant challenges for our NHS, because our staff are still in the midst of coping with the pandemic, so there are big and difficult choices ahead that will go well beyond when this pandemic finally does come to an end."" The British Medical Association (BMA) in Wales said the figures had reached extraordinary levels and were ""stark"". ""What is vital now, is clear messaging for these patients, many of whom have, and continue to suffer due to these delays,"" said David Bailey, chair of the BMA council in Wales. ""Clear communication which provides insight as to where they are in the system, may offer a small amount of peace of mind. To have no information at all will be for many, extremely distressing."" Responding to the A&E waiting time figures, Dr Suresh Pillai, of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Wales said it showed a worrying trend of increasing long waits. ""Long waits have always been dangerous, but at a time where Covid is still endemic and we are having to care for patients alongside managing the virus, we simply cannot have crowded emergency departments,"" he said. Dr Olwen Williams, of the Royal College of Physicians in Wales, said Dr Goodall's comments reflected the views of many doctors on the frontline. ""We need to take this opportunity to adapt and redesign the way we provide care, with better use of new technologies, investment in innovative preventative and community medicine, and much wider patient involvement in decision-making,"" she said. Andrew RT Davies, Conservative health spokesman, said urged the health minister to ""get a grip on this because troubling as these figures are, they are not just abstract numbers"". He added: ""Our plan would mean ramping up capacity in Covid-free hospitals so we can get back on top of treatments, and patients aren't left waiting in unnecessary agony or anxiety."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""We still need to see more urgency in delivering significant 'green' Covid-free, or 'Covid-light' sites for diagnosis and treatment. ""Stopping in-hospital transmission of the virus is another area which needs significant attention."" Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us? Has the firebreak lockdown had an impact?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Defence spending a boost for ""safety of the British people"" A ""once-in-a-generation modernisation"" of the armed forces is required to extend British influence and protect the public, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister told MPs a new four-year funding deal would protect ""hundreds of thousands"" of jobs and create 40,000 new roles. ""I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end, and it ends now,"" he said. Labour welcomed more defence spending but asked how it would be funded. Outlining the new package in the Commons, the PM - speaking over video linkas he is self-isolating- said the benefits ""will go far beyond our armed forces"". Mr Johnson described the increase in defence spending as being worth Â£16.5bn in new money over four years. However economist Ben Zaranko, from the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said that while this represented a big rise in spending, the figure of Â£16.5bn was a ""misleading way to present this announcement"". He continued: ""It would be more accurate to say that by 2024-25, defence spending will be Â£7bn higher than it would have been under previous plans."" How will defence spending rise affect armed forces? PM launches review to 'overhaul' foreign policy UK defence secretary denies plan to mothball tanks Mr Johnson said: ""Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry, protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe."" The PM pledged to end defence budget cuts, protect shipping lanes that supply the country, press on with renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent and restore Britain as ""the foremost naval power in Europe"" with a ""renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK"". He also said the funding would allow investment in new technology such as: A new centre dedicated to artificial intelligence The creation of a national cyber force, which he said was already operating against terrorists, organised crime groups and hostile states A new ""RAF space command launching British satellites and our first rocket from Scotland in 2022"" ""From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications opening up new vistas of economic progress, creating 10,000 jobs every year - 40,000 in total - levelling-up across our country and reinforcing our union,"" Mr Johnson added. This is a big win for Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who's been fighting hard for a significant increase in defence spending and a long-term financial settlement to end what he calls a cycle of overambitious, under-funded defence reviews of the past. The Treasury had been arguing for a much smaller annual increase. But Mr Wallace found an ally in the PM, who says his first priority is defence of the realm. Boris Johnson also believes it'll boost Britain's place in the world and create jobs. The extra money will be used to modernise the armed forces with more spent on robots, autonomous systems and meeting new threats in the domains of space and cyber. Despite the palpable relief inside the MoD it still has to fill a Â£13bn black hole in its equipment budget. Difficult decisions about cutting old equipment to fund the new are still to be made. The MoD, which doesn't have a strong track record of balancing its books, now has to prove it can spend wisely. And good news for defence might also mean bad news for other government departments -there's already speculation the international aid budget could be cut. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of making a ""spending announcement without a strategy"" and asked whether the money would be raised through cuts or tax rises, or both. Mr Johnson did not respond to the question but said Sir Keir's record of support for the armed forces was ""very thin indeed"". Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt urged Mr Johnson ""not to listen to any voices in his ear"" saying that cutting international aid could help to fund the increase in defence spending. And Labour MP Sarah Champion, chairwoman of the international development committee, asked Mr Johnson to ""quash rumours and confirm his manifesto commitment"" of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, ""now and going forwards"". The PM responded by telling the Commons: ""I think we can all be proud of our record on overseas aid and that will continue."" Gen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, said he was ""absolutely delighted"" by the announcement. ""But of course we're also conscious that living through this Covid crisis, the armed forces have stepped up to the plate to provide some of the resilience that the nation has needed,"" he added. Gen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, said the ""extraordinary announcement"" would be very good for morale Earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said ""letting go"" of some older weapons would create ""headroom"" for new investment. He added: ""When I looked across at the armed forces today I saw them with equipment that was out-of-date, I saw our adversaries across the world having better equipment, the ability to attack us and harm us getting wider and wider from our capabilities."" The funding announcement is part of the first conclusions ofthe government's Integrated Reviewwhich looks at security, defence, development and foreign policy. Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the extra money would give ""a welcome and long-overdue upgrade to Britain's defences after a decade of decline"". Conservative MP and defence select committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said: ""This is a lot of money but ultimately there are still huge financial pressures facing our armed forces."" But he said the ""key takeaway"" for him was the ""message this sends to the British people, to the MoD as well, that we want to be back as a strong power capability"".

"This video can not be played Sedwill: Not all of Patel report will be public A report into allegations Home Secretary Priti Patel bullied staff is ""with"" the prime minister, a former head of the civil service has said. Sir Mark Sedwill said Boris Johnson ""needs to reflect and make a decision"" following a fact-finding review led by a senior civil servant. A Cabinet Office inquiry was launched eight months ago into the allegations, which Ms Patel denies. A spokesman for the PM said he was not yet ready to publish the findings. The spokesman added that the probe into Ms Patel's behaviour - which was launched when Sir Mark was cabinet secretary - was an ""ongoing process"". Labour has previously called for the report to be published ""without further delay,"" claiming trust in politics has been undermined as a result. Publish Patel bullying claims report - PM adviser Patel bullying inquiry must be published - Labour What has happened to the report into Priti Patel? An official investigation into the facts of Ms Patel's behaviour was launched in March, when Sir Mark was in charge of the UK civil service. The probe was launched to investigate whether she had breached theministerial code,external- the official rulebook for government ministers. In February, Sir Philip Rutnam, the top civil servant in the Home Office, resigned, saying he had been the target of a ""vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign"". He is pursuing an employment tribunal claim for constructive dismissal. Sir Mark said Mr Johnson had begun consulting his independent adviser on ministers' interests, Sir Alex Allan, about the fact-finding review by the time hisleft his post in September. ""I think Alex had been in discussion with the prime minister,"" he told MPs on the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. ""I don't know the exact date of when that part of the process was submitted to the PM, but it was under way, and it's with him as I understand it now. ""The process was: establish the facts, have Alex Allan consider it, because the prime minister wanted his advice, and the prime minister needs to reflect and make a decision. ""That, as I understand it, is still in train."" A decision on whether to publish the report will be made by Mr Johnson - who also has the ultimate power to decide whether the ministerial code has been breached. Sir Mark suggested the full report might never be published, to protect the confidentiality of those interviewed as part of the inquiry. ""It is a decision in the end for the PM whether he publishes anything,"" he said. ""But [they] would have to be very careful, if there were any publication, to respect the basis on which individuals interviewed in the process had submitted their evidence. ""That doesn't mean you can't publish or release anything, but it does mean you have to be careful about it."" The PM's official spokesman said: ""Once we are in a position to make public the prime minister's conclusions then we will do so, but we are not at that point yet.""

"A draft report concluded in the summer that Home Secretary Priti Patel had broken rules on ministers' behaviour, sources familiar with the contents say. The Cabinet Office began an inquiry into her conduct after Sir Philip Rutnam, the most senior Home Office official, resigned in February. Sir Philip - who is suing for constructive dismissal - alleged staff felt that Ms Patel had ""created fear"". Ms Patel has always strongly denied allegations of bullying. Patel bullying report 'with the PM' - Sedwill Publish Patel claims report - PM adviser The report, carried out by the government's independent adviser on standards, Sir Alex Allan, has not been published. But one source said it had concluded that the ""home secretary had not met the requirements of theministerial code,externalto treat civil servants with consideration and respect"". They added that the investigation had found evidence of bullying, even if it had not been intentional. Another source who saw the report called it ""unambiguous in stating that Priti Patel broke the ministerial code and that the prime minister buried it"". A spokesman for the home secretary said she had always denied the allegations and that there had never been any formal complaints made against her. It's a government document setting out ""expected standards"" of behaviour in office, which include ""consideration and respect"" for civil servants and other colleagues. The code says ""harassing, bullying or other inappropriate or discriminating behaviour"" will not be tolerated. It adds that ministers are ""personally responsible"" for how they act - and that they can stay in office ""for so long as they retain the confidence of the prime minister"". The code is not legally binding but, according to the Institute for Government think tank, there is growing pressure for it to become so. A different government source has suggested that the report also paints an unflattering picture of how Ms Patel was sometimes treated. The report is understood to have looked at Ms Patel's behaviour at three different government departments - the Home Office, Work and Pensions and International Development. The evidence gathering was completed several months ago, but Downing Street has delayed giving a verdict. The prime minister is the ultimate arbiter of the ministerial code, and there is no requirement on the government to publish Sir Alex's report. Sir Philip Rutnam quit as permanent secretary to the Home Office in February The BBC understands there have been conversations in government this week about how to manage the situation, with suggestions that Ms Patel may be given a reprimand, or be asked to apologise, but keep her job. It is possible Boris Johnson's decision could be revealed as early as Friday. Normally if a minister breaches the code they are expected to resign. But earlier this week former Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill suggested there could be a ""wider range of sanctions"", telling MPs: ""I don't think it should be binary between let off or sacked."" He confirmed then that the report was already ""with"" Mr Johnson. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA senior civil servants' union, said ""thousands"" of civil servants would be asking what ""message"" it would send if the government suggested Ms Patel did not have to resign over a ""little bit of bullying"". He described the system as not ""fit for purpose"", adding: ""We need an independent process that's not relying upon a prime minister making a political judgement rather than judging based on the evidence."" For Labour, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called for Sir Alex's report to be published immediately, adding: ""These revelations could not be more serious. ""This has all the hallmarks of a cover-up from the prime minister and raises fundamental questions about his judgement."" But several Conservative MPs have offered Ms Patel their support. Tom Tugendhat tweeted that Ms Patel was popular ""across"" the party because she was ""hardworking, determined and has been very kind to many"". Another Tory MP, Julie Marson, said the home secretary was doing a ""huge job"", adding: ""Like many women operating in a man's world, you have to be strong and decisive."" A government spokesperson said: ""The process is ongoing and the prime minister will make any decision on the matter public once the process has concluded.""

"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

"An Antarctic blue whale surfaces off South Georgia The resurgence of blue whales around the island of South Georgia is real and has probably been under way for a little while now, say scientists. When a survey was conducted at the British Overseas Territory earlier this year, 58 of the animals were seen. That was described as ""astonishing"" at the time because there had been so few sightings previously. But a reassessment of 30 years of observational data suggests this bumper crowd of blues was no anomaly. South Georgia is home to millions of king penguins It most likely signals they really are making a comeback in the waters around the sub-Antarctic island. South Georgia is infamous, of course, for being the epicentre of commercial whaling in the early 20th Century. Huge iceberg on collision path with wildlife haven Antarctic artwork commemorates island's dark past South Georgia: New map traces Shackleton's footsteps This video can not be played Jennifer Jackson: ""I don't think this is a surprise phenomenon"" Its steam boats, with their grenade-tipped harpoons, decimated all the large whale populations - and at the peak of the carnage were removing 3,000 blues a year. And while fur and elephant seals, which were also heavily exploited, managed to bounce back to historic levels relatively quickly - the whales, and the blues in particular, did not. Grytviken: Remnants of the old whaling stations can still be seen today Their absence long after commercial whaling ended even led some whale experts to wonder if these majestic creatures would ever be seen again in significant numbers at South Georgia. ""It was held up as an example of how you can exploit a population beyond the point where it can recover,"" Susannah Calderan, who led the reassessment, told BBC News. Susannah Calderan uses ex-military sonobuoys to pick up the sounds of whales It's possible that as the population crashed, the blues simply lost the cultural memory that had drawn them to South Georgia in the first place, the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) fellow said. The British Overseas Territory is in the path of a food train coming up from the Antarctic on strong currents. This train carries abundant krill, the small crustaceans that whales love. But because there were so few blues left after commercial whaling, it may be that the knowledge of the island's productive feeding ground could not be passed on to future generations - so the theory goes. ""So, perhaps now they have re-discovered 'the larder',"" Susannah Calderan speculated. ""South Georgia remains an extremely productive feeding ground. Nothing ever happened to its productivity. It's not as if the whales stopped coming because there was nothing left to eat."" This video can not be played Male blues communicate over vast distances with their repetitive, low-frequency calls (B.Miller/AAD) The SAMS scientist, with colleagues, has reviewed all the observational data on blue whales at South Georgia going back three decades. This includes the systematic surveys that have been conducted by researchers and the opportunistic reporting that's come in from mariners and from cruise ships, whose visits to South Georgia have increased in frequency. The study also includes data from acoustics - the use of listening devices, such as sonobuoys, which are put in the water to detect the booming, low-frequency calls that are made by blue whales. This video can not be played So-called D-calls made by blue whales are probably associated with social behaviour and feeding (B.Miller/AAD) All this information points to a gradual increase in the presence of blue whale numbers around the island in recent years. Even before the remarkable observation of 58 blues in February, it's now recognised that a total of 41 animals from the species were photo-identified off South Georgia between 2011 and 2020. Conservationists say South Georgia is an all-too-rare example of an ecosystem in recovery ""It should be said, the survey we carried out at the beginning of this year was not dedicated to blues. This was an accidental finding. We were actually looking for right whales, but the team saw blue whales when they were doing their transects,"" explained co-researcher Jennifer Jackson from the British Antarctic Survey, which led the February expedition. ""I don't think this is a surprise phenomenon. I think we're going to continue seeing blue whales in the years to come. What we need to understand now is why they are using South Georgia waters again."" A humpback whale in the waters around South Georgia And it's not just blues. Those other species that were also driven to the brink, like the humpbacks, are also on the rise. Susannah Calderan would like to see a network of acoustic moorings placed around the island, in particular off its southwest coastline where little systematic survey work has been conducted. This would help fill gaps in the data and smooth biases which mean the same locations tend to dominate sightings - such as the popular routes taken by cruise ships. At the peak of harvesting, 3,000 blue whales were being taken each year The whale scientists are also now watching closely what will happen with the world's biggest iceberg - the 4,200 sq km tabular block known as A68a. Drifting in the same currents that deliver krill to South Georgia, it risks being caught in the shallows surrounding the island. If that happens, the iceberg could disrupt the foraging behaviour of many animals that depend on the krill. ""South Georgia is a kind of home to dead icebergs. Generally, they tend to go there to die. But, yes, this one's massive,"" said Susannah Calderan. ""Will it affect productivity? Will it affect the krill? Will that affect the whales?

"Fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger have fallen into administration, putting more than 4,700 jobs and almost 500 shops at risk. It comes after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer for both businesses. No redundancies have been announced yet and no stores closed. EWM Group blamed the pandemic for a collapse in trade, but said it was still in talks with potential buyers. ""In recent weeks we have had constructive discussions with a number of potential buyers for Peacocks and Jaeger,"" it said in a statement. ""But the continuing deterioration of the retail sector due to the impact of the pandemic and second lockdown have made this process longer and more complex than we would have hoped."" It said that a ""standstill agreement"" secured with the High Court that temporarily put off administration had now expired. ""Therefore as directors we taken the desperately difficult decision to place Peacocks and Jaeger into administration while those talks continue,"" it said. Jaeger is a London-based fashion business with 76 stores and concessions and employs 347 staff. Cardiff-based Peacocks operates 423 stores with 4,369 staff. Some Peacocks stores had already begun to shut following an announcement on 15 October. Philip Day has quietly built a retail empire over the last 18 years and his huge footprint on high streets across the UK served him well. He did so by snapping up a string of businesses out of administration. Critics say he didn't do much with them. He didn't do much business online, either. That left him and his chains more exposed when shoppers stampeded to the internet during lockdown. Mr Day still has Bonmarche, a business which he bought through a separate investment vehicle and isn't affected by the current insolvency process. It went into administration last year amid challenging trading conditions. He went on to buy it back, with fewer stores. Will he now do the same with Peacocks or walk away? According to the most recent company accounts, the EWM Group made a pre-tax profit of Â£31m in the six months until March 2019. It also had plenty of cash in the bank and next to no debt. How quickly things have unravelled. The news come two weeks after Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group called in administrators for its eponymous clothing chain and its homeware brand Ponden Home, putting almost 3,000 more jobs at risk. Tony Wright, joint administrator of the business from FRP Advisory, said talks with potential buyers for Jaeger and Peacocks were at an advanced stage, suggesting the brands could still be saved. ""Jaeger and Peacocks are attractive brands that have suffered the well-known challenges that many retailers face at present,"" he said. ""We are in advanced discussions with a number of parties and working hard to secure a future for both businesses.""

"An Antarctic blue whale surfaces off South Georgia The resurgence of blue whales around the island of South Georgia is real and has probably been under way for a little while now, say scientists. When a survey was conducted at the British Overseas Territory earlier this year, 58 of the animals were seen. That was described as ""astonishing"" at the time because there had been so few sightings previously. But a reassessment of 30 years of observational data suggests this bumper crowd of blues was no anomaly. South Georgia is home to millions of king penguins It most likely signals they really are making a comeback in the waters around the sub-Antarctic island. South Georgia is infamous, of course, for being the epicentre of commercial whaling in the early 20th Century. Huge iceberg on collision path with wildlife haven Antarctic artwork commemorates island's dark past South Georgia: New map traces Shackleton's footsteps This video can not be played Jennifer Jackson: ""I don't think this is a surprise phenomenon"" Its steam boats, with their grenade-tipped harpoons, decimated all the large whale populations - and at the peak of the carnage were removing 3,000 blues a year. And while fur and elephant seals, which were also heavily exploited, managed to bounce back to historic levels relatively quickly - the whales, and the blues in particular, did not. Grytviken: Remnants of the old whaling stations can still be seen today Their absence long after commercial whaling ended even led some whale experts to wonder if these majestic creatures would ever be seen again in significant numbers at South Georgia. ""It was held up as an example of how you can exploit a population beyond the point where it can recover,"" Susannah Calderan, who led the reassessment, told BBC News. Susannah Calderan uses ex-military sonobuoys to pick up the sounds of whales It's possible that as the population crashed, the blues simply lost the cultural memory that had drawn them to South Georgia in the first place, the Scottish Association for Marine Science (SAMS) fellow said. The British Overseas Territory is in the path of a food train coming up from the Antarctic on strong currents. This train carries abundant krill, the small crustaceans that whales love. But because there were so few blues left after commercial whaling, it may be that the knowledge of the island's productive feeding ground could not be passed on to future generations - so the theory goes. ""So, perhaps now they have re-discovered 'the larder',"" Susannah Calderan speculated. ""South Georgia remains an extremely productive feeding ground. Nothing ever happened to its productivity. It's not as if the whales stopped coming because there was nothing left to eat."" This video can not be played Male blues communicate over vast distances with their repetitive, low-frequency calls (B.Miller/AAD) The SAMS scientist, with colleagues, has reviewed all the observational data on blue whales at South Georgia going back three decades. This includes the systematic surveys that have been conducted by researchers and the opportunistic reporting that's come in from mariners and from cruise ships, whose visits to South Georgia have increased in frequency. The study also includes data from acoustics - the use of listening devices, such as sonobuoys, which are put in the water to detect the booming, low-frequency calls that are made by blue whales. This video can not be played So-called D-calls made by blue whales are probably associated with social behaviour and feeding (B.Miller/AAD) All this information points to a gradual increase in the presence of blue whale numbers around the island in recent years. Even before the remarkable observation of 58 blues in February, it's now recognised that a total of 41 animals from the species were photo-identified off South Georgia between 2011 and 2020. Conservationists say South Georgia is an all-too-rare example of an ecosystem in recovery ""It should be said, the survey we carried out at the beginning of this year was not dedicated to blues. This was an accidental finding. We were actually looking for right whales, but the team saw blue whales when they were doing their transects,"" explained co-researcher Jennifer Jackson from the British Antarctic Survey, which led the February expedition. ""I don't think this is a surprise phenomenon. I think we're going to continue seeing blue whales in the years to come. What we need to understand now is why they are using South Georgia waters again."" A humpback whale in the waters around South Georgia And it's not just blues. Those other species that were also driven to the brink, like the humpbacks, are also on the rise. Susannah Calderan would like to see a network of acoustic moorings placed around the island, in particular off its southwest coastline where little systematic survey work has been conducted. This would help fill gaps in the data and smooth biases which mean the same locations tend to dominate sightings - such as the popular routes taken by cruise ships. At the peak of harvesting, 3,000 blue whales were being taken each year The whale scientists are also now watching closely what will happen with the world's biggest iceberg - the 4,200 sq km tabular block known as A68a. Drifting in the same currents that deliver krill to South Georgia, it risks being caught in the shallows surrounding the island. If that happens, the iceberg could disrupt the foraging behaviour of many animals that depend on the krill. ""South Georgia is a kind of home to dead icebergs. Generally, they tend to go there to die. But, yes, this one's massive,"" said Susannah Calderan. ""Will it affect productivity? Will it affect the krill? Will that affect the whales? It's a really interesting question."" The team's analysis, which is publishedin the journal Endangered Species Research,external, was funded by South Georgia Heritage Trust and Friends of South Georgia Island. The giant iceberg A68a could become stuck in shallow water near the island At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Meanwhile, here's a summary of headlines from across the UK this evening:  And that's all from us for today's live page. Our coverage has been edited by Sarah Fowler and Emma Owen and written by Hazel Shearing, Georgina Rannard, Holly Honderich and Doug Faulkner. Thanks for joining us - there'll be more from the team tomorrow. We're nearing the end of our live page coverage - on a day that the US hit a grim milestone of 250,000 Covid deaths, and the nation of Samoa recorded its first ever case. Here's a summary of the day's stories from around the world: A punk musician who posted criticism of Indonesia's handling of Covid-19 has been sentenced to 14 months in prison for causing public unrest. Gede Ari Astina or Jerinx, the drummer for the Balinese rock band, Superman is Dead, commented on Instagram in June about the pandemic. Criticising an order that pregnant women should be tested for coronavirus, he said that Indonesia's doctors association was acting as a lackey of the World Health Organisation. The court ruled he was guilty of spreading of hate speech. Jerinx is considering an appeal. A woman whose elderly father died in a care home in April has won the first stage of a legal challenge over measures taken by the government to protect those living in care homes from Covid-19. Dr Cathy Gardner claims there was a failure to implement ""adequate"" measures to protect residents from the ""ravages"" of coronavirus. She is pursuing a High Court claim against the government and two health bodies over decisions and measures taken in relation to care homes during the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Gardner argues certain key policies and decisions led to a ""shocking death toll"" of care home residents - which she puts at more than 20,000 people between March and June - particularly an alleged policy of discharging patients from hospital into care homes without testing and suitable isolation arrangements. She is bringing her case along with Fay Harris, and the pair allege the measures breached human rights and equality laws. At a remote hearing on Thursday, Mr Justice Linden granted Dr Gardner permission for a full hearing of her challenge. The government and health bodies oppose Dr Gardner's challenge and asked the judge to dismiss the case. Her father, Michael Gibson, died in an Oxfordshire care home on 3 April after it re-admitted, without Covid-testing, a former resident who had been in hospital. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney is facing criticism after being photographed drinking inside a city bar the day before issuing a city-wide ban on indoor dining. The mayor's office confirmed to US media that the photograph was taken some time last weekend. On Monday, Kenney issued a series of new Covid-19 restrictions, amid rising cases. Some have accused the mayor of hypocrisy for participating in an activity he later linked to coronavirus spread. In addition to an indoor dining ban, movie theatres, bowling alleys, museums and gyms have been ordered to close, and high schools and colleges must move to online instruction. As of Wednesday, Philadelphia had reported 57,201 cases of Covid-19, and 1,942 deaths. Statewide, Pennsylvania has seen a surge in cases starting in October, reaching more than 5,000 new cases each day this month.  Leeds Rhinos and Catalans Dragons played at an empty Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington in November The government has announceda rescue package of Â£300m of emergency fundingfor sports in England impacted by the absence of spectators because of coronavirus. Both rugby codes and horse racing are among the beneficiaries, but not clubs in football's Premier League nor the English Football League. Cricket was not on the initial list. Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""Clubs are the beating hearts of their communities - this boost will help them survive this difficult winter period."" The government said the Sports Winter Survival Package will be largely composed of low-interest loans. The sports which will benefit are: rugby union Â£135m, horseracing Â£40m, football Â£28m, rugby league Â£12m, motorsport Â£6m, tennis Â£5m. netball Â£4m, basketball Â£4m, ice hockey Â£4m, badminton Â£2m and greyhound racing Â£1m. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston added that grants would be available where organisations were unable to repay loans. He also said ""the door was open"" to any sport requiring funding, including cricket which was not on the initial list. The money available is for sports in England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland responsible for their own budgets. Travellers to England, Wales and Northern Ireland from Israel, Sri Lanka and Namibia will not have to quarantine for 14 days after they were among several countries added to the air corridor list. Other places added to the list are Rwanda, Uruguay, Bonaire, St Eustatius & Saba, the Northern Mariana Islands and the US Virgin Islands. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted: ""If you arrive from these countries after 4am on Saturday 21 November you will not need to self-isolate. Please remember that under the current restrictions travel outside of the home, with the exception of a limited number of reasons including work or education, is not permitted."" Remember, Scotland makes its own decisions on travel, and we will bring you any updates here. New York City's entire public school system closed its doors on Thursday, a shutdown automatically triggered by the city reaching a 3% test positivity rate - meaning that for every 1,000 New Yorkers tested, 30 were positive for Covid-19. The city's students had been back to school for in-person learning for less than eight weeks. With 1.1 million students and 1,800 schools, New York boasts the largest public school system in the US. ""Today is a tough day, but this is a temporary situation,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday, announcing the closure. New York - once the national epicentre of the coronavirus crisis - began its phased reopening this summer, after a brutal battle with the virus in spring. Now, with cases rising once again, the city appears headed back towards tightened restrictions. Both de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo have indicated that places like restaurants and gyms may soon face closure. The New York City closures comes as the United Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF)warns of ""dire and growingâ consequences for children,external, as the pandemic continues on into another year.  A further 501 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK,the Department of Health has confirmed,external. It takes the total number of people who have died by that measure since the pandemic began to 53,775. There have also been a further 22,915 people who have tested positive for the virus. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Many Scots feel that the Scottish government hashandled the pandemic betterthan the UK government. But the hard data on the pandemic reveals many similarities between the two nationsâ experience. The death rates in England in the first wave were higher than those in Scotland. Both both saw higher death rates than Wales or Northern Ireland. And both nations featured in the three worst-hit in Europe, with Glasgow and Edinburgh joining Birmingham, London and Manchester inthe ten worst hit cities. Differences are starting to emerge between the two nations in the handling of the second wave. Nicola Sturgeon introduced severe restrictions in the central belt in mid-October and cases in Scotland have started to flatten, perhaps even decline, while those in England still rise. But it will be some time before these differences filter through into the numbers of people who die because of the pandemic. And it will be even longer before death rates start to come down and we can make definitive comparisons between nations. A number of workers in Sweden's mink industry have tested positive for coronavirus, days after Denmark identified a strain of the virus on farms. The Swedish health ministry said it is investigating any possible links between the strains identified in the animals and the workers. Earlier on Thursday the Danish health ministry claimed that coronavirus strain found in its mink was ""very likely"" extinct. All farmed mink in the country have now been killed. In Ireland a mass culling is also being planned, a government spokesperson said on Thursday. Testing of the animals has not so far revealed any positive Covid-19 cases. There are worries about a potential new strain of coronavirus undermining vaccines in the works. Cineworld is looking to arrangea rescue deal that could mean UK cinema closures, the BBC understands. One option being discussed with bank lenders is a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process which could help  the company cut its rent bill. Like other cinema chains, Cineworld has been hit hard by the lockdown, it reported a $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) loss for the six months to June after being forced to temporarily close some of its cinemas and after film studios delayed the release of some blockbusters. According to the Financial Times,which first reported the news,,externalCineworld has appointed restructuring experts AlixPartners. Although cinemas reopened when restrictions were relaxed, delays in big budget releases - such as the new James Bond movie - led Cineworld to temporarily close its UK cinemas on 9 October until further notice. Cineworld declined to comment but a source has stressed a CVA is only one option being discussed. More than 4,700 jobs are at risk afterclothing chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration, after bosses failed to find a buyer for the business. The two companies were placed into administration on Thursday after a two-week deadline to find a buyer passed. Earlier this month, a spokesperson for owner EWM Group, which also owns the Edinburgh Woollen Mill brand, said they had been speaking to several potential buyers who were interested in parts of the business. But they said talks had been made more complex by ""the continuing deterioration of the retail sector due to the impact of the pandemic and second lockdown"". Jaeger runs 76 stores and concessions and has 347 employees while Cardiff-based Peacocks has 4,369 staff across 423 stores. No redundancies have been announced and no stores have closed. Tony Wright, joint administrator of the business from FRP Advisory, said: ""Jaeger and Peacocks are attractive brands that have suffered the well-known challenges that many retailers face at present."" He said administrators were in ""advanced discussions"" with a number of parties. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst For many of us, online shopping
has become a lifeline in lockdown life. And in China, that has very much
been the reality for a lot of people. When the country saw an outbreak of
Covid-19 at the beginning of the year, cities began implementing strict
lockdowns and social distancing measures. Many couriers began leaving
parcels outside people's apartment buildings to avoid social contact, but
between March and April, surveillance footage picked up one opportunistic woman
in the capital city of Beijing, stealing multiple parcels from outside the
entrance of one building. She was subsequently arrested. Ms Lang has now been sentenced to
nine months imprisonment and fined 7,000 yuan ($1,063; Â£803) for stealing 10
parcels, the majority of which contained food. While the sentence might appear
strict, many on Chinaâs Sina Weibo social network site believe the punishment was
adequate, given that she stole essential items. China has prosecuted more than 6,000 people forCovid-19 related crimes,externalsince the beginning of the year. People have been arrested for hiking the price of masks and hand sanitiser, making fake PPE, and breaking social distancing rules. Last month in Sichuan, a man was even arrested after he tried to avoid paying for a karaoke room by calling for an ambulance, and saying he had Covid-19 symptoms. Boris Johnson used video link for this week's Prime Minister's Questions Plans to allow MPs who are shielding to take part in House of Commons debates via video link have been criticised for not going far enough. The influential cross party Procedure Committee is calling on the government to allow all MPs to take part in debates virtually during the coronavirus pandemic. At the moment, MPs can ask questions and respond to statements virtually but they are not allowed to speak during debates on legislation, or anything else, unless they are physically present in the Commons chamber. On Monday the Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government planned to allow only MPs who are clinically vulnerable to take part in debates until the end of March. During a short debate, the Conservative chair of the Procedure Committee Karen Bradley said his ""refusal  to listen"" to the ""views of the House"" was ""indefensible"". She said the public would be ""baffled by a situation where the prime minister can answer Prime Minister's Questions virtually yesterday and and make a statement to the House virtually today, but cannot then take part in a debate until he has finished self isolating"". ""This is an utterly farcical situation,"" she said. The pandemic has up-ended all manner of celebrations and turned our holidays into muted affairs, but in the US, one festive tradition will go on. The White House has said the annual presidential pardoning of a turkey before Thanksgiving will happen this year. The ritual spares a turkey from being served on a Thanksgiving dinner table, and the birds usually spend the rest of their days on a farm or even Disneyland in Florida. It falls to voters to choose to pardon one of two turkeys, although both birds tend to be spared in the end. White House officials say social distancing will be practised at the event next week and people will be asked to wear face masks. The chosen birds were raised in Iowa and next week will board a train to Washington DC where they will stay in a hotel before making their way to the White House. Allow Twitter content?

Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics After dementia/Alzheimerâs disease and heart disease, Covid-19 caused the third most deaths in England and Wales in October, according to figures published today by the Office for National Statistics. In September, Covid-19 was the 19th-leading cause of death in England and 24th in Wales. But a sharp rise, from 600 to 3,200 deaths in a month, now mean that it caused more deaths in October than illnesses like strokes, lung or colon cancers and pneumonia. The total number of deaths in England and Wales is slightly higher than would be expected for an average October, driven largely by the Covid-19 deaths. Most of those other causes for death, including ischaemic heart disease, are actually running slightly below the average levels seen in the last five years. Failure to wear a mask can now cost residents in the Indian capital of Delhi even more as authorities nearly quadrupled the fines. Coronavirus infections are rising rapidly in the densely-populated city and authorities are keen to get a handle on the crisis. Officials can now fine anyone not wearing a face covering $27, up from $7, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Keriwai announced. The sheer number of dead bodies of coronavirus victims is overwhelming ambulance drivers who must transport them to crematoria across the city. The number of infections in the city and its outlying areas has crossed half a million. More than 8,000 people have died. A Scottish mother with cancer will be allowed to go on a ""final holiday"" with her children despite Scotland's travel ban, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Linzi Page, 38, who has stage-four cancer, will be exempt from rules preventing people traveling between Level 3 and Level 4 regions. At First Minister's Questions Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard asked about Ms Page's plan to fly to Tenerife from Edinburgh. Ms Sturgeon said she had spoken to Ms Page on Thursday morning. ""She told me that the family have had a tough year and that this holiday would be 'a nice memory for us',"" the first minister said. ""She said it is a precious time with the family which we will never get back."" Ms Sturgeon said she had told Ms Page travel for ""compassionate reasons which relate to the end of a person's life"" is exempt and the family is allowed to go on holiday. ""Under the regulations, anyone in a situation like hers can go on a final holiday,"" she said, adding: ""Linzi's situation is tragic but on both compassionate and indeed on legal grounds, she can go on her holiday and I wish her and her family well."" EU Chief negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted that the discussions will be paused for a ""short period"" but that teams will ""continue their work in full respect of guidelines"". Britain's negotiator David Frost tweeted that he is in close contact with Barnier. ""The health of our teams comes first,"" he added. There had been speculation that an EU-UK trade deal could be announced early next week.Barnier was expected to brief the EU's 27 member states on Friday morningabout the state of play. A deal would need to be in place by 1 January when Britain's transition period ends.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Mixing between households at Christmas could pose ""substantial risks"", particularly for older people more vulnerable to coronavirus, a scientist advising the government has warned. Prof Andrew Hayward said there would be a ""cost"" to families getting together. It comes as No 10 said proposals to ease restrictions over Christmas will be set out next week. Scientists have suggested that for every day measures are eased, five days of tighter rules would be needed. Prof Hayward, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, said mixing at Christmas does pose ""substantial risks"" particularly where generations ""with high incidence of infection"" socialise with older people ""who currently have much lower levels of infection and are at most risk of dying"" if they catch Covid-19. Prof Hayward - a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""My personal view is we're putting far too much emphasis on having a near-normal Christmas. ""We know respiratory infections peak in January so throwing fuel on the fire over Christmas can only contribute to this."" Sage is a committee attended by scientists across a range of fields. While its members may not individually agree, their role is to look at the evidence, and present a view to the government. Seven things that may be different this Christmas Oxford Covid vaccine 'encouraging' in older adults 'Why a family Christmas means so much to me this year' Mayor warns against Christmas Covid-19 complacency Another 22,915 cases of Covid have been recorded in the UK,,externaland there were 501 further deaths within 28 days of a positive test, the government's dashboard shows. The UK's four nations - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - are trying to work out a common approach to Christmas so families spread across the UK can still meet up. Scotland's First MinisterNicola Sturgeon said a meeting between the four nations on Wednesday had ""discussed the Christmas periodand how we could come to a sensible... and safe plan that would allow people, not 100% normality, but a greater degree of normality - in particular the ability to spend some time with loved ones"". Meanwhile,it is understood that Northern Ireland is set to face a two-week period of tougher restrictions from 27 November- with non-essential retail, pubs, restaurants and hotels all closed. There will be a partial reopening of some sectors for a week from Friday. Downing Street said plans for what will follow England's lockdown - which is expected to end on 2 December - and proposals to ease restrictions over Christmas would be set out next week. A No 10 spokesman said on Thursday that ministers would keep case numbers ""under review"" into next week, when it will ""set out more details of the next phase"" after lockdown ends. The spokesman pointed to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's previous comment that ""whilst Christmas will be a little bit different from normal this year, we continue to hope to ensure that families can spend Christmas together"". Any rule change would be for a limited time, maybe just a few days, BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle has said. But, he said, the advice was likely to urge families not to hold big gatherings and to travel by car, rather than public transport.

Public Health England's Dr Susan Hopkinssaid on Wednesday that tough restrictions might be needed before and after Christmasto allow mixing to take place during the holiday. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he did not want to be ""the Grinch that stole Christmas"" but No 10 wanted to safeguard the NHS and protect lives. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""I would love all of us to be able to have a Christmas, but more than anything I want us to get through this Covid and try and get this country back to normal and I want to protect lives."" Dr Gabriel Scally, president of epidemiology at the Royal Society of Medicine, told the same programme: ""There is no point having a very merry Christmas and then burying friends and family in January or February... It's too dangerous a time and opportunity for the virus to spread."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said she was concerned some NHS hospitals in Covid hotspots were seeing ""crowded"" emergency departments, as well as the beginnings of ""corridor care"" and ""problems unloading ambulances"". She said: ""That's the reality of what we've got in hospitals at the moment. Let's not have that happening and then we can talk about Christmas. But we're not in that situation at the moment."" Dr Henderson warned that we would ""regret"" a [festive] season that's given Granny Covid for Christmas"" rather than working through a ""rational, controlled, plan to come out the other side of this when we've got a vaccine into spring and we can actually start having a much more normal society"".

VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Prof Hayward also told the Today programme government messaging had not been consistent. He said: ""When policy is undulating between stay at home to save lives, eat out to help out, the tier system, the second lockdown and now proposals for an amnesty on social distancing - it is a highly inconsistent message."" Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence based medicine at the University of Oxford told the BBC said some ""coherent thinking"" from health officials was now required and they would need to ""take the public with them"" in the run up to Christmas. He said there had been some ""impressive falls"" in Covid cases in some areas and ""if we can see that carrying on we would be in a much better position to see what to do at Christmas"". It comes as scientists who advised the government during the early stages of the pandemic tolda BBC documentary focused on the first lockdownthat they ""never checked"" how Covid-19 could be spread by staff working at more than one care home.

"Cineworld introduced extra safety measures in its cinemas including wearing masks and social distancing Cineworld is looking to arrange a rescue deal that could mean UK cinema closures, the BBC understands. One option being discussed with bank lenders is a company voluntary arrangement, an insolvency process that could help Cineworld cut its rent bill. According to the Financial Times,which first reported the news,,externalCineworld has appointed restructuring experts AlixPartners. Like other cinema chains, Cineworld has been hit hard by the lockdown. The company reported a huge lossfor the first six months of the year after it was forced to temporarily close some cinemas, and movie studios delayed the release of some blockbusters. The cinema giant warned in September that it might need to raise more money in the event of further coronavirus restrictions or film delays due to Covid-19. Cineworld to shut down UK screens after Bond film delay Cineworld swings to huge loss after virus closures The coronavirus crisis has hit the film and entertainment industry hard. Cineworld swung to a $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) loss for the six months to June as its cinemas were forced to close as a result of Covid lockdowns. Although cinemas reopened when restrictions were relaxed, delays in big budget releases - such as the new James Bond movie - led Cineworld to temporarily close its UK cinemas on 9 October until further notice. Rival Odeon cut opening hours in October for the same reason, and all cinemas in England have been closed during the second lockdown which began on 5 November. Cinemas can open in Scotland if they meet certain criteria, but Cineworld is closed throughout the UK. The chain has been in talks with lenders to try to negotiate waivers on banking agreements, which fall due in December and in June next year. Company voluntary arrangements (CVA) have been used by retailers are part of restructurings to push through closures and rent cuts. But they have faced opposition from landlords. However, a source stressed to the BBC that a CVA was only one option being discussed. The Financial Times said Cineworld had been individually negotiating with landlords for rent cuts at its 127 sites. Cineworld declined to comment.

"This video can not be played Â£300m bailout essential to the sport sector - Dowden The government has announced a rescue package of Â£300m of emergency funding for sports in England impacted by the absence of spectators because of coronavirus. Both rugby codes and horse racing are among the beneficiaries, but not clubs in football's Premier League or the English Football League. Cricket was not on the initial list. DCMS minister Oliver Dowden told BBC Sport it is ""the most generous single package of any country in the world"". Speaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Dowden added that the package is ""essential"" to the sport sector and provides a ""lot of support"". When asked if it was enough to prevent clubs and competitions folding, he said the package is ""evidence-based"" and reflects the numbers provided by each sport to help them through a ""difficult winter"". Scottish government seeks 'urgent clarification' on emergency sport funding Northern Ireland elite sport to go behind closed doors The government said the Sports Winter Survival Package, which will be largely composed of low-interest loans, will support rugby union, horse racing, women's football and the lower tiers of the National League. It added that rugby league, motorsport, tennis, netball, basketball, ice hockey, badminton and greyhound racing were also in line to benefit. In July, the government announced aÂ£1.57bn support packagefor Britain's arts industry. ""It's worth remembering we have provided well over Â£1bn to sports already through things like the job retention scheme and various loan facilities,"" said Dowden. ""This is a very specific thing - sports, and mainly winter sports, were expecting to have fans in stadiums and didn't, we said we'd help them out."" Sports minister Nigel Huddleston added that grants would be available where organisations were unable to repay loans. He also said ""the door was open"" to any sport requiring funding, including cricket which was not on the initial list. The money available is for sports in England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland responsible for their own budgets. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) statement added: ""Preliminary allocations have been made on a needs-based assessment process and reflect the submissions made from the individual sports, and the funding process will be overseen by an independent decision-making board and supported by Sport England."" It said the first tranche of funding will be distributed in the coming weeks. Note: The final amount received by each sport/organisation may differ from the amounts set out when final decisions are made by an independent decision-making board, and supported by Sport England. Rugby Union: Â£135m- Rugby Football Union: Â£44m; Premiership clubs: Â£59m; Championship clubs: Â£9m; Clubs below Championship: Â£23m Horseracing: Â£40m- To racecourses Football: Â£28m -National League (steps 1-2): Â£11m; National League (steps 3-6): Â£14m; Women's Football (Women's Super League and FA Women's Championship): Â£3m Rugby League: Â£12m Motorsport: Â£6m- Owners/operators of major circuits (Silverstone, Goodwood, The British Automobile Racing Club, MotorSport Vision) Tennis: Â£5m- Lawn Tennis Association Netball: Â£4m- England Netball: Â£2m; Super League Netball: Â£2m Basketball: Â£4m -Basketball England: Â£1m; British Basketball League clubs (including Women's British Basketball League clubs): Â£3m Ice Hockey: Â£4m- Elite League Badminton: Â£2m- Badminton England Greyhound racing: Â£1m- Greyhound Board of Great Britain Leeds Rhinos and Catalans Dragons played at an empty Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington in November The Football Associationwelcomed the announcement and said it would ""await further detail of the eligibility, application process and timelines from Sport England"" before it was able to advise leagues and clubs. ""A number of clubs from across the football pyramid have been greatly affected by the pandemic and this financial package will provide vital assistance for them during this challenging period,"" the FA statement said. Chief executive officerBill Sweeneysaid the Rugby Football Union was grateful for the ""much-needed support"" and that the organisation would work with the government to find the ""appropriate balance between loans and grants"" for the different areas of the sport. Boxing did not receive any funding and Olympic gold medallistLuke Campbellsaid the sport has to ""come together to fight this"" and ""get the funding it needs to survive at all levels"". ""We would welcome the opportunity to have a grown-up conversation with someone involved in the decision making of this to see how we can get financial help for boxing and hopefully move the sport up the pecking order,"" he added. BBC Radio 5 Live boxing analyst Steve Bunce said the sport ""expected"" and ""deserved"" Â£2m-4m of funding and missing out means ""thousands of boxers denied, hundreds of gyms left struggling"". Kat Ratnapala,director of netball at Saracens Mavericks, told BBC Radio 5 Live that the funding would help her club compete in next season's Superleague, starting in February. ""It's been a tough year for us, financially, to make ends meet,"" she said. ""We set up a funding page just so we could come through the first Covid lockdown. It's a loan and we need to pay that back eventually. ""We're definitely not out of the woods, but it's a bit of breathing room so that we can get back on to court at least and get a full season under our belts."" Adrian Christy,Badminton England's chief executive, said the funding could help stave off the threat of job losses in the organisation. ""Since the start of the pandemic, Badminton England has lost more than Â£2.2m in income,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""The Â£2m award will help significantly towards closing the gap. ""It ensures the Yonex All-England Championships can take place - it's the biggest event on the world tour and a qualification event for the Olympics. ""The operation of the organisation also needs the support with 25% of our staff at risk of redundancy - we hope we can save some jobs as a direct consequence. And also, we repurposed Sport England's money from the outset for our survival. That money was taken away from the grassroots."" British Horseracing Authority chief executiveNick Rustpraised members of his team for presenting their case to government and officials. ""The support for racing recognises the sport's position as the second biggest spectator sport in the UK and the financial peril faced by the tens of thousands who depend upon racing for their livelihoods,"" he said. ""The BHA team work tirelessly to protect the interests of racing. While advancing the case for financial support, they have also helped to ensure the sport continues behind closed doors, with owners present, and supported the efforts to get spectators back. I am very proud of all they are achieving."" Swimming missed out on the funding and Swim England chief executiveJane Nickersonstressed aquatic sports are also ""fighting for survival"" and need to be supported. ""It's encouraging to see support being provided for those organisations who have lost their major spectator income - now what I would like to see is any further government investment focused on sports that have missed out on this package but have also been severely impacted by coronavirus restrictions,"" she said. ""While we may not be classed as a major spectator sport, swimming is one of the biggest participation sports with 14 million adults swimming in 2019.""

"Fifteen pro-democracy lawmakers resigned this month in protest at China's new rules China has strongly rebuked the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada after being accused of a concerted effort to silence critics in Hong Kong. The countries, which form the Five Eyes alliance, criticised China's imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong. They urged Beijing to reverse course. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman responded that if countries ""dared harm China's sovereignty, they should beware that their eyes could be blinded"". ""The Chinese never stir trouble , but they aren't afraid of trouble either,""  Zhao Lijian told journalists in Beijing on Thursday, saying it did not ""matter if they had five or 10 eyes"". Chinaâs new brand of tough-talking diplomats Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? Why people are scared of Hong Kong's new law Last week, Hong Kong expelled four pro-democracy lawmakers from its legislature after Beijing passed a resolution allowing the city's government to dismiss politicians deemed a threat to national security. In response,all of Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers announced their resignation.For the first time since the UK handed the territory back to China in 1997, the body has almost no dissenting voices. This video can not be played Claudia Mo: ""We have given up the legislative fight at least for the time being."" The dismissal of the four lawmakers was viewed by many as the latest attempt by China to restrict Hong Kong's freedoms, something Beijing denies. Foreign ministers from the Five Eyes group urged China to reinstate them, saying the move was a clear breach of Beijing's legally binding commitments to protect the territory's freedoms and autonomy. They also accused Beijing of undermining the rights of people in Hong Kong to elect their representatives. Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing alliance of the five Anglophone countries set up during the Cold War and initially developed to monitor the USSR and its allies.

As a Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong was to have its own legal system, multiple political parties, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech. But in late June China passed a controversial, far-reaching national security law in the territory after years of pro-democracy and anti-Beijing protests, which reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. It criminalises ""secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces"". Beijing says the law will return stability to the territory, but western governments and human rights groups say it effectively curtails freedom of speech and protest.

"Mike Pompeo flew by helicopter to the Psagot winery, in a Jewish settlement close to Ramallah Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has toured a Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - the first such visit by a top US official. The trip to Psagot came a year afterMr Pompeo said the settlements did not contradict international law, reversing a long-held US position. The declaration outraged Palestinians, who oppose settlements on land they claim for a future independent state. Mr Pompeo later paid a similar visit to the occupied Golan Heights. Pompeo eyes history on swansong trip to Israel President Donald Trump last year officially recognised Israeli sovereignty over the strategic plateau, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in 1981. Mr Trump is a close ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and analysts say Mr Pompeo's actions could be seen as a valedictory gesture before he and the president leave the world stage. Israel's Jerusalem settler homes plan criticised US alters passport ruling for Jerusalem births Israel's borders explained in maps Mr Pompeo arrived in Israel on Wednesday for what is likely to be his last trip to Israel before leaving office in January. After meeting Mr Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday morning, he announced thatthe state department would declare as anti-Semitic the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which campaigns for a complete boycott of Israel over its policies towards the Palestinians. This video can not be played Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: 'US regards BDS movement as anti-Semitic' Israel says that BDS opposes the country's very existence and is motivated by anti-Semitism. BDS rejects the charge, saying Israel is using it as a cover for its actions. Mr Pompeo also told reporters that ""for a long time the state department took the wrong view of settlements"" in the West Bank. ""It took a view that didn't recognise the history of this special place and instead now today the United States department of state stands strongly to the recognition that settlements can be done in a way that's lawful and appropriate and proper,"" he added. Palestinians protested near Psagot on Wednesday after reports of Mike Pompeo's plans emerged He then travelled by helicopter to the Psagot winery, in a Jewish settlement close to Ramallah. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. While Psagot winery staff would not comment officially on this visit in advance, the BBC was shown one of the last bottles of ""Pompeo"" red - a blend of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot, described on the label as ""refreshing, fruity and beautifully balanced"". It was named after the US secretary of state declared last year that settlements were ""not, per se, inconsistent with international law"". Most countries still believe that they are. The Psagot winery has a vineyard on privately-owned Palestinian land and is owned by US donors to the Trump administration. It is well-known for its international efforts to have its wines labelled as coming from Israel. However, European courts have rejected its attempts to mark bottles in this way, saying that products manufactured in West Bank settlements need to be labelled as such. Following his visit to Psagot,Mr Pompeo issued a statement,externalsaying the US would require goods imported from areas ""where Israel exercises the relevant authorities"" to be marked as ""Israel"", ""Made in Israel"", or ""Product of Israel"". The guidelines, he said, applied ""most notably"" to the 60% of the West Bank, classified as ""Area C"" under the Oslo Accords, that is under full Israeli military and civilian control and where much of the settler population lives. It includes the Jordan Valley and many Palestinian communities. Exports from West Bank areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority had to be labelled ""West Bank"", and those from Hamas-controlled Gaza marked as ""Gaza"", Mr Pompeo added, arguing that the territories were ""politically and administratively separate and should be treatedâ¯accordingly"". Mr Pompeo also became the first top US official to visit the occupied Golan Heights Palestinian leaders called Mr Pompeo's actions a provocation. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said: ""Pompeo's visit to occupied land is an active participation in the occupation."" Syria has also appealed to the United Nations to condemn the ""provocative"" visit, calling it ""a flagrant violation"" of Syrian sovereignty, a government source told state media. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to reverse Mr Pompeo's declaration on settlements, but he has said he will not undo Mr Trump's decision in 2017 to recognise of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. What does Trump's Mid-East plan say on key issues? Can the Jewish settlement issue be resolved? Golan Heights profile Mr Pompeo later became the first US secretary of state to visit the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, visiting a hilltop overlooking the Syrian-held part of the plateau with Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi.

"Fashion chains Peacocks and Jaeger have fallen into administration, putting more than 4,700 jobs and almost 500 shops at risk. It comes after owner Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group failed to find a buyer for both businesses. No redundancies have been announced yet and no stores closed. EWM Group blamed the pandemic for a collapse in trade, but said it was still in talks with potential buyers. ""In recent weeks we have had constructive discussions with a number of potential buyers for Peacocks and Jaeger,"" it said in a statement. ""But the continuing deterioration of the retail sector due to the impact of the pandemic and second lockdown have made this process longer and more complex than we would have hoped."" It said that a ""standstill agreement"" secured with the High Court that temporarily put off administration had now expired. ""Therefore as directors we taken the desperately difficult decision to place Peacocks and Jaeger into administration while those talks continue,"" it said. Jaeger is a London-based fashion business with 76 stores and concessions and employs 347 staff. Cardiff-based Peacocks operates 423 stores with 4,369 staff. Some Peacocks stores had already begun to shut following an announcement on 15 October. Philip Day has quietly built a retail empire over the last 18 years and his huge footprint on high streets across the UK served him well. He did so by snapping up a string of businesses out of administration. Critics say he didn't do much with them. He didn't do much business online, either. That left him and his chains more exposed when shoppers stampeded to the internet during lockdown. Mr Day still has Bonmarche, a business which he bought through a separate investment vehicle and isn't affected by the current insolvency process. It went into administration last year amid challenging trading conditions. He went on to buy it back, with fewer stores. Will he now do the same with Peacocks or walk away? According to the most recent company accounts, the EWM Group made a pre-tax profit of Â£31m in the six months until March 2019. It also had plenty of cash in the bank and next to no debt. How quickly things have unravelled. The news come two weeks after Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group called in administrators for its eponymous clothing chain and its homeware brand Ponden Home, putting almost 3,000 more jobs at risk. Tony Wright, joint administrator of the business from FRP Advisory, said talks with potential buyers for Jaeger and Peacocks were at an advanced stage, suggesting the brands could still be saved. ""Jaeger and Peacocks are attractive brands that have suffered the well-known challenges that many retailers face at present,"" he said. ""We are in advanced discussions with a number of parties and working hard to secure a future for both businesses."" Edinburgh Woollen Mill (EWM) is owned by businessman Philip Day, who has a Â£1.14bn fortune, according to the Sunday Times Rich List published in May 2020.

"Mike Pompeo flew by helicopter to the Psagot winery, in a Jewish settlement close to Ramallah Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has toured a Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - the first such visit by a top US official. The trip to Psagot came a year afterMr Pompeo said the settlements did not contradict international law, reversing a long-held US position. The declaration outraged Palestinians, who oppose settlements on land they claim for a future independent state. Mr Pompeo later paid a similar visit to the occupied Golan Heights. Pompeo eyes history on swansong trip to Israel President Donald Trump last year officially recognised Israeli sovereignty over the strategic plateau, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed in 1981. Mr Trump is a close ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and analysts say Mr Pompeo's actions could be seen as a valedictory gesture before he and the president leave the world stage. Israel's Jerusalem settler homes plan criticised US alters passport ruling for Jerusalem births Israel's borders explained in maps Mr Pompeo arrived in Israel on Wednesday for what is likely to be his last trip to Israel before leaving office in January. After meeting Mr Netanyahu in Jerusalem on Thursday morning, he announced thatthe state department would declare as anti-Semitic the global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which campaigns for a complete boycott of Israel over its policies towards the Palestinians. This video can not be played Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: 'US regards BDS movement as anti-Semitic' Israel says that BDS opposes the country's very existence and is motivated by anti-Semitism. BDS rejects the charge, saying Israel is using it as a cover for its actions. Mr Pompeo also told reporters that ""for a long time the state department took the wrong view of settlements"" in the West Bank. ""It took a view that didn't recognise the history of this special place and instead now today the United States department of state stands strongly to the recognition that settlements can be done in a way that's lawful and appropriate and proper,"" he added. Palestinians protested near Psagot on Wednesday after reports of Mike Pompeo's plans emerged He then travelled by helicopter to the Psagot winery, in a Jewish settlement close to Ramallah. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. While Psagot winery staff would not comment officially on this visit in advance, the BBC was shown one of the last bottles of ""Pompeo"" red - a blend of shiraz, cabernet sauvignon and merlot, described on the label as ""refreshing, fruity and beautifully balanced"". It was named after the US secretary of state declared last year that settlements were ""not, per se, inconsistent with international law"". Most countries still believe that they are. The Psagot winery has a vineyard on privately-owned Palestinian land and is owned by US donors to the Trump administration. It is well-known for its international efforts to have its wines labelled as coming from Israel. However, European courts have rejected its attempts to mark bottles in this way, saying that products manufactured in West Bank settlements need to be labelled as such. Following his visit to Psagot,Mr Pompeo issued a statement,externalsaying the US would require goods imported from areas ""where Israel exercises the relevant authorities"" to be marked as ""Israel"", ""Made in Israel"", or ""Product of Israel"". The guidelines, he said, applied ""most notably"" to the 60% of the West Bank, classified as ""Area C"" under the Oslo Accords, that is under full Israeli military and civilian control and where much of the settler population lives. It includes the Jordan Valley and many Palestinian communities. Exports from West Bank areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority had to be labelled ""West Bank"", and those from Hamas-controlled Gaza marked as ""Gaza"", Mr Pompeo added, arguing that the territories were ""politically and administratively separate and should be treatedâ¯accordingly"". Mr Pompeo also became the first top US official to visit the occupied Golan Heights Palestinian leaders called Mr Pompeo's actions a provocation. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, said: ""Pompeo's visit to occupied land is an active participation in the occupation."" Syria has also appealed to the United Nations to condemn the ""provocative"" visit, calling it ""a flagrant violation"" of Syrian sovereignty, a government source told state media. President-elect Joe Biden is expected to reverse Mr Pompeo's declaration on settlements, but he has said he will not undo Mr Trump's decision in 2017 to recognise of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. What does Trump's Mid-East plan say on key issues? Can the Jewish settlement issue be resolved? Golan Heights profile Mr Pompeo later became the first US secretary of state to visit the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, visiting a hilltop overlooking the Syrian-held part of the plateau with Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi. ""You can't stand here and stare out at what's across the border and deny the central thing that President Trump recognised, that previous presidents had refused to do, that this is a part of Israel, and a central part of Israel,"" he said.

"Australia has had forces in Afghanistan since 2002 There is ""credible evidence"" that Australian elite soldiers unlawfully killed 39 people during the Afghan war, a long-awaited report has found. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has released findings from a four-year inquiry into misconduct by its forces. It said 19 current or ex-special forces soldiers should be investigated by police over killings of ""prisoners, farmers or civilians"" in 2009-13. The ADF blamed crimes on an unchecked ""warrior culture"" among some soldiers. The inquiry - conducted by Maj Gen Justice Paul Brereton - conducted interviews with more than 400 witnesses. It also found evidence that: Junior soldiers were told to get their first kill by shooting prisoners, in a practice known as ""blooding"" Weapons and other items were planted near Afghan bodies to cover up crimes An additional two incidents could constitute a war crime of ""cruel treatment"" Afghanistan said it had been assured by Australia that it was committed to ""ensuring justice"". Samantha Crompvoets, an academic who carried out the initial research into the incidents, told the BBC they were ""deliberate, repeated and targeted war crimes"" and said she felt vindicated by the report. Australia has had forces in Afghanistan since 2002, following the overthrow of the Taliban, as part of a US-led coalition. Initially the international forces' role was to train Afghan troops but they became increasingly involved in fighting insurgents. Gen Angus Campbell said none of the incidents could be ""described as being in the heat of battle"" It said 25 special forces soldiers had taken part in unlawful killings directly or as ""accessories"", across 23 separate incidents. It recommended that 36 incidents in total be investigated by federal police. ADF chief Gen Angus Campbell said none of the incidents could be ""described as being in the heat of battle"". ""None were alleged to have occurred in circumstances in which the intent of the perpetrator was unclear, confused or mistaken,"" he told reporters on Thursday. ICC backs Afghan war crimes probe Did UK Special Forces execute unarmed civilians? Gen Campbell said there was alarming evidence that some Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers had taken ""the law into their own hands"". ""The report notes that the distorted culture was embraced and amplified by some experienced, charismatic and influential non-commissioned officers and their proteges, who sought to fuse military excellence with ego, elitism and entitlement,"" he said. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? The report said it would be a ""gross distortion"" to blame senior ADF command, saying the crimes were ""commenced... and concealed at the patrol commander level"". Dr Crompvoets said the incidents ""involved in some instances very influential non-commissioned officers"". ""Platoon commanders were encouraging or insisting junior soldiers execute prisoners to achieve their first kill, so it was that sort of pattern of behaviour of grooming these junior soldiers for, or initiating them into, the squadron - that's what was very disturbing,"" she told BBC World Service's Newsday programme. The inquiry was conducted behind closed doors, meaning few details have been reported until now. Last week, PM Scott Morrison warned the report contained ""difficult and hard news for Australians"" about its special forces. ""It is the environment [within the ADF], it is the context, it is the rules, it is the culture and the command that sat around those things,"" he said. ""And if we want to deal with the truth of this, we have to deal with the truth of that."" The office of Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani said Mr Morrison had phoned to express his ""deepest sorrow"" over the findings. The country's foreign ministry, quoted by AFP, said the incidents mentioned in the report were ""unforgivable"" but its publication was ""an important step towards justice"". The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC)welcomed the report,externalbut noted it had not established enough evidence to ensure criminal prosecution. It said it was vital that this be sought and ""adequate compensation"" provided without delay. ""Only through a series of independent inquiries will we uncover the true extent of this disregard for Afghan life, which normalised murder, and resulted in war crimes,"" it said. Elaine Pearson, from Human Rights Watch, told the BBC: ""This is a vindication - this is an acknowledgement that these crimes occurred."" Dr Crompvoets said she had faced ""huge resistance"" when her initial report was leaked but had now been proved right. ""I was certainly criticised for being a female, a civilian, a feminist, that somehow I was trying to feminise defence,"" she said. ""It wasn't about me not understanding what it's like to be at war,"" she added. ""It was quite evident there were fundamental things that had gone wrong."" The defence chief's language was as part of this story as the findings themselves. He started by apologising to the Afghan people for any wrongdoing, then told the Australian people they had the right to expect better from their special forces. He used words like shameful, appalling and toxic when describing the actions of some troops and the culture in which they operated. And it wasn't just that these alleged executions took place, it was the manner of impunity by which they happened. In fact, according to the report, there was an air of competitiveness within the special forces. One moment stood out in Gen Campbell's address: when he described how some junior soldiers had allegedly been coerced to shoot unarmed civilians to get their ""first kill"" - a practice known as ""blooding"". He said that weapons and radios had then been allegedly planted to support claims that the victims had been enemies killed in action. The public version of the report is highly redacted and we don't know details of specific incidents or specific individuals. But it has been enough to make for very uncomfortable reading for the military, the government and for the Australian public. Last week, Mr Morrison said a special investigator would be appointed to consider prosecutions from information contained in the report. Australian media reported that police investigations would be likely to take years, even before possible criminal trials. Fighting for a future in a war without end How much has the Afghanistan war cost the US? The Afghan war: The short and long story Gen Campbell said one SAS squadron had been shut down, and it was the ADF's responsibility to ""set things right"". The government said it would also establish an independent oversight panel to provide ""accountability and transparency that sits outside of the ADF chain of command"". Australia maintains an operation of around 400 soldiers in Afghanistan as part ongoing peacekeeping efforts with the US and other allies. Earlier this year, the International Criminal Court (ICC) began investigating alleged war crimes by the US and others in the Afghan conflict. The actions of the Taliban, the Afghan government and US troops since May 2003 are expected to be examined. A 2016 report from the ICC said there was a reasonable basis,externalto believe the US military had committed torture at secret detention sites operated by the CIA. The report also said it was reasonable to believe the Afghan government had tortured prisoners and the Taliban had committed war crimes such as the mass killing of civilians. In Britain, the High Court is considering whether the UK failed to properly investigate allegations of unlawful killing by UK Special Forces. And on Thursday, the AIHRC also called for the UK ""to open an independent public inquiry to review and investigate the allegations of unlawful killings by UK Special Forces"". Last year,the BBC's Panorama programme revealedthat the UK had failed to fully investigate credible evidence of a pattern of illegal killings carried out by British Special Forces. ""The US and UK, and other countries with an armed presence in Afghanistan [should] respond to these media reports, and to investigate their forces' participation, and leadership, of acts of violence against Afghan non-combatants,"" the AIHRC said in a statement.

"The first vaccination against coronavirus is expected to be delivered in Scotland next month, the health secretary has announced. Jeane Freeman said the NHS would be ready to vaccinate people from the first week of December if safety approval is given. It is hoped up to one million people could be vaccinated by the end of January if there are no delays. Frontline NHS and care workers will be among the first recipients. Ms Freeman said distributing the vaccine would be one of ""the biggest civilian logistical challenges in our lifetime"". How Scotland reached 5,000 deaths during the pandemic Health boards 'will be ready' to deliver vaccine Who will have the vaccine first and when can I get it? A total of three vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford and Moderna - have alreadyreported good preliminary datafrom trials. The health secretary said it was not yet known which vaccines would be approved for use or precisely when the first doses would be delivered. She added: ""The safety of the Covid-19 vaccine is paramount to us. ""Scotland has a strong track record of delivering immunisation programmes, but this programme will be the largest of its kind ever undertaken. ""NHS Boards will identify acceptable and accessible locations, both for mass vaccination and for local access. ""We will be getting in touch with the first priority groups in the coming weeks and I urge people to take up the vaccine when they are offered it."" Ms Freeman said that if the vaccines at the most advanced stage get regulatory approval then the Scottish government hopes to have 320,000 doses to deploy in the first two weeks of December. The UK government health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the NHS in the rest of the UK is ready to begin delivering the Pfizer vaccine from the start of next month but warned what was ""more likely is that we may be able to start rolling it out before Christmas"". Everyone over the age of 18 in Scotland, a total of 4.4m people, will be offered the vaccination by the end of the programme. Ms Freeman suggested this could be achieved by the spring of next year. A senior Scottish government health source later said the aim was to vaccinate all over-18s ""as fast as possible"" but stressed there was ""no firm delivery timetable"". The priorities for the first wave of vaccine distribution, from December to February, are: front-line health and social care staff older residents in care homes care home staff all those aged 80 and over unpaid carers and personal assistants those delivering the vaccination programme. The next tranche of immunisations is expected to take place from February if there are no delays. It will target those over the age of 65 and younger people with extra clinical risks. They will be followed by the wider general population. A workforce of about 2,000 vaccinators will be needed, and support from the military will be provided to ensure the vaccination programme runs smoothly. Ms Freeman said the NHS was looking at mirroring some aspects of the flu jab programme for the rollout of the vaccine The logistics of how the vaccines are transported and stored are still being addressed, she added. The vaccines will be delivered in a range of public locations, as well as through mobile sites and in some cases in people's homes. Walk-through and drive-through clinics being used for the flu vaccination programme are being considered for use in the rollout of the Covid vaccine. Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said lessons needed to be learned from the ""chaotic"" flu vaccination programme. She added: ""The ambition to deliver one million vaccinations by the end of January needs to be matched by resources and investment in staff, and a clear plan on logistics."" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said distributing the vaccine would be ""one of the biggest public health exercises in history"".

"This video can not be played WATCH: BBC News uncovers evidence that women have not been told about serious abnormalities A BBC News investigation has uncovered failures in the diagnosis of serious medical issues during private baby scans. More than 200 studios across the UK now sell ultrasound scans, with hundreds of thousands being carried out each year. But the BBC has found evidence of women not being told about serious conditions and abnormalities. The Care Quality Commission says there is good quality care in the industry but it has a ""growing concern"". Private baby scanning studios offer a variety of services. Some diagnose medical issues while others market themselves as providers of souvenir images or video of the ultrasound. Most sell packages providing a ""reassurance scan"" to expectant mums. The growing popularity of gender reveal parties means many women visit private baby scan studios to buy confetti cannons and balloons which unveil the sex of their baby after the scan. Many women BBC News spoke to said they had positive experiences at private studios, but we have also learned of instances where women said they were failed. Charlotte, from Manchester, attended a scan in Salford with one of the biggest franchises, Window to the Womb, to record her baby's sex for a party and check its wellbeing. BBC News has learned the sonographer identified a serious abnormality that meant the baby could not survive, where part or all of its head is missing, called anencephaly. But rather than refer her immediately to hospital and provide a medical report, Charlotte was told the baby's head could not be fully seen and recommended to book an NHS anomaly scan. She was also given a gender reveal cannon and a teddy bear containing a recording of its heartbeat as a present for her daughter. Charlotte only found out the baby could not survive the day after her gender reveal party, when she showed scan images to a family friend who was an experienced sonographer. ""I was distraught,"" Charlotte said. ""You've bonded with that baby."" ""To get that news the next day, I then had to go and tell every single one of those people what happened. ""It's like a deep cut feeling,"" she added. ""All of it could have just been avoided, we could have processed the news all together as a family because I was with my mum and dad, I would have had the support there."" Charlotte was given a teddy bear containing her baby's heartbeat even though the scan showed it could not survive Window To The Womb has said all its staff are registered with the Health and Care Professions Council but BBC News has learned the sonographer who conducted the scan was not. The company said: ""An anomaly was identified however the communication from the sonographer was not to the standard that we expect."" It apologised to Charlotte at the time. It says that the sonographer left shortly afterwards and the incident led to best practice being reinforced across its branches. The profession of those scanning women, sonography, is not regulated like midwifery or radiography, leading some to question the quality of private baby scans and their interpretation. ""You're doing the most difficult scans at the trickiest time for the most anxious group of people with a workforce that you don't necessarily know their level of skills, expertise and what training they've actually had,"" said Jeanette Dickson, president of the Royal College of Radiologists. Almost all sonographers are regulated separately as radiographers or midwives in the NHS, as are many in private studios. But Dr Dickson says regulation of sonographers is necessary because of the growth of the industry. ""It matters now because of the massive increase in these companies,"" she said. Dr Dickson says regulation of sonographers is needed Some baby scan studios say they do not diagnose medical problems but still sell scans offering ""reassurance"" which typically detect a heartbeat. One of these companies, Meet Your Miracle, advertises scans which its website says ""visualise"" wellbeing. BBC News has seen messages from a WhatsApp group of the company's management and sonographers which shared and reviewed customer scans, sometimes during appointments. One sonographer told the group she felt guilty after having to let a woman leave without informing her of a possible abnormality identified by a colleague as potentially being foetal hydrops, which has a very low chance of survival. ""I knew something was wrong straight away, didn't know what to do,"" reads one message from the sonographer. Shortly after, she added: ""I feel terrible at saying nothing and I'm wracked with guilt for not saying anything."" Messages from one company WhatsApp group reveal anxiety over not informing a woman about a potential abnormality Despite being a non-medical company, a former employee told the BBC women who were bleeding and in pain were accepted for scans, rather than being recommended to immediately contact the NHS. Meet Your Miracle says its scans are largely ""recreational"" and under its registration it cannot discuss any concerns unless they are relevant to the baby's heartbeat nor offer a potential diagnosis which requires further tests by the NHS. It says it advises women bleeding and in pain to attend the NHS. The NHS says bleeding during pregnancy is relatively common butadvises women to contact their midwife or GP,externalif bleeding from their vagina. BBC News looked at the practices of many private companies and also uncovered concerns about how the industry operates more widely including: Failure to diagnose an ectopic pregnancy and multiple spina bifida cases Women undergoing private baby scans more than a dozen times during pregnancies not regarded as high risk. The NHS provides two scans unless there is a clinical need for more A studio which has not been inspected by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in England four years after opening Companies offering non-essential '4D' scans during lockdown which visualise the foetus but have no medical benefit to women Use of doppler function to listen to heartbeats of foetuses under 12 weeks despite NICE guidance recommending against routine use in low-risk pregnancies The findings reveal a ""catalogue of incredibly poor practice"", according to Jacqueline Torrington, a lecturer in medical ultrasound at City University London. ""[There is] an entire range of harms here, which are completely unnecessary,"" she said. ""It ranges from incredibly dangerous to anxiety inducing to false reassurance."" Women were allowed to bring partners to many private scans, but not NHS ones, early in the coronavirus pandemic In England, all studios must register with the CQC, which regulates the care provided by services. But BBC News has learned the CQC does not review samples of scans as part of its inspections and found a studio which had not been inspected since opening four years ago. The CQC says it bases decisions over which studios to inspect on ""information of concern"" or according to risk. It says there is good quality care in the industry as a whole but it has a ""growing concern"". Studios need only register with the regulator in Scotland if they are run by registered healthcare professionals. In Wales, businesses have to register only if a doctor is employed to interpret scans. In a statement, the government said: ""We are committed to appropriate regulations for all health and care professions so patients can feel confident their care has been placed in safe and qualified hands."" Northern Ireland's Department of Health said it was not aware of any baby scan studios. NHS advice for pregnant women can be foundhere,external.

"The pupils were inspired by a David Attenborough show on the plight of the penguins A group of Stirling High School pupils have been praised after helping discover a new colony of emperor penguins in the Antarctic. The pupils initially developed and coded an algorithm to identify penguin colonies from satellite imagery. Researchers at the British Antarctic Survey then used higher-resolution imaging to confirm the colony. Their study reveals nearly 20% more emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica than previously thought. The smudges on the ice show the existence of an emperor penguin colony The students were inspired by a Sir David Attenborough programme on the plight of penguins. They wanted to see if the colonies could be located using freely-available satellite imagery and processing software. Dr Andrew McDonald from Stirling High School said: ""To be acknowledged in a peer-reviewed paper was a great boost to the group and showed that it is possible to perform meaningful real science in schools."" The pupils' work was part of an Institute for Research in Schools project called Earth Observation. Emperor penguins need sea ice in order to breed Dr Peter Fretwell and Philip Trathan, the geographers and researchers for the British Antarctic Survey, praised the pupils in their research paper on the study. It found 11 new colonies, three of which were previously identified but never confirmed. A number of colonies were located far offshore, situated on sea ice that has formed around icebergs that had grounded in shallow water. Dr Phil Trathan, head of conservation biology at the British Antarctic Survey said: ""Whilst it's good news that we've found these new colonies, the breeding sites are all in locations where recent model projections suggest emperors will decline. ""We need to watch these sites carefully as climate change will affect this region.""

"The coffin of a Scottish care worker who died during the first wave of the pandemic There have now been more than 5,000 deaths in Scotland linked to Covid-19, according to official figures. The National Records of Scotland (NRS), which counts all death certificates which mention the virus, said5,135 people had died as of 15 November,external, up from 4,857 the week before. The sheer number of deaths is enough to underline the impact that the pandemic has had on Scotland, but what do we know of the complex picture behind this figure? In the spring, the number of deaths per week from Covid-19 accelerated very quickly. Between 16-22 March there were11deaths. Just four weeks later,650deaths were recorded between 13-19 April. Deaths peaked in the week beginning 20 April, when661Covid deaths were recorded. The number of new deaths from Covid-19 stabilised over the summer, but the weekly totals began to rise again in September. In the first week of September, there were just two deaths using the NRS measure - last week there were 278 and there is no sign yet of the rate beginning to decrease. There are two main ways of counting deaths from Covid-19. The Scottish government releases daily figures of those who died following a positive test, and the NRS counts death certificates mentioning Covid-19 - even if the person has not been tested for the virus. But the NRS also publishes monthly figures on excess deaths from all causes, compared with a five-year average. As of 15 November, there had been5,738more deaths than would be expected since the start of the outbreak in Scotland, when measured against this average. Some of the non-Covid excess deaths in the early days of the outbreak could actually have been caused by the virus, but the link was perhaps missed because there were lower levels of testing and less knowledge about the disease. Others can be seen as indirect deaths - for example deaths from other conditions when people could not access the treatment they needed. More than three-quarters all deaths involving Covid-19 up until 8 November were of people aged 75 or over. The virus has caused the death of34people under 45, but there have been447deaths among those aged between 45 and 64. No-one under 15 years old has died from Covid-19 in Scotland, according to the NRS. Looking at the death rates per 100,000 people across each local authority in Scotland, eight out of the top 10 are in western Scotland. The highest death rate in the country has been in West Dunbartonshire, with159 deaths per 100,000, followed by Inverclyde with a rate of157. The lowest rate is in the Western Isles which as of 8 November had only seenone deathfrom Covid-19. Comparisons between nations are difficult to do because of the different demographic make-up. The ONS looked at this issue back in July using the excess deaths measure. The comparison suggested England had been the hardest hit in Europe, with Scotland ranked third, behind Spain. How this will be reflected in the second wave is not yet clear. There have been54,510deaths from all causes in Scotland in 2020 so far and there are likely to be another 8,000 deaths or so before the end of the year, judging from averages over the last five years. If Scotland reaches almost 63,000 deaths this year, it will be the highest overall death toll since1993. Adjusting for population changes, it will be the highest number of deaths per 100,000 people since1999. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Fifteen pro-democracy lawmakers resigned this month in protest at China's new rules China has strongly rebuked the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada after being accused of a concerted effort to silence critics in Hong Kong. The countries, which form the Five Eyes alliance, criticised China's imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong. They urged Beijing to reverse course. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman responded that if countries ""dared harm China's sovereignty, they should beware that their eyes could be blinded"". ""The Chinese never stir trouble , but they aren't afraid of trouble either,""  Zhao Lijian told journalists in Beijing on Thursday, saying it did not ""matter if they had five or 10 eyes"". Chinaâs new brand of tough-talking diplomats Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? Why people are scared of Hong Kong's new law Last week, Hong Kong expelled four pro-democracy lawmakers from its legislature after Beijing passed a resolution allowing the city's government to dismiss politicians deemed a threat to national security. In response,all of Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers announced their resignation.For the first time since the UK handed the territory back to China in 1997, the body has almost no dissenting voices. This video can not be played Claudia Mo: ""We have given up the legislative fight at least for the time being."" The dismissal of the four lawmakers was viewed by many as the latest attempt by China to restrict Hong Kong's freedoms, something Beijing denies. Foreign ministers from the Five Eyes group urged China to reinstate them, saying the move was a clear breach of Beijing's legally binding commitments to protect the territory's freedoms and autonomy. They also accused Beijing of undermining the rights of people in Hong Kong to elect their representatives. Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing alliance of the five Anglophone countries set up during the Cold War and initially developed to monitor the USSR and its allies. Earlier, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said any attempt by foreign states to threaten or pressure Beijing to make concessions was ""doomed to fail"". This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 Hong Kong was returned to China under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which allowed it to retain more rights and freedoms than the mainland until 2047. As a Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong was to have its own legal system, multiple political parties, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech. But in late June China passed a controversial, far-reaching national security law in the territory after years of pro-democracy and anti-Beijing protests, which reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. It criminalises ""secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces"". Beijing says the law will return stability to the territory, but western governments and human rights groups say it effectively curtails freedom of speech and protest. After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety. Earlier this month, a reporter who helped investigate suspected police involvement in a violent attack on protesters last year was arrested, in whatjournalists said was a tactic to discourage reporting. In response to the security law, theUK offered Hong Kong residents still holding British National Overseas (BNO) statusa route to British citizenship. Around 300,000 people currently hold BNO passports, while an estimated 2.9 million people born before the handover are eligible for one.China last month strongly criticised the UKin response, telling London to ""immediately correct its mistakes"".

"Twenty-one people were killed in two blasts on 21 November 1974 A man arrested in connection with the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings which killed 21 people is reported to be Michael Patrick Reilly. The blasts at the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on the night of 21 November also injured 220 people. Police said a man, 65, was held at his Belfast home on Wednesday under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and would be questioned in Northern Ireland. Mr Reilly has strongly denied any involvement in the bombings. Inquests into the deaths of those killed in the bombings found they were unlawfully killed West Midlands Police added the address was being searched and the man was to be interviewed under caution at a police station. Fresh inquests last year ruled the victims were unlawfully killed, but did not establish who was responsible. Six men, who became known as the Birmingham Six, were wrongly jailed for the bombings in 1975 following a botched police investigation, but their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991. Saturday marks the 46th anniversary of the bombings and the arrest comes within a month of an announcement from Home Secretary Priti Patel that she would consider the case for a public inquiry into the attacks.

"This video can not be played Â£300m bailout essential to the sport sector - Dowden The government has announced a rescue package of Â£300m of emergency funding for sports in England impacted by the absence of spectators because of coronavirus. Both rugby codes and horse racing are among the beneficiaries, but not clubs in football's Premier League or the English Football League. Cricket was not on the initial list. DCMS minister Oliver Dowden told BBC Sport it is ""the most generous single package of any country in the world"". Speaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Dowden added that the package is ""essential"" to the sport sector and provides a ""lot of support"". When asked if it was enough to prevent clubs and competitions folding, he said the package is ""evidence-based"" and reflects the numbers provided by each sport to help them through a ""difficult winter"". Scottish government seeks 'urgent clarification' on emergency sport funding Northern Ireland elite sport to go behind closed doors The government said the Sports Winter Survival Package, which will be largely composed of low-interest loans, will support rugby union, horse racing, women's football and the lower tiers of the National League. It added that rugby league, motorsport, tennis, netball, basketball, ice hockey, badminton and greyhound racing were also in line to benefit. In July, the government announced aÂ£1.57bn support packagefor Britain's arts industry. ""It's worth remembering we have provided well over Â£1bn to sports already through things like the job retention scheme and various loan facilities,"" said Dowden. ""This is a very specific thing - sports, and mainly winter sports, were expecting to have fans in stadiums and didn't, we said we'd help them out."" Sports minister Nigel Huddleston added that grants would be available where organisations were unable to repay loans. He also said ""the door was open"" to any sport requiring funding, including cricket which was not on the initial list. The money available is for sports in England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland responsible for their own budgets. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) statement added: ""Preliminary allocations have been made on a needs-based assessment process and reflect the submissions made from the individual sports, and the funding process will be overseen by an independent decision-making board and supported by Sport England."" It said the first tranche of funding will be distributed in the coming weeks. Note: The final amount received by each sport/organisation may differ from the amounts set out when final decisions are made by an independent decision-making board, and supported by Sport England.

""A number of clubs from across the football pyramid have been greatly affected by the pandemic and this financial package will provide vital assistance for them during this challenging period,"" the FA statement said. Chief executive officerBill Sweeneysaid the Rugby Football Union was grateful for the ""much-needed support"" and that the organisation would work with the government to find the ""appropriate balance between loans and grants"" for the different areas of the sport. Boxing did not receive any funding and Olympic gold medallistLuke Campbellsaid the sport has to ""come together to fight this"" and ""get the funding it needs to survive at all levels"". ""We would welcome the opportunity to have a grown-up conversation with someone involved in the decision making of this to see how we can get financial help for boxing and hopefully move the sport up the pecking order,"" he added. BBC Radio 5 Live boxing analyst Steve Bunce said the sport ""expected"" and ""deserved"" Â£2m-4m of funding and missing out means ""thousands of boxers denied, hundreds of gyms left struggling"". Kat Ratnapala,director of netball at Saracens Mavericks, told BBC Radio 5 Live that the funding would help her club compete in next season's Superleague, starting in February. ""It's been a tough year for us, financially, to make ends meet,"" she said. ""We set up a funding page just so we could come through the first Covid lockdown. It's a loan and we need to pay that back eventually. ""We're definitely not out of the woods, but it's a bit of breathing room so that we can get back on to court at least and get a full season under our belts."" Adrian Christy,Badminton England's chief executive, said the funding could help stave off the threat of job losses in the organisation. ""Since the start of the pandemic, Badminton England has lost more than Â£2.2m in income,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""The Â£2m award will help significantly towards closing the gap. ""It ensures the Yonex All-England Championships can take place - it's the biggest event on the world tour and a qualification event for the Olympics. ""The operation of the organisation also needs the support with 25% of our staff at risk of redundancy - we hope we can save some jobs as a direct consequence. And also, we repurposed Sport England's money from the outset for our survival. That money was taken away from the grassroots."" British Horseracing Authority chief executiveNick Rustpraised members of his team for presenting their case to government and officials. ""The support for racing recognises the sport's position as the second biggest spectator sport in the UK and the financial peril faced by the tens of thousands who depend upon racing for their livelihoods,"" he said. ""The BHA team work tirelessly to protect the interests of racing. While advancing the case for financial support, they have also helped to ensure the sport continues behind closed doors, with owners present, and supported the efforts to get spectators back. I am very proud of all they are achieving."" Swimming missed out on the funding and Swim England chief executiveJane Nickersonstressed aquatic sports are also ""fighting for survival"" and need to be supported. ""It's encouraging to see support being provided for those organisations who have lost their major spectator income - now what I would like to see is any further government investment focused on sports that have missed out on this package but have also been severely impacted by coronavirus restrictions,"" she said. ""While we may not be classed as a major spectator sport, swimming is one of the biggest participation sports with 14 million adults swimming in 2019.""

" By Theo Leggett and Tom Burridge By Theo Leggett and Tom Burridge The crash site is empty now condoned off by a row of wooden posts The crash site is empty now condoned off by a row of wooden posts It was still dark when the plane came in to land. Mark and Debbie Pegram, and their younger son Tom, looked out towards the runway from the deserted terminal building. When they saw the tell-tale red writing down the side of the aircraft, and the elongated green, yellow and red triangles on its tail, they were overcome with emotion. It was the only Ethiopian Airlines plane arriving into Manchester that October morning, and on board was the coffin of 25-year-old Sam Pegram. The family knew this was going to be a painful moment. However, it had been seven months since Sam had died. So, amid the intense loss and heartbreak, they also felt relief that it had finally arrived. The humanitarian worker from Penwortham in Lancashire boarded an Ethiopian Airlines plane in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, on 10 March 2019. Six minutes after take-off, the Boeing 737 Max aircraft crashed. No-one survived. It took investigators six months to match DNA samples taken from the family and Sam’s belongings, to remains recovered from the crash site. Sam Pegram Sam Pegram Sam Pegram Sam Pegram Earlier, his family had shown their passports and had been escorted through security at Manchester Airport. Family liaison officers were with them, along with someone from the UK Foreign Office, an inspector from Sussex Police and a representative from the coroner’s office. As they stood overlooking the gate where the plane would park, officials stood back to give them some space. An airline official carried the family’s single yellow rose and another bunch of flowers down to the plane. A union flag was draped over the shipping crate containing the coffin. As ground crew formed a guard of honour, it was moved to a waiting ambulance, and taken to clear customs. It wasn’t until later that morning, at the undertakers, that Debbie, Mark and Tom were finally able to spend time with Sam in a private room. The premature end to Sam’s life and that of 156 others could have been avoided. The Boeing 737 Max aircraft they were travelling on had fatal design flaws – and it was not the first to be involved in such a tragedy. A near-identical 737 Max had crashed off Indonesia five months earlier, in chillingly similar circumstances. But tragically, after that crash, the aircraft was not grounded. And that was why “gentle” Sam, who his family remember as a kind, energetic young man, was able to board the Ethiopian Airways flight that morning. Debbie believes it was Boeing’s “greed” that took him from her. “We want someone from Boeing to look us in the eye and explain why our son isn’t here.” She says she will never again feel her son’s infectious energy nor receive his caring text messages. “It’s all about money. They played Russian roulette with people’s lives.” “Nobody should have been on those planes.” The 737 Max was grounded worldwide for 20 months. Now, regulators in the US have finally given it permission to fly again. They insist it has been made safe. Nevertheless, the families feel distraught that it is being allowed back in the air. The crash site in March 2019 The crash site in March 2019  Since the 737 Max was grounded, its design and construction have been pored over in minute detail by investigators and regulators from several different countries. To fly again, each plane will have to undergo significant modifications, although the changes will not be visible from the outside and passengers will not notice any difference. Before the grounding, the company had already delivered 385 aircraft from the 737 Max family to airlines.  About 450 have been built and are awaiting delivery. The biggest alterations concern the flight control software known as MCAS – or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System. It was originally installed on the Max because of handling problems caused when large modern engines were installed on the existing 737 airframe. It was meant to make the plane more stable, and to make the controls feel more familiar and predictable to pilots used to older versions of the 737. The system was only ever meant to operate when the plane was flying at a high angle of attack, with its nose up and wings at a relatively steep angle relative to the airflow, approaching a stall. It worked by using the horizontal stabiliser – the small wings at the tail of the aircraft either side of the tailfin – to push the nose of the aircraft downwards, countering an aerodynamic quirk that made it want to rise further. But MCAS was deeply flawed. In both accidents, the system became active when it should not have done. It became, for the pilots, a malevolent force – repeatedly pushing the nose of the plane down, when they were desperately trying to gain height. It was simply too powerful and too persistent for them to overrule. This happened because MCAS relied on data from a single external sensor to determine the angle of attack of the plane, even though there were two of them available. When that sensor malfunctioned, it received bad data, and deployed at the wrong time. Meanwhile, pilots were initially unaware the system even existed – US lawmakers later alleged Boeing had deliberately concealed the fact from them – and had not been trained to recognise or deal with failures. Boeing denies deliberately concealing any information from its customers. Now, Boeing has made significant changes to the MCAS software. For a start, it will have to use data from both “angle of attack” sensors. If those sensors give significantly different readings, the system will not activate at all. And a warning light on the flight deck, to alert the crew of a potential sensor failure, will have to be operational. When MCAS does activate, it will only do so once – rather than deploying repeatedly, as it did on the crashed planes. And it will be less powerful. The crew must be able to override it simply by pulling back on their control columns. The regulator in charge of ensuring aviation safety in the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has demanded changes to cockpit procedures, and has mandated new training requirements for pilots. This will include specific training linked to MCAS and “associated failure conditions”, which will involve time in a simulator. There will also be a change unrelated to MCAS, to counter a separate potential hazard found during the FAA’s review of the 737 Max design. Two sets of wiring for controls at the rear of the aircraft, including the horizontal stabiliser, were found to be too close together, in breach of FAA rules. These wires will have to be rerouted, to prevent a possible short-circuit causing the stabiliser to move on its own, potentially causing a crash – although the risks of that happening are understood to be very remote, and Boeing resisted the change. The revised design is the result of a huge engineering effort, which has included some 1,300 test flights. The FAA has estimated the cost of carrying out the changes at more than $1m (£754,000) for each aircraft that needs to be modified. So will all this be enough to make the 737 Max a safe aircraft? Pilots spoken to by the BBC believe it will. They say the design has been changed, crews know how the system works and will be properly trained to deal with failures. They know, too, that the scrutiny of the 737 Max’s design has been unprecedented. Others are more sceptical. Lawyers representing the families of victims of the ET302 crash claim the plane has a fundamental flaw that has not been addressed. They say the position and size of its engines mean it is “inherently aerodynamically unstable” and it remains potentially dangerous. Boeing rejects that suggestion. Its view is supported by Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical analyst at consultants Leeham News. “The aircraft is perfectly flyable without the MCAS software,” he says - pointing out that the system is not actually meant to deploy during normal flight. The FAA itself says that “with MCAS inoperative, the Boeing 737 Max is capable of continued safe flight and landing”. Meanwhile, critics of Boeing and the FAA claim the flawed design of the 737 Max was merely a symptom of a much wider disease. They believe that a corporate culture at Boeing prioritised profit at the expense of safety, and that the regulatory culture failed to keep the aerospace giant in check. Airteam Images Airteam Images The sheer, obscene violence of a plane crash can be hard to imagine.  When Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 hit the ground just minutes after takeoff,  it was travelling at more than 500mph. The massive impact simply obliterated the aircraft, forming a crater some 10m deep. Heavier parts, such as the engines, buried themselves in the dark earth, while lighter pieces were scattered across the surrounding fields. Months later, they were still lying there. Remote as it was, the crash site was rapidly besieged by investigators, government officials and people from surrounding villages. Diggers set to work retrieving wreckage. And soon, the families of the victims gathered at the site to grieve. In the US, politicians launched a far-reaching investigation. The official inquiry, led by the Ethiopian authorities, quickly homed-in on the MCAS software as the probable immediate cause of the disaster. The House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the US Congress had a different brief, however. Led by Democrats Peter DeFazio and Rick Larsen, it decided to investigate the entire process of design, development and certification of the 737 Max itself, to find out why an apparently flawed aircraft had been cleared to fly passengers in the first place. The committee released its final report in September this year, and its conclusion was scathing.  The Max crashes, it said, were not the result of a single failure, technical mistake or mismanaged event. They were instead: “…The horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing’s engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of Boeing’s management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the FAA.” The report painted a picture of Boeing as a business under intense financial pressure - first to get the 737 Max in the air, and then to maximise production at all costs. The desire to meet these goals, it said, had jeopardised the safety of the flying public. The FAA, meanwhile, had become the victim of “regulatory capture” by the very company it was meant to be overseeing. In other words, it was acting in Boeing’s interests rather than protecting the public. “It’s mind-boggling,” said Congressman DeFazio afterwards. “Both the FAA and Boeing came to the conclusion that the certification of the Max, which killed 346 people in two accidents just a few months apart, was ‘compliant’ – that’s the bureaucratic word, it was compliant. “But the problem was, it was compliant, and not safe. And people died.” A memorial for the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash A memorial for the victims of the Ethiopian Airlines crash Among those called to testify was Boeing’s now former chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. Visibly deeply uncomfortable as he faced unremitting harsh questioning while sitting yards away from relatives of those lost aboard ET302, he admitted that Boeing had “made some mistakes” on his watch and “discovered some things we didn’t get right”. He brushed off calls for his resignation – but within a few weeks he had left the company anyway. And although Mr Muilenburg insisted that safety had always been a core value for Boeing, lawmakers later heard allegations that the company had ignored emphatic warnings about problems with the 737 Max programme. Dennis Muilenburg testifies before the Senate committee Dennis Muilenburg testifies before the Senate committee  Boeing’s factory in Renton, some 13 miles (21km) from Seattle, is the beating heart of the US aviation industry. According to the company, some 11,600 planes have rolled out of its gargantuan hangars over the years. This is where each generation of the 737 has been built - including the Max. At its peak, it can build an entire aircraft in just 10 days. But such speed, according to insiders, has its dangers. And in 2018, a senior manager on the production line, Ed Pierson, emailed the head of the 737 programme to warn that the rush to produce new aircraft was causing serious problems. “I know how dangerous even the smallest of defects can be to the safety of an airplane. Frankly right now all my internal warning bells are going off. And for the first time in my life, I’m sorry to say that I’m hesitant about putting my family on a Boeing airplane,” he said. The email was sent on the 9 June 2018 – nearly five months before Lion Air Flight 610 plunged into the Java Sea. In December 2019 Mr Pierson found himself a star witness before the congressional committee. A navy veteran with decades of experience in aviation, he told lawmakers how he had become deeply concerned about the “chaotic” and “dysfunctional” state of the factory – to the point where he had asked for the entire 737 Max production line to be shut down. But his request got nowhere, and he left the company soon afterwards. Boeing factory, Renton, Washington Boeing factory, Renton, Washington Mr Pierson had been working in the Renton factory for three years. By mid 2018, it was producing 47 aircraft every month - and was about to increase that number to 52. But the pressure to build at such a rate was already taking a heavy toll. “We were having horrible supply chain problems,” he now remembers. “We had a huge backlog, thousands of jobs behind schedule.” Tasks which would normally be carried out in a rigidly-planned order on the production line were being done out of sequence. Unfinished aircraft were standing on the tarmac outside the factory, while employees were being asked to work huge amounts of overtime. Many were simply exhausted. “Everything was indicating to me professionally that this was not safe at all, and we needed to stop the line temporarily, fix the problems,” he says. “But there was this tremendous schedule pressure to get these airplanes out the door.” Mr Pierson says he told the head of the 737 programme, Scott Campbell, that he had seen operations in the military shut down over less substantial safety issues. “The military isn’t a profit-making organisation,” Mr Campbell allegedly replied. Mr Pierson retired soon afterwards. But following the Lion Air crash he took his concerns back to Boeing, even writing directly to the chief executive and board – urging them to investigate conditions at Renton. He was subsequently told the company had seen nothing “that would suggest the existence of embedded quality or safety issues”. Boeing later said it had taken Mr Pierson’s concerns seriously, and had devoted significant resources to maintaining production quality. But it insisted that the suggestion of a link between production conditions at Renton and the two accidents was “completely unfounded”. It emphasised that none of the authorities investigating the crashes had found any such link. Mr Pierson got a similar response when he took his concerns to the US National Transportation Safety Board, the US agency which was assisting with the investigation into ET302. Its response was that they fell “outside the scope of the NTSB’s role in the 737 Max investigations”. But Mr Pierson says this misses the point. He still believes that conditions at Renton were highly relevant to the Max investigation, not least because, he claims, they showed a profit-driven corporate mentality at Boeing. And he emphasises that the failure of sensors originally fitted in the factory were a major part of the chain of events leading to the crashes. US lawmakers were shocked at his testimony – and ordered the FAA to investigate conditions at Renton. But while officials did subsequently speak to him, Mr Pierson insists they failed to follow-up on his allegations. Almost a year later, he feels deeply disappointed. “I feel like they’re paid by tax dollars to do their job. But they resisted, they delayed, they blocked,” he says “I’m not happy. I think all of us have been let down.” The FAA says it has inspectors on site at Renton on a daily basis - a situation that predated Mr Pierson’s testimony. And it points out that for much of this year, the 737 Max production line was shut down after Boeing decided to suspend building the plane. But Mr Pierson is not the only former Boeing employee to claim that production and cost pressures may have undermined safety standards at the company – and concerns are not confined to the 737 production line. Boeing’s plant at North Charleston, South Carolina, makes the 787 Dreamliner, a popular long-haul airliner. John Barnett, a former quality control manager at the factory, has previously told the BBC he believes that a rush to get new planes out of the factory causedserious quality problems. He claims, for example, that during his time at the plant, under-pressure workers deliberately removed substandard parts from scrap bins and fitted them to aircraft on the production line in order to save time – in at least one case with the knowledge of a senior manager. He also alleges that procedures meant to track parts through the factory were not followed – allowing a number of defective items to be “lost”. In 2017, following up on his claims, the FAA did identify a number of cases in which non-conforming parts had gone missing. Boeing insists that it has since fully resolved the situation and implemented corrective action. Another former quality control employee at the plant, Cynthia Kitchens, has made similar allegations. In 2011, she complained to regulators about substandard parts being deliberately removed from quarantine bins and fitted to aircraft, in an attempt to keep the production line moving. She also alleges employees were being told to overlook substandard work, and says defective wiring bundles, containing metallic shavings within their coatings, were deliberately installed on planes – creating a risk of dangerous short-circuits. Aircraft with such wiring, she told the BBC, may still be flying today. “It gets scarier every day I think about it,” she says. Boeing has not responded to these specific allegations - but says Ms Kitchens resigned in 2016 “after being informed that she was being placed on a performance improvement plan”.  It points out that she subsequently filed a lawsuit against Boeing “alleging claims of discrimination and retaliation unrelated to any quality issues”.  The lawsuit was dismissed, and Ms Kitchens had to pay Boeing’s costs. Since the tragedies involving Lion Air 610 and ET302, the aviation world has changed beyond recognition. The Covid epidemic has had a catastrophic effect on air travel, forcing carriers to cut most of their flights and keep planes on the ground. The booming market the 737 Max was designed for has disappeared - for the moment at least. It is not expected to recover for the next three or four years – meaning that airlines which once clamoured for new planes are trying to delay their orders. The pressure to produce planes as fast as possible has evaporated. The crisis has been dreadful news for Boeing’s business. In the first nine months of the year, it lost $3.5bn, and it is in the process of cutting 30,000 jobs. But it has been able to focus on returning the Max to service – and the aircraft is likely to continue operating for decades. Boeing headquarters, Chicago, Illinois Boeing headquarters, Chicago, Illinois Boeing headquarters, Chicago, Illinois Boeing headquarters, Chicago, Illinois Boeing insists it is a different company now. It commissioned a major review of its operations after the grounding of the Max, which was carried out by a committee of independent directors. The outcome was a 10-point plan to improve its safety procedures from design through to delivery. Mr Muilenburg’s replacement David Calhoun has promised to hold the company to the highest standards of safety, quality and integrity. The FAA, meanwhile, says it remains “committed to continually advancing aviation safety”. Yet doubts persist. In its final report, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee stated that: “... producing a compliant aircraft that proved unsafe should have been an immediate wake-up call to both Boeing and the FAA that the current regulatory system… is broken. “Unfortunately serious questions remain as to whether Boeing and the FAA have fully and correctly learned the lessons behind the Max failures.” Critics of Mr Calhoun, who has been a director of Boeing for more than a decade, say he is the wrong man to lead a far-reaching cultural change at the company. They claim he is tainted by the failures of the past. And the families of those who died on ET302 insist the plane should not be flying. Their campaign – known as #AxeTheMax –  is continuing. They have already testified before the US Congress and met with regulators in the US and Europe. They are also suing Boeing, whose negligence and mistakes, they say, killed their loved ones. They accept, however, that their efforts to get the 737 Max grounded for good never really had much chance of success. Adrian Toole, who lost his daughter Joanna, claims that the forces lined up against them were “just too powerful”. Joanna Toole Zipporah Kuria, whose father Joseph Waithaka was also killed, agrees. She believes the industry simply could not consider abandoning the design. “The moment this plane is permanently grounded, it’s a form of defeat for them,” she says. Joseph Waithaka and Zipporah Kuria But although they know they cannot prevent the Max from returning to the skies, the relatives hope that their efforts will help prevent future tragedies. In the meantime, says Ms Kuria, “I pray the plane is as safe as they say it is.” Authors: Theo Leggett and Tom Burridge Producer: James Percy Photos: Warren Smith, Reuters, Getty Images, Family handout Graphics: Lilly Huynh, Tom Housden, Gerry Fletcher, Salim Qurashi Editor: Kathryn Westcott ",Negative,1.375977e-12
"The company's adverts feature meerkat puppets Price comparison site ComparetheMarket has been fined Â£17.9m by the competition watchdog for keeping home insurance costs artificially high. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that over a two-year period the firm's contracts stopped insurers advertising more cheaply elsewhere. It meant getting the cheapest possible deal was not as ""simples"" for consumers as the company's adverts suggest. But the firm hit out at the ruling, saying it ""fundamentally"" disagreed. The CMA said clauses in contracts between December 2015 and December 2017 prohibited home insurers from offering lower prices on other comparison websites, and prevented these other platforms from expanding. The competition watchdog found that this was likely to have resulted in higher insurance premiums for consumers. But, in a strongly-worded statement, ComparetheMarket - part of the BGL Group - said it was disappointed with the CMA's decision and did not recognise its analysis of the market. ""We fundamentally disagree with the conclusions the CMA has drawn and will be carefully examining the detailed rationale behind the decision and considering all of our options."" a spokesman said. ComparetheMarket is one of the UK's biggest price comparison websites and well-known for its adverts featuring meerkat puppets and their ""simples"" catchphrase. ""Price comparison websites are excellent for consumers. They promote competition between providers, offer choice for customers, and make it easier for consumers to find the best bargains,"" said Michael Grenfell, executive director of enforcement at the CMA. ""It is therefore unacceptable that ComparetheMarket, which has been the largest price comparison site for home insurance for several years, used clauses in its contracts that restricted home insurers from offering bigger discounts on competing websites - so limiting the bargains potentially available to consumers."" The CMA concluded that: The insurers bound by the contracts were prohibited from offering cheaper deals on other price comparison websites Rival comparison sites could not offer lower prices, for example, by lowering their commission fees to encourage insurers to quote lower prices on their platforms Without the clauses, ComparetheMarket itself would have had to compete harder to get lower prices from the home insurers Mr Grenfell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the contract clauses meant many of the benefits of shopping around were lost for consumers, pointing out that the harm to competition was ""more than theoretical"". ""We show that it had real anti-competitive effects, that there were cases where insurance companies wanted to offer promotions or discounts on other websites, and they were prevented from doing so as a result of the clauses,"" he said.

"Royal Mail has said revenue from parcel deliveries has surpassed letters for the first time, fuelled by a surge in online shopping during the pandemic. The postal group said turnover from parcels now makes up 60% of its total revenue, which rose by nearly 10% in the first half of its financial year. But it was not enough to stop a sharp drop in profits, due to a number of costs including extra staff to sort the increased parcel volume by hand. Pre-tax profit fell 90.2% to Â£17m. During the six months to 27 September, Royal Mail's increased costs included Â£85m related to Covid-19 as well as Â£147m on voluntary redundancies due to a continuing restructuring of the business. While revenue from letters dropped by 20.5%, parcel rose by 33.2%. Black Friday emissions boom predicted Royal Mail seeks record number of Christmas temps Royal Mail said that on its busiest day it processed 2.5 million tracked parcels while its international parcels business, GLS, also saw increased volumes, ""in particular as China emerged from Covid-19 restrictions and economic activity increased early in the period"". However, it added that growth in international volumes ""weakened"" as the first half progressed, ""impacted by reduced global air capacity"" and other increased costs. ""Royal Mail's performance continues to reflect structural changes in the sector, which have only intensified through the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin. ""The fact that for the first time parcels revenue is now larger than letters revenue is a milestone for the business and only goes to underline the importance of Royal Mail's restructuring programme, which was long overdue even when it was introduced."" At present only a third of parcels dealt with by Royal Mail are processed through a parcel sorting machine, with the majority sorted by hand. The increased volume incurred higher costs for Royal Mail such as taking on extra staff, personal protective equipment to guard against the coronavirus as well as social distancing measures. ""Due to the uncertain risks over future infection rates, there are challenges in being able to accurately predict volumes and potential impact on absence rates,"" Royal Mail said. The company is investing in four more parcel sorting machines, however the first one will only start after Christmas and the remainder will be installed in the next financial year. It is currently building a parcels hub in the north west, which is scheduled to become operational in 2022 and it has begun construction of a similar facility in the midlands. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that ""adapting to the e-commerce boom is proving a painful shift for the company"". ""With demand for letters plummeting, there is a risk that the red post box could go the same way as the iconic telephone box, revered for its history and not its usefulness,"" she added. Looking ahead, Royal Mail said it was difficult to give an outlook for its second half, ""given the uncertainty surrounding the development of the pandemic in the remainder of the year and possible recessionary impacts across our business, which could have a significant influence on parcel volumes"". In the meantime, it said it was preparing for the peak Christmas period and is recruiting around 33,000 additional flexible workers to handle the expected demand.

"The song was a duet between The Pogues singer Shane MacGowan and Kirsty MacColl BBC Radio 1 will not play the original version of Fairytale of New York by The Pogues and Kirsty MacColl this Christmas, because its audience may be offended by some of the lyrics. The station said young listeners were particularly sensitive to derogatory terms for gender and sexuality. It will instead play an edited version with different lyrics sung by MacColl. But the 1987 original will still be played on Radio 2, while 6 Music DJs can choose between the two versions. A BBC spokesman said: ""We know the song is considered a Christmas classic and we will continue to play it this year, with our radio stations choosing the version of the song most relevant for their audience."" The duet is one of the most enduring Christmas pop songs, having returned to the UK top 20 every year since 2005.Along with a string of other festive favourites,external, it is now rising the chart again, at 59 in the current midweek chart. The track is regularly voted one of the UK's favourite Christmas songs But Radio 1 has decided younger listeners who are unfamiliar with the track would find some of the words stark and not in line with what they would expect to hear on air. The new edited version changes two lines - one swapped for an alternative version in which MacColl sings ""You're cheap and you're haggard"" in place of a homophobic slur. MacColl sang the newly-added line on Top of the Pops in 1992.She died in a boat accident,externalin Mexico eight years later, at the age of 41. The same wording was used by Ronan Keating and Moya Brennan in their 2000 cover version. WhenEd Sheeran and Anne-Marie performed the song in Radio 1's Live Lounge in 2017,external, she opted to call him a ""cheap lousy blagger"". In Radio 1's newly-edited version, another line, sung by Shane MacGowan in the second verse, has a word removed entirely. Radio 1 has played the song in its original form in recent years, but the insults contained in the lyrics, sung in the form of a blazing row between an alcoholic and a heroin addict, have long been criticised by some. The track was censored by Radio 1 back in 2007, butthat decision was swiftly reversed,externalafter an outcry by its fans. Andy Parfitt, the station's controller at the time, explained the U-turn by saying its audiences were ""smart enough to distinguish between maliciousness and creative freedom"", and there was no ""negative intent behind the use of the words"". Aled Haydn-Jones, who worked as producer of Chris Moyles' breakfast show at the time, was made head of Radio 1 this June. The original song was a number two hit in 1987 In 2018, MacGowan defended the song, explaining: ""The word was used by the character because it fitted with the way she would speak and with her character. She is not supposed to be a nice person, or even a wholesome person. ""She is a woman of a certain generation at a certain time in history, and she is down on her luck and desperate. Her dialogue is as accurate as I could make it, but she is not intended to offend. ""She is just supposed to be an authentic character and not all characters in songs and stories are angels or even decent and respectable. Sometimes characters in songs and stories have to be evil or nasty in order to tell the story effectively."" Should we stop listening to these Christmas songs? BBC Arts - 30 years of Fairytale of New York Radio 2 - Behind the Fairytale Last year, there were hundreds of complaints after Gavin and Stacey characters Nessa and Bryn sang the unedited version in the sitcom's seasonal special. This Christmas, Radio 2 said it had considered the issue carefully and would continue to monitor listeners' views, but had decided to continue to play the original. 6 Music, meanwhile, has said both versions can be played, at the discretion of each individual presenter.

"Louise has found new work on a farm - but her apprenticeship is over Louise James started her apprenticeship with a butchery company in January, but was made redundant just eight months later due to the coronavirus pandemic. The 33-year-old was ""devastated"" by the decision, but her employer's business had completely dried up. Louise is not alone, with the number of apprenticeships ending in redundancy in lockdown two thirds higher than in 2019,  provisional figures show. The BBC obtained the data under the Freedom of Information Act. Between March and July, 1,033 people in England were withdrawn from apprenticeship programmes because they had been made redundant. This compares to 615 for the same period in 2019, according to Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) data. There are roughly 740,000 apprentices training in England in total. The apparent rise in redundancies is more evidence of the challenge facing the apprenticeship system due to the coronavirus outbreak. The ESFA said the total number of apprentices made redundant would be higher than the figures they disclosed. The numbers don't include those who go on to complete their apprenticeship with a new employer, or at a college. Some cases may also not be registered as redundancies, the agency said. More substantial data is expected later in November. Louise said she had wanted to be a butcher since she was ""tiny"". ""I have never been the sort of person to want to sit behind a computer screen all day. I always like doing things with my hands, I am very crafty. I felt worth something."" But her employer provided meat to bars and restaurants - when they closed, business dried up. ""We went from having something in the region of about a thousand orders a day to having 30 and there just wasn't enough work to keep all of the staff on."" Louise was told she was being made redundant, and says she was ""devastated."" The government was already supporting trainees for 12 weeks to find new work and continue their apprenticeship, but Louise didn't have much luck. ""I contacted something in the region of 30 butchers across Coventry and Warwickshire. There were three who seemed quite keen and then once they realised I was over the age of 21 they cooled off."" ""I didn't receive much support from the training company at all. I have not even received confirmation that my apprenticeship has come to an end. I just know that it has due to the length of time it has been."" In August, Louise's redundancy went through, and she's since found work on a council-run farm, supporting adults with learning disabilities. ""It was a huge relief. I cried, I'm not going to lie. It has been a very financially difficult year for myself and my husband. I cried. And we celebrated as well!"" The Chancellor's furlough scheme was opened to apprentices from the start of lockdown In October, 12% of apprentices in Great Britain surveyed by the Sutton Trust had been made redundant, up from 8% in April. A further 8% were on furlough, and 35% had been furloughed but were now back at work. 15% had remained at work but seen their off-the-job learning programmes suspended. For the UK workforce as a whole, July to September saw a record increase and a record number of redundancies, to 314,000, according to official statistics. Gillian Keegan, apprenticeships minister, told the BBC that redundancy ""is always a risk when you have got this sort of disruption in your economy so we were very focused very early on to do as much as we could to support and protect apprentices."" That support includes allowing apprentices to be furloughed, and continue their training while not working, moving to online study if need be. From August to January, employers will get a Â£2,000 grant for each apprentice under 25 they hire, and Â£1,500 for older apprentices. In September, the government introduced a redundancy support service for apprentices. At the same time, trainees who were three quarters of the way through a longer apprenticeship were granted funding to finish - previously, this had been limited to those in their final six months of training. The pandemic has also hit the number of people starting new apprenticeships. Figures from the Department for Education show,externalthat between 23 March and 31 July in England, 58,160 apprentices started their training - down from 107,750 during the same period in 2019. Apprenticeships for the under-19s were particularly affected, down over two-thirds compared to the same period last year. The retail and leisure sectors, hardest hit by the lockdown, show a 72% fall. However, the Department said some of the apparent drop may be exaggerated by employers failing to file paperwork because of the pandemic. The first five months of lockdown also saw a steep fall in the number of opportunities advertised on the government's Find an Apprenticeship website. Tracey Matthews says around 20 of Milton Keynes College's 500 apprentices face redundancy Tracey Matthews, an assistant principal at Milton Keynes College, said the picture was concerning. ""I don't just worry about all those apprentices we have on programme now, I also worry about those young people who wanted to get apprenticeships. We don't have as many vacancies in the system as we have had previously. Ms Matthews said she worried the uncertainty could damage the ""apprenticeship brand"". ""For the last few years in school we have been trying to encourage young people to consider apprenticeships as a viable alternative, and now actually, for those who have, maybe they're feeling their fingers have been burned,"" she said. In a special edition of the Your Work Your Money podcast, Sean and Reggie are joined by YouTuber and former BAME Apprentice of the Year Kimmy Kimani to answer your questions on apprenticeships.Available now on BBC Sounds.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Defence spending a boost for ""safety of the British people"" A ""once-in-a-generation modernisation"" of the armed forces is required to extend British influence and protect the public, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister told MPs a new four-year funding deal would protect ""hundreds of thousands"" of jobs and create 40,000 new roles. ""I have decided that the era of cutting our defence budget must end, and it ends now,"" he said. Labour welcomed more defence spending but asked how it would be funded. Outlining the new package in the Commons, the PM - speaking over video linkas he is self-isolating- said the benefits ""will go far beyond our armed forces"". Mr Johnson described the increase in defence spending as being worth Â£16.5bn in new money over four years. However economist Ben Zaranko, from the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said that while this represented a big rise in spending, the figure of Â£16.5bn was a ""misleading way to present this announcement"". He continued: ""It would be more accurate to say that by 2024-25, defence spending will be Â£7bn higher than it would have been under previous plans."" How will defence spending rise affect armed forces? PM launches review to 'overhaul' foreign policy UK defence secretary denies plan to mothball tanks Mr Johnson said: ""Our plans will safeguard hundreds of thousands of jobs in the defence industry, protecting livelihoods across the UK and keeping the British people safe."" The PM pledged to end defence budget cuts, protect shipping lanes that supply the country, press on with renewing the UK's nuclear deterrent and restore Britain as ""the foremost naval power in Europe"" with a ""renaissance of British shipbuilding across the UK"". He also said the funding would allow investment in new technology such as: A new centre dedicated to artificial intelligence The creation of a national cyber force, which he said was already operating against terrorists, organised crime groups and hostile states A new ""RAF space command launching British satellites and our first rocket from Scotland in 2022"" ""From aerospace to autonomous vehicles, these technologies have a vast array of civilian applications opening up new vistas of economic progress, creating 10,000 jobs every year - 40,000 in total - levelling-up across our country and reinforcing our union,"" Mr Johnson added. This is a big win for Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, who's been fighting hard for a significant increase in defence spending and a long-term financial settlement to end what he calls a cycle of overambitious, under-funded defence reviews of the past. The Treasury had been arguing for a much smaller annual increase. But Mr Wallace found an ally in the PM, who says his first priority is defence of the realm. Boris Johnson also believes it'll boost Britain's place in the world and create jobs. The extra money will be used to modernise the armed forces with more spent on robots, autonomous systems and meeting new threats in the domains of space and cyber. Despite the palpable relief inside the MoD it still has to fill a Â£13bn black hole in its equipment budget. Difficult decisions about cutting old equipment to fund the new are still to be made. The MoD, which doesn't have a strong track record of balancing its books, now has to prove it can spend wisely. And good news for defence might also mean bad news for other government departments -there's already speculation the international aid budget could be cut. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused Mr Johnson of making a ""spending announcement without a strategy"" and asked whether the money would be raised through cuts or tax rises, or both. Mr Johnson did not respond to the question but said Sir Keir's record of support for the armed forces was ""very thin indeed"". Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt urged Mr Johnson ""not to listen to any voices in his ear"" saying that cutting international aid could help to fund the increase in defence spending. And Labour MP Sarah Champion, chairwoman of the international development committee, asked Mr Johnson to ""quash rumours and confirm his manifesto commitment"" of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, ""now and going forwards"". The PM responded by telling the Commons: ""I think we can all be proud of our record on overseas aid and that will continue."" Gen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, said he was ""absolutely delighted"" by the announcement. ""But of course we're also conscious that living through this Covid crisis, the armed forces have stepped up to the plate to provide some of the resilience that the nation has needed,"" he added. Gen Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, said the ""extraordinary announcement"" would be very good for morale Earlier, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said ""letting go"" of some older weapons would create ""headroom"" for new investment. He added: ""When I looked across at the armed forces today I saw them with equipment that was out-of-date, I saw our adversaries across the world having better equipment, the ability to attack us and harm us getting wider and wider from our capabilities."" The funding announcement is part of the first conclusions ofthe government's Integrated Reviewwhich looks at security, defence, development and foreign policy. Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the extra money would give ""a welcome and long-overdue upgrade to Britain's defences after a decade of decline"". Conservative MP and defence select committee chairman Tobias Ellwood said: ""This is a lot of money but ultimately there are still huge financial pressures facing our armed forces."" But he said the ""key takeaway"" for him was the ""message this sends to the British people, to the MoD as well, that we want to be back as a strong power capability"".

"This video can not be played Dr Anthony Fauci asks families to weigh up the risks of their Thanksgiving plans The US has recorded more than 250,000 deaths from Covid-19, a bleak marker as cases soar once again across the country. According to Johns Hopkins University, the country has now reported 250,029 deaths and nearly 11.5 million cases. It has more reported infections and a higher death toll than any other country worldwide. And cases have once again started to soar throughout the US, hitting new daily highs in the last week. Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, top US infectious diseases Dr Anthony Fauci said the country was ""going in the wrong direction at a very precarious time"", with people more likely to gather inside as the weather gets colder. Is this Covid wave in the US the worst yet? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? New York City - the epicentre of the US outbreak in the spring - has ordered the closure of its schools from Thursday, amid a spike in cases. The decision to close the US's largest public school system came as positive test rates for the virus surpassed the 3% threshold, officials say. It will affect some 300,000 children. In an interview on the BBC News channel, Dr Fauci warned about the new surge in cases leading to more deaths. ""It's a very serious situation because there are lagging indicators,"" he said. ""So when you see the massive increase in cases as we're seeing now particularly as more and more people are doing things inside, we're in a very difficult situation."" He repeated his call for people to ""double down"" on public health measures, such as wearing face coverings, physical distancing and avoiding crowds. ""They sound so simple and we know they can work. But there's a degree of Covid fatigue - people just are worn out with these restrictions,"" Dr Fauci said. He urged people to ""hold out for just a little longer because help is on the way"" in the form of vaccines. At the end of March - when the US had recorded 2,200 deaths -Dr Fauci predicted the pandemic could kill up to 200,000 Americansand infect millions more. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading On Wednesdaydata released by Pfizer and BioNTechsaid the vaccine they had developed to tackle the virus appeared to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech published preliminary data suggestingthe vaccine offered 90% protection against Covid-19and said there were no safety concerns. This was followed by data on a vaccine made byUS company Modernasuggesting nearly 95% protection andsimilarly promising results from trials of another developed in Russia called Sputnik. A letter from New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza released on Wednesday informed parents that all schools would close and classrooms would immediately shift to online learning ""until further notice"". ""You will hear from your principal shortly about next steps for you and your student. Please note that this is a temporary closure, and school buildings will reopen as soon as it is safe to do so."" The move comes only eight weeks after the school system reopened to students. It is the latest city to close school and shift to online learning after Boston and Detroit, with Las Vegas and Philadelphia delaying plans to return pupils to classrooms. Some pupils in Brooklyn took classes outside in September Bill de Blasio, the New York mayor, said: ""No one is happy about this decision. We all in fact are feeling very sad about this decision because so much good work has been put into keeping the schools open, opening them up to begin with."" However, he said that officials had ""set a very clear standard"" on safety metrics that needed to be met in order for schools to take pupils, ""and we need to stick to that standard"". ""I want to emphasise to parents, to educators, to staff, to kids that we will intend to come back and come back as quickly as possible,"" he said. The school closure is the latest measure amid attempts to curb a fresh outbreak of cases. Last week further restrictions were put into place - including bars and restaurants moving to takeaway-only after 22:00 and parties at private residences being limited to 10 people. Officials in other states are taking similar measures. On Wednesday Minnesota and Kentucky ordered all restaurants and bars to temporarily stop indoor eating.

The move, which represents a major backslide for the city's coronavirus recovery, has also left parents scrambling for last-minute childcare options. As infections rise throughout the country, the healthcare system is struggling to cope. In the Texan city of El Paso the convention centre was recently converted into a makeshift hospital. Some patients are being airlifted elsewhere in the state due to the overcrowded facilities, and authorities have requested ten refrigerated trailers to use as mobile morgues.

"Hundreds of young environmental activists from around the world are meeting virtually to call for greater action on climate change. With the international climate talks that weredue to be held in Glasgow this year delayed until November 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic,young people have decided to create their own. Unlike the UN summit, COP26, the youth-led Mock COP is not based anywhere physical. Workshops and talks are being hosted virtually across multiple time zones, reducing carbon emissions by 1,500 times that of previous COP events, according to organisers. From Thursday until 1 December, more than 350 young environmental activists from 150 countries will hold discussions and hear from a range of climate experts to produce a final statement of demands. The aim? For countries to consider adopting them into law. A really simple guide to climate change Has the world started to take climate change fight seriously? Covid crisis does little to slow climate change Co-organiser Dom Jaramillo, 21, from Ecuador, says the event was born of frustration at the postponement of climate talks. Dozens of world leaders will attend the summit between 1 and 12 November next year - in the most important round of talks since the global Paris Agreement to tackle climate change in 2015. What is the Paris climate agreement? ""We decided we had to do something because we are in a climate emergency,"" she told BBC News. Dom says they want to raise ambitions around the world ""We want to raise ambitions and show world leaders how a COP should be run. We are not the leaders of the future. We are the leaders of today,"" Dom added. Business Secretary Alok Sharma, who is president of COP26, will speak on the first day of Mock COP. He says the event will further show ""the appetite that exists across the world for governments and organisations to take ambitious climate action"". Josh Tregale, 18, from the UK, decided to defer his place at university to get more involved with environmental work. He says he wants to set an example for how COP could be run in a low-carbon way. Josh wants governments to think about the impact of flying around the world for meetings ""At a normal COP summit, delegates fly in from around the world. They can emit more than 50,000 tonnes of CO2 -  whereas ours will emit around 39 tonnes of CO2,"" he said. ""If each year those carbon savings were made by government meetings that could have a huge impact."" Mock COP organisers say they want to addresscomplaints about a lack of diversity in the climate movementand fears that countries most affected by climate change are not being heard. They have given countries from the Global South more young delegates and speaking time than richer countries. Dom says the Global South - which refers broadly to areas in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania which would previously have been described as developing countries - needs greater representation in climate talks. ""We feel voiceless because we are the most affected,"" she said. Growing up on a banana farm in Ecuador, she says she has seen the impact of climate change firsthand. ""We didn't have enough water, our soil was deteriorating. We are really worried about what is happening. I'm worried about my future,"" she said. Research suggests that Africa ismore vulnerable than any other region to the world's changing weather patterns.Hundreds of millions of people depend on rainfall to grow their food. In Zambia, where young activist David Watson Mwabila lives, temperatures are predicted to rise by 5C or more. David is concerned that these changes could lead to malnutrition. David is worried about how climate change will affect food production in Zambia ""Climate change is going to make it difficult for us to grow food. As a result, it would directly contribute to malnutrition and stunted growth in children,"" he said. ""Keeping global temperature rise below 1.5C is very unlikely because the current political climate is too hostile. We need to work together as a global village taking decisive steps to combating climate change."" For Josh, this is an important moment to raise ambitions for COP26 next year. ""We can show world leaders that young people can do more than just protest, we can come up with ideas and put things in place as well,"" he said. The delegates will work with scientists and environmental law charity ClientEarth to produce a final statement of demands that could be developed into a legal treaty for countries to consider adopting into law. It is thought one of the demands will call for young people to be included in each country's delegation at COP26.

"Twenty-one people were killed in two blasts on 21 November 1974 A man arrested in connection with the 1974 Birmingham pub bombings which killed 21 people is reported to be Michael Patrick Reilly. The blasts at the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on the night of 21 November also injured 220 people. Police said a man, 65, was held at his Belfast home on Wednesday under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and would be questioned in Northern Ireland. Mr Reilly has strongly denied any involvement in the bombings. Inquests into the deaths of those killed in the bombings found they were unlawfully killed West Midlands Police added the address was being searched and the man was to be interviewed under caution at a police station. Fresh inquests last year ruled the victims were unlawfully killed, but did not establish who was responsible. Six men, who became known as the Birmingham Six, were wrongly jailed for the bombings in 1975 following a botched police investigation, but their convictions were quashed by the Court of Appeal in 1991. Saturday marks the 46th anniversary of the bombings and the arrest comes within a month of an announcement from Home Secretary Priti Patel that she would consider the case for a public inquiry into the attacks.

"Prince William alongside his mother and brother, Princess Diana and Prince Harry, in 1995 The Duke of Cambridge says a new investigation into how the BBC secured an interview with his mother in 1995 is ""a step in the right direction"". The BBC has promised to ""get to the truth"" about the events surrounding the Panorama interview with Princess Diana. Diana's brother has alleged the BBC's Martin Bashir used forged bank statements to convince her to do it. Kensington Palace said in a statement that Prince William ""tentatively welcomed the investigation"". The prince, whose mother died in 1997, added: ""The independent investigation is a step in the right direction. ""It should help establish the truth behind the actions that led to the Panorama interview and subsequent decisions taken by those in the BBC at the time."" BBC vows to 'get to truth' about Diana interview 'Dark cloud over BBC journalism' says Lord Grade Diana's brother makes new BBC interview allegations On Wednesday, the BBC announced that Lord Dyson, one of the country's most senior retired judges and a former Supreme Court judge, had been appointed to lead the inquiry. The BBC's director general, Tim Davie, said: ""The BBC is determined to get to the truth about these events and that is why we have commissioned an independent investigation. ""Lord Dyson is an eminent and highly respected figure who will lead a thorough process."" Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, called for an independent inquiry earlier this month, saying ""sheer dishonesty"" was used to secure the interview with the princess. In a letter to Mr Davie,reported by the Daily Mail,,externalthe earl said Bashir had used forged bank statements - which wrongly purported to show that two senior courtiers were being paid by the security services for information on his sister. Earl Spencer wrote: ""If it were not for me seeing these statements, I would not have introduced Bashir to my sister."" In another Daily Mail interview,,externalhe also alleged that the then Panorama reporter made a number of false and defamatory claims about senior royals during a meeting with him, in order to gain his trust and access to his sister. These claims included that Diana's private correspondence was being opened, her car tracked and phones tapped - described by the Mail as ""preposterous lies"". Bashir, 57, currently BBC News religion editor, is recovering from heart surgery and complications from Covid-19 and has been unable to comment on Earl Spencer's allegations. Martin Bashir left the BBC in 2004 but rejoined in 2016 1. What steps did the BBC and, in particular, Martin Bashir take with a view to obtaining the Panorama interview in 1995? This will include looking at the mocked up bank statements, alleged payments to members of the royal household, and other issues raised by Earl Spencer. 2. Were those steps appropriate, particularly in regard to the BBC's editorial standards at the time? 3. To what extent did the actions of the BBC and, in particular, Martin Bashir influence Diana's decision to give an interview? 4. What knowledge did the BBC have in 1995 and 1996 of the relevant evidence, such as the forged bank statements? 5. How effectively did the BBC investigate the circumstances leading to the interview? These terms of reference for the investigation were set by Lord Dyson and agreed by the BBC. The BBC said the investigation would start straight away and it was handing over ""all of its relevant records"". Last week, the broadcaster revealed thata previously missing note from Diana, thought to indicate she was happy with the way her interview by BBC Panorama was obtained, had been found and would be handed over to the investigation. Leading the inquiry will be Lord Dyson, who was Master of the Rolls - the second most senior judge in England and Wales - for four years until he retired in October 2016. His other influential positions have included being a Justice of the UK's Supreme Court - the highest court in the country - and a Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. Dame Melanie Dawes, chief executive of the broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, welcomed the inquiry. She saidin a letter sent to Mr Davie,externalthat Ofcom would follow the inquiry and its conclusions closely. Lord John Dyson as Master of the Rolls before his retirement in 2016 Almost 23 million people tuned in to watch the Panorama programme 25 years ago. In it, the princess famously said ""there were three of us in this marriage"", referring to the Prince of Wales's relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles. At the time, Princess Diana was separated from Prince Charles but not yet divorced. She died on 31 August 1997, aged 36, in a car crash in Paris.

"Royal Mail has said revenue from parcel deliveries has surpassed letters for the first time, fuelled by a surge in online shopping during the pandemic. The postal group said turnover from parcels now makes up 60% of its total revenue, which rose by nearly 10% in the first half of its financial year. But it was not enough to stop a sharp drop in profits, due to a number of costs including extra staff to sort the increased parcel volume by hand. Pre-tax profit fell 90.2% to Â£17m. During the six months to 27 September, Royal Mail's increased costs included Â£85m related to Covid-19 as well as Â£147m on voluntary redundancies due to a continuing restructuring of the business. While revenue from letters dropped by 20.5%, parcel rose by 33.2%. Black Friday emissions boom predicted Royal Mail seeks record number of Christmas temps Royal Mail said that on its busiest day it processed 2.5 million tracked parcels while its international parcels business, GLS, also saw increased volumes, ""in particular as China emerged from Covid-19 restrictions and economic activity increased early in the period"". However, it added that growth in international volumes ""weakened"" as the first half progressed, ""impacted by reduced global air capacity"" and other increased costs. ""Royal Mail's performance continues to reflect structural changes in the sector, which have only intensified through the Covid-19 pandemic,"" said John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin. ""The fact that for the first time parcels revenue is now larger than letters revenue is a milestone for the business and only goes to underline the importance of Royal Mail's restructuring programme, which was long overdue even when it was introduced."" At present only a third of parcels dealt with by Royal Mail are processed through a parcel sorting machine, with the majority sorted by hand. The increased volume incurred higher costs for Royal Mail such as taking on extra staff, personal protective equipment to guard against the coronavirus as well as social distancing measures. ""Due to the uncertain risks over future infection rates, there are challenges in being able to accurately predict volumes and potential impact on absence rates,"" Royal Mail said. The company is investing in four more parcel sorting machines, however the first one will only start after Christmas and the remainder will be installed in the next financial year. It is currently building a parcels hub in the north west, which is scheduled to become operational in 2022 and it has begun construction of a similar facility in the midlands. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that ""adapting to the e-commerce boom is proving a painful shift for the company"". ""With demand for letters plummeting, there is a risk that the red post box could go the same way as the iconic telephone box, revered for its history and not its usefulness,"" she added. Looking ahead, Royal Mail said it was difficult to give an outlook for its second half, ""given the uncertainty surrounding the development of the pandemic in the remainder of the year and possible recessionary impacts across our business, which could have a significant influence on parcel volumes"". In the meantime, it said it was preparing for the peak Christmas period and is recruiting around 33,000 additional flexible workers to handle the expected demand.

"Government-backed projects tackling bullying of LGBT students in England's schools have had their funding pulled, the BBC has learned. The decision came despite an earlier pledge to continue investing in school programmes targeting homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying. Ministers admit that those identifying as LGBT face a higher risk of bullying which can cause long-term harm. But they say the funding was always due to come to an end. The Government Equalities Office had funded several well-received programmes costing at least Â£4m, which specifically targeted LGBT bullying, since 2014. Many had been extended and given further government support. Initially called The Homophobic, Biphobic and Transphobic Challenge Fund, the government programme was not compulsory for schools, but it allowed teachers, staff and students to receive free training and workshops. Providers of workshops, as well as parents, students and teachers, had been expecting the funding to continue. The government acknowledges the serious impact anti-LGBT bullying can have on educational attainment, absence levels, emotional wellbeing and mental health. But the BBC has learned that the government quietly ended its funding of LGBT anti-bullying initiatives last March. Concerned father Richard said his son Tom came out as gay a few years ago. ""At first, he was loud and proud about who he was,"" said Richard. Now in Year 10, he has since been continually bullied by other students, which led to him self-harming and lashing out in class. The pair have asked for their names to be changed as they fear further attacks. ""He started getting negative comments at school, had trouble in corridors, and he got threatening voicemails. He's ended up cutting himself,"" said Richard. ""His school's been hopeless at sorting things out for him. If it was racism, they would've prioritised it, but because it's homophobia, they've had no idea how to deal with it."" It was a ""disaster"" that the government had ended this specific funding, said Richard, who believes Tom's school ""massively"" needs help with LGBT inclusion work. ""They just don't have the money or skills to do it themselves."" The Government Equalities Office said: ""The anti-bullying grant fund, which provided 2,250 schools across the country with materials and training, was always due to end in March 2020."" However, this is the first time that the funding has not been extended since it was originally announced in October 2014 by the then Minister for Women and Equalities, Nicky Morgan. One provider of LGBT inclusion workshops, who wanted to remain anonymous as they feared that speaking out would jeopardise any future possible funding, said schools and programme providers had been expecting a further extension. Her organisation was waiting for another funding announcement at the beginning of November, inviting new applications for grants. She said she felt ""sick"" that schools would not be able to continue their work, and claimed her organisation had been ""ignored"" and ""shut out"" by the government, even though its programmes were well-received. ""What message does this send to young people? This government is rolling back on their initial commitment to LGBT rights,"" she said. Diversity Role Models, a charity which also received funding through the government's LGBT anti-bullying programme, recently carried out what it called a ""pulse check"" onlevels of LGBT education and bullying in 90 schools across England,external. It found that homophobic, biphobic and transphobic language was used in the majority of schools, and some schools were described as unsafe places for LGBT people to be themselves. Metro, an LGBT charity, first received funding in 2016. Dr Greg Ussher, CEO of Metro, told the BBC that ""most schools"" had been unable to continue their LGBT inclusivity work without government backing. ""We were able to work directly with over 200 schools, train over 4,000 staff, as well as engage students in school-wide equalities activities. ""Government funding meant that schools could have this support for free, but they now need to find funds from their already stretched budgets,"" he said. Nancy Kelley, chief executive of Stonewall, said cutting funding would lead to students being left to ""suffer in silence"". ""We know LGBT people are disproportionately affected by poor mental health, and some of this is because of the way they were treated at school. ""It's crucial this government invests money in funding anti-LGBT bullying programmes across England."" Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it was important for every young person to learn about the negative stereotypes and ideas which still lead to many LGBT+ people feeling marginalised. ""If the government is dropping this funding, they need to explain what alternative plans they have to give schools support with challenging LGBT+ bullying.""

Our coverage has been edited by Sarah Fowler and Emma Owen and written by Hazel Shearing, Georgina Rannard, Holly Honderich and Doug Faulkner. Thanks for joining us - there'll be more from the team tomorrow. We're nearing the end of our live page coverage - on a day that the US hit a grim milestone of 250,000 Covid deaths, and the nation of Samoa recorded its first ever case. Here's a summary of the day's stories from around the world: A punk musician who posted criticism of Indonesia's handling of Covid-19 has been sentenced to 14 months in prison for causing public unrest. Gede Ari Astina or Jerinx, the drummer for the Balinese rock band, Superman is Dead, commented on Instagram in June about the pandemic. Criticising an order that pregnant women should be tested for coronavirus, he said that Indonesia's doctors association was acting as a lackey of the World Health Organisation. The court ruled he was guilty of spreading of hate speech. Jerinx is considering an appeal. A woman whose elderly father died in a care home in April has won the first stage of a legal challenge over measures taken by the government to protect those living in care homes from Covid-19. Dr Cathy Gardner claims there was a failure to implement ""adequate"" measures to protect residents from the ""ravages"" of coronavirus. She is pursuing a High Court claim against the government and two health bodies over decisions and measures taken in relation to care homes during the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Gardner argues certain key policies and decisions led to a ""shocking death toll"" of care home residents - which she puts at more than 20,000 people between March and June - particularly an alleged policy of discharging patients from hospital into care homes without testing and suitable isolation arrangements. She is bringing her case along with Fay Harris, and the pair allege the measures breached human rights and equality laws. At a remote hearing on Thursday, Mr Justice Linden granted Dr Gardner permission for a full hearing of her challenge. The government and health bodies oppose Dr Gardner's challenge and asked the judge to dismiss the case. Her father, Michael Gibson, died in an Oxfordshire care home on 3 April after it re-admitted, without Covid-testing, a former resident who had been in hospital. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney is facing criticism after being photographed drinking inside a city bar the day before issuing a city-wide ban on indoor dining. The mayor's office confirmed to US media that the photograph was taken some time last weekend. On Monday, Kenney issued a series of new Covid-19 restrictions, amid rising cases. Some have accused the mayor of hypocrisy for participating in an activity he later linked to coronavirus spread. In addition to an indoor dining ban, movie theatres, bowling alleys, museums and gyms have been ordered to close, and high schools and colleges must move to online instruction. As of Wednesday, Philadelphia had reported 57,201 cases of Covid-19, and 1,942 deaths. Statewide, Pennsylvania has seen a surge in cases starting in October, reaching more than 5,000 new cases each day this month.  Leeds Rhinos and Catalans Dragons played at an empty Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington in November The government has announceda rescue package of Â£300m of emergency fundingfor sports in England impacted by the absence of spectators because of coronavirus. Both rugby codes and horse racing are among the beneficiaries, but not clubs in football's Premier League nor the English Football League. Cricket was not on the initial list. Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""Clubs are the beating hearts of their communities - this boost will help them survive this difficult winter period."" The government said the Sports Winter Survival Package will be largely composed of low-interest loans. The sports which will benefit are: rugby union Â£135m, horseracing Â£40m, football Â£28m, rugby league Â£12m, motorsport Â£6m, tennis Â£5m. netball Â£4m, basketball Â£4m, ice hockey Â£4m, badminton Â£2m and greyhound racing Â£1m. Sports minister Nigel Huddleston added that grants would be available where organisations were unable to repay loans. He also said ""the door was open"" to any sport requiring funding, including cricket which was not on the initial list. The money available is for sports in England, with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland responsible for their own budgets. Travellers to England, Wales and Northern Ireland from Israel, Sri Lanka and Namibia will not have to quarantine for 14 days after they were among several countries added to the air corridor list. Other places added to the list are Rwanda, Uruguay, Bonaire, St Eustatius & Saba, the Northern Mariana Islands and the US Virgin Islands. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted: ""If you arrive from these countries after 4am on Saturday 21 November you will not need to self-isolate. Please remember that under the current restrictions travel outside of the home, with the exception of a limited number of reasons including work or education, is not permitted."" Remember, Scotland makes its own decisions on travel, and we will bring you any updates here. New York City's entire public school system closed its doors on Thursday, a shutdown automatically triggered by the city reaching a 3% test positivity rate - meaning that for every 1,000 New Yorkers tested, 30 were positive for Covid-19. The city's students had been back to school for in-person learning for less than eight weeks. With 1.1 million students and 1,800 schools, New York boasts the largest public school system in the US. ""Today is a tough day, but this is a temporary situation,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Wednesday, announcing the closure. New York - once the national epicentre of the coronavirus crisis - began its phased reopening this summer, after a brutal battle with the virus in spring. Now, with cases rising once again, the city appears headed back towards tightened restrictions. Both de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo have indicated that places like restaurants and gyms may soon face closure. The New York City closures comes as the United Nations Childrenâs Fund (UNICEF)warns of ""dire and growingâ consequences for children,external, as the pandemic continues on into another year.  A further 501 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK,the Department of Health has confirmed,external. It takes the total number of people who have died by that measure since the pandemic began to 53,775. There have also been a further 22,915 people who have tested positive for the virus. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Many Scots feel that the Scottish government hashandled the pandemic betterthan the UK government. But the hard data on the pandemic reveals many similarities between the two nationsâ experience. The death rates in England in the first wave were higher than those in Scotland. Both both saw higher death rates than Wales or Northern Ireland. And both nations featured in the three worst-hit in Europe, with Glasgow and Edinburgh joining Birmingham, London and Manchester inthe ten worst hit cities. Differences are starting to emerge between the two nations in the handling of the second wave. Nicola Sturgeon introduced severe restrictions in the central belt in mid-October and cases in Scotland have started to flatten, perhaps even decline, while those in England still rise. But it will be some time before these differences filter through into the numbers of people who die because of the pandemic. And it will be even longer before death rates start to come down and we can make definitive comparisons between nations. A number of workers in Sweden's mink industry have tested positive for coronavirus, days after Denmark identified a strain of the virus on farms. The Swedish health ministry said it is investigating any possible links between the strains identified in the animals and the workers. Earlier on Thursday the Danish health ministry claimed that coronavirus strain found in its mink was ""very likely"" extinct. All farmed mink in the country have now been killed. In Ireland a mass culling is also being planned, a government spokesperson said on Thursday. Testing of the animals has not so far revealed any positive Covid-19 cases. There are worries about a potential new strain of coronavirus undermining vaccines in the works. Cineworld is looking to arrangea rescue deal that could mean UK cinema closures, the BBC understands. One option being discussed with bank lenders is a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process which could help  the company cut its rent bill. Like other cinema chains, Cineworld has been hit hard by the lockdown, it reported a $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) loss for the six months to June after being forced to temporarily close some of its cinemas and after film studios delayed the release of some blockbusters. According to the Financial Times,which first reported the news,,externalCineworld has appointed restructuring experts AlixPartners. Although cinemas reopened when restrictions were relaxed, delays in big budget releases - such as the new James Bond movie - led Cineworld to temporarily close its UK cinemas on 9 October until further notice. Cineworld declined to comment but a source has stressed a CVA is only one option being discussed. More than 4,700 jobs are at risk afterclothing chains Peacocks and Jaeger were placed into administration, after bosses failed to find a buyer for the business. The two companies were placed into administration on Thursday after a two-week deadline to find a buyer passed. Earlier this month, a spokesperson for owner EWM Group, which also owns the Edinburgh Woollen Mill brand, said they had been speaking to several potential buyers who were interested in parts of the business. But they said talks had been made more complex by ""the continuing deterioration of the retail sector due to the impact of the pandemic and second lockdown"". Jaeger runs 76 stores and concessions and has 347 employees while Cardiff-based Peacocks has 4,369 staff across 423 stores. No redundancies have been announced and no stores have closed. Tony Wright, joint administrator of the business from FRP Advisory, said: ""Jaeger and Peacocks are attractive brands that have suffered the well-known challenges that many retailers face at present."" He said administrators were in ""advanced discussions"" with a number of parties. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst For many of us, online shopping
has become a lifeline in lockdown life. And in China, that has very much
been the reality for a lot of people. When the country saw an outbreak of
Covid-19 at the beginning of the year, cities began implementing strict
lockdowns and social distancing measures. Many couriers began leaving
parcels outside people's apartment buildings to avoid social contact, but
between March and April, surveillance footage picked up one opportunistic woman
in the capital city of Beijing, stealing multiple parcels from outside the
entrance of one building. She was subsequently arrested. Ms Lang has now been sentenced to
nine months imprisonment and fined 7,000 yuan ($1,063; Â£803) for stealing 10
parcels, the majority of which contained food. While the sentence might appear
strict, many on Chinaâs Sina Weibo social network site believe the punishment was
adequate, given that she stole essential items. China has prosecuted more than 6,000 people forCovid-19 related crimes,externalsince the beginning of the year. People have been arrested for hiking the price of masks and hand sanitiser, making fake PPE, and breaking social distancing rules. Last month in Sichuan, a man was even arrested after he tried to avoid paying for a karaoke room by calling for an ambulance, and saying he had Covid-19 symptoms. Boris Johnson used video link for this week's Prime Minister's Questions Plans to allow MPs who are shielding to take part in House of Commons debates via video link have been criticised for not going far enough. The influential cross party Procedure Committee is calling on the government to allow all MPs to take part in debates virtually during the coronavirus pandemic. At the moment, MPs can ask questions and respond to statements virtually but they are not allowed to speak during debates on legislation, or anything else, unless they are physically present in the Commons chamber. On Monday the Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said the government planned to allow only MPs who are clinically vulnerable to take part in debates until the end of March. During a short debate, the Conservative chair of the Procedure Committee Karen Bradley said his ""refusal  to listen"" to the ""views of the House"" was ""indefensible"". She said the public would be ""baffled by a situation where the prime minister can answer Prime Minister's Questions virtually yesterday and and make a statement to the House virtually today, but cannot then take part in a debate until he has finished self isolating"". ""This is an utterly farcical situation,"" she said. The pandemic has up-ended all manner of celebrations and turned our holidays into muted affairs, but in the US, one festive tradition will go on. The White House has said the annual presidential pardoning of a turkey before Thanksgiving will happen this year. The ritual spares a turkey from being served on a Thanksgiving dinner table, and the birds usually spend the rest of their days on a farm or even Disneyland in Florida. It falls to voters to choose to pardon one of two turkeys, although both birds tend to be spared in the end. White House officials say social distancing will be practised at the event next week and people will be asked to wear face masks. The chosen birds were raised in Iowa and next week will board a train to Washington DC where they will stay in a hotel before making their way to the White House. Allow Twitter content?

Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics After dementia/Alzheimerâs disease and heart disease, Covid-19 caused the third most deaths in England and Wales in October, according to figures published today by the Office for National Statistics. In September, Covid-19 was the 19th-leading cause of death in England and 24th in Wales. But a sharp rise, from 600 to 3,200 deaths in a month, now mean that it caused more deaths in October than illnesses like strokes, lung or colon cancers and pneumonia. The total number of deaths in England and Wales is slightly higher than would be expected for an average October, driven largely by the Covid-19 deaths. Most of those other causes for death, including ischaemic heart disease, are actually running slightly below the average levels seen in the last five years. Failure to wear a mask can now cost residents in the Indian capital of Delhi even more as authorities nearly quadrupled the fines. Coronavirus infections are rising rapidly in the densely-populated city and authorities are keen to get a handle on the crisis. Officials can now fine anyone not wearing a face covering $27, up from $7, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Keriwai announced. The sheer number of dead bodies of coronavirus victims is overwhelming ambulance drivers who must transport them to crematoria across the city. The number of infections in the city and its outlying areas has crossed half a million. More than 8,000 people have died. A Scottish mother with cancer will be allowed to go on a ""final holiday"" with her children despite Scotland's travel ban, Nicola Sturgeon has said. Linzi Page, 38, who has stage-four cancer, will be exempt from rules preventing people traveling between Level 3 and Level 4 regions. At First Minister's Questions Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard asked about Ms Page's plan to fly to Tenerife from Edinburgh. Ms Sturgeon said she had spoken to Ms Page on Thursday morning. ""She told me that the family have had a tough year and that this holiday would be 'a nice memory for us',"" the first minister said. ""She said it is a precious time with the family which we will never get back."" Ms Sturgeon said she had told Ms Page travel for ""compassionate reasons which relate to the end of a person's life"" is exempt and the family is allowed to go on holiday. ""Under the regulations, anyone in a situation like hers can go on a final holiday,"" she said, adding: ""Linzi's situation is tragic but on both compassionate and indeed on legal grounds, she can go on her holiday and I wish her and her family well."" EU Chief negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted that the discussions will be paused for a ""short period"" but that teams will ""continue their work in full respect of guidelines"". Britain's negotiator David Frost tweeted that he is in close contact with Barnier. ""The health of our teams comes first,"" he added. There had been speculation that an EU-UK trade deal could be announced early next week.Barnier was expected to brief the EU's 27 member states on Friday morningabout the state of play. A deal would need to be in place by 1 January when Britain's transition period ends.  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Content moderators say they have Facebook's ""most brutal job"" More than 200 Facebook workers from around the world have accused the firm of forcing its content moderators back to the office despite the risks of contracting coronavirus. The claims came inan open letter,externalthat said the firm was ""needlessly risking"" lives to maintain profits. They called on Facebook to make changes to allow more remote work and offer other benefits, such as hazard pay. Facebook said ""a majority"" of content reviewers are working from home. ""While we believe in having an open internal dialogue, these discussions need to be honest,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""The majority of these 15,000 global content reviewers have been working from home and will continue to do so for the duration of the pandemic."" What does my boss have to do to keep me safe? The people policing the internet's most horrific content Facebook to pay $52m to moderators over PTSD In August, Facebook said staff could work from home until the summer of 2021. But the social media giant relies on thousands of contractors, who officially work for other companies such as Accenture and CPL, to spot materials on the site that violate its policies, such as spam, child abuse and disinformation. The letter comes a day after Mr Zuckerberg was grilled by Washington lawmakers over its handling of problematic posts In the open letter, the workers said the call to return to the office had come after Facebook's efforts to rely more on artificial intelligence to spot problematic posts had come up short. ""After months of allowing content moderators to work from home, faced with intense pressure to keep Facebook free of hate and disinformation, you have forced us back to the office,"" they said. ""Facebook needs us. It is time that you acknowledged this and valued our work. To sacrifice our health and safety for profit is immoral."" This letter gives a fascinating behind the scenes glimpse into what is happening at Facebook - and all is not well. Mark Zuckerberg's dream is that AI moderation will one day solve some of the platform's problems. The idea is that machine learning and sophisticated software will automatically pick up and block things like hate speech or child abuse. Facebook claims that nearly 95% of offending posts are picked up before they are flagged. Yet it's still easy to find grim stuff on Facebook. On Monday I published a piece showing the kinds of racist and misogynistic content aimed at Kamala Harris on the platform. Facebook removed some of the content, however even though I flagged it to Facebook, some of it is still there - a week after I reported it. What this letter suggests is that AI is simply not working as Facebook execs would hope. Of course, these are voices of moderators - Facebook will have a different take. You could also argue that human voices may have a vested interest to say AI doesn't work. But clearly, as the spotlight is well and truly on Facebook, there are internal problems that have now spilled out into the open. Facebook said the reviewers have access to health care and that it had ""exceeded health guidance on keeping facilities safe for any in-office work"". But the workers said only those with a doctor's note are currently excused from working in an office and called on Facebook to offer hazard pay and make its contractors full-time staff. ""Before the pandemic, content moderation was easily Facebook's most brutal job. We waded through violence and child abuse for hours on end. Moderators working on child abuse content had targets increased during the pandemic, with no additional support,"" they said. ""Now, on top of work that is psychologically toxic, holding onto the job means walking into a hot zone."" The letter is addressed to Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, as well as the chiefs of Accenture and CPL. It was organised by UK law firm Foxglove, which works on tech policy issues. More than 170 of the signatories were anonymous. Facebook is not the only company to face staff worries about in-person work amid the pandemic. Amazon has also come under fire for conditions in its warehouses, while outbreaks at firms from manufacturers to finance companies have stirred fears. It comes just a day after Washington lawmakers grilled Mr Zuckerberg on the firm's content review policies. What are the new working from home rules?

"Stormont ministers are continuing to meet in a bid to reach agreement on further Covid-19 restrictions. Health Minister Robin Swann had warned more interventions were necessary before the end of this month. Otherwise, he said a full lockdown in mid-December would not be enough to stop hospital services being overwhelmed. The executive has been considering advice from health officials throughout the afternoon. It is thought discussions will continue into Thursday evening, with ministers taking a brief adjournment until 18:00 GMT. It is believed that is to allow health officials to take some of the minister's advice and put it into formal recommendations. Several Stormont sources said it appeared all the parties were ""in the right space"" to support Mr Swann's proposals, reported BBC News NI's Jayne McCormack. The DUP, which previously opposed the extension of some restrictions, has indicated it may support recommendations this time - given the advice being presented by health officials. Close-contact services, cafes and coffee shops are set to reopen this Friday but restrictions on pubs, restaurants and hotels will expire at midnight next Thursday. It is understood the minister has also asked the executive to consider the possible introduction of local, legally enforceable travel restrictions. Until now, the executive has only advised against ""unnecessary travel"". Meanwhile, the Department of Health has said Northern Ireland will initially be in line for up to 4.35 million doses of vaccines when they are eventually made available. Two of the leading vaccines - Pfizer and AstraZeneca - have completed their final trials and are seeking authorisation. The Department of Health confirmed to the Press Association that NI would receive 1.5 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and 2.85 million doses of AstraZeneca. It said this will be in line with allocations made through the Barnett Formula. It is possible they could be available for use in the UK by the end of December. On Thursday, the Department of Health confirmed 12 coronavirus-related deaths in the previous 24 hours, bringing the department's death toll to 901. There were 487 new cases of the virus recorded. There are also 456 people being treated in hospitals in Northern Ireland for Covid-19, with 41 in ICU and 32 on ventilators. In the Republic of Ireland four further coronavirus-related deaths and 429 new cases were recorded on Wednesday. The Irish Department for Health said there were 290 patients being treated in hospital, and there were 33 people in ICU. There have been 15 additional hospitalisations in the past 24 hours. Thursday's full meeting at Stormont is the first sincelast week's row over extending some regulations. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party was focused on finding consensus and said Arlene Foster had ""spent a lot of time this week talking to her fellow ministers, trying to get people back together"".. ""If the infection rate is rising and the current restrictions are not working, we need to learn the lessons of that,"" he told BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster. The marked change in tone from the DUP is certainly significant. Just seven days ago, the party was the loudest advocate against more restrictions on hospitality, and Arlene Foster had insisted the regulations would fall away on 27 November. The party's attitude to lockdown measures has changed, which senior figures put down to the rising rates of infection - something health officials had already warned of last week. However it's thought the DUP wants more measures introduced as lockdown on its own does not appear to be doing enough. The atmosphere around the executive table appears very different today, so far - with the potential that consensus could be reached by the five parties. But we have been here before, and it could still take time before any final decision is reached. If the executive does now reach agreement, some may wonder what the difficult events of last week were all about. On Wednesday, Mr Swann said he would bringa range of options to ministers including restrictions and initiatives. He said the measures were aimed at restricting the spread of Covid-19 ahead of Christmas. NI's Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young has said the R-rate - the rate of transmission of the virus - in Northern Ireland is currently sitting at ""around one"", and has risen since schools reopened two weeks ago. Sir Jeffrey said his party would ""work with the health minister and other ministers in the executive to arrive at a consensus"". ""I certainly hope we're not in a position where anyone has to use a veto in this situation and we're working closely with the health minister and with other ministers to arrive at a set of proposals that people can agree to on all sides,"" he added. Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said not being able to open on 27 November would be ""devastating"" for businesses. ""If we are not open, the current funding does not save the businesses, and furlough is not free,"" he said. Swann to bring new Covid proposals to NI Executive NI Executive aiming to 'protect' Christmas period Covid-19 row lays bare Stormont's rocky foundations But Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) in NI, said easing restrictions now would see ""us paying the price further down the road"". This video can not be played Health Minister Robin Swann speaking at Wednesday's Covid-19 briefing Meanwhile, Mr Swann has written to the UK government asking for four million fast-turnaround Covid-19 tests. The Department of Health confirmed Mr Swann's request for the fast tests, which would allow Northern Ireland's entire population to be tested. However, it is thought they would, if approved, more likely be used in a targeted way, by focusing on health workers or specific communities.

"Mixing between households at Christmas could pose ""substantial risks"", particularly for older people more vulnerable to coronavirus, a scientist advising the government has warned. Prof Andrew Hayward said there would be a ""cost"" to families getting together. It comes as No 10 said proposals to ease restrictions over Christmas will be set out next week. Scientists have suggested that for every day measures are eased, five days of tighter rules would be needed. Prof Hayward, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London, said mixing at Christmas does pose ""substantial risks"" particularly where generations ""with high incidence of infection"" socialise with older people ""who currently have much lower levels of infection and are at most risk of dying"" if they catch Covid-19. Prof Hayward - a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""My personal view is we're putting far too much emphasis on having a near-normal Christmas. ""We know respiratory infections peak in January so throwing fuel on the fire over Christmas can only contribute to this."" Sage is a committee attended by scientists across a range of fields. While its members may not individually agree, their role is to look at the evidence, and present a view to the government.

The UK's four nations - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - are trying to work out a common approach to Christmas so families spread across the UK can still meet up. Scotland's First MinisterNicola Sturgeon said a meeting between the four nations on Wednesday had ""discussed the Christmas periodand how we could come to a sensible... and safe plan that would allow people, not 100% normality, but a greater degree of normality - in particular the ability to spend some time with loved ones"". Meanwhile,it is understood that Northern Ireland is set to face a two-week period of tougher restrictions from 27 November- with non-essential retail, pubs, restaurants and hotels all closed. There will be a partial reopening of some sectors for a week from Friday. Downing Street said plans for what will follow England's lockdown - which is expected to end on 2 December - and proposals to ease restrictions over Christmas would be set out next week. A No 10 spokesman said on Thursday that ministers would keep case numbers ""under review"" into next week, when it will ""set out more details of the next phase"" after lockdown ends. The spokesman pointed to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's previous comment that ""whilst Christmas will be a little bit different from normal this year, we continue to hope to ensure that families can spend Christmas together"". Any rule change would be for a limited time, maybe just a few days, BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle has said. But, he said, the advice was likely to urge families not to hold big gatherings and to travel by car, rather than public transport. This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas England is expected to return to thetier systemof localised restrictions, with household mixing banned indoors in the top two tiers, when its lockdown ends. Public Health England's Dr Susan Hopkinssaid on Wednesday that tough restrictions might be needed before and after Christmasto allow mixing to take place during the holiday. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he did not want to be ""the Grinch that stole Christmas"" but No 10 wanted to safeguard the NHS and protect lives. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: ""I would love all of us to be able to have a Christmas, but more than anything I want us to get through this Covid and try and get this country back to normal and I want to protect lives."" Dr Gabriel Scally, president of epidemiology at the Royal Society of Medicine, told the same programme: ""There is no point having a very merry Christmas and then burying friends and family in January or February... It's too dangerous a time and opportunity for the virus to spread."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said she was concerned some NHS hospitals in Covid hotspots were seeing ""crowded"" emergency departments, as well as the beginnings of ""corridor care"" and ""problems unloading ambulances"". She said: ""That's the reality of what we've got in hospitals at the moment. Let's not have that happening and then we can talk about Christmas. But we're not in that situation at the moment."" Dr Henderson warned that we would ""regret"" a [festive] season that's given Granny Covid for Christmas"" rather than working through a ""rational, controlled, plan to come out the other side of this when we've got a vaccine into spring and we can actually start having a much more normal society"".

VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Prof Hayward also told the Today programme government messaging had not been consistent. He said: ""When policy is undulating between stay at home to save lives, eat out to help out, the tier system, the second lockdown and now proposals for an amnesty on social distancing - it is a highly inconsistent message."" Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence based medicine at the University of Oxford told the BBC said some ""coherent thinking"" from health officials was now required and they would need to ""take the public with them"" in the run up to Christmas. He said there had been some ""impressive falls"" in Covid cases in some areas and ""if we can see that carrying on we would be in a much better position to see what to do at Christmas"". It comes as scientists who advised the government during the early stages of the pandemic tolda BBC documentary focused on the first lockdownthat they ""never checked"" how Covid-19 could be spread by staff working at more than one care home.

"The UK will be less safe if it fails to strike a post-Brexit security deal with the EU, Britain's top counter-terrorism officer has said. Neil Basu toldthe BBC's Newscast podcasta deal was ""incredibly important for the safety and security of our country"". He said he was hopeful of a better security and law enforcement agreement than the UK currently has. The government said the safety and security of citizens was a priority. Talks between the UK and EU are ongoing ahead of the 31 December deadline for a deal. The UK left the EU on 31 January, but continues to follow current EU rules until the end of the year while negotiations take place. Any deal would need to be ratified by parliaments on both sides. Crime agency warning over post-Brexit security What's happening with Brexit? Talk of Brexit deal breakthrough: Handle with care PM confident UK 'will prosper' without EU deal On security, the UK had wanted to maintain the same access to shared databases that it has now, but the EU says that is not on offer to non-members. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mr Basu told BBC Newscast: ""We need to negotiate a security treaty that either retains or improves on the current position that we've got today. ""It's incredibly important for the safety and security of our country. And I know the government gets that. And I know that that is what it's aiming for."" When asked what a no-deal Brexit would mean for UK security, he said: ""The country would be less safe in a non-negotiated outcome where a security treaty wasn't forthcoming. That's the bottom line."" Mr Basu said he was keen to know the outcome of negotiations as soon as possible. ""We've made it very clear that we need as much time to negotiate those agreements with our European counterparts as possible, and we can't do that until the negotiations are finished,"" he said. ""We've been very clear to government right from the start of this process, and I'm confident they have listened to our concerns."" A spokesman for the government said: ""The safety and security of our citizens is our top priority, and the UK will continue to be a global leader on security and one of the safest countries in the world. ""We are focused on reaching an agreement with the EU and there is a good degree of convergence in what the UK and EU are seeking to negotiate in terms of operational capabilities."" If it was impossible to reach an agreement, they said, ""we have well-developed and well-rehearsed plans in place"".

The appeal hopes to raise Â£1m for UK museums and galleries facing financial problems due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Sir Anish is offering limited edition prints of his 2019 work Omo The Art Fund charity has already distributed Â£2.25m in ""Respond and Reimagine"" grants to help institutions cope. Last month it decided to split its Â£200,000 Museum of the Year prize five ways,rather than give it to a single recipient. According to the Art Fund's own research, six out of every 10 museums are worried about their survival. More than 60% of workers in the sector fear for their jobs, while only a third of closed museums expect to reopen in the coming months. Nine out of 10 institutions say that they will need to adapt and innovate in order to survive the virus and its aftermath. More than 200 museums, galleries and historic houses took part in the survey, conducted this month by market research agency Opinium. Hill said he often visits museums when he is performing around the country Harry Hill may seem an unlikely advocate for visiting museums. Yet the comedian says such institutions provide a much-needed ""mental workout"". ""If I'm ever stuck for an idea, or just not in a particularly sunny mood, I'll go to an art gallery or a museum, because museums are full of ideas,"" he told the PA news agency. ""Museums, on the whole, don't close,"" he said. ""But we're in this bizarre situation where perhaps half of them are faced with closure if they don't get some sort of bailout. ""When this pandemic is over, the last thing we want is for none of these places to be open. We're not going to go abroad and we'll want something to do."" Over the last six months the Art Fund received funding applications from more than 450 organisations amounting to more than Â£16.9m. The Postal Museum in London, the Roald Dahl Museum in Buckinghamshire and Glasgow's Gallery of Modern Art are among the institutions to benefit from its latest round of grants. Art lovers can claim a print of Michael Landy's Look Around for a Â£100 donation Art Fund director Jenny Waldman said the ""innovative"" ideas put forward by museums had been ""hugely inspiring"" and that it had been ""heartbreaking"" not to be able to support them all. ""We are urging everyone who loves and uses museums to come together now to help so many more museums thrive,"" she continued. Museums and galleries also have the option of applying for money from the Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund that the government unveiled in July.

"Plans for the UK government's shared prosperity fund are yet to be announced Local councils will have a ""stronger role"" in the new fund to replace EU aid, the Welsh secretary has said. Simon Hart said councils were ""elected and accountable bodies that operate closest to the communities they serve"". Details of the fund are expected to be announced by UK ministers after the chancellor's spending review next week. Welsh minister Jeremy Miles said there ""appears to be a difference of opinion about the role the Welsh Government should play"" in the new system. Ministers in Cardiff insist they should control the fund, not UK ministers, but are also promising to give local authorities a bigger say. Wales and Westminster have been arguing over who should ultimately control the purse strings of the Wales portion of the new shared prosperity fund (SPF). EU funds in Wales have been administered by the Welsh European Funding Office, part of the Welsh Government. Welsh ministers want control of EU aid replacement New Welsh spending powers set to go to UK Johnson wants say in spending post-Brexit aid cash Labour ministers in Wales havepublished their own proposals,externalfor how the new fund should be spent. They said the UK government should set a ""policy agenda"", similar to the way the EU does. But they argue it should then allocate funding ""in full"" to Cardiff, giving the Welsh Government ""full autonomy over its SPF share on a multi-annual basis"". However, it seems both the UK and Welsh governments are agreed that local authorities should be much more involved in the process. Welsh ministers say they ""envisage a central role for local authorities"". Simon Hart said he saw a ""stronger role"" for local councils Writing in the Telegraph,external, Mr Hart said he saw ""a stronger role for local councils, elected and accountable bodies that operate closest to the communities they serve"". ""Of course - this is how the funding should have been operating all along, but the opposite has been the case,"" he writes. Mr Hart said leaving the EU ""gives us a once in a generation opportunity to click the restart button on how billions of pounds are spent across Wales"". ""In the past week I've been meeting local authorities across Wales. ""They're all hungry to play a greater role in smarter investment of this funding - distributing it to those best able to target the money to projects that will benefit their communities most. ""I remain hopeful that the Welsh Government will take a collaborative approach, putting principles ahead of politics."" Legislation going through the UK Parliament would give Whitehall new powers tospend in devolved areassuch as economic development. Running for the Tory leadership in 2019, Boris Johnson said he wanted to see a ""strong Conservative influence"" over spending after Brexit. Jeremy Miles says the UK government should be making ""firm proposals"" by now Responding to Mr Hart's article, and appearing before the Commons Welsh Affairs Committee on Thursday, Welsh minister for European Transition Jeremy Miles said ""we are way beyond the stage at which its helpful for organisations in Wales to be reading things in the press"". ""We really need to see some firm proposals"" from UK ministers, he said. ""A set of proposals that reflect the devolution settlement would mean that funding comes to Welsh Government for Welsh Government to share, in accordance with the principles of our framework, and that framework has been developed with local government and has a very very strong regional character to it. ""You will have seen in it, perhaps, that a significant amount of decentralisation is envisaged from Cardiff Bay to regions right across Wales."" Mr Miles also denied ""there's been any lack of collaboration on our part"". ""I offered the UK government the services of our officials,"" he said. ""Those offers were not taken up.""

"Many staff members reported working over their contracted hours Maternity services inspectors raised concerns about staffing levels, emergency equipment and training before the Covid pandemic, a report has found. Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) visited 25 maternity units between July 2019 and January 2020 as part of a national review. It found the quality of care was generally good, with the majority of women having positive experiences. But some ""areas for improvement"" were also identified. Inspectors sought immediate improvements around the checking of neonatal and emergency equipment as well as medical emergency arrangements, the security of newborn babies and the management of medicines. Maternity service improvements 'firmly on track' Coronavirus: Giving birth during the lockdown Pregnant women facing 'anxious and worrying time' The report comes after serious failings were foundat Cwm Taf Morgannwg health boardwhich resulted in maternity services at hospitals in Merthyr Tydfil and Llantrisant being placed in special measures last year. But the HIW inspections found services across Wales were ""safe and effective and that's a really nice thing to be able to say,"" said Alun Jones, interim chief executive. ""Of course there's no room for complacency there and we did find some areas for improvement as well."" The Welsh Government said: ""We are pleased that the report recognises the commitment and dedication of staff working within maternity services throughout Wales. ""We welcome the report by HIW and will give careful consideration to its recommendations."" Inspectors surveyed 122 patients during their visits to maternity wards across Wales In the Aneurin Bevan, Cardiff and Vale, Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Hywel Dda health boards, inspections revealed inconsistencies in the way temperatures were monitored and recorded for medication fridges. Staff were not always clear on their roles and some were unable to clearly explain why the information was recorded, and what they should do if the temperatures fell outside of manufacturer's recommendations. The inspections also found issues with the prescribing and administering of medication during labour, with particular concerns in Betsi Cadwaladr and Cwm Taf Morgannwg. Those concerns were dealt with and resolved, but HIW said it was an issue all health boards should consider. HIW received more than 3,300 responses from women and their families as part of the review and also surveyed 122 patients during their inspections. Workers were also surveyed and raised concerns about staffing levels, with 40% saying there were ""always"" or ""usually"" enough staff for them to do their job properly. Many staff reported working in excess of their contracted hours and there were also worries about using temporary staff during shortages and the impact on continuity of care. HIW found some units did not monitor the number of hours individual staff members were working, and did not take steps to ensure staff had adequate rest time between shifts. Less than half of respondents agreed their job was good for their health. HIW said health boards across south Wales had the most negative comments about staffing ratios. ""Whilst we found that the staff working across Wales were very much committed and striving to provide a high quality service, there were lots of examples where we were told by staff that they were under pressure,"" said Mr Jones. ""There was a sense that the sustainability of some services was a challenge so we made a number of recommendations to health boards to think about workforce planning."" The second phase of HIW's national review is due to begin before the end of the year.

"Louise has found new work on a farm - but her apprenticeship is over Louise James started her apprenticeship with a butchery company in January, but was made redundant just eight months later due to the coronavirus pandemic. The 33-year-old was ""devastated"" by the decision, but her employer's business had completely dried up. Louise is not alone, with the number of apprenticeships ending in redundancy in lockdown two thirds higher than in 2019,  provisional figures show. The BBC obtained the data under the Freedom of Information Act. Between March and July, 1,033 people in England were withdrawn from apprenticeship programmes because they had been made redundant. This compares to 615 for the same period in 2019, according to Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) data. There are roughly 740,000 apprentices training in England in total. The apparent rise in redundancies is more evidence of the challenge facing the apprenticeship system due to the coronavirus outbreak. The ESFA said the total number of apprentices made redundant would be higher than the figures they disclosed. The numbers don't include those who go on to complete their apprenticeship with a new employer, or at a college. Some cases may also not be registered as redundancies, the agency said. More substantial data is expected later in November. Louise said she had wanted to be a butcher since she was ""tiny"". ""I have never been the sort of person to want to sit behind a computer screen all day. I always like doing things with my hands, I am very crafty. I felt worth something."" But her employer provided meat to bars and restaurants - when they closed, business dried up. ""We went from having something in the region of about a thousand orders a day to having 30 and there just wasn't enough work to keep all of the staff on."" Louise was told she was being made redundant, and says she was ""devastated."" The government was already supporting trainees for 12 weeks to find new work and continue their apprenticeship, but Louise didn't have much luck. ""I contacted something in the region of 30 butchers across Coventry and Warwickshire. There were three who seemed quite keen and then once they realised I was over the age of 21 they cooled off."" ""I didn't receive much support from the training company at all. I have not even received confirmation that my apprenticeship has come to an end. I just know that it has due to the length of time it has been."" In August, Louise's redundancy went through, and she's since found work on a council-run farm, supporting adults with learning disabilities. ""It was a huge relief. I cried, I'm not going to lie. It has been a very financially difficult year for myself and my husband. I cried. And we celebrated as well!"" The Chancellor's furlough scheme was opened to apprentices from the start of lockdown In October, 12% of apprentices in Great Britain surveyed by the Sutton Trust had been made redundant, up from 8% in April. A further 8% were on furlough, and 35% had been furloughed but were now back at work. 15% had remained at work but seen their off-the-job learning programmes suspended. For the UK workforce as a whole, July to September saw a record increase and a record number of redundancies, to 314,000, according to official statistics. Gillian Keegan, apprenticeships minister, told the BBC that redundancy ""is always a risk when you have got this sort of disruption in your economy so we were very focused very early on to do as much as we could to support and protect apprentices."" That support includes allowing apprentices to be furloughed, and continue their training while not working, moving to online study if need be. From August to January, employers will get a Â£2,000 grant for each apprentice under 25 they hire, and Â£1,500 for older apprentices. In September, the government introduced a redundancy support service for apprentices. At the same time, trainees who were three quarters of the way through a longer apprenticeship were granted funding to finish - previously, this had been limited to those in their final six months of training. The pandemic has also hit the number of people starting new apprenticeships. Figures from the Department for Education show,externalthat between 23 March and 31 July in England, 58,160 apprentices started their training - down from 107,750 during the same period in 2019. Apprenticeships for the under-19s were particularly affected, down over two-thirds compared to the same period last year. The retail and leisure sectors, hardest hit by the lockdown, show a 72% fall. However, the Department said some of the apparent drop may be exaggerated by employers failing to file paperwork because of the pandemic. The first five months of lockdown also saw a steep fall in the number of opportunities advertised on the government's Find an Apprenticeship website. Tracey Matthews says around 20 of Milton Keynes College's 500 apprentices face redundancy Tracey Matthews, an assistant principal at Milton Keynes College, said the picture was concerning. ""I don't just worry about all those apprentices we have on programme now, I also worry about those young people who wanted to get apprenticeships. We don't have as many vacancies in the system as we have had previously. Ms Matthews said she worried the uncertainty could damage the ""apprenticeship brand"". ""For the last few years in school we have been trying to encourage young people to consider apprenticeships as a viable alternative, and now actually, for those who have, maybe they're feeling their fingers have been burned,"" she said. In a special edition of the Your Work Your Money podcast, Sean and Reggie are joined by YouTuber and former BAME Apprentice of the Year Kimmy Kimani to answer your questions on apprenticeships.Available now on BBC Sounds.

"Military helicopters were deployed to support the NHS as part of the coronavirus response MPs have accused the Ministry of Defence of a ""lamentable"" failure to properly fund new military equipment required for the armed forces.

The MPs accused the MoD of failing to make the ""hard choices"" necessary to plug a gap of up to Â£13bn pounds in the current equipment programme. ""The government has still not taken the strategic decisions required to establish an affordable equipment plan and deliver the crucial military capabilities needed by our armed forces. ""The department's lamentable failure to get a grip on the equipment plan continues, despite this committee and the NAO [National Audit Office] consistently highlighting serious affordability issues in the plan year after year."" Committee chair Meg Hillier said: ""The MoD knows what it's getting wrong. We know what it's getting wrong. ""For years, we have made concrete proposals to improve delivery of key strategic priorities and here we are again, with the same gaps in our national defence and the same risk to our armed forces personnel, year after year."" Conservative MP Mark Francois recently warned General Sir Nick Carter, chief of the defence staff, that he should ""nip back to the department and ask them to sort their bloody selves out, because if not, Cummings is going to come down there and sort you out his own way, and you won't like it.""

"Apple will pay $113m (Â£85m) to settle allegations that it slowed down older iPhones. Thirty-three US states claimed that Apple had done this to drive users into buying new devices. Millions of people were affected when the models of iPhone 6 and 7 and SE were slowed down in 2016 in a scandal that was dubbed batterygate. Apple declined to comment, however, it has previously said the phones were slowed to preserve ageing battery life. The deal is separate from a proposed settlement Apple reached in March to pay affected iPhone owners up to $500m in a class action lawsuit. In 2016 Apple updated software on models of the iPhone 6, 7 and SE - which throttled chip speeds on aging phones. Apple acknowledged its update reduced power demands after researchers found unusual slowdowns in 2017. The states argued that Apple had acted deceptively and should have replaced batteries or disclosed the issue. According to an Arizona filing, millions of users were affected by power shutoffs. Apple denies that the slowdown was for financial gain. But Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich wrote in a court document made public on Wednesday: ""Many consumers decided that the only way to get improved performance was to purchase a newer-model iPhone from Apple. ""Apple, of course, fully understood such effects on sales."" Under the settlement, Apple did not admit to any wrongdoing or breaking any law. The tech titan also agreed for the next three years to provide ""truthful information"" about iPhone power management across its website, software update notes and iPhone settings.

"Elisa Granato was one of the volunteers given the Oxford vaccine The Oxford coronavirus vaccine shows a strong immune response in adults in their 60s and 70s, raising hopes that it can protect age groups most at risk from the virus. Researchers saythe Lancet phase two findings,external, based on 560 healthy adult volunteers, are ""encouraging"". They are also testing whether the vaccine stops people developing Covid-19 in larger, phase three trials. Early results from this crucial stage are expected in the coming weeks. Three vaccines - Pfizer-BioNTech, Sputnik and Moderna - have already reported good preliminary data from phase three trials, with one suggesting94% of over-65s could be protected from Covid-19. The Oxford data is from an earlier stage, which tests the safety of the vaccine and the body's response to it, but in the long run it's likely this vaccine could be easier to roll out because it doesn't need to be stored at very cold temperatures. The UK government has ordered more of the Oxford vaccine, manufactured by AstraZeneca, than any other - 100 million doses - compared to 40 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and five million of the Moderna vaccine. Prof Andrew Pollard, study lead from the University of Oxford, told the BBC he was ""absolutely delighted with the results"" showing a strong immune response ""even in those over 70 years of age"". On whether the vaccine protects people against Covid-19, he said they were ""not there yet"" but the data would probably be released ""before Christmas"". Prof Pollard said there was ""no competition"" with other vaccines, adding that multiple vaccines needed to be successful. ""We will need all of them to protect people around the globe,"" he said. How many coronavirus vaccines will there be? How do we know if vaccines are safe? The challenge with developing a Covid vaccine is to trigger the body to fight back against the virus no matter how old someone is. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Older people's weaker immune systems mean vaccines do not tend to function as well as they do in younger people. These trial results from the University of Oxford, peer-reviewed in the Lancet, suggest that may not be a problem. They show that older adults aged 56-69 and over 70 had a similar immune response to younger adults aged 18-55. Dr Maheshi Ramasamy, an investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: ""The next step will be to see if this translates into protection from the disease itself."" VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Two weeks after the second dose, more than 99% of participants had neutralising antibody responses. These included people of all ages. The T-cell response - another measure of how well the immune system responds - peaked two weeks after the first dose of the vaccine, regardless of age. ""The robust antibody and T-cell responses seen in older people in our study are encouraging,"" Dr Ramasamy said. ""The populations at greatest risk of serious Covid-19 disease include people with existing health conditions and older adults. ""We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure."" Older adults were also less likely to experience side-effects, which were usually mild. And there were no serious safety issues relating to the vaccine, called ChAdOx1 nCov-2019. Volunteers in the trial were put into groups and given one or two doses of the vaccine or a dummy jab. The reaction of their immune systems was assessed on the day they got the jab, then one, two and four weeks after both doses. First patients injected in UK Covid vaccine trial Oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response Pfizer vaccine is '94% effective in over-65s' The Oxford vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees that has been modified so it cannot grow in humans. Work began on the vaccine in January and it was developed in under three months, starting human trials - the first in Europe - in April in Oxford. Phase three trials of the vaccine, which look at how effective it is at protecting people against the Covid-19, started at the end of August and are still continuing. When data from this stage is sent to the regulators, scrutinised and approved, the vaccine can be given the green light to be used on people worldwide. The Oxford vaccine is expected to be easier to manufacture on a global scale than Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine, and the university is committed to making hundreds of millions of doses available to the developing world. The UK's large order of the vaccine means that if it is approved before Christmas and becomes available early next year, it would make a major difference to how quickly Covid vaccines could be given to people in priority groups.

RADIO 1'S POWER DOWN PLAYLIST:Billie Eilish gives us two hours of blissed-out warm sounds to relax to News of the vaccine comes amid a debate in the UK about whether people will be able to see their families over the Christmas period. Prof Andrew Hayward - director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care and a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies - told the BBC that family gatherings at Christmas would pose ""substantial risks"". ""We're on the cusp of being able to protect those elderly people, who we love, through vaccination,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. ""It would be tragic to throw that opportunity away... by trying to return to normality over the holidays."" He added: ""My personal view is we're putting far too much emphasis on having a near-normal Christmas."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"This video can not be played Robin Swann hopes for 'better Christmas season' Health Minister Robin Swann says he will bring proposals to Thursday's executive meeting setting out options to manage the spread of Covid-19 in NI. Ministers are due to meet for the first time sincelast week's row over extending some restrictions. Mr Swann said his paper would set out measures to ""get us through the difficult weeks ahead"". He will suggest further restrictions and initiatives, in the hopes of reaching consensus, he added. Earlier, First Minister Arlene Foster said it was ""time for the executive to step back"" and collaborate together. Her party, the DUP, faced criticism for using a cross-community mechanism to block two proposals last week from Mr Swann to extend the restrictions - and the party has not ruled out deploying it again. Speaking at a press conference at Stormont on Wednesday, Mr Swann said the ""single biggest priority"" had to be forcing down rates of infection in Northern Ireland. ""Those of us in political leadership have a critical responsibility to take the right decisions - it's tough because all of us around the executive table are taking the decisions,"" he said. ""I will be bringing a paper to tomorrow's executive...detailing a range of options and initiatives to get us through the difficult weeks ahead. ""It can help us achieve a better Christmas season as we look forward to a much better new year."" He said he would not hesitate to recommend more restrictions if required and said there were ""no quick fixes"". NI's Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young said NI's R number - or reproduction value of the virus - was sitting ""around one"" - a rise from two weeks ago when it was sitting at about 0.7 for new case numbers. ""There are no new solutions - we all need to limit our mobility and the number of contacts we have with other people and to adhere to other mitigations we've been talking about for so long,"" said Prof Young. Their comments came as another 11 people died in Northern Ireland after contracting Covid-19. In the past day, 518 more people tested positive for the virus. In the Republic of Ireland, a further 12 people died after contracting Covid-19, and 379 new cases were also confirmed. On Wednesday, the health minister visited Whiteabbey Hospital's Nightingale facility, which he said would open on Friday. Analysis by Louise Cullen, BBC News NI health reporter This was the minister and his advisers setting out their stall ahead of tomorrow's Executive meeting. The words of the Chief Scientific Adviser - ""we have not yet seen the fall we had hoped for"" - were telling. Hospital inpatients are still at a high level, and the rate of transmission, the R number, didn't drop as much as expected while schools were closed.  It's risen since they returned. The trio were asked about mass testing and rapid testing. But that's the tip of a very large iceberg of logistics, reliability and availability. At least 90% of the population would need to be repeatedly tested to allow mass rapid testing to be effective, and the rapid test currently has a 30% failure rate. Dr. Michael McBride spoke of hope being tempered with realism - while spring and summer may present a brighter picture, thanks to developments in testing, vaccination and treatments for the virus, the realistic picture now for the health minister is that more restrictions will be needed before Christmas. The department of health said it will provide enhanced rehabilitation ""step down"" care for Covid patients who are well enough to leave an acute hospital but who would benefit from a period of rehabilitation before discharge. The nightingale will be run by the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and will provide an additional 23 beds with further expansion expected. Hairdressing salons are among the businesses that can reopen from Friday Earlier, Mrs Foster said initial discussions had taken place on Tuesday with other executive ministers about trying to reach an earlier decision around current Covid-19 restrictions. Close-contact services, cafes and coffee shops can reopen this Friday but restrictions on pubs, restaurants and hotels are due to expire at midnight next Thursday. ""We're all adults - we recognise last week was not good for the executive,"" she told BBC News NI. ""I hope we will have a press conference tomorrowâ¦ it is our desire to communicate with the public as much as we can. What are the lockdown rules where you live? What are the rules for work, seeing friends and exercise? Business fury at 'shambolic' Stormont stalemate ""It's about preparing the ground this week - we cannot leave it to the way it happened last week, we have to step forward this week."" She repeated her assertion that she wants to find a ""balanced and proportionate approach"" to the restrictions. Mrs Foster added she would need to see the detail from the health minister and assess it with other data before making a decision. Arlene Foster says she wants the executive to step back and try to avoid a repeat of last week's row ""I would love to give certainty to everybody in Northern Ireland but I have to hear what the health minister has to say in relation to all of that,"" said the first minister. ""People need to know what is happening and whatever the decision is I think it is incumbent upon us to communicate that as quickly as we can."" NI's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride told the press conference that officials were looking at the possibility of mass testing for university students, to allow them to come home for Christmas. However, he warned it was not a ""panacea"" for people to ignore other public health guidelines. Mr Swann added that he had written to the British Health Secretary Matt Hancock about rolling out a mass testing programme in Northern Ireland, but he cautioned that discussions were ongoing, would prove resource-intensive and would not be a full solution. Prof Young said the prospect of wider testing was ""exciting"", but that it had limitations. He said where it had been successful, a high number of the population - about 90% or more - needed to be tested, which would present ""enormous logistical challenges"" in Northern Ireland. He added that it would also require repeated testing due to the infectious cycle of the virus, meaning developing the programme itself would be challenging. Earlier on Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Downing Street would talk to the Stormont Executive about the government's plans to roll out more mass testing programmes across the UK. He made the remark in response to DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson during prime minister's questions. Sir Jeffrey said Northern Ireland should be considered for the scheme, which is already operating in Liverpool, due to its population size. The prime minister said he recognised mass testing was a ""powerful weapon"" in the fight against Covid-19 and that talks with the executive would take place. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she had spoken to the Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson about thebenefits of mass testing. Allow Twitter content?

"Harlequins played Bath in front of around 2,700 fans at The Stoop in September The government is set to confirm a rescue package of emergency funding for sports impacted by the absence of spectators because of coronavirus. A bailout of several hundred million pounds will be announced on Thursday, consisting of both grants and loans. Both rugby codes and horse racing will be among the 11 beneficiaries, although a range of sports in England will receive assistance. The Premier League and English Football League will not be among them. The government says the sport is wealthy enough to support itself. Cricket will also not be among those receiving money. Government exploring potential return for fans in December Nigel Huddleston, the UK sports minister, has said he will be making a statement on financial support for the sport sector in the House of Commons on Thursday after weeks of talks with the Treasury. In September, more than 100 sports bodies wrote to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ask for emergency funding, warning of ""a lost generation of activity"" because of coronavirus. The coalition of organisations said they were ""united in our concern that at a time when our role should be central to the nation's recovery, the future of the sector is perilous"". They also pointed to the Â£1.6bn of support that the arts sector received in July. Sports were then asked to tell the government how much they estimated they would lose as a result of turnstiles being closed. In a devastating blow to cash-strapped sports bodies, plans for a partial return of spectators from 1 October were scrapped amid a rise in coronavirus cases. Turnstiles have been closed since March, despite sports saying that pilot events with socially-distanced crowds have been achieved safely. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is working on allowing fans into stadiums in areas where rates of infections are deemed sufficiently low - possibly before Christmas. ""I understand the frustration over fans and we hope to get crowds back in the ground as soon as possible,"" Johnson said on Wednesday in response to a question from Karl McCartney, the Conservative MP for Lincoln. Meanwhile, the petition to exempt golf courses from the list of venues required to close during lockdown will be debated by MPs on 23 November, as will a similar one relating to gyms.

""The government has still not taken the strategic decisions required to establish an affordable equipment plan and deliver the crucial military capabilities needed by our armed forces.

"Fifteen pro-democracy lawmakers resigned this month in protest at China's new rules China has strongly rebuked the UK, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada after being accused of a concerted effort to silence critics in Hong Kong. The countries, which form the Five Eyes alliance, criticised China's imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong. They urged Beijing to reverse course. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman responded that if countries ""dared harm China's sovereignty, they should beware that their eyes could be blinded"". ""The Chinese never stir trouble , but they aren't afraid of trouble either,""  Zhao Lijian told journalists in Beijing on Thursday, saying it did not ""matter if they had five or 10 eyes"". Chinaâs new brand of tough-talking diplomats Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? Why people are scared of Hong Kong's new law Last week, Hong Kong expelled four pro-democracy lawmakers from its legislature after Beijing passed a resolution allowing the city's government to dismiss politicians deemed a threat to national security. In response,all of Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers announced their resignation.For the first time since the UK handed the territory back to China in 1997, the body has almost no dissenting voices. This video can not be played Claudia Mo: ""We have given up the legislative fight at least for the time being."" The dismissal of the four lawmakers was viewed by many as the latest attempt by China to restrict Hong Kong's freedoms, something Beijing denies. Foreign ministers from the Five Eyes group urged China to reinstate them, saying the move was a clear breach of Beijing's legally binding commitments to protect the territory's freedoms and autonomy. They also accused Beijing of undermining the rights of people in Hong Kong to elect their representatives. Five Eyes is an intelligence-sharing alliance of the five Anglophone countries set up during the Cold War and initially developed to monitor the USSR and its allies. Earlier, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said any attempt by foreign states to threaten or pressure Beijing to make concessions was ""doomed to fail"".

As a Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong was to have its own legal system, multiple political parties, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech. But in late June China passed a controversial, far-reaching national security law in the territory after years of pro-democracy and anti-Beijing protests, which reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. It criminalises ""secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces"". Beijing says the law will return stability to the territory, but western governments and human rights groups say it effectively curtails freedom of speech and protest. After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety. Earlier this month, a reporter who helped investigate suspected police involvement in a violent attack on protesters last year was arrested, in whatjournalists said was a tactic to discourage reporting. In response to the security law, theUK offered Hong Kong residents still holding British National Overseas (BNO) statusa route to British citizenship. Around 300,000 people currently hold BNO passports, while an estimated 2.9 million people born before the handover are eligible for one.China last month strongly criticised the UKin response, telling London to ""immediately correct its mistakes"".

"This video can not be played Father Christmas has some tips on how to have a safe Christmas The four UK governments have announced their plans to enable families to celebrate Christmas together. So how is the festive period likely to be different this year? The governments of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have agreeda common approachallowing up to three households to form a Christmas bubble and meet up from 23 to 27 December (22 to 28 December in Northern Ireland). People can mix in homes, places of worship and outdoor spaces, and travel restrictions will also be eased. However, a Christmas bubble must be exclusive, so people cannot swap between them. Bubble members also will not be able to visit pubs or restaurants together. There will be no limit to the number of people in a household joining a bubble in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But the Scottish government has said that Christmas bubblesshould contain no more than eight people.Children under 12 will not count in the total. Who can I see at Christmas? Fears that a lack of skilled overseas workers on poultry farms could hit the supply of turkeys have been overcome aftertravel rules were relaxedso they could travel to the UK. But many people are buying smaller turkeys than usual because they are likely to have fewer guests. An Aberdeenshire farmer has warnedmany birds could go to waste, while a farm in Walescut its turkey numbers by 20%in September. Any turkey shortage may make some people consider a vegetarian or vegan meal instead. This year's work celebrations seem certain to take place on Zoom and other online platforms. Rules on big groups meeting up in pubs or anywhere outdoors are very unlikely to be eased in December, so seeing friends for a pre-Christmas drink or meal will probably not be allowed. Current rules for socialising outside your household/support bubble/extended household are: From 2 December inEngland, people can meetup to five other people outdoors,and in tier one areas only, up to five others indoors In most ofScotland,people cannot meet indoors, butoutdoors, depending on the area,external, up to six people (from two households) or eight (from the same area) can meet Two families can form a bubble inWalesbut cannot meet anyone else at home, andup to four from different households,externalcan meet in pubs and restaurants In Northern Ireland, two households can form a bubble butcannot meet anyone else indoors,external At the moment, it is not known what will happen about traditional Christmas religious services like midnight Mass. From 2 December inEngland,places of worshipwill reopen for communal prayer.,external Up to 50 people canattend indoor services,externalinScotlandin levels zero to three areas, but only up to 20 in level four places. Places of worship have reopened inWales,but with social distancing in place andcommunal singing banned,external. They are also open inNorthern Ireland withno limit on numbers if safety measures are in place.,externalWeddings, civil ceremonies and funerals can happen, but only 25 people. can attend While in-person shopping in non-food shops can currently happen in all of the UK except England, online retailers are expecting a big surge in demand this year. In September, shoppers were warned by an industry boss tobuy as early as possible. Andy Mulcahy, from the online businesses' industry body, told the BBC: ""At this point, I think we can expect an increase of at least 30% for the peak festive trading season, but if stores have to close this might push to 50%."" InEngland,non-essential shops will reopen on 2 December.,externalThey are currently open in all ofScotlandexcept level four areas,external, acrossWales,external, and inNorthern Ireland,external. Last posting dates,externalinside the UK range from 18 to 23 December, while we have already passed some international dates. Theatres inEnglandcan reopen on 2 December, and plans have been made for some Christmas pantomimes. While many venues and production companies havecancelled their shows, others are going ahead thanks to National Lottery backing. One is at the London Palladium, wherethe Lottery will buy seats that cannot be usedbecause of social distancing. It will also donate 20,000 free tickets to Lottery players. Meanwhile a drive-in show - the Car Park Panto - will tour Great Britain with audience memberswatching from inside their cars. Theatres inScotlandare closed inlevel two, three and four areas,external, throughoutWales,external, and to audiences inNorthern Ireland,where they can open forrehearsals or a live recording,external. The Christmas relaxation of meeting up rules does not extend to New Year's Eve, so that is likely to be a quiet affair this year, with house parties banned in most places.

"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days.

You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate.

"Scotland and England have lifted their guidance to work from home. However, people in Northern Ireland and Wales are still advised to work remotely where possible. InEnglandthe government isno longer asking people to work from home. It had previously asked people to do so, to help tackle the spread of Omicron. InScotland,similar guidance has now been relaxed. The government wants firms to let workers return gradually - allowing them to spend some time in the office and some time at home. InNorthern Ireland, current guidance is to work from home where you can. Offices no longer need to take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing, although risk assessments should still be carried out. InWales, the government says it remains important to work from home if you can. A legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable - with Â£60 fines for anyone who did not comply - has been scrapped. Employers are asked to followofficial safety guidance,externaland carry out Covid risk assessments for those staff who are in the office. Safety measures can include: improving ventilation additional cleaning turning away people with Covid There ismore detailed advice,externalfor some industries - including construction, hospitality and manufacturing, plus specific advice for employers inEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external.

It greatly limits face-to-face contact - both with colleagues and on public transport. Much of the riskdepends on how crowded it is and your distance from other people.

"The UK's various lockdowns have one unifying feature - a squeeze on the finances of many whose jobs have been affected. There is some help available if you are struggling to pay your bills, but it will usually require action on your part. This is many people's biggest monthly bill. Since the pandemic started, some two-and-a-half million homeowners have taken a mortgage holiday. That means they have deferred the payment, but will probably have to pay more each month when repayments resume. Irrespective of the level of lockdown, anyone can still request a mortgage holiday, unless they have already had one for six months,the City regulator - the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - has said.,external A new one can last for six months. An existing one can be extended to last for six months in total. Applications can be made before the end of March 2020. Under the FCA's rules, there will be no repossessions before 31 January, unless a homeowner specifically asks for one. In addition, a mortgage holiday should not show up on your credit record, so should not affect future borrowing. That said, future lenders may ask other questions to find out whether you have had previous difficulties paying. In these cases, the FCA says that your lender can give you ""tailored support"". They will assess your circumstances and devise an arrangement that could include extending the mortgage term, accepting partial payments, or - only in the short-term - another deferral. However, this will show up on your credit record. For tenants, the situation is less clear-cut. The best option is to talk to your landlord, explain your circumstances and agree a payments schedule. It will often be in the landlord's own interests to do this, as eviction for non-payment is likely to be a drawn-out process. Courts will remain open to hear eviction cases but, in England, no new eviction notices will be issued until 11 January at the earliest - except in the most serious cases. There is some financial help to pay the rent through the benefits system if, for example, you are on universal credit. Some hardship funds are also available in some UK nations. Again, the FCA says there will be an extension of the payment deferrals system seen during the first lockdown. About two million people made use of payment holidays for loans, credit cards, and other debts in the spring and summer. Similar to the mortgage system, payment holidays for credit can be extended to six months, or taken for the first time. What is universal credit and what else can I claim? How to save money working from home this winter Who is eligible to go back on to furlough? This is also true of motor finance, rent-to-own, and buy-now-pay-later products, and for pawnbroking customers. Again, if you have used up your six-month holiday, ask your lender for other, specific support. This will be marked on your credit file. There is short-term assistance for what is generally a short-term, high-cost product. Payday loan customers who have not yet had a payment deferral will be eligible for a one-month payment holiday. There is a host of free guidance and advice available, including: TheMoney Navigator tool,externalfrom the Money and Pensions Service relates to coronavirus-related money matters TheTurn2Us charity,externalhas a range of advice on grants, benefits and financial assistance Guidance is available fromCitizens Advice,externaland from theLow Incomes Tax Reform Group,external During the spring lockdown and up until the end of October, borrowers had an interest-free buffer for the first Â£500 of their overdraft. This is not being extended. So, customers are now facing overdraft interest rates, typically of 40% - a rise for many on what it cost at the start of 2020. Pre-payment meter users who cannot top up, possibly because they are self-isolating and cannot get to the shops, will be helped. Meanwhile, any gas and electricity customer struggling to pay will be offered whatthe energy regulator Ofgem describes as,externala ""realistic and sustainable repayment plan"". So far, these have been voluntary agreements with suppliers, but will become a regulatory requirement from 15 December. Customers who had payment holidays or who are struggling financially may have their risk reassessed to make a policy cheaper, be given more time to pay, or have charges reduced or cancelled. However, anyone finding it difficult must contact their insurer first, rather than waiting for their insurer to contact them. Councils have a hardship fund designed to reduce payments for those finding it hard to pay. Bailiffs will not pursue other debts during lockdown. Lenders have a duty to identify and support those who are vulnerable, and mental health issues will fall into that category. Is is important to seek free, independent advice and not to bottle up any serious concerns. Nobody knows when that will be. The regulator is keen to stress that a debt problem delayed is not a debt problem solved, so you should make repayments if you can.

"Australia has had forces in Afghanistan since 2002 There is ""credible evidence"" that Australian elite soldiers unlawfully killed 39 people during the Afghan war, a long-awaited report has found. The Australian Defence Force (ADF) has released findings from a four-year inquiry into misconduct by its forces. It said 19 current or ex-special forces soldiers should be investigated by police over killings of ""prisoners, farmers or civilians"" in 2009-13. The ADF blamed crimes on an unchecked ""warrior culture"" among some soldiers. The inquiry - conducted by Maj Gen Justice Paul Brereton - conducted interviews with more than 400 witnesses. It also found evidence that: Junior soldiers were told to get their first kill by shooting prisoners, in a practice known as ""blooding"" Weapons and other items were planted near Afghan bodies to cover up crimes An additional two incidents could constitute a war crime of ""cruel treatment"" Afghanistan said it had been assured by Australia that it was committed to ""ensuring justice"". Samantha Crompvoets, an academic who carried out the initial research into the incidents, told the BBC they were ""deliberate, repeated and targeted war crimes"" and said she felt vindicated by the report. Australia has had forces in Afghanistan since 2002, following the overthrow of the Taliban, as part of a US-led coalition. Initially the international forces' role was to train Afghan troops but they became increasingly involved in fighting insurgents. Gen Angus Campbell said none of the incidents could be ""described as being in the heat of battle"" It said 25 special forces soldiers had taken part in unlawful killings directly or as ""accessories"", across 23 separate incidents. It recommended that 36 incidents in total be investigated by federal police. ADF chief Gen Angus Campbell said none of the incidents could be ""described as being in the heat of battle"". ""None were alleged to have occurred in circumstances in which the intent of the perpetrator was unclear, confused or mistaken,"" he told reporters on Thursday. ICC backs Afghan war crimes probe Did UK Special Forces execute unarmed civilians? Gen Campbell said there was alarming evidence that some Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers had taken ""the law into their own hands"". ""The report notes that the distorted culture was embraced and amplified by some experienced, charismatic and influential non-commissioned officers and their proteges, who sought to fuse military excellence with ego, elitism and entitlement,"" he said. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? The report said it would be a ""gross distortion"" to blame senior ADF command, saying the crimes were ""commenced... and concealed at the patrol commander level"". Dr Crompvoets said the incidents ""involved in some instances very influential non-commissioned officers"". ""Platoon commanders were encouraging or insisting junior soldiers execute prisoners to achieve their first kill, so it was that sort of pattern of behaviour of grooming these junior soldiers for, or initiating them into, the squadron - that's what was very disturbing,"" she told BBC World Service's Newsday programme. The inquiry was conducted behind closed doors, meaning few details have been reported until now. Last week, PM Scott Morrison warned the report contained ""difficult and hard news for Australians"" about its special forces. ""It is the environment [within the ADF], it is the context, it is the rules, it is the culture and the command that sat around those things,"" he said. ""And if we want to deal with the truth of this, we have to deal with the truth of that."" The office of Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani said Mr Morrison had phoned to express his ""deepest sorrow"" over the findings. The country's foreign ministry, quoted by AFP, said the incidents mentioned in the report were ""unforgivable"" but its publication was ""an important step towards justice"". The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC)welcomed the report,externalbut noted it had not established enough evidence to ensure criminal prosecution. It said it was vital that this be sought and ""adequate compensation"" provided without delay. ""Only through a series of independent inquiries will we uncover the true extent of this disregard for Afghan life, which normalised murder, and resulted in war crimes,"" it said. Elaine Pearson, from Human Rights Watch, told the BBC: ""This is a vindication - this is an acknowledgement that these crimes occurred."" Dr Crompvoets said she had faced ""huge resistance"" when her initial report was leaked but had now been proved right. ""I was certainly criticised for being a female, a civilian, a feminist, that somehow I was trying to feminise defence,"" she said. ""It wasn't about me not understanding what it's like to be at war,"" she added. ""It was quite evident there were fundamental things that had gone wrong."" The defence chief's language was as part of this story as the findings themselves. He started by apologising to the Afghan people for any wrongdoing, then told the Australian people they had the right to expect better from their special forces. He used words like shameful, appalling and toxic when describing the actions of some troops and the culture in which they operated. And it wasn't just that these alleged executions took place, it was the manner of impunity by which they happened. In fact, according to the report, there was an air of competitiveness within the special forces. One moment stood out in Gen Campbell's address: when he described how some junior soldiers had allegedly been coerced to shoot unarmed civilians to get their ""first kill"" - a practice known as ""blooding"". He said that weapons and radios had then been allegedly planted to support claims that the victims had been enemies killed in action. The public version of the report is highly redacted and we don't know details of specific incidents or specific individuals. But it has been enough to make for very uncomfortable reading for the military, the government and for the Australian public. Last week, Mr Morrison said a special investigator would be appointed to consider prosecutions from information contained in the report. Australian media reported that police investigations would be likely to take years, even before possible criminal trials. Fighting for a future in a war without end How much has the Afghanistan war cost the US? The Afghan war: The short and long story Gen Campbell said one SAS squadron had been shut down, and it was the ADF's responsibility to ""set things right"". The government said it would also establish an independent oversight panel to provide ""accountability and transparency that sits outside of the ADF chain of command"". Australia maintains an operation of around 400 soldiers in Afghanistan as part ongoing peacekeeping efforts with the US and other allies. Earlier this year, the International Criminal Court (ICC) began investigating alleged war crimes by the US and others in the Afghan conflict. The actions of the Taliban, the Afghan government and US troops since May 2003 are expected to be examined. A 2016 report from the ICC said there was a reasonable basis,externalto believe the US military had committed torture at secret detention sites operated by the CIA. The report also said it was reasonable to believe the Afghan government had tortured prisoners and the Taliban had committed war crimes such as the mass killing of civilians. In Britain, the High Court is considering whether the UK failed to properly investigate allegations of unlawful killing by UK Special Forces. And on Thursday, the AIHRC also called for the UK ""to open an independent public inquiry to review and investigate the allegations of unlawful killings by UK Special Forces"". Last year,the BBC's Panorama programme revealedthat the UK had failed to fully investigate credible evidence of a pattern of illegal killings carried out by British Special Forces. ""The US and UK, and other countries with an armed presence in Afghanistan [should] respond to these media reports, and to investigate their forces' participation, and leadership, of acts of violence against Afghan non-combatants,"" the AIHRC said in a statement.
