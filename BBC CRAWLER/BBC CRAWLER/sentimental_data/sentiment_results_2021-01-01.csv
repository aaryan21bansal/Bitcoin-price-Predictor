"The actor was married to fellow Coronation Street star Sue Nicholls Mark Eden, who played Coronation Street villain Alan Bradley, has died at the age of 92. The actor, who had been living with Alzheimer's disease ""for some time"", died early on New Year's Day, his agent confirmed in a statement. Eden was married to fellow Coronation Street star Sue Nicholls, who plays Audrey Roberts. He had been in hospital since November and died peacefully in the early hours of 1 January, his agent said. ""Mark had a long career spanning more than 50 years, including eight years in Coronation Street,"" he added. ""He is survived by his wife Sue, his daughter Polly, his stepson Saul and grand-daughter Emma. We ask that their privacy be respected at this very difficult time."" Alan Bradley's death is one of the most memorable scenes in Coronation Street history Eden's character Alan Bradley - whose daughter Jenny is the current Rovers Return landlady - was one of Weatherfield's most notorious bad boys in the late 1980s. He cheated on Rita Fairclough several times during their relationship and then remortgaged her house without her knowledge so he could fraudulently obtain funds for his security firm. After Rita reported the fraud, he attempted to suffocate her with a cushion. After being found guilty of fraud and actual bodily harm, he was only given a short jail sentence and quickly continued his torment of Rita, who eventually fled the street to escape his harassment. Bradley tracked her down in Blackpool but met a sticky end when, in one of the soap's most dramatic scenes, he was struck by a tram as he chased her through the town. The episode was watched by 21.4 million viewers - and Eden later unveiled a plaque at the tram stop where the scene was filmed. Eden (centre) starred alongside William Hartnell and Martin Miller in the first series of Doctor Who Eden was born in London in 1928 and decided to become an actor in his teens after falling in love with Shakespeare. However, he was unable to launch a career until he was almost 30,he told the Daily Express newspaper in 2013,external. ""I contracted tuberculosis, spent two years in a sanatorium, worked on the fairgrounds, got marriedâ¦ in fact, I was almost 30 by the time I joined Everyman Theatre Group in Ramsgate,"" he said. ""The East Kent Times gave me a rave review for my first play and that was all the encouragement I needed."" His first screen credit was in 1958, with a role in Quatermass And The Pit; and he later played Marco Polo in the first series of Doctor Who. Other roles came in the 1965 film Doctor Zhivago, starring Julie Christie and Omar Sharif, TV show The Avengers and the 1970s detective serial Lord Peter Wimsey. Later in his career he appeared in Doctors and Casualty, with his last screen credit in 2013 in the TV movie An Adventure In Space And Time. Actress Sally Ann Matthews, who played his Coronation Street daughter Jenny Bradley, was among those paying tribute. ""I loved this man so much,"" she wrote on Instagram.

"Iran began increasing enrichment after the US abandoned a 2015 nuclear deal Iran intends to start enriching uranium to 20% purity, a global watchdog says - its most significant breach of an international nuclear deal so far. This remains short of the 90% required to make a nuclear bomb. But under the 2015 agreement Iran was supposed to keep enrichment below 4%. Iran began breaching the deal after President Trump took the US out of it and re-imposed crippling sanctions. However the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China all hope it can be revived. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Iran had informed it of its plans to enrich to a purity of up to 20% at its Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, a facility built deep inside a mountain. But the agency added: ""Iran's letter to the agency ... did not say when this enrichment activity would take place."" Iran breached the 3.67% purity cap imposed by the nuclear deal in 2019 but the enrichment level had remained steady at up to 4.5% since then. However the increase to 20% was mandated in a law passed by Iran's parliament last month in response tothe assassination of the country's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Iran law aims to boost enrichment and block inspectors Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? The bill required the Iranian government to resume enriching uranium to 20% if sanctions on the country's oil and financial sectors were not eased in two months. It also mandated the blocking of UN inspectors from Iran's nuclear facilities at Natanz and Fordo. This video can not be played IAEA inspectors 'working again' in Iran Enriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235. Low-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% concentration of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Highly enriched uranium has a concentration of 20% or more and is used in research reactors. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. Observers say increasing enrichment could shorten Iran's ""break-out time"" - the time it would theoretically take to develop a nuclear bomb. Iran insists its nuclear programme is exclusively for peaceful purposes. But suspicions that Iran was developing a nuclear bomb prompted the EU, the US and the UN to impose sanctions in 2010. The 2015 deal - signed with China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US - was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief. President Trump pulled out of the agreement in May 2018, calling it ""decaying and rotten"". But President-elect Joe Biden has said he would return the US to the agreement - negotiated under President Obama - and would lift sanctions if Iran returned to ""strict compliance with the nuclear deal"". After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Mr Biden, who is due to be sworn in as US president on 20 January, told the New York Times last year that ""it's going to be hard"", but that ""the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a build-up of nuclear capability"". For its part, Iran has expressed interest in once again complying with the agreement should there be a return to full implementation by the US. If Mr Biden ""returns to the situation as it was in 2017, then so will we,"" said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in December.

"This video can not be played ""I wish I could switch place with my daughter"" - Odd Steinar SÃ¸rengen's daughter is missing A body has been found shortly after rescuers and dog handlers began a risky ground search for 10 people missing in a hillside collapse in Norway. Initially it was thought too dangerous to send rescuers on to the site, after flowing mud sent homes toppling into a giant chasm in the village of Ask. Helicopters and drones spent two days searching the scene. But on Friday police commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter. Rescuers, who included a Swedish specialist team, began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards. The bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach one of the wrecked homes, which are 25km (15 miles) north-east of the capital Oslo. A missing Dalmatian dog was rescued on Thursday and police believe there is still a chance survivors could be found. However, on Friday afternoon an air ambulance helicopter landed near the site and police said a body had been found at 14:30 (13:30 GMT) without giving further details. Rescuers are using orange Styrofoam boards to move around the landslide area Prime Minister Erna Solberg said her thoughts went out to the victim's family, and to those waiting for news of the other nine people who were missing. In Friday's operation the rescuers also prepared a giant army vehicle called a ""paver"", which has a giant steel bridge on which rescuers can move. However, conditions were not yet good enough for the 50-tonne machine to be deployed. The plan is to deploy a Norwegian army bridge-laying vehicle as soon as conditions are good enough Friday's search was a race against time, as the rescuers only had a few hours of daylight in the Norwegian winter. Medics and geologists were reportedly part of the ground rescue team. The ground search was called off for the night at 17:30 and police said drones and heat-seeking cameras would continue overnight until rescue crews could return on Saturday morning. About 1,000 people have been evacuated from Gjerdrum municipality, which contains Ask village. Dozens more were moved out of their homes on New Year's Eve. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide Although police have not given details of the missing, they are believed to include men, women and children. Among them is a woman who was talking to her husband on the phone while walking the dog when the line went dead, according to Bergens Tidende newspaper. Further reports say a couple and their small child are also missing, as well as a woman in her 50s and her adult son. More than 30 homes have been destroyed, but officials say more could be lost as the edges of the crater left by the landslide are still breaking away. The conditions have proved challenging, with temperatures dropping to -1C (30F) and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. The scale of the landslide is shown by this aerial view of the disaster site The landslide began early on Wednesday, with residents calling emergency services and telling them that their houses were moving, police said. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" A spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP that the landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft). ""This is the largest landslide in recent times in Norway, considering the number of houses involved and the number of evacuees,"" Laila Hoivik said. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built three years later in 2008.

"This video can not be played Bodycam footage shows the moments before a black man was killed by a police shooting in Minneapolis Minneapolis police have released bodycam footage of a fatal shooting by officers, the first death at the hands of police in the US city since that of George Floyd, a black man, in May. The victim, Dolal Idd, 23, was a suspect in a felony and was stopped by police on Wednesday. He was also black. Initial witness statements and police say Mr Idd fired first and was shot dead when the officers returned fire. Minneapolis saw months of unrest after Mr Floyd's death in police custody. The protests spread across the US amid allegations of police brutality. Mr Floyd died after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Protesters set Minneapolis police station ablaze Viewpoint: Why racism in US is worse than in Europe A city pledged to abolish its police. Then what? The footage from Wednesday's fatal shooting, from the bodycam of one of the officers involved, was released late on Thursday. It shows the officers' cars blocking a white vehicle at a petrol station on the city's south side, not far from where Mr Floyd died. The police are heard shouting ""Stop your car, hands up, hands up!"" before shots are fired, including by the officers. A female passenger in the car with Mr Idd was not hurt, police said, nor were the officers. Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo said a gun was found at the scene. ""When I viewed the video that everyone else is viewing - and certainly the real-time slow-down version - it appears the individual inside the vehicle fired his weapon at the officers first,"" he said. People including Mr Idd's father Bayle Gelle gathered at the scene the following day, prompting fears of renewed protests. ""He was just sitting in the car, and bullets were shot at him, and no reason,"" he said, quoted by CBS News. ""Why are we here?... Because of colour. He is a black man. We want to know why my sweet son gets shot and killed."" George Floyd's death led to violent protests in the city, including this police station set on fire in May City mayor Jacob Frey said he was committed to getting the facts and pursuing justice. ""We know a life has been cut short tonight and that trust between communities of colour and law enforcement is fragile,"" he said in a statement. ""Rebuilding that trust will depend on complete transparency."" Mr Floyd's death in May led to calls for reform or even abolition of the city's police department, but those efforts have stalled.

Mark Ferrett, whose daughter owned the ponies, said the deaths were ""unacceptable"". He said: ""I would favour a reduction in the speed [limit]. Please, everyone needs to slow down and stop this carnage."" The New Forest is one of the largest remaining areas of unenclosed land where commoners' cattle, ponies and donkeys roam throughout the open heath.

All Saints' Church in East Horndon,external, near Brentwood, was broken into before crowds entered, Essex Police said. Officers were threatened and had objects thrown at them as they dispersed hundreds of people and seized equipment, the force said. Two men from Harlow, aged 27 and 22, and a 35-year-old from Southwark were arrested. They were held on suspicion of public order and drugs offences. Astrid Gillespie, a volunteer with the Friends of All Saints', said event organisers had smashed a window to put in an extractor fan unit and wired sound equipment into the church's fuse box.

"After years of silence, The KLF have uploaded a selection of their most famous songs to streaming services like Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music. The band's music has been officially unavailable since 1992, when they deleted their entire back catalogue.

He has previously acted in the Channel 4 drama Skins and the Ken Loach film Route Irish. Earlier this week, the comedian revealed that he and his wife had tested positive for Coronavirus over Christmas, saying he had been ""flattened"" by ""the worst illness I have ever had"". Writing on Instagram,external, he described his symptoms as including ""incredible headaches, muscle and joint point, no appetite, nausea, dizziness [and] chronic fatigue like I didn't know existed"". He updated fans on New Year's Eve, saying he and his wife were ""getting a little stronger"" every day, and promising he would return to work in January. Allow Instagram content?

"Cases have reached record highs in the past week The next few weeks could be the most dangerous period for Scotland since March in the fight against Covid, the first minister has warned. Nicola Sturgeon said the new variant of the virus was ""accelerating spread"" across Scotland. ""If you first foot someone today, or hug/kiss/handshake them HNY, you are putting yourself, others and the NHS at risk,""she tweeted,external. A further 2,539 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed on Friday. The number is slightly down on Thursday's figure, but Ms Sturgeon said cases numbers were still ""worryingly high"". Daily confirmed caseshave reached record highs on each of the previous three days, rising to to 2,622 on Thursday. The percentage of positive cases also reached 14.4% on Wednesday - the highest it has been since the second wave of the pandemic began in the summer. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Police disperse crowd amid muted Hogmanay events Ms Sturgeon tweeted: ""Today's case numbers are worryingly high again. The new variant is accelerating spread. ""PLEASE do not visit other people's homes just now, even today - if you first foot someone today, or hug/kiss/handshake them HNY, you are putting yourself, others & the NHS at risk."" She said the ""vaccine cavalry"" was on the way, offering ""real hope for 2021"", but she added: ""With this new variant, the next few weeks may be the most dangerous we've faced since Mar/April. ""We must act together to suppress it, to save lives and protect the NHS. Folded hands stick with it."" The number of daily confirmed cases has reached record highs this week A new study by London's Imperial College has found that the new variant of Covid-19 is ""hugely"" more transmissible than the virus's previous version. It concludes the new variantincreases the Reproduction or R number by between 0.4 and 0.7. The UK's latest R number has been estimated at between 1.1 and 1.3. It needs to be below 1.0 for the number of cases to start falling. The Scottish government'smost recent estimate of the R number in Scotland,externalhas put it between 0.9 and 1.1. Emma Thomson, a professor of infectious disease at the University of Glasgow, said it was important to get people vaccinated quickly. The professor, who has been working on the sequencing of the new Covid mutation, told the BBC that lockdown was not controlling the infection ""on its own"". ""At least we come in armed into the new year with two vaccines which are highly effective at preventing severe disease. We have that,"" she said. ""We need to roll it out now to add to the public health measures."" Parties, traditional ""first-footing"" and social events were banned this Hogmanay, with all of mainland Scotland and Skye being under the highest level of Covid restrictions. All official events were cancelled, but police had to disperse a crowds of people who gathered at Edinburgh Castle and Calton Hill to see in the new year. It has also emerged that 32 people were charged with reckless conduct after police found them gathered at a rented property in Aberfoyle on 27 December. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""As the first minister has pointed out, the sharp rise in cases is evidence that the new strain seems to be speeding up transmission. ""This is why we are asking people to please stay at home as much as possible and avoid non-essential interaction with others. ""There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we ask everyone to be patient as we work our way through the vaccination programme, and continue to follow FACTS to keep us all safe.""

"Hospitals are under increased pressure amid rising coronavirus cases The next few weeks will be ""nail-bitingly difficult"" for the NHS, hospital bosses have warned. Staff absences and the new Covid variant are creating a ""challenging situation"", Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, said. Doctors are urging the public to ""take it seriously and follow the rules"" to protect the health service. The year started with53,285 more Covid cases and 613 deaths,externalbeing reported. The day's figures do not include data fromNorthern Ireland or Wales, or the numbers of deaths from Scotland,external- as these are not being published on certain days during the Christmas and New Year period. It comes after the UK reported its highest daily cases on Thursday, with a record55,892 infections. On Friday evening, the government confirmed thatall primary schools in London would remain closed for the start of the new term, following a review of Covid transmission rates. From Monday, all schools in the capital will now be required to provide remote learning. Primaries in nine London boroughs and the City of London district had been set to reopen - while those in the remaining 23 boroughs would have stayed closed from 4 January. Meanwhile, new analysis by Imperial College London has confirmed the new variant of coronavirus has a much quicker rate of transmission than the original strain. And an analysis of NHS England data from 23 hospital trusts bythe Health Service Journal,externalshows that Covid-19 is putting intense pressure on adult acute care and general beds, as well as those in intensive care. It found that more than a third of these beds were occupied by patients with Covid-19 on Tuesday, and in three trusts - North Middlesex in London, and Medway and Dartford and Gravesham in Kent - the figure was more than half. Based on the recent rise in numbers, the analysis suggests that all acute and general beds might soon be filled with Covid-19 patients. What can you still do in tier four? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Cordery said the surging transmission and death rates were ""incredibly hard to deal with"". ""When we are seeing major London trusts saying they are under pressure, that's when we know we're in a very challenging space,"" she said. A leading intensive care doctor has urged people to follow restrictions until the vaccination programme is fully rolled out. Prof Anthony Gordon, of Imperial College, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There is light at the end of the tunnel so I would urge people to hold on for these few more months while the vaccination programme makes that difference and then we can truly get back to normal. ""But we can't overrun the health service because this will just lead to thousands more deaths."" Adrian Boyle, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to follow guidance on hand washing, social distancing and face coverings to stop the ""entirely preventable"" spread of the virus. Dr Boyle said staff are ""tired"" and at risk of ""burnout"", having ""worked really hard over the summer"" and ""put up with a lot of disruption"". ""This time people are frustrated, this is now an entirely preventable disease, we know what we did in spring made a lot of this go away. There's also now a vaccine,"" he added. More than three-quarters of England is currently under the strictest tier four - ""stay at home"" - coronavirus measures, and other parts of the country have joined higher tiers. Mainland Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are under lockdown. There are also concerns the added pressures of rising numbers of Covid patients seen at London hospitals have begun to spread across the country. Speaking on Today, Dr Alison Pittard, of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said it was ""only a matter of time before it starts to spread to other parts of country"", adding that ""we're already starting to see that"". She stressed it was ""really important that we try and stop the transmission in the community because that translates into hospital admissions"". It comes as almost half the major hospital trusts in England are said to be dealing with more Covid-19 patients than at the peak of the first wave in April. And pressure has been so great on some hospitals in London and south-east England that some patients have been moved out of the area. London's Nightingale emergency hospitalis ready to admit patients, the NHS has said, while other sites currently not in use are being readied. However, Mike Adams, director of the Royal College of Nursing, questioned whether there were the staff available to run the hospital. ""Nursing is already stretched beyond capacity so there is no magic pile of nurses we can call upon,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""I think the real battle is reducing the spread of the virus and getting the vaccine rolled out."" Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? How do the Covid vaccines compare? 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs The new coronavirus variant has driven a big rise in cases, with the worst effects felt so far in London. Researchers at Imperial College London haveconfirmed it increases the R number- the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to - by about 0.4 to 0.7. The UK's latest R number has been estimated at between 1.1 and 1.3. It needs to be below 1.0 for the number of cases to start falling. Prof Axel Gandy, from the statistic section of Imperial College London, told the Today programme this higher rate of infection means that transmission of the disease would have tripled even during England's November lockdown conditions. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading The hunt is now on to find new ways to slow the spread of coronavirus, with the rules on mask wearing potentially coming up for review. Behavioural science group SPI-B (Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours), which reports to the Sage group of government advisers, has said that mandatory face coverings may be necessary in a wider number of settings, such as in workplaces and possibly outdoors. However, Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told BBC Radio 4's World at One he was not convinced a move towards making the wearing of face coverings mandatory outdoors would make ""much difference"" to transmission rates. He said the ""bigger problem"" was people touching their face covering or wearing it incorrectly, adding ministers should focus on ensuring people knew how to wear them and to change and wash them regularly. The rollout of the newly approved Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will begin on Monday, almost a month after the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Second doses of either will now take place within 12 weeks rather than 21 days as had been initially planned with the Pfizer vaccine.

"London's Nightingale Hospital is ready to admit patients as hospitals in the capital struggle, the NHS has said. The Excel Centre site in east London has been ""reactivated"" amid a rise in the number of Covid-19 patients. Other Nightingale hospital sites across England are also being readied, with the UK recording arecord daily rise in coronavirus cases. An NHS spokesman said hospitals in London remain under ""significant pressure"". He said: ""In anticipation of pressures rising from the spread of the new variant infection, NHS London were asked to ensure the London Nightingale was reactivated and ready to admit patients as needed, and that process is under way."" Several NHS hospitals in London and the south-east are now reporting they are under extreme pressure as a result of a surge in the number of people falling seriously ill with Covid-19. An email to staff at the Royal London Hospital says they are operating in disaster medicine mode - warning they can no longer provide high-standard critical care. Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? Health workers 'back in eye of storm' How the UK's newest hospital was built in nine days Nightingale hospitals in Manchester, Bristol and Harrogate are in use currently for non-Covid patients, the spokesman added. The Exeter site received its first Covid patients in November when it began accepting those transferred from the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust, which was described as ""very busy"". He said: ""Covid inpatient numbers are rising sharply so the remaining Nightingales are being readied to admit patients once again should they be needed, in line with best clinical practice developed over the first and second waves of coronavirus."" Senior intensive care doctor Prof Hugh Montgomery warned those who fail to follow the rules on social distancing, hand washing and wearing a face covering""have blood on their hands"". NHS England medical director Stephen Powis has described the Nightingale hospitals as ""our insurance policy, there as our last resort"". London's Nightingale hospital was built in nine days, with the help of hundreds of soldiers He told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday: ""We asked all the Nightingale hospitals a few weeks ago to be ready to take patients if that was required. ""Indeed, some of them are already doing that, in Manchester taking step-down patients, in Exeter managing Covid patients, and in other places managing diagnostics, for instance. ""Our first steps though, in managing the extra demands on the NHS, are to expand capacity within existing hospitals - that's the best way to use our staff.""

"Researchers have been tracking changes to the ""spike"" of the virus The new variant of Covid-19 is ""hugely"" more transmissible than the virus's previous version, a study has found. It concludes the new variant increases theReproduction or R numberby between 0.4 and 0.7. The UK's latest R number has been estimated at between 1.1 and 1.3. It needs to be below 1.0 for the number of cases to start falling. Prof Axel Gandy of London's Imperial College said the differences between the viruses types was ""quite extreme"". ""There is a huge difference in how easily the variant virus spreads,"" he told BBC News. ""This is the most serious change in the virus since the epidemic began,""  he added. The Imperial College study suggests transmission of the new variant tripled during England's November lockdown while the previous version was reduced by a third. Cases of Covid-19 have begun to increase rapidly during the second spike, and the number of cases recorded in a single day reached a new high on Thursday. New coronavirus variant: What do we know? Cases of new variant appear worldwide Early results indicated that the virus was spreading more quickly among under-20s, particularly among secondary school age children. But the very latest data indicates that it was spreading quickly across all age groups, according to Prof Gandy who was a member of the research team. ""One possible explanation is that the early data was collected during the time of the November lockdown where schools were open and the activities of the adult population were more restricted. We are seeing now that the new virus has increased infectiousness across all age groups."" Prof Jim Naismith, of Oxford University, said he believed that the new findings indicated that even tougher restrictions would soon be needed. ""The data from Imperial represent the best analysis to date and imply that the measures we have employed to date, would - with the new virus - fail to reduce the R number to below 1. ""In simpler terms, unless we do something different the new virus strain is going to continue to spread, more infections, more hospitalisations and more deaths."" The R number is the average number of people an infected person infects. If it is above 1 the epidemic is growing. The most chilling finding from this piece of research is that the November lockdown in England, hard though it was for many people, would not have stopped the variant form of the virus spreading. The same severe restrictions that saw cases of the previous version of the virus fall by a third, would see a tripling of the new variant. This is why there has been such a sudden tightening of restrictions across the country. It is unclear whether the current restrictions will be enough to control the spread of the virus. Given the fact that it has taken two lockdowns to stop the earlier version of the virus overwhelming the NHS, many scientists fear that further tightening will be necessary. Infection levels will begin to drop as enough people are vaccinated. But until then it is now more important than ever for people to follow social distancing guidelines, wear masks where required and to regularly wash their hands. The new year brings with it hope of a more normal life in the next few months but also a new form of the virus that all of us will have to combat in the coming days and weeks. Professor Lawrence Young, of Warwick University, said early indications suggested that vaccines would be effective against the new form of the virus. ""Variants virus have been around since the beginning of the pandemic and are a product of the natural process by which viruses develop and adapt to their hosts as they replicate. ""Most of these mutations have no effect on the behaviour of the virus but very occasionally they can improve the ability of the virus to infect and/or become more resistant to the body's immune response."" Further research is needed to understand why the variant is spreading so quickly. But early indications are that vaccines should be effective against it. The new virus has been designated ""Variant of Concern 202012/01"" or VOC by Public Health England. It was detected in November and thought to have originated in the south-east England in September. There is no evidence to suggest that it is more deadly, but it will increase the number of cases which in turn will add further pressure on the NHS. The variant can now be found across the UK, except Northern Ireland, but it is heavily concentrated in London, as well as south-east and eastern England. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

"The crowd at Edinburgh Castle dispersed after police arrived Crowds of several hundred people gathered at Edinburgh Castle to see in the new year despite police and government warnings to stay away. People sang and danced before dispersing when several police vans and cars drove on to the castle esplanade. Most Scots heeded warnings to hold Hogmanay celebrations at home with household members. There were no midnight fireworks at the castle, but a display was held at the Wallace Monument in Stirling. UK sees in 2021 with fireworks and light show A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""We were aware of gatherings at Edinburgh Castle and Calton Hill around midnight on Hogmanay. ""Officers safely engaged with those in attendance and explained the current government regulations resulting in the groups dispersing without incident."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Thursday that there should be ""no gatherings, no house parties and no first footing"" at Hogmanay. All of mainland Scotland and Skye are under level four restrictions, while the other islands are in level three. Details have meanwhile emerged of another police enforcement action against a group who gathered at a rented property in Aberfoyle during the festive period. Police Scotland confirmed that 32 people were charged with culpable and reckless conduct after officers were called out on 27 December. According to the Scottish Sun,,externalthe group had travelled from Glasgow but police were tipped off by locals who spotted vehicles parked outside the property. People in Scotland were urged to stay at home and celebrate the new year with their families At Edinburgh Castle, one Hogmanay tradition endured as a lone piper played in the new year at midnight. With the capital's traditional new year party cancelled, the organisers of its annual Hogmanay celebration instead releaseda series of ""drone swarm"" videostitled Fare Well. The display featured a swarm of 150 illuminated drones forming symbols and animals in a ""beautiful ode to Scotland"". Each video was narrated by actor David Tennant and included verses written by Scotland's official poet, makar Jackie Kay. While they appear to be flying above landmarks like Edinburgh Castle, the drones were flown elsewhere before being edited into other footage. Drones write a message in the sky above the Forth Bridge The streets of central Edinburgh were quiet, in contrast to last year's Hogmanay celebrations when about 100,000 visitors attended the street party with live performances from Idlewild and Mark Ronson in Princes Street Gardens. Elsewhere in the UK this year a fireworks and light display, including tributes to NHS staff, was held over the River Thames in London, but people were also told to stay at home rather than go out and celebrate.

"Primary schools in 23 London boroughs will remain closed All primary schools in London will remain closed for the start of the new term, the government has confirmed. London mayor Sadiq Khan said the government had ""finally seen sense and U-turned"" on its plan to allow pupils in some areas to return on Monday. Leaders of nine London local authorities had written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson urging him to rethink the decision. Mr Williamson said the city-wide closures were ""a last resort"". The government said it had decided all primary schools in the capital would be required to provide remote learning after a further review of coronavirus transmission rates. Vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will continue to attend school, the government said. Early years care, alternative provision and special schools will remain open, it added. Schools in nine London boroughs and the City of London district had been set to reopen - while those in the remaining 23 boroughs would have stayed closed from 4 January. The decision was criticised and branded ""illogical"" by councillors and residents in the affected areas, who called for primary schools across the capital to move to online learning until 18 January. They pointed out that Covid-19 infection rates were higher in some boroughs told to reopen schools than in others where they were not. In atweet,external, Mr Khan said a city-wide closure was ""the right decision"" and thanked education minister Nick Gibb for ""our constructive conversations over the past two days"". ""The government's original decision was ridiculous and has been causing immense confusion for parents, teachers and staff across the capital,"" Mr Khan said. ""It is right that all schools in London are treated the same, and that no primary schools in London will be forced to open on Monday"". What's happening with schools in January? School closures will be 'as short as possible' Should London be split into different Covid tiers? Coronavirus cases in London Dan Thorpe, leader of Greenwich council, said he was ""absolutely delighted"" to hear Mr Williamson had ""finally climbed down and reversed his decision"". Kingston Council leader Caroline Kerr said she was ""dismayed"" at the government's handling of situation while a council statement added: ""It never made sense that neighbouring boroughs were being instructed to have different arrangements despite having similar rates of infection."" Islington council leader Richard Watts said waiting until New Year's day to announce the further closures was ""unacceptable"". He said the decision ""should have been made weeks ago, as the public health situation became clear"". Mary Bousted, of the National Education Union, said the government was right to reverse its ""obviously nonsensical position"". ""What is right for London is right for the rest of the country,"" she said, and she called on ministers to ""do their duty"" by closing all primary and secondary schools nationwide for at least two weeks. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, accused the government of damaging public confidence with a ""confusing and last-minute approach"". ""Just at the moment when we need some decisive leadership, the government is at sixes and sevens,"" he said. Shadow education secretary Kate Green said the move was ""yet another government U-turn creating chaos for parents just two days before the start of term"". ""Gavin Williamson must still clarify why some schools in tier 4 are closing and what the criteria for reopening will be,"" she said. Gavin Williamson said closing schools across London was a ""last resort"" In a statement, Mr Williamson said children's education and wellbeing remained ""a national priority"" and moving the whole of London to remote education ""really is a last resort and a temporary solution"". ""We will continue keep the list of local authorities under review, and reopen classrooms as soon as we possibly can,"" he said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the situation in London had continued to worsen in the past week and infections and hospital admissions had risen sharply. ""While our priority is to keep as many children as possible in school, we have to strike a balance between education and infection rates and pressures on the NHS,"" he said. The Department for Education had previously said decisions on school closures and openings were based on new infections, positivity rates, and pressures on the NHS. A spokeswoman for the department said: ""In response to concerning data about the spread of coronavirus, we have implemented the contingency framework for education in a small number of areas of the country, requiring schools to provide remote learning to all but vulnerable and critical worker children and exam years.

"The song was written while George Michael (right) watched a football match Wham!'s Last Christmas has topped the UK singles chart for the first time, 36 years after it was first released. The festive classic was streamed 9.2 million times over the last week, knocking LadBaby's Don't Stop Me Eating off the top spot. First released in December 1984, George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley's song was held off the top spot by Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas? Ridgeley said he was ""somewhat amazed"" the record had now reached number one. He said he was ""delighted"" and ""profoundly pleased"" at the news, ""albeit 36 years after its first release which is, perhaps more than anything, a testament to its timeless appeal and charm"". ""It is a fitting tribute to George's song-writing genius and one of which he would have been immensely proud and utterly thrilled,"" Ridgeley added. Since the song was released in 1984, it has returned to the top 10 a further six times. Mariah's Christmas anthem finally tops the charts LadBaby bags third straight Christmas number one Fans had previously launched a campaign to get it to number one in 2017, to mark the first anniversary of George Michael'suntimely death on Christmas Day 2016. But it only reached number two - and was thwarted by Ed Sheeran's Perfect. Its lyrics also inspired Dame Emma Thompson to write the movie Last Christmas, which was released in cinemas last Christmas. Last Christmas was written by George Michael in his childhood bedroom in February 1984, ""and as far as I was concerned it was a number one"",he told Smash Hits in 1986.,external Inspiration struck out of the blue, while the singer was watching a football match at his parents' house in Hertfordshire. ""We'd had a bite to eat and were sitting together relaxing with the television on in the background when, almost unnoticed, George disappeared upstairs for an hour or so,"" recalled Ridgeley in his 2017 memoir. ""When he came back down, such was his excitement, it was as if he had discovered gold which, in a sense, he had. ""We went to his old room, the room in which we had spent hours as kids recording pastiches of radio shows and jingles... and he played me the introduction and the beguiling, wistful chorus melody to Last Christmas. It was a moment of wonder."" Wham! in March 1984, shortly after Last Christmas was written The song was subsequently recorded in the middle of August at London's Advision Studios, which Michael plastered in Christmas decorations to set the mood. The cheesy-but-cheerful video was shot later that year in Switzerland, featuring Wham's backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie and model Kathy Hill. Alongside its famous chunky knitwear, and central role for a silver brooch, the video also marked the final time Michael would be seen without his trademark designer stubble. Allow YouTube content?

The singer jetted back from the film shoot to record his vocals for Do They Know It's Christmas - which would eventually hold Wham!'s song off the top spot. In a gesture of solidarity with Band Aid, however, the duo donated all the royalties from Last Christmas to Ethiopian famine relief. At the time of its initial release, Last Christmas was part of a Wham! double A-side single, along with Everything She Wants. Although immediately after Christmas, radio stations started playing Everything She Wants and the band did a Top of the Pops appearance to promote it, the colossal sales of Do They Know It's Christmas meant it was never to top the chart at the time. Prior to today's chart, Last Christmas was the UK's biggest-selling single never to have reached number one - accumulating 1.9 million sales across its lifetime, according to the Official Chart Company. That title now passes on to Maroon 5's Moves Like Jagger (1.55 million sales), which was a number two hit in 2011. But Last Christmas does now hold a new chart record - for the longest time taken for a single to reach number one. The previous record-holder was Tony Christie's (Is This The Way To) Amarillo? which had a 34-year gap between its original release and topping the chart for Comic Relief in 2005. Wham!'s record is the second long-toothed classic to claim chart glory in recent weeks, after Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You reached number one in December, 26 years after its release. Christmas songs continue to dominate this week's chart countdown, with 28 festive tracks inside the top 40. This video can not be played All I Want For Christmas Is You: Meet the man behind Mariah Carey's festive classic However, as festive streams decline, some other songs have seen their fortunes turn around - with Little Mix's Sweet Melody returning to the top 10; and Ed Sheeran's new single Afterglow reaching a new peak of 13. In the albums chart, Michael BublÃ©'s Christmas album returned to number one for the first time in nine years, displacing Paul McCartney's latest record, McCartney III. Taylor Swift's second surprise album of 2020, Evermore, held steady at number two; while Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia jumped 15 places to number three after featuring prominently ina number of end-of-year polls. Correction: An earlier version of this article erroneously stated that Martin Kemp of Spandau Ballet made a cameo in the video for Last Christmas.

"Officers dispersed the party at the Grade II* listed church before midnight A 500-year-old church was damaged during an illegal New Year's Eve party at the venue. All Saints' Church in East Horndon,external, near Brentwood, was broken into before crowds entered, Essex Police said. Officers were threatened and had objects thrown at them as they dispersed hundreds of people and seized equipment, the force said. Two men from Harlow, aged 27 and 22, and a 35-year-old from Southwark were arrested. They were held on suspicion of public order and drugs offences. Astrid Gillespie, a volunteer with the Friends of All Saints', said event organisers had smashed a window to put in an extractor fan unit and wired sound equipment into the church's fuse box. She said: ""It was a professional set-up, they'd hired portable loos, they had a bar area where you had to exchange tokens... obviously it's a mess. ""It's such a beautiful church, to find out it's been damaged is devastating."" The conservation group believes it will cost at least Â£1,000 to repair the Tudor building. Essex is in England'stop tier four of coronavirus restrictionsand onWednesday declared a major incident over virus cases. Equipment was seized and fines issued over three illegal parties broken up by officers Police later dispersed about 100 people at an illegal party at an abandoned warehouse in Brentwood and made two arrests.

"Primary schools in 23 London boroughs will remain closed All primary schools in London will remain closed for the start of the new term, the government has confirmed. London mayor Sadiq Khan said the government had ""finally seen sense and U-turned"" on its plan to allow pupils in some areas to return on Monday. Leaders of nine London local authorities had written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson urging him to rethink the decision. Mr Williamson said the city-wide closures were ""a last resort"". The government said it had decided all primary schools in the capital would be required to provide remote learning after a further review of coronavirus transmission rates. Vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will continue to attend school, the government said. Early years care, alternative provision and special schools will remain open, it added. Schools in nine London boroughs and the City of London district had been set to reopen - while those in the remaining 23 boroughs would have stayed closed from 4 January. The decision was criticised and branded ""illogical"" by councillors and residents in the affected areas, who called for primary schools across the capital to move to online learning until 18 January. They pointed out that Covid-19 infection rates were higher in some boroughs told to reopen schools than in others where they were not. In atweet,external, Mr Khan said a city-wide closure was ""the right decision"" and thanked education minister Nick Gibb for ""our constructive conversations over the past two days"". ""The government's original decision was ridiculous and has been causing immense confusion for parents, teachers and staff across the capital,"" Mr Khan said. ""It is right that all schools in London are treated the same, and that no primary schools in London will be forced to open on Monday"". What's happening with schools in January? School closures will be 'as short as possible' Should London be split into different Covid tiers? Coronavirus cases in London Dan Thorpe, leader of Greenwich council, said he was ""absolutely delighted"" to hear Mr Williamson had ""finally climbed down and reversed his decision"".

"This video can not be played London's new year celebrations featured a message of hope from David Attenborough The UK has seen off 2020 and celebrated the dawn of 2021 with a fireworks and light display over London that included tributes to NHS staff. Revellers were not able to ring in the New Year in the usual way because of the coronavirus pandemic, with people instead told to stay at home. Police had to break up various parties and events across England overnight. Forces have handed out hundreds of fines, with several issuing the maximum Â£10,000 to event organisers. Much of the UK saw in the new year while under lockdown rules, with about 44 million people in England - or 78% of the population - in tier four, the top level of Covid restrictions. Mainland Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are also under lockdown. Although people were warned not to attend any parties outside their own homes, there were many around the country who ignored the rules. The Metropolitan Police said police attended 58 parties and unlicensed music events in breach of tier four rules across London overnight, the vast majority of which ended when police intervened, they added. Fixed penalty fines were given to 217 people while five others could be fined Â£10,000 for organising large gatherings. The police force said four other people were arrested for breaching Covid regulations by gathering in central London. Elsewhere, other forces also broke up parties and handed out hundreds of fines. They included Greater Manchester Police, which issued 105 fixed penalty notices at house parties and larger gatherings. And Leicestershire Police had to issue six on-the-spot Â£10,000 fines to party organisers. In Essex,hundreds of people were dispersed from an illegal New Year's Eve partyat a church, while Lancashire Policebroke up a partyin Hyndburn, near Blackburn, attended by 80. Meanwhile, in Scotland, Edinburgh's traditional Hogmanay street party was cancelled, with videos ofa drone displayreleased instead. The series of videos showed a swarm of 150 lit-up drones over the Scottish Highlands and Edinburgh were released, which organisers said it was the largest drone show ever produced in the UK. Despite the cancellation of Edinburgh's traditional Hogmanay celebration - which normally attracts 100,000 people on the city's streets - there were some people who ignored the pleas to stay at home. Crowds of several hundred people gathered at Edinburgh Castle to see in the new year. They sang Auld Lang Syne and danced before eventually dispersing when several police vans and cars pulled on to the castle esplanade. An anti-lockdown protest and New Year's Eve celebration was also held in London People cross Hungerford Bridge in London on New Year's Eve On New Year's Eve, Health Secretary Matt Hancock called on people to take ""personal responsibility"" and stay at home to avoid spreading Covid-19. What can you still do in tier four? UK coronavirus cases up to 55,892 on Thursday London's 10-minute display over the Thames aired on the BBC at midnight, and began with a poem which addressed the pandemic, that said: ""In the year of 2020 a new virus came our way; We knew what must be done and so to help we hid away."" Light projections lit up the sky over the O2 Arena, including the NHS logo in a heart accompanied by a child's voice saying: ""Thank you NHS heroes"". The show also recognised Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised Â£33m for the NHS by walking laps of his garden and the Black Lives Matter movement. One 2020 phenomena - working from home - was represented with a mute logo backed by a voiceover saying ""You're on mute"". The display ended with a call from Sir David Attenborough about the need for action on climate change. London mayor Sadiq Khan said the display had reflected the resolve of Londoners to endure 300 drones were used in the display to create images in the sky In a speech being broadcast on BBC One between Doctor Who and EastEnders this evening, Sir David will say that this ""could be a year for positive change - for ourselves, for our planet and for the wonderful creatures with which we share it"". Despite the ""challenging"" times we live in, ""the reactions to these extraordinary times has proved that when we work together there is no limit to what we can accomplish"", he will say, as he looks ahead to the United Nations Climate Change Conference later this year. The sounds of a video conference call starting up were played Much of London was far quieter than usual Edinburgh's streets were largely empty, with Police Scotland warning against Hogmanay gatherings Official figures showed 10.75 million viewers watched the 2021 New Year celebrations on BBC One. It's down from the 11.18m who saw in the start of 2020 on the channel. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was proud of the show, which he said ""paid tribute to our NHS heroes and the way that Londoners continue to stand together"". ""We showed how our capital and the UK have made huge sacrifices to support one another through these difficult times, and how they will continue to do so as the vaccine is rolled out."" Usually, around 100,000 people pack into the streets around Victoria Embankment to watch the New Year's Eve fireworks. This video can not be played Drone swarm lights up Hogmanay skies In his New Year's message, the Archbishop of Canterbury said he saw ""reasons to be hopeful for the year ahead"" despite the ""tremendous pain and sadness"" brought by 2020. The Most Reverend Justin Welby spoke of his experience volunteering as an assistant chaplain at St Thomas' hospital during the pandemic, saying: ""Sometimes the most important thing we do is just sit with people, letting them know they are not alone."" In his message, filmed at the London hospital and broadcast on BBC One on Friday afternoon, he said: ""This crisis has shown us how fragile we are. It has also shown us how to face this fragility. ""Here at the hospital, hope is there in every hand that's held, and every comforting word that's spoken. ""Up and down the country, it's there in every phone call.

"Police tweeted this photo, which appears to show the vehicle severely damaged in the crash Four ponies have been killed in a collision with a vehicle in the New Forest National Park. The animals were hit on Thursday night while licking freshly laid salt on Roger Penny Way, Hampshire Constabulary said. Three ponies died at the scene while a fourth was found dead later a short distance away. In December, three donkeys werekilled on the road, which is a black spot for animal accidents. Mark Ferrett, whose daughter owned the ponies, said the deaths were ""unacceptable"" The crash happened at about 21:00 GMT on a 40mph (64km/h) section of the road north of Brook. The car, a Land Rover Discovery, appears to have been severely damaged in the collision, according to a police tweet, which gave no further details. Mark Ferrett, whose daughter owned the ponies, said the deaths were ""unacceptable"". He said: ""I would favour a reduction in the speed [limit]. Please, everyone needs to slow down and stop this carnage."" The New Forest is one of the largest remaining areas of unenclosed land where commoners' cattle, ponies and donkeys roam throughout the open heath. InÂ 2019, 58 animals were killed and 32 were injured, according to the New Forest National Park Authority. The crash happened on Roger Penny Way, where donkeys, cattle and horses roam freely Andrew Napthine, a New Forest Agister who helps manage the area's free-roaming animals, attended the scene of the crash, and said the male driver was not injured.

"Omar Elabdellaoui is receiving treatment in hospital after an accident with a firework Norway and Galatasaray footballer Omar Elabdellaoui has been injured by a firework during a New Year's Eve celebration. The Norwegian vice-captain's club said he was taken to hospital after ""an unfortunate accident at his home"". He suffered burns to his face and damage to his eyes, the club said, adding that further tests would assess the extent of his injuries. The New Year's Eve incident was one of many involving fireworks in Europe. In Elabdellaoui's case, Turkish reports say a firework exploded in the hand of the 29-year-old defender.

"Staff absences and the new Covid variant are creating a ""challenging situation"" in hospitals, NHS bosses say London hospitals say they are under huge pressure, with whole floors being converted to intensive care wards Emergency Nightingale hospitals are being readied across the country, but experts warn staffing may be a problem Imperial College London analysis confirms the new variant of the virus has a much faster rate of transmission than the original strain Experts defended the UK's new strategy to give more people a first dose of the vaccine, while delaying the second Eight London boroughs have urged ministers to delay the re-opening of primary schools as others move to online teaching It comes as the nation saw in the New Year without traditional parties, amid warnings for people to stay at home Another 53,285 cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK on Friday, and a further 613 deaths Edited by Holly Wallis We're bringing our live coverage of the pandemic to a close now - thanks for joining us. Today's live page was edited by Holly Wallis and Chris Clayton, and written by Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Kathryn Snowdon, Penny Spiller and Alexandra FouchÃ©. We'll be pausing our live coverage for the day soon so here's a summary of the main stories in the UK today: Here are the latest
headlines from around the world: Coronavirus cases are now rising fast again, driven by a new variant of the virus thought to be much more easily transmissible than other strains. The number of Covid-19 patients in hospitals across the UK has also risen sharply in recent weeks and is now above the level seen in the spring. You can check how many cases there are in your areahere. Sir Tom Jones said receiving the Covid-19 vaccine was just like getting a flu jab And back in the UK, Sir Tom Jones revealed that he too has received the coronavirus vaccine, calling it ""one good thing about being 80"". âIâve had my jab already,"" he told TV presenter Jools Holland on the New Year's Eve broadcast of Jools' Annual Hootenanny. âThatâs one good thing about being 80, youâre first in line for the jab. It was fine, it was like getting the flu jab.â Holland jokingly asked if it was a legitimate vaccine and Sir Tom replied: âIt wasnât a black market one. It was the real deal.â Queen Margrethe delivered her New Year's speech before receiving the vaccine Denmarkâs Queen
Margrethe has received the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, the royal
household has announced. The 80-year-old
monarch was given the dose on New Yearâs Day, and will receive the second dose
of the vaccine in three weeks. Queen Margrethe has
had to isolate for much of the past year, cancelling plans for her birthday last
April and traditional events around Christmas and New Year. Her grandson, Prince Christian, tested positive for the coronavirus
in recent weeks and had to self-isolate, although his parents, Crown Prince Frederik and
Crown Princess Mary, and siblings tested negative. The collapse of Debenhams contributed to the retail sector's 180,000 job losses in 2020 Retail analysts have described 2020 asthe worst year for the high street in a quarter of a century, with the pandemic accelerating a move towards online shopping. The Centre for Retail Research said nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost in the UK in 2020, with up to 200,000 more at risk in 2021 as businesses face a cash flow crisis. Some analysts estimate that the pandemic accelerated the shift to online shopping by five to ten years, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Sarah Corker said. Analysis of spending habits also suggests we increased the amount we spent in smaller neighbourhood shopping areas rather than large cities and shopping centres during 2020. With more of us working from home, people spent their money locally and rediscovered local independent stores. Susannah Streeter, market analyst at Hargreaves Landsdown, said bigger retailers needed to focus on the experience they offer - including the ability to try before you buy - if they are to attract customers back when the coronavirus crisis is over. ""Shopping needs to be an enjoyable pastime, not a bun fight amid vast racks of clothes. Reducing retail footprints, while investing in the appeal of an exciting in-store and online seamless experience will be key to attracting newer, younger customers,"" she said. Norway has
announced it is lifting its ban on flights arriving from the UK. Flights will
resume from 16:00 GMT on 2 January, the health ministry announced. Passengers arriving
by plane from the UK will have to fill out a travel registration form and
everyone entering Norway from Saturday must take a Covid-19 test, the ministry
said. Norway was among a
number of countries that halted travel from the UK on 21 December after it emerged
a new variant of the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in south-east England. ""If this strain should spread in Norway, it will probably mean a full lockdown of society,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg said on Thursday. Adam Lambert (left) and Tituss Burgess will bring the TikTok-made musical to life After the worldâs most unusual year comes the worldâs most unusual
musical. Ratatouille the TikTok Musical will be streaming in a few hours, featuring
Queen
singer Adam Lambert, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt star Tituss Burgess and Tony
Award winner Andre De Shields. Theone-off performance,externalwas born out of a short song posted on
TikTok in August by Emily Jacobson, a teacher in New York and fan of the 2007
Pixar film Ratatouille about a rat who dreams of becoming a chef. Her short catchy song about Remy âthe rat of all my dreamsâ was picked
up and given a Broadway-style musical finish by composer Daniel Mertzlufft. His rendition sparked a craze on TikTok with hundreds of other
creators following suit, providing songs for other characters, choreographed
dances and suggested stage designs. The 1 January âshowâ will be accompanied by the 20-piece Broadway
Sinfonietta orchestra and will raise money for The Actors Fund, which has been
supporting performers during the pandemic. You can read more on how this show came about here. The next few weeks could be the most dangerous period for Scotland since March in the fight against Covid, the country's first minister has warned. Nicola Sturgeon said the new variant of the virus was ""accelerating spread"" across Scotland. ""If you first foot someone today, or hug/kiss/handshake them HNY, you are putting yourself, others and the NHS at risk,""she said in a tweet.,external A further 2,539 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Scotland on Friday. The number is slightly down on Thursday's figure, but Sturgeon said cases numbers were still ""worryingly high"". Daily confirmed cases have reached record highs on each of the previous three days.

The force said it had received numerous reports of Covid breaches on New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, North Wales Police said it had reported several breaches of restrictions, with some people travelling from as far as Southampton, Kent and Solihull on New Year's Day. Wales has been in anationwide level four lockdownsince 20 December and travel is only allowed for essential purposes, such as for work and for caring responsibilities. Read more.

Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News Many scientists fear even tougher restrictions than the current tier four are needed The most chilling finding from the Imperial College research on the new coronavirus variant is that the November lockdown in England, hard though it was for many people, would not have stopped the variant form of the virus from spreading. The same severe restrictions that saw cases of the previous version of the virus fall by a third, would see a tripling of the new variant. This is why there has been such a sudden tightening of restrictions across the country. It is unclear whether the current restrictions will be enough to control the spread of the virus. Given the fact that it has taken two lockdowns to stop the earlier version of the virus overwhelming the NHS, many scientists fear that further tightening will be necessary. Infection levels will begin to drop as enough people are vaccinated. But until then it is now more important than ever for people to follow social distancing guidelines, wear masks where required and to regularly wash their hands. The new year brings with it hope of a more normal life in the next few months but also a new form of the virus that all of us will have to combat in the next few weeks. Much of England has been placed in a new top tier of restrictions - tier four - as the new variant spreads Earlier we reported that a study by Imperial College had concludedthe new coronavirus variant is ""hugely"" more transmissible. Now some experts are saying that means even tougher restrictions will soon be needed. Prof Jim Naismith, of Oxford University, said: ""The data from Imperial represent the best analysis to date and imply that the measures we have employed to date, would - with the new virus - fail to reduce the R number to below 1. ""In simpler terms, unless we do something different the new virus strain is going to continue to spread - more infections, more hospitalisations and more deaths."" The R number is the average number of people an infected person passes the virus onto. If it is above 1 the epidemic is growing. Early data suggested that the virus was spreading more quickly among the under-20s, particularly among secondary school age children, but the latest results indicate that it is more infectious in all age groups. Prof Axel Gandy, part of the research team, suggested that it may have appeared to spread more easily among school children simply because the early data was collected during the November lockdown, when adults' movements were restricted but schools remained open. The UK has recorded a further 53,285 coronavirus cases, as well as 613 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of daily cases is slightly down on Thursday's figure of 55,892,which was the highest number on record. Carys BetteleyBBC News Carmarthen showground has been repurposed as a coronavirus testing centre In a cattle market repurposed for a very different mission, a 66-year-old man arrives early and shuts himself in a portable cabin. Chris Jones dons his personal protective equipment (PPE), and prepares for the day ahead before heading to another work station to find out what his day holds in store. This Carmarthenshire barn, with its five lanes for traffic, is being used as a regional coronavirus testing centre. Read more here. A US hospital employee who was said to have intentionally discarded vials of the Moderna vaccine at a medical centre in Wisconsin earlier this week has now been arrested, officials say. The pharmacist, who has not been publicly identified, is suspected of sabotaging more than 500
doses of coronavirus vaccine by deliberately removing them from
cold storage. He is no longer employed by the hospital. It is not clear what his motive may have been. Each vial contains 10 doses. Some of the doses were administered before staff at the Aurora Health medical centre in Grafton, Wisconsin, realised the medication had been spoiled. The remaining 500-plus doses then had to be discarded. Initially, hospital officials thought the error had been made inadvertently, but the individual later acknowledged they had intentionally removed the vaccines from refrigeration, according to a hospital statement released earlier this week.  Japan is facing rising infections but insists the delayed Olympics will go ahead this year The Olympics and Paralympics will go ahead as scheduled in July despite concern over rising coronavirus cases in Japan, the country's prime minister has said. Yoshihide Suga saidthe ""Games will be held this summer"" and will be ""safe and secure"". Infections have surged in Japan in recent days with Tokyo reporting more than 1,000 daily cases for the first time. Japan is responding to cases of the new variant of coronavirus first found in the UK, with Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike warning the number of infections could ""explode"". The Olympics, postponed from summer 2020, are due to begin on 23 July - with the Paralympics following a month later from 24 August. An animal park has closed temporarilyafter finding that most of its visitor bookings were from areas with the tightest coronavirus restrictions. Monkey World in Wool, Dorset, also said workers had been ""unacceptably abused"" when contacting people who had  tried to visit from tier four areas. The site is in a tier three zone, allowing its outdoor areas to remain open. People living under tier four restrictions are only permitted to travel to lower-tier areas for certain specified reasons, such as work, caring responsibilities or emergencies. You can read more on the rules for different tiershere. London's Nightingale hospital was built in just 9 days London's Nightingale Hospital is ready to admit patients,the NHS has said, with the capital's hospitals under increasing pressure as Covid cases rise. However, Mike Adams, director of the Royal College of Nursing, questioned whether there were the staff available to run the hospital. âNursing is already stretched beyond capacity so
there is no magic pile of nurses we can call upon,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. âI think the real battle is reducing the spread of the
virus and getting the vaccine rolled out so we can actually reduce the capacity
of people needing care in any given moment.â London's Nightingale Hospital was opened on 3 April but placed on standby weeks later after fewer than 20 patients were treated there. A fleet of 300 drones joined the usual pyrotechnics this year Although going out wasn't an option for millions of Britons over New Year's Eve,London's annual firework display was watched by slightly fewer people than last year. An average audience of 10.75 million tuned in to the 10-minute display, which combined pyrotechnics with illuminated tributes to NHS staff and notable figures from 2020 created by 300 drones. In January 2020, 11.18 million watched the celebrations. Normally, up to 100,000 people line the streets to see the fireworks in person, but this year the city centre was largely empty. Â© 2025 BBC.

"More than 35,000 people have received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Wales The Covid vaccine programme is at the ""very beginning"" and vaccination rates are increasing, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething has insisted. It follows concerns raised by some politicians over the speed of Welsh vaccine rollout. Initial figures on how many people have received the first Pfizer-BioNTech jab show Wales is slightly behind those vaccinated elsewhere in the UK. Mr Gething said there were likely to be ""small differences between nations"". ""Comparisons are naturally being made on the number of vaccinations administered by the four nations of the UK,"" he said in a ministerial statement to Senedd members. ""Whilst I recognise the data indicates there are other nations ahead of us, the national data presented at this very early stage of the vaccination roll out should be considered provisional and a snapshot of ongoing activity."" When will I get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? How do the vaccines compare? Oxford vaccine: How did they make it so quickly? He said there would be ""lags"" in data being entered, and local factors affecting vaccinations. ""For example the vaccination centre in Cardiff and the Vale was unable to operate for two days because of a virus outbreak linked to the site,"" he added. More than 35,000 people have now received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in Wales, including healthcare workers who work in Wales but live over the border in England. Almost 13,000 of these vaccines were given in the past week. The number of vaccinations in Wales up until 27 December account for 1.12% of the Welsh population. In England, 1.4% have received a jab, while in Scotland it is 1.7%, and 1.6% in Northern Ireland. The Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies flagged his concerns about the vaccine delivery programme on Thursday. ""Three weeks ago, the first Covid-19 vaccine was given in Wales, and since that time we have sadly seen confusion and hope drop away,"" he said. ""Many people over 80 in Wales were desperately waiting for their appointment to do their bit and have the vaccine but as we quickly learnt they would have to wait longer,"" he said. But the health minister said daily vaccination rates were ""increasing across Wales"". The focus is on delivering vaccines effectively and safely, says Vaughan Gething ""Looking ahead, all health boards are preparing for significant expansion in capacity from the beginning of January,"" added Mr Gething. He said the new Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved earlier this week would be available from some GPs in Wales from Monday. ""This is only the very beginning of what will be a programme spanning many months,"" he said. ""Whilst the urgency and priority required is clear to all, we must also have some patience and allow the NHS to do what it does so well. ""My focus, and that of the NHS, is on delivering the vaccine programme quickly but also effectively, safely and equitably."" The Welsh Government has also confirmed it will be following the latest advice from medical advisers on introducing a 12-week gap between the two doses of vaccines needed, for both types of approved jabs. All four chief medical officers in the UK have supported the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which said the focus should be on giving at-risk people the first dose of whichever vaccine they receive. ""It will ensure that more at-risk people are able to get protection from a vaccine in the coming weeks and months, reducing deaths and starting to ease pressure on our NHS,"" said Mr Gething. Vaccinations started earlier in December after regulators approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine Plaid Cymru has called on the Welsh Government to ask the UK government to publish evidence to justify increasing the period for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. In a letter to Mr Gething, the party's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the ""sudden switch"" represented ""a very significant departure"" from previous guidelines. He added there were ""very real concerns"" that a longer delay between doses ""could significantly decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine"". 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs Wales to get new vaccine doses next week Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rollout to start next week Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine approved for use in UK At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played Nativity petrol bomber: Reward offer to catch Monmouthshire culprit A Â£2,500 reward has been offered after a nativity scene was petrol-bombed on Christmas Eve. The scene in Raglan, Monmouthshire, had been installed in a bus shelter for families to enjoy over Christmas. The fire destroyed statues of a shepherd, Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus - with only the three wise men surviving as they stood outside the shelter. Miguel Santiago, of the Beaufort Hotel which funded the Â£10,000 scene, said the attack was ""really disappointing"". Jesus stolen from nativity scene for third time How schools managed to save the Christmas nativity ""I was in the hotel when I saw the fire and I went into panic mode,"" he said. ""It was about 21:45 on Christmas Eve when it all happened and I ended up using nine extinguishers to put it out."" The scene cost Â£10,000 to construct The wooden nativity was funded by the hotel and put together by retired theatre design lecturer Liz Friendship. Ms Friendship said the festive scene had also been targeted by thieves in the past. ""In 2018 Mary was taken, in 2019 two shepherds were stolen and never came back, and in 2020 it's burnt down. ""It's now just three kings staring at the bus stop. It's very sad."" The scene was in ruins following the petrol bomb attack Villagers are now appealing for help to catch the suspects responsible for the Christmas crime. Mr Santiago added: ""It's a shame because so much effort went into putting it together this year. ""We added three kings which really made it a great sight, we made sure the figures couldn't be taken by fixing them down. ""It's really disappointing that this has happened but the locals have been great and we will be back next year with a bigger and better nativity."" A spokeswoman for Gwent Police said: ""Officers are investigating a report of criminal damage to a nativity scene on the High Street, in Raglan on Christmas Eve. ""It has been reported that fire damage was caused to the set at approximately 9.45pm on the evening of Thursday 24th December 2020. ""The scene that belonged to the Beaufort Hotel was totally damaged as a result."" Anyone with information should contact police on 101, she said.

"This video can not be played Parents and teachers have criticised the closure decisions Nine London boroughs have written to the education secretary asking him to reverse plans to reopen primary schools in some areas. About a million primary school pupilswill not return to lessonsnext week in a bid to cut Covid transmission rates. However, schools in 10 London boroughs are due to remain open. In the letter, the leaders said they were ""struggling to understand the rationale"" behind the idea as pupils and teachers moved between boroughs. The government has said the measure would be reviewed fortnightly. What's happening with schools in January? School closures will be 'as short as possible' Should London be split into different Covid tiers? Coronavirus cases in London All primary schools had been due to fully reopen on 4 January but under government plans those in 23 London boroughs will remain closed. However, schools in the City of London, Camden, Greenwich, Hackney, Haringey, Harrow, Islington, Kingston, Lambeth and Lewisham will open. Primary schools in 23 London boroughs will remain closed The letter to Gavin Williamson has been signed by leaders of all of those boroughs apart from Kingston. It has also been signed by the City of London's policy chair. It calls for primary school pupils across the capital to ""move to online learning until 18 January"", apart from vulnerable children and those of key workers. ""The omission of 10 boroughs ignores the deep interconnectedness of our city, and the many thousands of teachers and students that study or teach in one borough and live in another,"" the letter states. The councils also said they had received legal advice that omitting some councils from the list of areas told to take teaching online ""is unlawful on a number of grounds and can be challenged in court"". Richard Watts, leader of Islington Council, told the BBC there ""seems to be no reason at all to look at this on a borough by borough basis"". ""The entirety of the rest of the government's handling of the pandemic has rightly treated London as a single entity and this is the first time anyone... has tried to implement different public health measures in different boroughs,"" he said. In astatement,externalDan Thorpe, leader of the Royal borough of Greenwich, accused the government of providing ""a lack of clarity and answers"", adding that the situation was ""causing uncertainty and concern among our schools, families, carers, and undoubtedly children and young people"". Although Kingston Council did not sign the letter,leader Caroline Kerr said,externalreopening primary schools in the borough ""doesn't make any sense"" and that they were ""urgently seeking clarity on the reasoning for the decision"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called the plans ""nonsensical"" and has also written to the government calling for a ""delay to all London schools opening until mid-January"". Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the National Education Union, said the education secretary ""must listen to the leaders of the community, he must listen to school staff and he must listen to the general public who are all telling him that it is not safe to reopen schools on Monday"". The Department for Education has previously said decisions on school closures and openings were based on new infections, positivity rates, and pressures on the NHS. A spokeswoman for the department said: ""In response to concerning data about the spread of coronavirus, we have implemented the contingency framework for education in a small number of areas of the country, requiring schools to provide remote learning to all but vulnerable and critical worker children and exam years. ""Decisions on which areas will be subject to the contingency framework are based on close work with PHE, the NHS, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and across government.""

"Hospitals are under increased pressure amid rising coronavirus cases The next few weeks will be ""nail-bitingly difficult"" for the NHS, hospital bosses have warned. Staff absences and the new Covid variant are creating a ""challenging situation"", Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, said. Doctors are urging the public to ""take it seriously and follow the rules"" to protect the health service. The year started with53,285 more Covid cases and 613 deaths,externalbeing reported. The day's figures do not include data fromNorthern Ireland or Wales, or the numbers of deaths from Scotland,external- as these are not being published on certain days during the Christmas and New Year period. It comes after the UK reported its highest daily cases on Thursday, with a record55,892 infections. On Friday evening, the government confirmed thatall primary schools in London would remain closed for the start of the new term, following a review of Covid transmission rates. From Monday, all schools in the capital will now be required to provide remote learning. Primaries in nine London boroughs and the City of London district had been set to reopen - while those in the remaining 23 boroughs would have stayed closed from 4 January. Meanwhile, new analysis by Imperial College London has confirmed the new variant of coronavirus has a much quicker rate of transmission than the original strain. And an analysis of NHS England data from 23 hospital trusts bythe Health Service Journal,externalshows that Covid-19 is putting intense pressure on adult acute care and general beds, as well as those in intensive care. It found that more than a third of these beds were occupied by patients with Covid-19 on Tuesday, and in three trusts - North Middlesex in London, and Medway and Dartford and Gravesham in Kent - the figure was more than half. Based on the recent rise in numbers, the analysis suggests that all acute and general beds might soon be filled with Covid-19 patients. What can you still do in tier four? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Cordery said the surging transmission and death rates were ""incredibly hard to deal with"". ""When we are seeing major London trusts saying they are under pressure, that's when we know we're in a very challenging space,"" she said. A leading intensive care doctor has urged people to follow restrictions until the vaccination programme is fully rolled out. Prof Anthony Gordon, of Imperial College, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There is light at the end of the tunnel so I would urge people to hold on for these few more months while the vaccination programme makes that difference and then we can truly get back to normal. ""But we can't overrun the health service because this will just lead to thousands more deaths."" Adrian Boyle, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to follow guidance on hand washing, social distancing and face coverings to stop the ""entirely preventable"" spread of the virus. Dr Boyle said staff are ""tired"" and at risk of ""burnout"", having ""worked really hard over the summer"" and ""put up with a lot of disruption"". ""This time people are frustrated, this is now an entirely preventable disease, we know what we did in spring made a lot of this go away. There's also now a vaccine,"" he added. More than three-quarters of England is currently under the strictest tier four - ""stay at home"" - coronavirus measures, and other parts of the country have joined higher tiers. Mainland Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are under lockdown. There are also concerns the added pressures of rising numbers of Covid patients seen at London hospitals have begun to spread across the country. Speaking on Today, Dr Alison Pittard, of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said it was ""only a matter of time before it starts to spread to other parts of country"", adding that ""we're already starting to see that"". She stressed it was ""really important that we try and stop the transmission in the community because that translates into hospital admissions"". It comes as almost half the major hospital trusts in England are said to be dealing with more Covid-19 patients than at the peak of the first wave in April. And pressure has been so great on some hospitals in London and south-east England that some patients have been moved out of the area. London's Nightingale emergency hospitalis ready to admit patients, the NHS has said, while other sites currently not in use are being readied. However, Mike Adams, director of the Royal College of Nursing, questioned whether there were the staff available to run the hospital. ""Nursing is already stretched beyond capacity so there is no magic pile of nurses we can call upon,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""I think the real battle is reducing the spread of the virus and getting the vaccine rolled out."" Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? How do the Covid vaccines compare? 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs The new coronavirus variant has driven a big rise in cases, with the worst effects felt so far in London. Researchers at Imperial College London haveconfirmed it increases the R number- the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to - by about 0.4 to 0.7. The UK's latest R number has been estimated at between 1.1 and 1.3. It needs to be below 1.0 for the number of cases to start falling. Prof Axel Gandy, from the statistic section of Imperial College London, told the Today programme this higher rate of infection means that transmission of the disease would have tripled even during England's November lockdown conditions. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading The hunt is now on to find new ways to slow the spread of coronavirus, with the rules on mask wearing potentially coming up for review. Behavioural science group SPI-B (Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours), which reports to the Sage group of government advisers, has said that mandatory face coverings may be necessary in a wider number of settings, such as in workplaces and possibly outdoors. However, Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told BBC Radio 4's World at One he was not convinced a move towards making the wearing of face coverings mandatory outdoors would make ""much difference"" to transmission rates. He said the ""bigger problem"" was people touching their face covering or wearing it incorrectly, adding ministers should focus on ensuring people knew how to wear them and to change and wash them regularly. The rollout of the newly approved Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will begin on Monday, almost a month after the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Second doses of either will now take place within 12 weeks rather than 21 days as had been initially planned with the Pfizer vaccine.

"Tampon tax activist Laura Coryton says scrapping the tampon tax is an important move âending a symptom of sexismâ The 5% rate of VAT on sanitary products - referred to as the ""tampon tax"" - will be abolished in the UK from 1 January. EU law required members to tax tampons and sanitary towels at 5%, treating period products as non-essential. Chancellor Rishi Sunak committed toscrapping the tax in his March Budget. Campaigners welcomed the end to what they called a ""sexist tax"" with activist Laura Coryton saying it was ""about ending a symptom of sexism"". The UK was able to get rid of the tax now because it is no longer subject to European Union rules on sanitary products. The EU is itself in the process of abolishing the tampon tax. In 2018 the European Commission published proposals to change the VAT rules, which would give countries the right to stop taxing tampons and other period products, but the move has not yet been agreed by all members. The Republic of Ireland has zero VAT on sanitary products as the rate was in place prior to EU legislation imposing the 5% minimum VAT rate on EU members. Ms Coryton, 27, whobegan campaigning to end the tampon tax,externalwhen she was 21, told the BBC the move ""challenged the negative message that this tax sent to society about women"". The move followsScotland becoming the first in the world to make period products freein November. Felicia Willow, chief executive of women's rights charity the Fawcett Society, agreed, saying: ""It's been a long road to reach this point, but at last the sexist tax that saw sanitary products classed as non-essential, luxury items can be consigned to the history books."" The Treasury has estimated the move will save the average woman nearly Â£40 over her lifetime, with a cut of 7p on a pack of 20 tampons and 5p on 12 pads. Date set for abolition of tampon tax It's been a long road to getting the tampon tax abolished in the UK. Campaigning and debates in parliament by then-MP for Dewsbury Ann Taylor led to the Labour government moving sanitary products to a reduced rate of 5% from January 2001- the lowest rate possible under the EU's VAT rules. And following more campaigning in 2014 by Ms Coryton and lobbying in parliament by former Dewsbury MP Paula Sherriff in 2016, the Conservative government announced that all VAT collected on sanitary products would henceforth be given to charities working with vulnerable women and girls. At the same time, the government enshrined in legislation that it would abolish the tampon tax. ""I'm just so happy and relieved and excited at the same time for this tax to finally be axed,"" said Ms Coryton. ""It will mean a reduction in prices for period products, and that reduction in cost will be important for the increasing number of people who are battling with poverty, especially due to the pandemic."" Gemma Abbott is a lawyer and campaigner with the Free Periods group, which successfully campaigned for the government to provide free sanitary products to schools and colleges across England in 2019. The scheme launched in January. Gemma Abbott wants clarity from the government on why the free sanitary products for schools scheme is not mandatory ""I think it's great news and a real testament to the determined campaigning of many people, like Paula Sheriff and Laura Coryton,"" she said. ""I think we can agree that any tax that characterises period products as non-essential is absurd and it has no place in a society that is seeking genuine gender equality."" Free Periods is now campaigning to ensure that schools and colleges know that the free sanitary products scheme exists and that they sign up for them. Ms Abbott said: ""The latest statistics we have are from last term - at that point only 40% of schools had signed up for the scheme."" Ms Coryton has set up a social enterprise called Sex Ed Matters with her sister Julia, providing talks in schools and toolkits for teachers to help them deliver the mandatory new sex education curriculum for primary and secondary schools issued in early 2020. They did an online survey of 150 teachers and students across the UK, and 100% of respondents said that there is still a stigma attached to periods. ""If there is a stigma attached to periods, then you're unlikely to speak up when you need period products, or to talk about the free sanitary products scheme that exists,"" stressed Ms Coryton. But Free Periods' Ms Abbott is also concerned about the charities supporting women and girls, who will no longer benefit from the proceeds of the previous 5% tax on sanitary products. ""The tampon tax fund has provided much needed support and funding to a chronically underfunded area,"" she said. ""I'm worried that the removal of the tampon tax will spell the end of the ring-fenced funding for charities to address really vital issues like domestic violence and rape.""

"This video can not be played ""I wish I could switch place with my daughter"" - Odd Steinar SÃ¸rengen's daughter is missing A body has been found shortly after rescuers and dog handlers began a risky ground search for 10 people missing in a hillside collapse in Norway. Initially it was thought too dangerous to send rescuers on to the site, after flowing mud sent homes toppling into a giant chasm in the village of Ask. Helicopters and drones spent two days searching the scene. But on Friday police commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter. Rescuers, who included a Swedish specialist team, began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards. The bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach one of the wrecked homes, which are 25km (15 miles) north-east of the capital Oslo. A missing Dalmatian dog was rescued on Thursday and police believe there is still a chance survivors could be found. However, on Friday afternoon an air ambulance helicopter landed near the site and police said a body had been found at 14:30 (13:30 GMT) without giving further details. Rescuers are using orange Styrofoam boards to move around the landslide area Prime Minister Erna Solberg said her thoughts went out to the victim's family, and to those waiting for news of the other nine people who were missing. In Friday's operation the rescuers also prepared a giant army vehicle called a ""paver"", which has a giant steel bridge on which rescuers can move. However, conditions were not yet good enough for the 50-tonne machine to be deployed. The plan is to deploy a Norwegian army bridge-laying vehicle as soon as conditions are good enough Friday's search was a race against time, as the rescuers only had a few hours of daylight in the Norwegian winter. Medics and geologists were reportedly part of the ground rescue team. The ground search was called off for the night at 17:30 and police said drones and heat-seeking cameras would continue overnight until rescue crews could return on Saturday morning. About 1,000 people have been evacuated from Gjerdrum municipality, which contains Ask village. Dozens more were moved out of their homes on New Year's Eve. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide Although police have not given details of the missing, they are believed to include men, women and children. Among them is a woman who was talking to her husband on the phone while walking the dog when the line went dead, according to Bergens Tidende newspaper. Further reports say a couple and their small child are also missing, as well as a woman in her 50s and her adult son. More than 30 homes have been destroyed, but officials say more could be lost as the edges of the crater left by the landslide are still breaking away. The conditions have proved challenging, with temperatures dropping to -1C (30F) and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. The scale of the landslide is shown by this aerial view of the disaster site The landslide began early on Wednesday, with residents calling emergency services and telling them that their houses were moving, police said. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" A spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP that the landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft). ""This is the largest landslide in recent times in Norway, considering the number of houses involved and the number of evacuees,"" Laila Hoivik said. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built three years later in 2008.

"Some lorries have been turned away for not having the correct paperwork Plans are in place to minimise disruption at Welsh ports - especially Holyhead - as the UK enters a post-Brexit new year. The EU Brexit transition period is over, and lorry drivers heading to and from the Republic of Ireland require additional paperwork to travel. Officials at Holyhead said some lorries have already been turned away because they had the wrong documentation. The Welsh Government said it was doing what it could to ""protect"" the port. Transport Minister Ken Skates said it was ""imperative"" contingency plans were in place for the island, as it wakes up to the new customs regime. Ferry operators in Wales will now require freight customers to link customs information to their booking as they head for the Irish Republic. Without that paperwork, port access will be refused. ""We've had the first few rejects, which is not unexpected,"" said Stena Line's Head of UK Ports, Ian Davies. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales from Holyhead on New Year's Day, he said it showed the new system was working. ""We've had people that have been passed and allowed to be shipped, and we've had a few failures as well, so it will be a learning curve for these customers."" A Brexit deal has been agreed, days before the deadline.It means that the UK and the EU can continue to trade without extra taxes being put on goods. What took so long?The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and actually left on 31 January 2020, but leaders had until the end of 2020 to work out a trade deal. There are big changes.Although it's a trade deal that has been agreed, there are also be changes to how people travel between the EU and UK, and to the way they live and work. The Welsh Government said a ""worst case scenario"" published by the UK suggested 40% to 70% of heavy goods vehicles arriving at ports after transition ended on New Year's Eve may not have the right documentation to travel. The peak period for turning vehicles away is expected to be mid-January. ""We simply don't know whether things are going to work,"" said Rod McKenzie, who is managing director of policy for the body representing lorry drivers and operators, the Road Haulage Association. ""There is no question there will be problems, even if all the IT works, things could go wrong, and given traders' unfamiliarity with it there is the potential for a lot of mistakes to be made."" A contraflow will allow lorries to be ""stacked"" on parts of the A55 if traffic builds The association said it was more worried about ""invisible delays"" in the supply chain, rather than queues at ferry ports. ""Lorries might not leave their factory gate or depot because the paperwork isn't done,"" he said. ""It's really, really important that people try to get their paperwork right. The consequences of any mistakes will be a disruption of the supply chain."" He said the sector would know in about a week ""how it's going"". Pembrokeshire council said it had been working to ensure any vehicles turned away from Pembroke Dock and Fishguard were dealt with away from the ports. It has arranged overflow locations at Goodwick and Pembroke Dock for its own version of Dover's ""Operation Stack"", where lorries queue along the M20. ""The importance of Pembrokeshire's ports to the county, Wales and UK as a whole cannot be overestimated,"" said council leader David Simpson. Holyhead is the UK's second busiest roll-on roll-off ferry port On Anglesey, a temporary contraflow is in force on the A55 expressway, eastbound between junctions two and four, allowing any traffic turned away from the port to be redirected back. It will be moved to parking locations at Parc Cybi on the outskirts of the town, and if necessary, lorries will be parked on the cordoned-off A55 sections. ""We will monitor the situation carefully and as soon as it's safe to do so we will remove the temporary contraflow,"" said Mr Skates. ""While the next few days are expected to be quiet, we know it will become busier as we approach mid-January. ""Our aim is to do what we can to protect the port, town of Holyhead and wider community from any possible disruption."" On Friday, port authorities on Anglesey said freight traffic has been quiet, as expected over the bank holiday period. It follows an steep rise in lorry crossings in the run up to Christmas and the end of the transition period. Ferry operator Stena Line is also responsible for running Holyhead Port. ""We can't get complacent over the next few days,"" said a Stena spokesman. ""It's when freight levels come back up that we'll know whether the systems are really working and whether the hauliers are ready. That will be the real test.""

"David Firth's Salad Fingers was a popular Flash character Adobe Flash Player, the browser plug-in that brought rich animations and interactivity to the early web, has officially reached the end of its life. Released in 1996, Flash was once one of the most popular ways for people to stream videos and play games online. But it was plagued with security problems and failed to transition to the smartphone era. Adobe will no longer offer security updates for Flash and has urged people to uninstall it. It will also stop videos and animations running in its Flash Player from 12 January. When Flash was first released, a majority of internet users connected via dial-up connections that were very slow by today's standards. But Flash let web designers and animators deliver exciting content that could be downloaded relatively quickly. This video can not be played WATCH: Flash reaches the end of its life ""You could make a full three-minute animation with multiple characters, backgrounds, sounds and music less than 2 megabytes (MB) and viewable from within the browser,"" explained animator David Firth. His surreal animations and characters - such as Salad Fingers, the gangly green monster with a hunched back- enjoyed viral success before the advent of social media. ""I just made the stuff I wanted to see that I felt was missing: dark, surreal comedy,"" he told the BBC. ""There were no shortcuts to viral content. No corporate fingers twiddling the algorithms. It was simply attention-grabbing and quality material that rose to the top."" Sites such as Newgrounds - described as ""the YouTube of Flash"" by Mr Firth - sprung up to serve the growing demand for cartoons and interactive games. ""It was the first website I'd ever seen that allowed anyone to post content and it be available in real time. If the community felt the content was low quality, it would get removed at the end of the day so you actually had to take that into account when posting,"" he said. Flash was about more than just animations - it also let websites such as YouTube stream high-quality video. By 2009, Adobe said Flash was installed on 99% of internet-connected desktop PCs. But by then the world was shifting towards mobile devices and Adobe was slow to react. ""We had optimised for lower-end phones with Flash Lite,"" explains David Mendels, former executive vice president of products at Adobe. ""It was incredibly successful in places like Japan, but it wasn't the same as the full desktop Flash. It wasn't fully compatible."" In April 2010, Apple's Steve Jobs wrotea blistering open letter headlined Thoughts On Flash,external, in which he laid out why Apple would not let Flash run on iPhones and iPads. Steve Jobs was critical of Flash Flash, he argued, was cumbersome to use on a touchscreen, unreliable, a security threat and a drain on battery life. He said videos and animations could instead be delivered with HTML5 and other open technologies, making Flash redundant on a smartphone or tablet. ""When the iPhone came out, Flash wasn't quite ready,"" Mr Mendels told the BBC. ""But also I think Apple wanted to create an Apple-only ecosystem."" Eventually, Adobe did get a version of its Flash Player working on smartphones. But the internet had moved on. Big brands such as Facebook, Netflix and YouTube were already streaming videos to smartphones without Flash and in November 2011Adobe ended development of Flash for mobile devices. It continued to produce Flash for desktop computers, but the software suffered from multiple security flaws. In 2015, Apple disabled the plug-in in its Safari web browser by default, and Google's Chrome started blocking some pieces of Flash content. In July 2017, Adobe announced that it would retire Flash in 2020. It said other technologies, such as HTML5 had matured enough to provide a ""viable alternative"", without requiring users to install and update a dedicated plug-in. Since Adobe will prevent Flash Player from displaying content from 12 January, there are concerns that years of animations, games and interactive websites will be lost. Gaming company Zyngaclosed the original version of its FarmVille video game on New Year's Eve,externalafter 11 years, as it relied on Flash to run. An open, collaborative project known as Ruffle is working to develop software that can play Flash content in a web browser, without requiring a plug-in. At its peak, FarmVille had millions of players The Internet Archive is currently hosting more than 2,000 items. Its collection includes episodes of Salad Fingers, although David Firth has posted official copies on YouTube, which he considers to have been a ""Flash killer"". ""As time went on and YouTube offered higher and higher-quality video formats, there was simply no reason to post in the Flash format,"" he explained. But since Flash was also used for interactive websites and games, there was ""every reason to preserve the format"", he told the BBC. Many of the features animators used are still available in Adobe Animate. In its final update, Adobe said: ""We want to take a moment to thank all of our customers and developers who have used and created amazing Flash Player content over the last two decades. ""We are proud that Flash had a crucial role in evolving web content across animation, interactivity, audio, and video."" Adobe has provided instructions for removing Flash onWindows,externalandMac,externalcomputers on its website. It has warned: ""Uninstalling Flash Player will help to secure your system since Adobe does not intend to issue Flash Player updates or security patches after the end-of-life date.""

Following the loss of his younger brother and bandmate DJ Subroc, he disappeared from music becoming, in his own words, ""damn near homeless"". But in 1997, he remerged at open mic events in Manhattan, wearing tights over his face. He protected his anonymity for the rest of his career, adopting a mask based on the Marvel villain Doctor Doom for all his public appearances. His debut as MF Doom, Operation: Doomsday, was released in 1999, and he followed it up with an almost non-stop outpouring of music. As well as six solo albums, he produced a wealth of bootlegs, compilations, collaborations, mixtapes and instrumental albums - including the influential, 10-part Special Herbs series.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning - and a Happy New Year too as we welcome in 2021. We'll have another update for you on Saturday. There's been a bit of reaction this week to the UK's new vaccination plan which will change how the doses are given out. The original plan was to give people the second dose of the Pfizer jab 21 days after the first, but the gap between doses for both vaccines has now been extended to 12 weeks. It means more people will get the first jab sooner, but many patients who had been booked in for their second dose have seen their appointments cancelled. The UK's chief medical officershave defended the Covid vaccination planafter criticism from doctors, saying that getting more people vaccinated with the first jab ""is much more preferable"".More about how the vaccine is being rolled out here. After warnings from the police and government to spend New Year's Eve indoors, millions of people stayed at home rather than celebrate with the usual parties and gatherings. Although some crowds turned out in London and Edinburgh, the majority of the streets were quiet. In the skies above London,a fireworks and light displaypaid tribute to NHS staff and was aired on the BBC. Elsewhere around the world, some celebrations had crowds while others didn't. Check outour picture galleryor watch our global round-up: This video can not be played Countries around the world welcomed 2021 with fireworks, but crowds were only allowed at some displays According to retail analysts, last year was the worst for the High Street in more than 25 years as the pandemic accelerated the shift towards online shopping. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost in the UK in 2020, up by almost a quarter on the previous year,the Centre for Retail Research said.And it's warned there will be more pain for the sector in 2021 as retailers face a cash flow crisis and rent payments, predicting up to 200,000 more retail jobs will be at risk. Another grim record was broken on Thursday, as the UK reported another 55,892 daily cases of coronavirus - the highest daily figure so far. A further 964 people died within 28 days of a positive test, only slightly down on the 981 on Wednesday. Public Health England medical director Dr Yvonne Doyle said Christmas week had seen a worrying rise in cases - particularly among adults in their 20s and 30s.Read more here. Joe Robertshaw and fiancee Rhiannon, from Burton-upon-Trent, had been due to tie the knot on New Year's Eve. But when it was announced that Staffordshire was one of the areas moving into tier four from 00:01 on Thursday, the couple had a choice: postpone, or bring forward their ceremony by a day. They chose the latter, frantically phoning their vicar, the photographer and the guests to see if everyone could rearrange. The bride, the new Mrs Robertshaw, was at work on Wednesday at an opticians, but was allowed to leave early for the ceremony.Read the full story here.

"Police tweeted this photo, which appears to show the vehicle severely damaged in the crash Four ponies have been killed in a collision with a vehicle in the New Forest National Park. The animals were hit on Thursday night while licking freshly laid salt on Roger Penny Way, Hampshire Constabulary said. Three ponies died at the scene while a fourth was found dead later a short distance away. In December, three donkeys werekilled on the road, which is a black spot for animal accidents. Mark Ferrett, whose daughter owned the ponies, said the deaths were ""unacceptable"" The crash happened at about 21:00 GMT on a 40mph (64km/h) section of the road north of Brook. The car, a Land Rover Discovery, appears to have been severely damaged in the collision, according to a police tweet, which gave no further details. Mark Ferrett, whose daughter owned the ponies, said the deaths were ""unacceptable"". He said: ""I would favour a reduction in the speed [limit]. Please, everyone needs to slow down and stop this carnage."" The New Forest is one of the largest remaining areas of unenclosed land where commoners' cattle, ponies and donkeys roam throughout the open heath. InÂ 2019, 58 animals were killed and 32 were injured, according to the New Forest National Park Authority. The crash happened on Roger Penny Way, where donkeys, cattle and horses roam freely Andrew Napthine, a New Forest Agister who helps manage the area's free-roaming animals, attended the scene of the crash, and said the male driver was not injured. He said three of the ponies were killed on the road while a fourth fled the scene and died behind a bush.

"A new era has begun for the United Kingdom after it completed its formal separation from the European Union. The UK stopped following EU rules at 23:00 GMT, as replacement arrangements for travel, trade, immigration and security co-operation came into force. Boris Johnson said the UK had ""freedom in our hands"" and the ability to do things ""differently and better"" now the long Brexit process was over. But opponents of leaving the EU maintain the country will be worse off. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, whose ambition it is to take an independent Scotland back into the EU,tweeted,external: ""Scotland will be back soon, Europe. Keep the light on."" BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said there was a sense of relief in Brussels that the Brexit process was over, ""but there is regret still at Brexit itself"". The first lorries arriving at the borders entered the UK and EU without delay. On Friday evening, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted thatborder traffic had been ""low due to [the] bank holiday"",externalbut there had been no disruption in Kent as ""hundreds"" of lorries crossed the Channel with a ""small"" number turned back. Six freight loads travelling from Holyhead in Wales to Ireland had to be turned away due to not having the correct paperwork, the Stena Line ferry and port group said on Friday morning. But later on Friday, the group said freight traffic was flowing well through its ports and government customs systems were working well. It added that the fall in freight traffic after the Christmas and Brexit stockpiling period meant ""it is too early to draw any conclusions"", but the company remained ""cautiously optimistic that, as freight volumes begin to rise again, we will be able to ensure the continued free movement of goods"". What happens now that a deal's been done? A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Brexit: Seven things that will change UK ministers have warned there will be some disruption in the coming days and weeks, as new rules bed in and British firms come to terms with the changes. But officials have insisted new border systems are ""ready to go"". As the first customs checks were completed after midnight, Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said: ""It all went fine, everything's running just as it was before 11pm."" Northern Ireland has different arrangements from other parts of the UK, meaning there will besome customs checks on goods moving between Great Britain and the province. On Friday afternoon, the first ferry from Great Britain operating under the terms of Northern Ireland trading protocol docked in Belfast, on schedule at 13:45 GMT. Seamus Leheny, policy manager at Logistics UK, said six out of the 15 lorries that were on the first ship to arrive into Belfast were brought in for inspection, with one being kept at the port for more than three hours. ""Inevitably there are going to be teething problems because with such a new, complex system as this there are going to be issues in the first few days,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. The first lorry loads on to the Eurotunnel shuttle after the UK left the single market and customs union Mandy Ridyard, whose aerospace components company makes daily shipments to Northern Ireland, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme she was ""filling in the same declaration to send goods to the Philippines that I am sending them within the UK"". ""And obviously that all adds a lot of cost to my business."" The UK officially left the 27-member political and economic bloc on 31 January, three and half years after the UK public voted to leave in the 2016 Brexit referendum. But it stuck to the EU's trading rules for 11 months while the two sides negotiated their future economic partnership. A treaty was finally agreed on Christmas Eve, and became law in the UK on Wednesday. Under the new arrangements, UK manufacturers will have tariff-free access to the EU's internal market, meaning there will be no import taxes on goods crossing between Britain and the continent. But it does mean more paperwork for businesses and people travelling to EU countries, while there is still uncertainty about what will happen to banking and services. The UK and Spain have also reachedan agreement meaning the border between Gibraltar and Spain will remain open. Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar's chief minister, said the deal still needed to be formalised, but by abolishing controls between Gibraltar and the EU's passport-free Schengen area, he said it would prevent queues at the border ""which make people's lives a misery and make business difficult"". It is a moment that some will regard with huge optimism, others with deep regret. And while this historic move happens at a moment in time, the impact, in some areas, may be less instant or obvious than others - for example, it's expected there'll be relatively little traffic at Dover on the first day of 2021 as new border checks kick in. Nevertheless, significant changes are here - whether on trade, travel, security or immigration - and those changes could well become more apparent in the months ahead. Mr Johnson - who took the UK out of the EU in January six months after becoming prime minister - said it was an ""amazing moment"" for the UK in his New Year message. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalhe added that the combination of the Brexit deal and rollout of the Oxford vaccine means ""we are creating the potential trampoline for the national bounceback"". Lord Frost, the UK's chief negotiator, tweeted that Britain had become a ""fully independent country again"". And the deputy chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory backbench MPs, David Jones, told the BBC: ""We can now say clearly Britain is a sovereign and independent state.""

But opponents of Brexit say the country will be worse off than it was while it was a member of the EU. Ireland's Foreign MinisterSimon Coveney said,externalit was ""not something to celebrate"" and the UK's relationship with Ireland will be different from now on, but ""we wish them well"". French President Emmanuel Macron said the UK remained a ""friend and ally"", but he added that the choice to leave the EU was ""the child of European malaise and many lies and false promises"". In Brussels, there is a sense of relief the Brexit process is over, but there is regret still at Brexit itself. Basically, the European Union thinks that Brexit makes it - the EU - and the UK weaker. But the EU view is this is less bye-bye Britain and more au revoir, because there are so many loose ends between the two sides. For example, there are the ongoing practicalities surrounding Gibraltar, the UK is still waiting to find out what access Brussels is going to give its financial services to the single market, there is cooperation on climate change, and there is a reviewal mechanism written into the treaty for every five years. For all of those reasons and more, this is not the end of the EU-UK conversation for the foreseeable future. The culmination of the Brexit process means major changes in different areas. These include: The free movement of people between the UK and EU countries has ended - and has been replaced in the UK by a""points-based"" immigration system,external Anyone from the UK who wants to stay in most of the EU for more than 90 days in any 180-day period now needs a visa Duty-free shopping has returned,,externalwith people coming back to the UK from the EU able to bring up to 42 litres of beer, 18 litres of wine, four litres of spirits and 200 cigarettes without paying tax EU citizens wanting to move to the UK (except those from Ireland) face the same points-based system as people elsewhere in the world UK police havelost instant access to EU-wide databaseson criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.

"This video can not be played London's new year celebrations featured a message of hope from David Attenborough The UK has seen off 2020 and celebrated the dawn of 2021 with a fireworks and light display over London that included tributes to NHS staff. Revellers were not able to ring in the New Year in the usual way because of the coronavirus pandemic, with people instead told to stay at home. Police had to break up various parties and events across England overnight. Forces have handed out hundreds of fines, with several issuing the maximum Â£10,000 to event organisers. Much of the UK saw in the new year while under lockdown rules, with about 44 million people in England - or 78% of the population - in tier four, the top level of Covid restrictions. Mainland Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are also under lockdown. Although people were warned not to attend any parties outside their own homes, there were many around the country who ignored the rules. The Metropolitan Police said police attended 58 parties and unlicensed music events in breach of tier four rules across London overnight, the vast majority of which ended when police intervened, they added. Fixed penalty fines were given to 217 people while five others could be fined Â£10,000 for organising large gatherings. The police force said four other people were arrested for breaching Covid regulations by gathering in central London. Elsewhere, other forces also broke up parties and handed out hundreds of fines. They included Greater Manchester Police, which issued 105 fixed penalty notices at house parties and larger gatherings. And Leicestershire Police had to issue six on-the-spot Â£10,000 fines to party organisers. In Essex,hundreds of people were dispersed from an illegal New Year's Eve partyat a church, while Lancashire Policebroke up a partyin Hyndburn, near Blackburn, attended by 80. Meanwhile, in Scotland, Edinburgh's traditional Hogmanay street party was cancelled, with videos ofa drone displayreleased instead. The series of videos showed a swarm of 150 lit-up drones over the Scottish Highlands and Edinburgh were released, which organisers said it was the largest drone show ever produced in the UK. Despite the cancellation of Edinburgh's traditional Hogmanay celebration - which normally attracts 100,000 people on the city's streets - there were some people who ignored the pleas to stay at home. Crowds of several hundred people gathered at Edinburgh Castle to see in the new year. They sang Auld Lang Syne and danced before eventually dispersing when several police vans and cars pulled on to the castle esplanade. An anti-lockdown protest and New Year's Eve celebration was also held in London People cross Hungerford Bridge in London on New Year's Eve On New Year's Eve, Health Secretary Matt Hancock called on people to take ""personal responsibility"" and stay at home to avoid spreading Covid-19. What can you still do in tier four? UK coronavirus cases up to 55,892 on Thursday London's 10-minute display over the Thames aired on the BBC at midnight, and began with a poem which addressed the pandemic, that said: ""In the year of 2020 a new virus came our way; We knew what must be done and so to help we hid away."" Light projections lit up the sky over the O2 Arena, including the NHS logo in a heart accompanied by a child's voice saying: ""Thank you NHS heroes"". The show also recognised Captain Sir Tom Moore, who raised Â£33m for the NHS by walking laps of his garden and the Black Lives Matter movement. One 2020 phenomena - working from home - was represented with a mute logo backed by a voiceover saying ""You're on mute"". The display ended with a call from Sir David Attenborough about the need for action on climate change. London mayor Sadiq Khan said the display had reflected the resolve of Londoners to endure 300 drones were used in the display to create images in the sky In a speech being broadcast on BBC One between Doctor Who and EastEnders this evening, Sir David will say that this ""could be a year for positive change - for ourselves, for our planet and for the wonderful creatures with which we share it"". Despite the ""challenging"" times we live in, ""the reactions to these extraordinary times has proved that when we work together there is no limit to what we can accomplish"", he will say, as he looks ahead to the United Nations Climate Change Conference later this year. The sounds of a video conference call starting up were played Much of London was far quieter than usual Edinburgh's streets were largely empty, with Police Scotland warning against Hogmanay gatherings Official figures showed 10.75 million viewers watched the 2021 New Year celebrations on BBC One. It's down from the 11.18m who saw in the start of 2020 on the channel. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was proud of the show, which he said ""paid tribute to our NHS heroes and the way that Londoners continue to stand together"". ""We showed how our capital and the UK have made huge sacrifices to support one another through these difficult times, and how they will continue to do so as the vaccine is rolled out."" Usually, around 100,000 people pack into the streets around Victoria Embankment to watch the New Year's Eve fireworks. This video can not be played Drone swarm lights up Hogmanay skies In his New Year's message, the Archbishop of Canterbury said he saw ""reasons to be hopeful for the year ahead"" despite the ""tremendous pain and sadness"" brought by 2020. The Most Reverend Justin Welby spoke of his experience volunteering as an assistant chaplain at St Thomas' hospital during the pandemic, saying: ""Sometimes the most important thing we do is just sit with people, letting them know they are not alone."" In his message, filmed at the London hospital and broadcast on BBC One on Friday afternoon, he said: ""This crisis has shown us how fragile we are. It has also shown us how to face this fragility. ""Here at the hospital, hope is there in every hand that's held, and every comforting word that's spoken. ""Up and down the country, it's there in every phone call.

"The first lorries to transport freight under the new arrangements arrived in Belfast on Friday afternoon The first goods have crossed the new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The'Irish Sea border' is a consequence of Brexitand means that most commercial goods entering NI from GB require a customs declaration. About a dozen lorries arrived on a ferry from Cairnryan in Scotland to Belfast at 14:00 GMT on Friday. They were met by officials, with some vehicles directed to new border control posts. Many food products from GB now have to enter NI through these border posts where they can be inspected by the Department of Agriculture. These products also need health certificates, though some of the new certification processes will be phased in over the next three months. The UK government also announced a three-month ""grace period"" for parcels, meaning those sent by online retailers will be exempt from customs declarations until at least April. It said the grace period was necessary to avoid disruption to deliveries at a time when many shops are closed due to pandemic restrictions. Meanwhile the secretary of state for Northern Ireland has continued to insist the new range of checks, controls and paperwork is not actually a sea border. Brandon Lewis tweeted: ""There is no 'Irish Sea Border'. As we have seen today, the important preparations the government and businesses have taken to prepare for the end of the Transition Period are keeping goods flowing freely around the country, including between GB and NI.""

Transport companies are not expecting significant volumes of freight over the next few days. There has been significant stockpiling ahead of the changes and it may take one or two weeks before freight volumes are at normal seasonal levels. Some businesses, particularly haulage companies, are anxious about the new IT systems which are necessary for the border to function. They have had less than two weeks to familiarise themselves with the new systems. Police officers carried out random vehicle checks near Larne Port on New Year's Eve Seamus Leheny from Logistics UK said: ""With any reconfiguration of supply chains and new systems there will be teething problems and we expect that."" There will be no new processes or checks for the vast majority of goods leaving NI for GB. Five steps that led to an Irish Sea border Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI IT systems for post-Brexit trade 'up and running' The new arrangements flow from the Northern Ireland Protocol, a deal reached by the UK and EU in 2019. Its purpose is to prevent a hard land border in Ireland. That is achieved by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and by having Northern Ireland apply EU customs rules at its ports. This will allow goods to flow from NI to the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the EU as they do now, without customs checks or new paperwork. The Protocol is opposed by Northern Ireland's unionist parties who fear it will weaken Northern Ireland's position in the UK. The arrangement does not change Northern Ireland's constitutional position. However, it does mean a significant new economic barrier within the UK. Unionist parties fear the sea border will weaken NI's position in the UK The UK government has allocated more than Â£300m for a Trader Support Service to help businesses deal with the new customs arrangements. The government is also covering the costs of the new certification requirements for food products. A Movement Assistance Scheme will pay vets up to Â£150 to complete the Export Health Certificates which will need to accompany all live animals and products of animal origin entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Trucks pass through a customs post at Dublin Port on Friday morning There are also new checks and controls on freight arriving at Dublin Port from GB. On Friday morning, the first ferry to arrive in Dublin from Holyhead had about 12 lorries on board. While they all cleared customs checks for the first time without delays, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the change in trading arrangements with the UK would inevitably cause disruption. ""We have avoided the kind of dramatic disruption of a no trade deal Brexit, but that doesn't mean that things aren't changing very fundamentally, because they are,"" he said. ""We're now going to see the â¬80b (Â£71.2bn) worth of trade across the Irish Sea between Britain and Ireland disrupted by an awful lot more checks and declarations, and bureaucracy and paperwork, and cost and delay."" On Saturdaynew freight sailings will begin between Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland and Dunkirk in France, allowing cargo to bypass GB and go straight to mainland Europe. The six-times weekly service will take 24 hours, which is longer than the ""landbridge"" route via GB.

"This video can not be played ""I wish I could switch place with my daughter"" - Odd Steinar SÃ¸rengen's daughter is missing A body has been found shortly after rescuers and dog handlers began a risky ground search for 10 people missing in a hillside collapse in Norway. Initially it was thought too dangerous to send rescuers on to the site, after flowing mud sent homes toppling into a giant chasm in the village of Ask. Helicopters and drones spent two days searching the scene. But on Friday police commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter. Rescuers, who included a Swedish specialist team, began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards. The bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach one of the wrecked homes, which are 25km (15 miles) north-east of the capital Oslo. A missing Dalmatian dog was rescued on Thursday and police believe there is still a chance survivors could be found. However, on Friday afternoon an air ambulance helicopter landed near the site and police said a body had been found at 14:30 (13:30 GMT) without giving further details. Rescuers are using orange Styrofoam boards to move around the landslide area Prime Minister Erna Solberg said her thoughts went out to the victim's family, and to those waiting for news of the other nine people who were missing. In Friday's operation the rescuers also prepared a giant army vehicle called a ""paver"", which has a giant steel bridge on which rescuers can move. However, conditions were not yet good enough for the 50-tonne machine to be deployed. The plan is to deploy a Norwegian army bridge-laying vehicle as soon as conditions are good enough Friday's search was a race against time, as the rescuers only had a few hours of daylight in the Norwegian winter. Medics and geologists were reportedly part of the ground rescue team. The ground search was called off for the night at 17:30 and police said drones and heat-seeking cameras would continue overnight until rescue crews could return on Saturday morning. About 1,000 people have been evacuated from Gjerdrum municipality, which contains Ask village. Dozens more were moved out of their homes on New Year's Eve. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide Although police have not given details of the missing, they are believed to include men, women and children. Among them is a woman who was talking to her husband on the phone while walking the dog when the line went dead, according to Bergens Tidende newspaper. Further reports say a couple and their small child are also missing, as well as a woman in her 50s and her adult son. More than 30 homes have been destroyed, but officials say more could be lost as the edges of the crater left by the landslide are still breaking away. The conditions have proved challenging, with temperatures dropping to -1C (30F) and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. The scale of the landslide is shown by this aerial view of the disaster site The landslide began early on Wednesday, with residents calling emergency services and telling them that their houses were moving, police said. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" A spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP that the landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft). ""This is the largest landslide in recent times in Norway, considering the number of houses involved and the number of evacuees,"" Laila Hoivik said. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built three years later in 2008.

Today's live page was edited by Holly Wallis and Chris Clayton, and written by Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Kathryn Snowdon, Penny Spiller and Alexandra FouchÃ©. We'll be pausing our live coverage for the day soon so here's a summary of the main stories in the UK today: Here are the latest
headlines from around the world: Coronavirus cases are now rising fast again, driven by a new variant of the virus thought to be much more easily transmissible than other strains. The number of Covid-19 patients in hospitals across the UK has also risen sharply in recent weeks and is now above the level seen in the spring. You can check how many cases there are in your areahere. Sir Tom Jones said receiving the Covid-19 vaccine was just like getting a flu jab And back in the UK, Sir Tom Jones revealed that he too has received the coronavirus vaccine, calling it ""one good thing about being 80"". âIâve had my jab already,"" he told TV presenter Jools Holland on the New Year's Eve broadcast of Jools' Annual Hootenanny. âThatâs one good thing about being 80, youâre first in line for the jab. It was fine, it was like getting the flu jab.â Holland jokingly asked if it was a legitimate vaccine and Sir Tom replied: âIt wasnât a black market one. It was the real deal.â Queen Margrethe delivered her New Year's speech before receiving the vaccine Denmarkâs Queen
Margrethe has received the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, the royal
household has announced. The 80-year-old
monarch was given the dose on New Yearâs Day, and will receive the second dose
of the vaccine in three weeks. Queen Margrethe has
had to isolate for much of the past year, cancelling plans for her birthday last
April and traditional events around Christmas and New Year. Her grandson, Prince Christian, tested positive for the coronavirus
in recent weeks and had to self-isolate, although his parents, Crown Prince Frederik and
Crown Princess Mary, and siblings tested negative. The collapse of Debenhams contributed to the retail sector's 180,000 job losses in 2020 Retail analysts have described 2020 asthe worst year for the high street in a quarter of a century, with the pandemic accelerating a move towards online shopping. The Centre for Retail Research said nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost in the UK in 2020, with up to 200,000 more at risk in 2021 as businesses face a cash flow crisis. Some analysts estimate that the pandemic accelerated the shift to online shopping by five to ten years, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Sarah Corker said. Analysis of spending habits also suggests we increased the amount we spent in smaller neighbourhood shopping areas rather than large cities and shopping centres during 2020. With more of us working from home, people spent their money locally and rediscovered local independent stores. Susannah Streeter, market analyst at Hargreaves Landsdown, said bigger retailers needed to focus on the experience they offer - including the ability to try before you buy - if they are to attract customers back when the coronavirus crisis is over. ""Shopping needs to be an enjoyable pastime, not a bun fight amid vast racks of clothes. Reducing retail footprints, while investing in the appeal of an exciting in-store and online seamless experience will be key to attracting newer, younger customers,"" she said. Norway has
announced it is lifting its ban on flights arriving from the UK. Flights will
resume from 16:00 GMT on 2 January, the health ministry announced. Passengers arriving
by plane from the UK will have to fill out a travel registration form and
everyone entering Norway from Saturday must take a Covid-19 test, the ministry
said. Norway was among a
number of countries that halted travel from the UK on 21 December after it emerged
a new variant of the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in south-east England. ""If this strain should spread in Norway, it will probably mean a full lockdown of society,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg said on Thursday. Adam Lambert (left) and Tituss Burgess will bring the TikTok-made musical to life After the worldâs most unusual year comes the worldâs most unusual
musical. Ratatouille the TikTok Musical will be streaming in a few hours, featuring
Queen

Award winner Andre De Shields. Theone-off performance,externalwas born out of a short song posted on
TikTok in August by Emily Jacobson, a teacher in New York and fan of the 2007
Pixar film Ratatouille about a rat who dreams of becoming a chef. Her short catchy song about Remy âthe rat of all my dreamsâ was picked
up and given a Broadway-style musical finish by composer Daniel Mertzlufft. His rendition sparked a craze on TikTok with hundreds of other
creators following suit, providing songs for other characters, choreographed
dances and suggested stage designs. The 1 January âshowâ will be accompanied by the 20-piece Broadway
Sinfonietta orchestra and will raise money for The Actors Fund, which has been
supporting performers during the pandemic. You can read more on how this show came about here. The next few weeks could be the most dangerous period for Scotland since March in the fight against Covid, the country's first minister has warned. Nicola Sturgeon said the new variant of the virus was ""accelerating spread"" across Scotland. ""If you first foot someone today, or hug/kiss/handshake them HNY, you are putting yourself, others and the NHS at risk,""she said in a tweet.,external A further 2,539 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Scotland on Friday. The number is slightly down on Thursday's figure, but Sturgeon said cases numbers were still ""worryingly high"". Daily confirmed cases have reached record highs on each of the previous three days.

Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News Many scientists fear even tougher restrictions than the current tier four are needed The most chilling finding from the Imperial College research on the new coronavirus variant is that the November lockdown in England, hard though it was for many people, would not have stopped the variant form of the virus from spreading. The same severe restrictions that saw cases of the previous version of the virus fall by a third, would see a tripling of the new variant. This is why there has been such a sudden tightening of restrictions across the country. It is unclear whether the current restrictions will be enough to control the spread of the virus. Given the fact that it has taken two lockdowns to stop the earlier version of the virus overwhelming the NHS, many scientists fear that further tightening will be necessary. Infection levels will begin to drop as enough people are vaccinated. But until then it is now more important than ever for people to follow social distancing guidelines, wear masks where required and to regularly wash their hands. The new year brings with it hope of a more normal life in the next few months but also a new form of the virus that all of us will have to combat in the next few weeks. Much of England has been placed in a new top tier of restrictions - tier four - as the new variant spreads Earlier we reported that a study by Imperial College had concludedthe new coronavirus variant is ""hugely"" more transmissible. Now some experts are saying that means even tougher restrictions will soon be needed. Prof Jim Naismith, of Oxford University, said: ""The data from Imperial represent the best analysis to date and imply that the measures we have employed to date, would - with the new virus - fail to reduce the R number to below 1. ""In simpler terms, unless we do something different the new virus strain is going to continue to spread - more infections, more hospitalisations and more deaths."" The R number is the average number of people an infected person passes the virus onto. If it is above 1 the epidemic is growing. Early data suggested that the virus was spreading more quickly among the under-20s, particularly among secondary school age children, but the latest results indicate that it is more infectious in all age groups. Prof Axel Gandy, part of the research team, suggested that it may have appeared to spread more easily among school children simply because the early data was collected during the November lockdown, when adults' movements were restricted but schools remained open. The UK has recorded a further 53,285 coronavirus cases, as well as 613 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of daily cases is slightly down on Thursday's figure of 55,892,which was the highest number on record. Carys BetteleyBBC News Carmarthen showground has been repurposed as a coronavirus testing centre In a cattle market repurposed for a very different mission, a 66-year-old man arrives early and shuts himself in a portable cabin. Chris Jones dons his personal protective equipment (PPE), and prepares for the day ahead before heading to another work station to find out what his day holds in store. This Carmarthenshire barn, with its five lanes for traffic, is being used as a regional coronavirus testing centre. Read more here. A US hospital employee who was said to have intentionally discarded vials of the Moderna vaccine at a medical centre in Wisconsin earlier this week has now been arrested, officials say. The pharmacist, who has not been publicly identified, is suspected of sabotaging more than 500
doses of coronavirus vaccine by deliberately removing them from
cold storage. He is no longer employed by the hospital. It is not clear what his motive may have been. Each vial contains 10 doses. Some of the doses were administered before staff at the Aurora Health medical centre in Grafton, Wisconsin, realised the medication had been spoiled. The remaining 500-plus doses then had to be discarded. Initially, hospital officials thought the error had been made inadvertently, but the individual later acknowledged they had intentionally removed the vaccines from refrigeration, according to a hospital statement released earlier this week.  Japan is facing rising infections but insists the delayed Olympics will go ahead this year The Olympics and Paralympics will go ahead as scheduled in July despite concern over rising coronavirus cases in Japan, the country's prime minister has said. Yoshihide Suga saidthe ""Games will be held this summer"" and will be ""safe and secure"". Infections have surged in Japan in recent days with Tokyo reporting more than 1,000 daily cases for the first time. Japan is responding to cases of the new variant of coronavirus first found in the UK, with Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike warning the number of infections could ""explode"". The Olympics, postponed from summer 2020, are due to begin on 23 July - with the Paralympics following a month later from 24 August. An animal park has closed temporarilyafter finding that most of its visitor bookings were from areas with the tightest coronavirus restrictions. Monkey World in Wool, Dorset, also said workers had been ""unacceptably abused"" when contacting people who had  tried to visit from tier four areas. The site is in a tier three zone, allowing its outdoor areas to remain open. People living under tier four restrictions are only permitted to travel to lower-tier areas for certain specified reasons, such as work, caring responsibilities or emergencies. You can read more on the rules for different tiershere. London's Nightingale hospital was built in just 9 days London's Nightingale Hospital is ready to admit patients,the NHS has said, with the capital's hospitals under increasing pressure as Covid cases rise. However, Mike Adams, director of the Royal College of Nursing, questioned whether there were the staff available to run the hospital. âNursing is already stretched beyond capacity so
there is no magic pile of nurses we can call upon,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. âI think the real battle is reducing the spread of the
virus and getting the vaccine rolled out so we can actually reduce the capacity
of people needing care in any given moment.â London's Nightingale Hospital was opened on 3 April but placed on standby weeks later after fewer than 20 patients were treated there. A fleet of 300 drones joined the usual pyrotechnics this year Although going out wasn't an option for millions of Britons over New Year's Eve,London's annual firework display was watched by slightly fewer people than last year. An average audience of 10.75 million tuned in to the 10-minute display, which combined pyrotechnics with illuminated tributes to NHS staff and notable figures from 2020 created by 300 drones. In January 2020, 11.18 million watched the celebrations. Normally, up to 100,000 people line the streets to see the fireworks in person, but this year the city centre was largely empty. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played ""I wish I could switch place with my daughter"" - Odd Steinar SÃ¸rengen's daughter is missing A body has been found shortly after rescuers and dog handlers began a risky ground search for 10 people missing in a hillside collapse in Norway. Initially it was thought too dangerous to send rescuers on to the site, after flowing mud sent homes toppling into a giant chasm in the village of Ask. Helicopters and drones spent two days searching the scene. But on Friday police commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter. Rescuers, who included a Swedish specialist team, began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards. The bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach one of the wrecked homes, which are 25km (15 miles) north-east of the capital Oslo. A missing Dalmatian dog was rescued on Thursday and police believe there is still a chance survivors could be found. However, on Friday afternoon an air ambulance helicopter landed near the site and police said a body had been found at 14:30 (13:30 GMT) without giving further details. Rescuers are using orange Styrofoam boards to move around the landslide area Prime Minister Erna Solberg said her thoughts went out to the victim's family, and to those waiting for news of the other nine people who were missing. In Friday's operation the rescuers also prepared a giant army vehicle called a ""paver"", which has a giant steel bridge on which rescuers can move. However, conditions were not yet good enough for the 50-tonne machine to be deployed. The plan is to deploy a Norwegian army bridge-laying vehicle as soon as conditions are good enough Friday's search was a race against time, as the rescuers only had a few hours of daylight in the Norwegian winter. Medics and geologists were reportedly part of the ground rescue team. The ground search was called off for the night at 17:30 and police said drones and heat-seeking cameras would continue overnight until rescue crews could return on Saturday morning. About 1,000 people have been evacuated from Gjerdrum municipality, which contains Ask village. Dozens more were moved out of their homes on New Year's Eve. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide Although police have not given details of the missing, they are believed to include men, women and children. Among them is a woman who was talking to her husband on the phone while walking the dog when the line went dead, according to Bergens Tidende newspaper. Further reports say a couple and their small child are also missing, as well as a woman in her 50s and her adult son. More than 30 homes have been destroyed, but officials say more could be lost as the edges of the crater left by the landslide are still breaking away. The conditions have proved challenging, with temperatures dropping to -1C (30F) and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. The scale of the landslide is shown by this aerial view of the disaster site The landslide began early on Wednesday, with residents calling emergency services and telling them that their houses were moving, police said. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" A spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP that the landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft). ""This is the largest landslide in recent times in Norway, considering the number of houses involved and the number of evacuees,"" Laila Hoivik said. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built three years later in 2008.

"A new era has begun for the United Kingdom after it completed its formal separation from the European Union. The UK stopped following EU rules at 23:00 GMT, as replacement arrangements for travel, trade, immigration and security co-operation came into force. Boris Johnson said the UK had ""freedom in our hands"" and the ability to do things ""differently and better"" now the long Brexit process was over. But opponents of leaving the EU maintain the country will be worse off. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, whose ambition it is to take an independent Scotland back into the EU,tweeted,external: ""Scotland will be back soon, Europe. Keep the light on."" BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said there was a sense of relief in Brussels that the Brexit process was over, ""but there is regret still at Brexit itself"". The first lorries arriving at the borders entered the UK and EU without delay. On Friday evening, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps tweeted thatborder traffic had been ""low due to [the] bank holiday"",externalbut there had been no disruption in Kent as ""hundreds"" of lorries crossed the Channel with a ""small"" number turned back. Six freight loads travelling from Holyhead in Wales to Ireland had to be turned away due to not having the correct paperwork, the Stena Line ferry and port group said on Friday morning. But later on Friday, the group said freight traffic was flowing well through its ports and government customs systems were working well. It added that the fall in freight traffic after the Christmas and Brexit stockpiling period meant ""it is too early to draw any conclusions"", but the company remained ""cautiously optimistic that, as freight volumes begin to rise again, we will be able to ensure the continued free movement of goods"". What happens now that a deal's been done? A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Brexit: Seven things that will change UK ministers have warned there will be some disruption in the coming days and weeks, as new rules bed in and British firms come to terms with the changes. But officials have insisted new border systems are ""ready to go"". As the first customs checks were completed after midnight, Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said: ""It all went fine, everything's running just as it was before 11pm."" Northern Ireland has different arrangements from other parts of the UK, meaning there will besome customs checks on goods moving between Great Britain and the province. On Friday afternoon, the first ferry from Great Britain operating under the terms of Northern Ireland trading protocol docked in Belfast, on schedule at 13:45 GMT. Seamus Leheny, policy manager at Logistics UK, said six out of the 15 lorries that were on the first ship to arrive into Belfast were brought in for inspection, with one being kept at the port for more than three hours. ""Inevitably there are going to be teething problems because with such a new, complex system as this there are going to be issues in the first few days,"" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. The first lorry loads on to the Eurotunnel shuttle after the UK left the single market and customs union Mandy Ridyard, whose aerospace components company makes daily shipments to Northern Ireland, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme she was ""filling in the same declaration to send goods to the Philippines that I am sending them within the UK"". ""And obviously that all adds a lot of cost to my business."" The UK officially left the 27-member political and economic bloc on 31 January, three and half years after the UK public voted to leave in the 2016 Brexit referendum. But it stuck to the EU's trading rules for 11 months while the two sides negotiated their future economic partnership. A treaty was finally agreed on Christmas Eve, and became law in the UK on Wednesday. Under the new arrangements, UK manufacturers will have tariff-free access to the EU's internal market, meaning there will be no import taxes on goods crossing between Britain and the continent. But it does mean more paperwork for businesses and people travelling to EU countries, while there is still uncertainty about what will happen to banking and services. The UK and Spain have also reachedan agreement meaning the border between Gibraltar and Spain will remain open. Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar's chief minister, said the deal still needed to be formalised, but by abolishing controls between Gibraltar and the EU's passport-free Schengen area, he said it would prevent queues at the border ""which make people's lives a misery and make business difficult"". It is a moment that some will regard with huge optimism, others with deep regret. And while this historic move happens at a moment in time, the impact, in some areas, may be less instant or obvious than others - for example, it's expected there'll be relatively little traffic at Dover on the first day of 2021 as new border checks kick in. Nevertheless, significant changes are here - whether on trade, travel, security or immigration - and those changes could well become more apparent in the months ahead. Mr Johnson - who took the UK out of the EU in January six months after becoming prime minister - said it was an ""amazing moment"" for the UK in his New Year message. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg challenges Boris Johnson on Brexit and vaccines Writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalhe added that the combination of the Brexit deal and rollout of the Oxford vaccine means ""we are creating the potential trampoline for the national bounceback"". Lord Frost, the UK's chief negotiator, tweeted that Britain had become a ""fully independent country again"". And the deputy chairman of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory backbench MPs, David Jones, told the BBC: ""We can now say clearly Britain is a sovereign and independent state.""

But opponents of Brexit say the country will be worse off than it was while it was a member of the EU. Ireland's Foreign MinisterSimon Coveney said,externalit was ""not something to celebrate"" and the UK's relationship with Ireland will be different from now on, but ""we wish them well"". French President Emmanuel Macron said the UK remained a ""friend and ally"", but he added that the choice to leave the EU was ""the child of European malaise and many lies and false promises"". In Brussels, there is a sense of relief the Brexit process is over, but there is regret still at Brexit itself. Basically, the European Union thinks that Brexit makes it - the EU - and the UK weaker. But the EU view is this is less bye-bye Britain and more au revoir, because there are so many loose ends between the two sides. For example, there are the ongoing practicalities surrounding Gibraltar, the UK is still waiting to find out what access Brussels is going to give its financial services to the single market, there is cooperation on climate change, and there is a reviewal mechanism written into the treaty for every five years. For all of those reasons and more, this is not the end of the EU-UK conversation for the foreseeable future. The culmination of the Brexit process means major changes in different areas. These include: The free movement of people between the UK and EU countries has ended - and has been replaced in the UK by a""points-based"" immigration system,external Anyone from the UK who wants to stay in most of the EU for more than 90 days in any 180-day period now needs a visa Duty-free shopping has returned,,externalwith people coming back to the UK from the EU able to bring up to 42 litres of beer, 18 litres of wine, four litres of spirits and 200 cigarettes without paying tax EU citizens wanting to move to the UK (except those from Ireland) face the same points-based system as people elsewhere in the world UK police havelost instant access to EU-wide databaseson criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.

"This video can not be played Parents and teachers have criticised the closure decisions Nine London boroughs have written to the education secretary asking him to reverse plans to reopen primary schools in some areas. About a million primary school pupilswill not return to lessonsnext week in a bid to cut Covid transmission rates. However, schools in 10 London boroughs are due to remain open. In the letter, the leaders said they were ""struggling to understand the rationale"" behind the idea as pupils and teachers moved between boroughs. The government has said the measure would be reviewed fortnightly. What's happening with schools in January? School closures will be 'as short as possible' Should London be split into different Covid tiers? Coronavirus cases in London All primary schools had been due to fully reopen on 4 January but under government plans those in 23 London boroughs will remain closed. However, schools in the City of London, Camden, Greenwich, Hackney, Haringey, Harrow, Islington, Kingston, Lambeth and Lewisham will open. Primary schools in 23 London boroughs will remain closed The letter to Gavin Williamson has been signed by leaders of all of those boroughs apart from Kingston. It has also been signed by the City of London's policy chair. It calls for primary school pupils across the capital to ""move to online learning until 18 January"", apart from vulnerable children and those of key workers. ""The omission of 10 boroughs ignores the deep interconnectedness of our city, and the many thousands of teachers and students that study or teach in one borough and live in another,"" the letter states. The councils also said they had received legal advice that omitting some councils from the list of areas told to take teaching online ""is unlawful on a number of grounds and can be challenged in court"". Richard Watts, leader of Islington Council, told the BBC there ""seems to be no reason at all to look at this on a borough by borough basis"". ""The entirety of the rest of the government's handling of the pandemic has rightly treated London as a single entity and this is the first time anyone... has tried to implement different public health measures in different boroughs,"" he said. In astatement,externalDan Thorpe, leader of the Royal borough of Greenwich, accused the government of providing ""a lack of clarity and answers"", adding that the situation was ""causing uncertainty and concern among our schools, families, carers, and undoubtedly children and young people"". Although Kingston Council did not sign the letter,leader Caroline Kerr said,externalreopening primary schools in the borough ""doesn't make any sense"" and that they were ""urgently seeking clarity on the reasoning for the decision"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called the plans ""nonsensical"" and has also written to the government calling for a ""delay to all London schools opening until mid-January"". Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the National Education Union, said the education secretary ""must listen to the leaders of the community, he must listen to school staff and he must listen to the general public who are all telling him that it is not safe to reopen schools on Monday"". The Department for Education has previously said decisions on school closures and openings were based on new infections, positivity rates, and pressures on the NHS. A spokeswoman for the department said: ""In response to concerning data about the spread of coronavirus, we have implemented the contingency framework for education in a small number of areas of the country, requiring schools to provide remote learning to all but vulnerable and critical worker children and exam years. ""Decisions on which areas will be subject to the contingency framework are based on close work with PHE, the NHS, the Joint Biosecurity Centre and across government.""

"Hospitals are under increased pressure amid rising coronavirus cases The next few weeks will be ""nail-bitingly difficult"" for the NHS, hospital bosses have warned. Staff absences and the new Covid variant are creating a ""challenging situation"", Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, said. Doctors are urging the public to ""take it seriously and follow the rules"" to protect the health service. The year started with53,285 more Covid cases and 613 deaths,externalbeing reported. The day's figures do not include data fromNorthern Ireland or Wales, or the numbers of deaths from Scotland,external- as these are not being published on certain days during the Christmas and New Year period. It comes after the UK reported its highest daily cases on Thursday, with a record55,892 infections. On Friday evening, the government confirmed thatall primary schools in London would remain closed for the start of the new term, following a review of Covid transmission rates. From Monday, all schools in the capital will now be required to provide remote learning. Primaries in nine London boroughs and the City of London district had been set to reopen - while those in the remaining 23 boroughs would have stayed closed from 4 January. Meanwhile, new analysis by Imperial College London has confirmed the new variant of coronavirus has a much quicker rate of transmission than the original strain. And an analysis of NHS England data from 23 hospital trusts bythe Health Service Journal,externalshows that Covid-19 is putting intense pressure on adult acute care and general beds, as well as those in intensive care. It found that more than a third of these beds were occupied by patients with Covid-19 on Tuesday, and in three trusts - North Middlesex in London, and Medway and Dartford and Gravesham in Kent - the figure was more than half. Based on the recent rise in numbers, the analysis suggests that all acute and general beds might soon be filled with Covid-19 patients. What can you still do in tier four? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Cordery said the surging transmission and death rates were ""incredibly hard to deal with"". ""When we are seeing major London trusts saying they are under pressure, that's when we know we're in a very challenging space,"" she said. A leading intensive care doctor has urged people to follow restrictions until the vaccination programme is fully rolled out. Prof Anthony Gordon, of Imperial College, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There is light at the end of the tunnel so I would urge people to hold on for these few more months while the vaccination programme makes that difference and then we can truly get back to normal. ""But we can't overrun the health service because this will just lead to thousands more deaths."" Adrian Boyle, vice-president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, urged people to follow guidance on hand washing, social distancing and face coverings to stop the ""entirely preventable"" spread of the virus. Dr Boyle said staff are ""tired"" and at risk of ""burnout"", having ""worked really hard over the summer"" and ""put up with a lot of disruption"". ""This time people are frustrated, this is now an entirely preventable disease, we know what we did in spring made a lot of this go away. There's also now a vaccine,"" he added. More than three-quarters of England is currently under the strictest tier four - ""stay at home"" - coronavirus measures, and other parts of the country have joined higher tiers. Mainland Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are under lockdown. There are also concerns the added pressures of rising numbers of Covid patients seen at London hospitals have begun to spread across the country. Speaking on Today, Dr Alison Pittard, of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, said it was ""only a matter of time before it starts to spread to other parts of country"", adding that ""we're already starting to see that"". She stressed it was ""really important that we try and stop the transmission in the community because that translates into hospital admissions"". It comes as almost half the major hospital trusts in England are said to be dealing with more Covid-19 patients than at the peak of the first wave in April. And pressure has been so great on some hospitals in London and south-east England that some patients have been moved out of the area. London's Nightingale emergency hospitalis ready to admit patients, the NHS has said, while other sites currently not in use are being readied. However, Mike Adams, director of the Royal College of Nursing, questioned whether there were the staff available to run the hospital. ""Nursing is already stretched beyond capacity so there is no magic pile of nurses we can call upon,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""I think the real battle is reducing the spread of the virus and getting the vaccine rolled out."" Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open? When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? How do the Covid vaccines compare? 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs The new coronavirus variant has driven a big rise in cases, with the worst effects felt so far in London. Researchers at Imperial College London haveconfirmed it increases the R number- the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to - by about 0.4 to 0.7. The UK's latest R number has been estimated at between 1.1 and 1.3. It needs to be below 1.0 for the number of cases to start falling. Prof Axel Gandy, from the statistic section of Imperial College London, told the Today programme this higher rate of infection means that transmission of the disease would have tripled even during England's November lockdown conditions. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains how to wear your mask correctly and help stop coronavirus spreading The hunt is now on to find new ways to slow the spread of coronavirus, with the rules on mask wearing potentially coming up for review. Behavioural science group SPI-B (Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours), which reports to the Sage group of government advisers, has said that mandatory face coverings may be necessary in a wider number of settings, such as in workplaces and possibly outdoors. However, Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told BBC Radio 4's World at One he was not convinced a move towards making the wearing of face coverings mandatory outdoors would make ""much difference"" to transmission rates. He said the ""bigger problem"" was people touching their face covering or wearing it incorrectly, adding ministers should focus on ensuring people knew how to wear them and to change and wash them regularly. The rollout of the newly approved Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will begin on Monday, almost a month after the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Second doses of either will now take place within 12 weeks rather than 21 days as had been initially planned with the Pfizer vaccine.

"Last year was the worst for the High Street in more than 25 years as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping, analysts say. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost in the UK in 2020, up by almost a quarter on the previous year, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR). It warned there will be more pain for the sector in 2021 as retailers face a cash flow crisis and rent payments. It has predicted up to 200,000 more retail jobs will be at risk in 2021. Professor Joshua Bamfield, a director at the Centre for Retail Research, said its forecast was based on ""the cumulative effects of months of closure and its impact upon cash flow and rent arrears that will be payable when the moratorium ends. ""Whilst the longer-term effects of the greater use by shoppers of all kinds of online retailing is likely to be hugely damaging for physical stores,"" he added. Topshop has been hit hard by coronavirus lockdowns Major brands including Topshop-owner Arcadia, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group and Debenhams slashed hundreds of jobs after collapsinig into administration during the year. Susannah Streeter, market analyst at Hargreaves Landsdown, said the pandemic alone couldn't ""be blamed for the collapse of household names. It merely accelerated the shift to digital,"" she said. What went wrong at Debenhams? Spent less, saved more: How we used money in 2020 She says that 2021 will be a ""year of painful evolution"" for the sector. ""Debenhams has been the key anchor store in city centres for decades, but fell behind fashion trends, whilst locked into long leases with rising rents with underperforming online sales. ""Topshop was still the leader of the High Street fashion pack a decade ago, but underinvestment in e-commerce and social media, saw it leapfrogged by savvy online rivals like Boohoo and Asos."" The success of fast fashion online retailers such as Boohoo has been tough for some of the  more established High Street brands to emulate. Mrs Streeter said that shoppers appeared to ""shrug off"" accusations that the retailer hadbeen ""tolerating widespread abuses of employment law""at some of its suppliers in Leicester. ""Although ethical concerns do appear to be growing amongst some consumers, it seems fast fashion shoppers are still prioritising price."" Analysis by consumer affairs correspondent Sarah Corker The High Street was struggling before the pandemic struck, but almost a year of lockdowns and restrictions appears to have turbocharged that decline. Some estimate the shift towards online shopping has been accelerated by five to ten years. Every week in 2020, an estimated 3,400 retail jobs were lost. Retailers have spent huge sums of money making their premises covid secure; stores have been re-designed with one way systems and plastic screens, returned items are quarantined for up to 72 hours and there are enhanced cleaning regimes. All that pushes costs up at a time when social distancing means there are fewer customers. But amid the slew of store closures, there is a sliver of positive news. As more of us work from home, we're spending more money locally and rediscovering our local high streets and independent stores. Analysis of spending habits suggests smaller neighbourhood shopping areas have fared much better than large cities and shopping centres this year. Currently around three million people in the UK work in retail. The CRR warned that on-going Tier 4 restrictions and a delayed rollout of coronavirus vaccines in the UK could spark up to 200,000 job losses. Mrs Streeter added that it would be crucial for high street retailers to evolve their in-store experience if they were to attract customers back in a post Covid-19 climate. ""Department stores can still thrive, if they provide the experience the customer craves. Items like footwear can be very difficult to get right online,"" she said. Boohoo's market capitalisation is now more than household name Marks & Spencer Trying out fragrances and skincare is impossible in a virtual world. Underwear, which is difficult to return, may look a good fit on models but customers prefer to try it before they buy, she says. ""However, shopping needs to be an enjoyable pasttime, not a bun fight amid vast racks of clothes. Reducing retail footprints, while investing in the appeal of an exciting in store and online seamless experience will be key to attracting newer younger customers.""

"The Archers returned to BBC Radio 4 in May with ""a new style"" forced upon the show by the coronavirus lockdown BBC Radio 4 will mark 70 years of The Archers with a series of features across its output on Friday. As well as broadcasting episode number 19,343 of the world's longest-running serial drama, stars from it will appear on the station's other programmes. This will include inserts into Woman's Hour, Farming Today, and a quiz. The Archers, set in the fictional village of Ambridge, began in 1951 with the original purpose of educating farmers on modern agricultural methods. The show's editor, Jeremy Howe, said its achievements over the years, coming up to the modern day, are incomparable. ""Almost daily and in real time The Archers has tracked life in the village of Ambridge across  years and more than 19,000 episodes,"" he said. ""No work of fiction or drama can truly compare to that. As I look back on this incredible legacy, I am looking forward to the next 70 years of The Archers."" The Archers returns with a lockdown twist Back in May, The Archers returned to BBC Radio 4 on Monday, with a ""new style"" forced upon the show by the coronavirus lockdown. Large cast recordings with interaction between multiple characters were scrapped in favour of monologues recorded at the actors' homes. The storyline of Friday's anniversary episode remains a secret, but celebratory programming on Radio 4 on the day will also include a special edition of With Great Pleasure at Christmas, where cast members from the series share their favourite prose and poetry. Howe, meanwhile, will appear alongside actor Timothy Bentinck (David Archer) and agricultural story advisor Sarah Swadling in an Archers-flavoured edition of Farming Today. Woman's Hour will focus on the female characters and storylines that have shaped the show. Finally, on the day, listeners will be invited to head over to The Bull pub - not literally of course - for the The Archers Anniversary Quiz, hosted by landlords Jolene (Buffy Davis) and Kenton Archer (Richard Attlee). On Saturday 2 January, historian David Kynaston will then delve into the history of the programme further documentary feature entitled A Social History of The Archers.

"Staff absences and the new Covid variant are creating a ""challenging situation"" in hospitals, NHS bosses say London hospitals say they are under huge pressure, with whole floors being converted to intensive care wards Emergency Nightingale hospitals are being readied across the country, but experts warn staffing may be a problem Imperial College London analysis confirms the new variant of the virus has a much faster rate of transmission than the original strain Experts defended the UK's new strategy to give more people a first dose of the vaccine, while delaying the second Eight London boroughs have urged ministers to delay the re-opening of primary schools as others move to online teaching It comes as the nation saw in the New Year without traditional parties, amid warnings for people to stay at home Another 53,285 cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK on Friday, and a further 613 deaths Edited by Holly Wallis We're bringing our live coverage of the pandemic to a close now - thanks for joining us. Today's live page was edited by Holly Wallis and Chris Clayton, and written by Joseph Lee, Becky Morton, Kathryn Snowdon, Penny Spiller and Alexandra FouchÃ©. We'll be pausing our live coverage for the day soon so here's a summary of the main stories in the UK today: Here are the latest
headlines from around the world: Coronavirus cases are now rising fast again, driven by a new variant of the virus thought to be much more easily transmissible than other strains. The number of Covid-19 patients in hospitals across the UK has also risen sharply in recent weeks and is now above the level seen in the spring. You can check how many cases there are in your areahere. Sir Tom Jones said receiving the Covid-19 vaccine was just like getting a flu jab And back in the UK, Sir Tom Jones revealed that he too has received the coronavirus vaccine, calling it ""one good thing about being 80"". âIâve had my jab already,"" he told TV presenter Jools Holland on the New Year's Eve broadcast of Jools' Annual Hootenanny. âThatâs one good thing about being 80, youâre first in line for the jab. It was fine, it was like getting the flu jab.â Holland jokingly asked if it was a legitimate vaccine and Sir Tom replied: âIt wasnât a black market one. It was the real deal.â Queen Margrethe delivered her New Year's speech before receiving the vaccine Denmarkâs Queen
Margrethe has received the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, the royal
household has announced. The 80-year-old
monarch was given the dose on New Yearâs Day, and will receive the second dose
of the vaccine in three weeks. Queen Margrethe has
had to isolate for much of the past year, cancelling plans for her birthday last
April and traditional events around Christmas and New Year. Her grandson, Prince Christian, tested positive for the coronavirus
in recent weeks and had to self-isolate, although his parents, Crown Prince Frederik and
Crown Princess Mary, and siblings tested negative. The collapse of Debenhams contributed to the retail sector's 180,000 job losses in 2020 Retail analysts have described 2020 asthe worst year for the high street in a quarter of a century, with the pandemic accelerating a move towards online shopping. The Centre for Retail Research said nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost in the UK in 2020, with up to 200,000 more at risk in 2021 as businesses face a cash flow crisis. Some analysts estimate that the pandemic accelerated the shift to online shopping by five to ten years, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Sarah Corker said. Analysis of spending habits also suggests we increased the amount we spent in smaller neighbourhood shopping areas rather than large cities and shopping centres during 2020. With more of us working from home, people spent their money locally and rediscovered local independent stores. Susannah Streeter, market analyst at Hargreaves Landsdown, said bigger retailers needed to focus on the experience they offer - including the ability to try before you buy - if they are to attract customers back when the coronavirus crisis is over. ""Shopping needs to be an enjoyable pastime, not a bun fight amid vast racks of clothes. Reducing retail footprints, while investing in the appeal of an exciting in-store and online seamless experience will be key to attracting newer, younger customers,"" she said. Norway has
announced it is lifting its ban on flights arriving from the UK. Flights will
resume from 16:00 GMT on 2 January, the health ministry announced. Passengers arriving
by plane from the UK will have to fill out a travel registration form and
everyone entering Norway from Saturday must take a Covid-19 test, the ministry
said. Norway was among a
number of countries that halted travel from the UK on 21 December after it emerged
a new variant of the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in south-east England. ""If this strain should spread in Norway, it will probably mean a full lockdown of society,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg said on Thursday. Adam Lambert (left) and Tituss Burgess will bring the TikTok-made musical to life After the worldâs most unusual year comes the worldâs most unusual
musical. Ratatouille the TikTok Musical will be streaming in a few hours, featuring
Queen
singer Adam Lambert, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt star Tituss Burgess and Tony
Award winner Andre De Shields. Theone-off performance,externalwas born out of a short song posted on
TikTok in August by Emily Jacobson, a teacher in New York and fan of the 2007
Pixar film Ratatouille about a rat who dreams of becoming a chef. Her short catchy song about Remy âthe rat of all my dreamsâ was picked
up and given a Broadway-style musical finish by composer Daniel Mertzlufft. His rendition sparked a craze on TikTok with hundreds of other
creators following suit, providing songs for other characters, choreographed
dances and suggested stage designs. The 1 January âshowâ will be accompanied by the 20-piece Broadway
Sinfonietta orchestra and will raise money for The Actors Fund, which has been
supporting performers during the pandemic. You can read more on how this show came about here. The next few weeks could be the most dangerous period for Scotland since March in the fight against Covid, the country's first minister has warned. Nicola Sturgeon said the new variant of the virus was ""accelerating spread"" across Scotland. ""If you first foot someone today, or hug/kiss/handshake them HNY, you are putting yourself, others and the NHS at risk,""she said in a tweet.,external A further 2,539 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in Scotland on Friday. The number is slightly down on Thursday's figure, but Sturgeon said cases numbers were still ""worryingly high"". Daily confirmed cases have reached record highs on each of the previous three days.

The force said it had received numerous reports of Covid breaches on New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, North Wales Police said it had reported several breaches of restrictions, with some people travelling from as far as Southampton, Kent and Solihull on New Year's Day. Wales has been in anationwide level four lockdownsince 20 December and travel is only allowed for essential purposes, such as for work and for caring responsibilities. Read more.

Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News Many scientists fear even tougher restrictions than the current tier four are needed The most chilling finding from the Imperial College research on the new coronavirus variant is that the November lockdown in England, hard though it was for many people, would not have stopped the variant form of the virus from spreading. The same severe restrictions that saw cases of the previous version of the virus fall by a third, would see a tripling of the new variant. This is why there has been such a sudden tightening of restrictions across the country. It is unclear whether the current restrictions will be enough to control the spread of the virus. Given the fact that it has taken two lockdowns to stop the earlier version of the virus overwhelming the NHS, many scientists fear that further tightening will be necessary. Infection levels will begin to drop as enough people are vaccinated. But until then it is now more important than ever for people to follow social distancing guidelines, wear masks where required and to regularly wash their hands. The new year brings with it hope of a more normal life in the next few months but also a new form of the virus that all of us will have to combat in the next few weeks. Much of England has been placed in a new top tier of restrictions - tier four - as the new variant spreads Earlier we reported that a study by Imperial College had concludedthe new coronavirus variant is ""hugely"" more transmissible. Now some experts are saying that means even tougher restrictions will soon be needed. Prof Jim Naismith, of Oxford University, said: ""The data from Imperial represent the best analysis to date and imply that the measures we have employed to date, would - with the new virus - fail to reduce the R number to below 1. ""In simpler terms, unless we do something different the new virus strain is going to continue to spread - more infections, more hospitalisations and more deaths."" The R number is the average number of people an infected person passes the virus onto. If it is above 1 the epidemic is growing. Early data suggested that the virus was spreading more quickly among the under-20s, particularly among secondary school age children, but the latest results indicate that it is more infectious in all age groups. Prof Axel Gandy, part of the research team, suggested that it may have appeared to spread more easily among school children simply because the early data was collected during the November lockdown, when adults' movements were restricted but schools remained open. The UK has recorded a further 53,285 coronavirus cases, as well as 613 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of daily cases is slightly down on Thursday's figure of 55,892,which was the highest number on record. Carys BetteleyBBC News Carmarthen showground has been repurposed as a coronavirus testing centre In a cattle market repurposed for a very different mission, a 66-year-old man arrives early and shuts himself in a portable cabin. Chris Jones dons his personal protective equipment (PPE), and prepares for the day ahead before heading to another work station to find out what his day holds in store. This Carmarthenshire barn, with its five lanes for traffic, is being used as a regional coronavirus testing centre. Read more here. A US hospital employee who was said to have intentionally discarded vials of the Moderna vaccine at a medical centre in Wisconsin earlier this week has now been arrested, officials say. The pharmacist, who has not been publicly identified, is suspected of sabotaging more than 500
doses of coronavirus vaccine by deliberately removing them from
cold storage. He is no longer employed by the hospital. It is not clear what his motive may have been. Each vial contains 10 doses. Some of the doses were administered before staff at the Aurora Health medical centre in Grafton, Wisconsin, realised the medication had been spoiled. The remaining 500-plus doses then had to be discarded. Initially, hospital officials thought the error had been made inadvertently, but the individual later acknowledged they had intentionally removed the vaccines from refrigeration, according to a hospital statement released earlier this week.  Japan is facing rising infections but insists the delayed Olympics will go ahead this year The Olympics and Paralympics will go ahead as scheduled in July despite concern over rising coronavirus cases in Japan, the country's prime minister has said. Yoshihide Suga saidthe ""Games will be held this summer"" and will be ""safe and secure"". Infections have surged in Japan in recent days with Tokyo reporting more than 1,000 daily cases for the first time. Japan is responding to cases of the new variant of coronavirus first found in the UK, with Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike warning the number of infections could ""explode"". The Olympics, postponed from summer 2020, are due to begin on 23 July - with the Paralympics following a month later from 24 August. An animal park has closed temporarilyafter finding that most of its visitor bookings were from areas with the tightest coronavirus restrictions. Monkey World in Wool, Dorset, also said workers had been ""unacceptably abused"" when contacting people who had  tried to visit from tier four areas. The site is in a tier three zone, allowing its outdoor areas to remain open. People living under tier four restrictions are only permitted to travel to lower-tier areas for certain specified reasons, such as work, caring responsibilities or emergencies. You can read more on the rules for different tiershere. London's Nightingale hospital was built in just 9 days London's Nightingale Hospital is ready to admit patients,the NHS has said, with the capital's hospitals under increasing pressure as Covid cases rise. However, Mike Adams, director of the Royal College of Nursing, questioned whether there were the staff available to run the hospital. âNursing is already stretched beyond capacity so
there is no magic pile of nurses we can call upon,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. âI think the real battle is reducing the spread of the
virus and getting the vaccine rolled out so we can actually reduce the capacity
of people needing care in any given moment.â London's Nightingale Hospital was opened on 3 April but placed on standby weeks later after fewer than 20 patients were treated there. A fleet of 300 drones joined the usual pyrotechnics this year Although going out wasn't an option for millions of Britons over New Year's Eve,London's annual firework display was watched by slightly fewer people than last year. An average audience of 10.75 million tuned in to the 10-minute display, which combined pyrotechnics with illuminated tributes to NHS staff and notable figures from 2020 created by 300 drones. In January 2020, 11.18 million watched the celebrations. Normally, up to 100,000 people line the streets to see the fireworks in person, but this year the city centre was largely empty. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sir Tom Jones said receiving the Covid-19 vaccine was just like getting a flu jab And back in the UK, Sir Tom Jones revealed that he too has received the coronavirus vaccine, calling it ""one good thing about being 80"". âIâve had my jab already,"" he told TV presenter Jools Holland on the New Year's Eve broadcast of Jools' Annual Hootenanny. âThatâs one good thing about being 80, youâre first in line for the jab. It was fine, it was like getting the flu jab.â Holland jokingly asked if it was a legitimate vaccine and Sir Tom replied: âIt wasnât a black market one. It was the real deal.â Queen Margrethe delivered her New Year's speech before receiving the vaccine Denmarkâs Queen
Margrethe has received the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, the royal
household has announced. The 80-year-old
monarch was given the dose on New Yearâs Day, and will receive the second dose
of the vaccine in three weeks. Queen Margrethe has
had to isolate for much of the past year, cancelling plans for her birthday last
April and traditional events around Christmas and New Year. Her grandson, Prince Christian, tested positive for the coronavirus
in recent weeks and had to self-isolate, although his parents, Crown Prince Frederik and
Crown Princess Mary, and siblings tested negative. The collapse of Debenhams contributed to the retail sector's 180,000 job losses in 2020 Retail analysts have described 2020 asthe worst year for the high street in a quarter of a century, with the pandemic accelerating a move towards online shopping. The Centre for Retail Research said nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost in the UK in 2020, with up to 200,000 more at risk in 2021 as businesses face a cash flow crisis. Some analysts estimate that the pandemic accelerated the shift to online shopping by five to ten years, BBC consumer affairs correspondent Sarah Corker said. Analysis of spending habits also suggests we increased the amount we spent in smaller neighbourhood shopping areas rather than large cities and shopping centres during 2020. With more of us working from home, people spent their money locally and rediscovered local independent stores. Susannah Streeter, market analyst at Hargreaves Landsdown, said bigger retailers needed to focus on the experience they offer - including the ability to try before you buy - if they are to attract customers back when the coronavirus crisis is over. ""Shopping needs to be an enjoyable pastime, not a bun fight amid vast racks of clothes. Reducing retail footprints, while investing in the appeal of an exciting in-store and online seamless experience will be key to attracting newer, younger customers,"" she said. Norway has
announced it is lifting its ban on flights arriving from the UK. Flights will
resume from 16:00 GMT on 2 January, the health ministry announced. Passengers arriving
by plane from the UK will have to fill out a travel registration form and
everyone entering Norway from Saturday must take a Covid-19 test, the ministry
said. Norway was among a
number of countries that halted travel from the UK on 21 December after it emerged
a new variant of the coronavirus was spreading rapidly in south-east England. ""If this strain should spread in Norway, it will probably mean a full lockdown of society,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg said on Thursday.

Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News Many scientists fear even tougher restrictions than the current tier four are needed The most chilling finding from the Imperial College research on the new coronavirus variant is that the November lockdown in England, hard though it was for many people, would not have stopped the variant form of the virus from spreading. The same severe restrictions that saw cases of the previous version of the virus fall by a third, would see a tripling of the new variant. This is why there has been such a sudden tightening of restrictions across the country. It is unclear whether the current restrictions will be enough to control the spread of the virus. Given the fact that it has taken two lockdowns to stop the earlier version of the virus overwhelming the NHS, many scientists fear that further tightening will be necessary. Infection levels will begin to drop as enough people are vaccinated. But until then it is now more important than ever for people to follow social distancing guidelines, wear masks where required and to regularly wash their hands. The new year brings with it hope of a more normal life in the next few months but also a new form of the virus that all of us will have to combat in the next few weeks. Much of England has been placed in a new top tier of restrictions - tier four - as the new variant spreads Earlier we reported that a study by Imperial College had concludedthe new coronavirus variant is ""hugely"" more transmissible. Now some experts are saying that means even tougher restrictions will soon be needed. Prof Jim Naismith, of Oxford University, said: ""The data from Imperial represent the best analysis to date and imply that the measures we have employed to date, would - with the new virus - fail to reduce the R number to below 1. ""In simpler terms, unless we do something different the new virus strain is going to continue to spread - more infections, more hospitalisations and more deaths."" The R number is the average number of people an infected person passes the virus onto. If it is above 1 the epidemic is growing. Early data suggested that the virus was spreading more quickly among the under-20s, particularly among secondary school age children, but the latest results indicate that it is more infectious in all age groups. Prof Axel Gandy, part of the research team, suggested that it may have appeared to spread more easily among school children simply because the early data was collected during the November lockdown, when adults' movements were restricted but schools remained open. The UK has recorded a further 53,285 coronavirus cases, as well as 613 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of daily cases is slightly down on Thursday's figure of 55,892,which was the highest number on record.

A US hospital employee who was said to have intentionally discarded vials of the Moderna vaccine at a medical centre in Wisconsin earlier this week has now been arrested, officials say. The pharmacist, who has not been publicly identified, is suspected of sabotaging more than 500
doses of coronavirus vaccine by deliberately removing them from
cold storage. He is no longer employed by the hospital. It is not clear what his motive may have been. Each vial contains 10 doses. Some of the doses were administered before staff at the Aurora Health medical centre in Grafton, Wisconsin, realised the medication had been spoiled. The remaining 500-plus doses then had to be discarded. Initially, hospital officials thought the error had been made inadvertently, but the individual later acknowledged they had intentionally removed the vaccines from refrigeration, according to a hospital statement released earlier this week.  Japan is facing rising infections but insists the delayed Olympics will go ahead this year The Olympics and Paralympics will go ahead as scheduled in July despite concern over rising coronavirus cases in Japan, the country's prime minister has said.

London's Nightingale hospital was built in just 9 days London's Nightingale Hospital is ready to admit patients,the NHS has said, with the capital's hospitals under increasing pressure as Covid cases rise. However, Mike Adams, director of the Royal College of Nursing, questioned whether there were the staff available to run the hospital. âNursing is already stretched beyond capacity so
there is no magic pile of nurses we can call upon,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. âI think the real battle is reducing the spread of the
virus and getting the vaccine rolled out so we can actually reduce the capacity
of people needing care in any given moment.â London's Nightingale Hospital was opened on 3 April but placed on standby weeks later after fewer than 20 patients were treated there. A fleet of 300 drones joined the usual pyrotechnics this year Although going out wasn't an option for millions of Britons over New Year's Eve,London's annual firework display was watched by slightly fewer people than last year. An average audience of 10.75 million tuned in to the 10-minute display, which combined pyrotechnics with illuminated tributes to NHS staff and notable figures from 2020 created by 300 drones. In January 2020, 11.18 million watched the celebrations. Normally, up to 100,000 people line the streets to see the fireworks in person, but this year the city centre was largely empty. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Archers returned to BBC Radio 4 in May with ""a new style"" forced upon the show by the coronavirus lockdown BBC Radio 4 will mark 70 years of The Archers with a series of features across its output on Friday. As well as broadcasting episode number 19,343 of the world's longest-running serial drama, stars from it will appear on the station's other programmes. This will include inserts into Woman's Hour, Farming Today, and a quiz. The Archers, set in the fictional village of Ambridge, began in 1951 with the original purpose of educating farmers on modern agricultural methods. The show's editor, Jeremy Howe, said its achievements over the years, coming up to the modern day, are incomparable. ""Almost daily and in real time The Archers has tracked life in the village of Ambridge across  years and more than 19,000 episodes,"" he said. ""No work of fiction or drama can truly compare to that. As I look back on this incredible legacy, I am looking forward to the next 70 years of The Archers."" The Archers returns with a lockdown twist Back in May, The Archers returned to BBC Radio 4 on Monday, with a ""new style"" forced upon the show by the coronavirus lockdown. Large cast recordings with interaction between multiple characters were scrapped in favour of monologues recorded at the actors' homes. The storyline of Friday's anniversary episode remains a secret, but celebratory programming on Radio 4 on the day will also include a special edition of With Great Pleasure at Christmas, where cast members from the series share their favourite prose and poetry. Howe, meanwhile, will appear alongside actor Timothy Bentinck (David Archer) and agricultural story advisor Sarah Swadling in an Archers-flavoured edition of Farming Today. Woman's Hour will focus on the female characters and storylines that have shaped the show. Finally, on the day, listeners will be invited to head over to The Bull pub - not literally of course - for the The Archers Anniversary Quiz, hosted by landlords Jolene (Buffy Davis) and Kenton Archer (Richard Attlee).

"Margaret Thatcher called for European reform Nearly half a century of the UK's membership of the European Union and its predecessor organisations ended in January of course. What has now ended is the UK's economic membership of the bloc. Forty-eight years in the European customs union, basically the Common Market, and 28 years in the single market. The Single Market was a creation for which the UK has paternity rights. It was Margaret Thatcher's rallying call for European reform, her calling card to unleash a wave of Japanese investment in post-industrial Britain and shepherded into existence by her appointee as commissioner Arthur Cockfield. Its creation served the UK's economic interests, as it grew the home domestic market available for British exporters without tariff or non-tariff barriers, eventually to nearly half a billion Europeans. It was not without irony that the tortuous negotiations of the past four years were made tougher by the EU's insistence on defending what it calls the ""internal market"", itself created by the British. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Indeed the institutional underpinning of this huge marketplace became too much for Mrs Thatcher. Famously she became suspicious of Commission President Delors turning up to tell the TUC that through the European Union workers could reassert rights rolled back by the Conservative Government. At her 1988 Bruges speech PM Thatcher replied: ""We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels."" The car industry was the prototype for the single market Perhaps this was the beginning of the path to Brexit, carried along by the push to monetary union and resentment at the overreach of the European Court of Justice and the considerable impact of the ""direct effect"" of community and then union law. The car industry was the prototype for the single market. Mrs Thatcher's campaigning for EEC membership was quickly followed by a charm offensive that began as opposition leader to get Japanese investors to build high tech factories to sell cars tariff-free across Europe. For the UK it would provide employment, technology, capital and competition for the languishing nationalised UK-owned auto sector. Ongoing membership of the EEC, restrictions on union activity and investment tax breaks were part of the deal communicated in writing to the then chairman of Nissan. The Datsun Bluebird was being developed in Sunderland and around the same time the Italians and the French threatened to slap tariffs on what they saw as a Japanese ruse to avoid tariffs and undercut their industry. The UK government quickly communicated that it was willing to take this matter to the European Court of Justice. The attempt to kill the Nissan factory at birth was fended off. From this, the UK car industry and other advanced manufacturing prospered from being plugged into rapid continent-wide supply chains, delivering each part just in time and just in sequence. All of that was enabled by conformity of regulations, standards, zero tariffs and the eradication of non-tariff barriers, for sale, but also within the manufacturing process. The UK became the financial centre for the euro Similar stories could be told about the pharmaceutical industry, chemicals, the food industry, aerospace, and financial services. Within the EU, the UK even became the financial centre for a new currency, the euro, which it did not participate in. The single market itself, with regulations set and enforced in Brussels, became a player on the world stage. And yet there was a balancing act. The UK could influence the direction of one of the biggest tankers in the sea but was restricted in acting more nimbly in new industries. In some sectors, the UK's trade dealings with the US or Asia were more important than with Europe. And so this tension led to breaking point. And for the Conservative Party in particular the single market's institutions it created and championed, became something akin to Frankenstein's monster. The EU has agreed an investment deal with China Some Brexiteers had hoped that the edifice would collapse once the UK left. But it has proven more robust than that. Indeed, Brexit has proven a catalyst of the EU to sign trade and investment deals far more quickly, including even with China. So now the UK finds itself outside of the machine it created as its strategic competitor. The trade negotiation wasn't primarily about trade. Great Britain has declared regulatory independence, or to be more specific, has declared as much regulatory independence as is compatible with a zero-tariff trade deal. The EU retains levers and switches to turn off some of these tariff advantages should the UK use the deal to turn into an offshore tariff free assembly hub for US and Asian manufacturing to be traded into the single market. Unlike with Nissan four decades ago, the European Court of Justice will no longer be there. The global pharmaceutical industry offers an opportunity for the UK The PM wants regulatory competition but his own deal contains disincentives, if not actual restrictions, on competing ""unfairly"" or too much. So the strategy matters. Britain is free, but to do what exactly? To level up? Well the regions that need levelling up are the ones that are actually most dependent on exports to Europe. Exports to Europe will be spared tariffs, thanks to the deal, but there will be literally millions of non-tariff barriers, that the economists calculate matter more, from health checks, customs formalities, origin paperwork, assessments of standards etc. Even to qualify for tariff-free treatment means, according to new government guidance on ""rules of origin"", analysis of how complicated is the process of grating cheese, of the shelling of nuts, and formalities on where the eyes of a doll come from. Most apply legally from tonight, having been absent for decades. The sweet spot for UK will now be to deploy regulatory freedom in sectors that are truly global, where we are not already overly dependent on EU markets. Certain sub-sectors within technology, finance and pharmaceuticals, for example. In each of these sectors the UK is likely to have to offer more friendly regulation to the multinational private sector, than the EU. It doesn't necessarily mean lower standards: It could be that UK medicines regulators, for example, build on the record of rapid approval for Covid vaccines in other medical areas. The deployment of massive scientific networks within the National Health service, used for rapid clinical testing, could become the envy of the world. Brexit Britain is likely to become a laboratory for the global economy. Car companies will need to be attracted with more permissive rules on data and, say autonomous driving testing. Some tech companies are already porting their UK customers to be served under US data privacy laws rather than more restrictive EU ones. But the government will also have to be very active and judicious. We are already ""picking winners"" again, at least in the satellite business. What about electric power, where the EU will fight aggressively, versus hydrogen power? There are a number of structural economic problems, from poor training, declining productivity and low investment that were not caused by EU membership which, in terms of non-tariff barriers, are made immediately worse by this type of Brexit, for which the UK has no option but to deal with. Northern Ireland is mostly left in the EU single market That process of looking outwards may not come quickly. Holyrood and Stormont rejected the Brexit trade deal. The UK has replaced a single market of 500 million Europeans free of non-tariff barriers with a single market smaller than the size of the UK. There is a trade border in the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland is mostly left in the EU single market. There are non-tariff barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of this deal. Lastly there are some big unknowns and unknowables. The inadvertent diplomatic consequences of changes in trade patterns can be profound. If, for example, the eminent historian RW Johnson is to be believed, the UK's accession to the EEC in the first place created the conditions for the fall of South Africa's apartheid regime which was ""hurt in several ways"". British trade was remodelled away from the Commonwealth to Europe, the EEC offered favourable trade with all of Africa except Pretoria. And then when Portugal followed its ally the UK into the EEC, its African colonies and white rule quickly lost to revolutions by black liberation movements in Angola and Mozambique. ""Thus the seeds of the 1976 Soweto uprising were sown"" in part by the UK joining the EEC. Which is obviously not to suggest the reverse would be true. It is merely to say that events such as these can have very unpredictable knock on effects. The Prime Minister has succeeded in taking the UK out of the Single Market created by his heroes. The UK now stands outside a system that it helped invent. For now its new single market is not the size of the country. The test of all of this, is to make the UK's new single market the size of the globe. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Last year was the worst for the High Street in more than 25 years as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping, analysts say. Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost in the UK in 2020, up by almost a quarter on the previous year, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR). It warned there will be more pain for the sector in 2021 as retailers face a cash flow crisis and rent payments. It has predicted up to 200,000 more retail jobs will be at risk in 2021. Professor Joshua Bamfield, a director at the Centre for Retail Research, said its forecast was based on ""the cumulative effects of months of closure and its impact upon cash flow and rent arrears that will be payable when the moratorium ends. ""Whilst the longer-term effects of the greater use by shoppers of all kinds of online retailing is likely to be hugely damaging for physical stores,"" he added. Topshop has been hit hard by coronavirus lockdowns Major brands including Topshop-owner Arcadia, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group and Debenhams slashed hundreds of jobs after collapsinig into administration during the year. Susannah Streeter, market analyst at Hargreaves Landsdown, said the pandemic alone couldn't ""be blamed for the collapse of household names. It merely accelerated the shift to digital,"" she said. What went wrong at Debenhams? Spent less, saved more: How we used money in 2020 She says that 2021 will be a ""year of painful evolution"" for the sector. ""Debenhams has been the key anchor store in city centres for decades, but fell behind fashion trends, whilst locked into long leases with rising rents with underperforming online sales. ""Topshop was still the leader of the High Street fashion pack a decade ago, but underinvestment in e-commerce and social media, saw it leapfrogged by savvy online rivals like Boohoo and Asos."" The success of fast fashion online retailers such as Boohoo has been tough for some of the  more established High Street brands to emulate. Mrs Streeter said that shoppers appeared to ""shrug off"" accusations that the retailer hadbeen ""tolerating widespread abuses of employment law""at some of its suppliers in Leicester. ""Although ethical concerns do appear to be growing amongst some consumers, it seems fast fashion shoppers are still prioritising price."" Analysis by consumer affairs correspondent Sarah Corker The High Street was struggling before the pandemic struck, but almost a year of lockdowns and restrictions appears to have turbocharged that decline. Some estimate the shift towards online shopping has been accelerated by five to ten years. Every week in 2020, an estimated 3,400 retail jobs were lost. Retailers have spent huge sums of money making their premises covid secure; stores have been re-designed with one way systems and plastic screens, returned items are quarantined for up to 72 hours and there are enhanced cleaning regimes. All that pushes costs up at a time when social distancing means there are fewer customers. But amid the slew of store closures, there is a sliver of positive news. As more of us work from home, we're spending more money locally and rediscovering our local high streets and independent stores. Analysis of spending habits suggests smaller neighbourhood shopping areas have fared much better than large cities and shopping centres this year. Currently around three million people in the UK work in retail. The CRR warned that on-going Tier 4 restrictions and a delayed rollout of coronavirus vaccines in the UK could spark up to 200,000 job losses. Mrs Streeter added that it would be crucial for high street retailers to evolve their in-store experience if they were to attract customers back in a post Covid-19 climate. ""Department stores can still thrive, if they provide the experience the customer craves. Items like footwear can be very difficult to get right online,"" she said. Boohoo's market capitalisation is now more than household name Marks & Spencer Trying out fragrances and skincare is impossible in a virtual world. Underwear, which is difficult to return, may look a good fit on models but customers prefer to try it before they buy, she says. ""However, shopping needs to be an enjoyable pasttime, not a bun fight amid vast racks of clothes. Reducing retail footprints, while investing in the appeal of an exciting in store and online seamless experience will be key to attracting newer younger customers.""

"Margaret Thatcher called for European reform Nearly half a century of the UK's membership of the European Union and its predecessor organisations ended in January of course. What has now ended is the UK's economic membership of the bloc. Forty-eight years in the European customs union, basically the Common Market, and 28 years in the single market. The Single Market was a creation for which the UK has paternity rights. It was Margaret Thatcher's rallying call for European reform, her calling card to unleash a wave of Japanese investment in post-industrial Britain and shepherded into existence by her appointee as commissioner Arthur Cockfield. Its creation served the UK's economic interests, as it grew the home domestic market available for British exporters without tariff or non-tariff barriers, eventually to nearly half a billion Europeans. It was not without irony that the tortuous negotiations of the past four years were made tougher by the EU's insistence on defending what it calls the ""internal market"", itself created by the British. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Indeed the institutional underpinning of this huge marketplace became too much for Mrs Thatcher. Famously she became suspicious of Commission President Delors turning up to tell the TUC that through the European Union workers could reassert rights rolled back by the Conservative Government. At her 1988 Bruges speech PM Thatcher replied: ""We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels."" The car industry was the prototype for the single market Perhaps this was the beginning of the path to Brexit, carried along by the push to monetary union and resentment at the overreach of the European Court of Justice and the considerable impact of the ""direct effect"" of community and then union law. The car industry was the prototype for the single market. Mrs Thatcher's campaigning for EEC membership was quickly followed by a charm offensive that began as opposition leader to get Japanese investors to build high tech factories to sell cars tariff-free across Europe. For the UK it would provide employment, technology, capital and competition for the languishing nationalised UK-owned auto sector. Ongoing membership of the EEC, restrictions on union activity and investment tax breaks were part of the deal communicated in writing to the then chairman of Nissan. The Datsun Bluebird was being developed in Sunderland and around the same time the Italians and the French threatened to slap tariffs on what they saw as a Japanese ruse to avoid tariffs and undercut their industry. The UK government quickly communicated that it was willing to take this matter to the European Court of Justice. The attempt to kill the Nissan factory at birth was fended off. From this, the UK car industry and other advanced manufacturing prospered from being plugged into rapid continent-wide supply chains, delivering each part just in time and just in sequence. All of that was enabled by conformity of regulations, standards, zero tariffs and the eradication of non-tariff barriers, for sale, but also within the manufacturing process. The UK became the financial centre for the euro Similar stories could be told about the pharmaceutical industry, chemicals, the food industry, aerospace, and financial services. Within the EU, the UK even became the financial centre for a new currency, the euro, which it did not participate in. The single market itself, with regulations set and enforced in Brussels, became a player on the world stage. And yet there was a balancing act. The UK could influence the direction of one of the biggest tankers in the sea but was restricted in acting more nimbly in new industries. In some sectors, the UK's trade dealings with the US or Asia were more important than with Europe. And so this tension led to breaking point. And for the Conservative Party in particular the single market's institutions it created and championed, became something akin to Frankenstein's monster.
